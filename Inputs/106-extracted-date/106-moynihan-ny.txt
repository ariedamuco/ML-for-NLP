   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will not require more than a few moments to thank my friend from New Jersey and express confidence in the Senators  from Massachusetts and Delaware who have just spoken, to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and my revered friend, the ranking member, the Senator from West Virginia, and the majority leader. 
   May I say, sir--something we often lose sight of--this is a national issue and ought to be addressed by the Congress. We are the only major industrial state in the world that has not sought to recreate and revivify its rail system in the last generation. 
   The Committee on Environment and Public Works in the last 20 years has turned to this. In 1989, we passed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, calling for just such measures--later the Transportation Efficiency Act. We created financial instruments and the possibility of investments to be involved. 
   We can do this. We are on the verge of it. To miss it at this moment would be to miss a moment in history for which I think we will not be happy. But I am so confident, from what I have heard today, that I leave the Senate yet more proud of having been here 24 years, thanking all--thanking particularly the Presiding Officer for his friendship and leadership in so many important matters. 
   I yield the floor with great satisfaction of what has just transpired. If this is the kind of mode we enter into in January, there is much to expect from the 107th. 
   Thanks to my friend from New Jersey.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on this last day of the 106th Congress I would ask to be allowed a moment of reminiscence and farewell. 
   Come January 3--deo voluntus, as the Brothers used to teach us--I will have served four terms in the United States Senate, a near quarter century. In our long history only one other New Yorker, our beloved Jacob K. Javits, has served four terms. I had the fortune of joining the Finance Committee from the outset, and served for a period as chairman, the first New Yorker since before the Civil War. I was also, at one point, chair of Environment and Public Works. I have been on Rules and Administration for the longest while, and for a period was also on Foreign Relations. Senators will know that it would be most unusual for someone to serve on both Finance and Foreign Relations at the same time. An account of how this came about may be of interest. 
   The elections of 1986 returned a Democratic majority to the Senate and the Democratic Steering Committee, of which I was then a member, began its biannual task of filling Democratic vacancies in the various standing committees. There are four ``Super A'' committees as we term them. In order of creation they are Foreign Relations, Finance, Armed Services and Appropriations. With the rarest exceptions, under our caucus rules a Senator may only serve on one of these four. 
   There were three vacancies on Foreign Relations. In years past these would have been snapped up. Foreign Relations was a committee of great prestige and daunting tasks. Of a sudden however, no one seemed interested. The Senate was already experiencing what the eminent statesman James Schlesinger describes in the current issue of The National Interest as ``the loss of interest in foreign policy by the general public'' (p. 110). Two newly-elected Senators were more or less persuaded to take seats. At length the Steering Committee turned to me, as a former ambassador. I remained on Finance. 
   And so I served six years under the chairmanship of the incomparable Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. I treasure the experience--the signing and ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), the final days of the Cold War. But I continue to be puzzled and troubled by our inattention to foreign affairs. To be sure, the clearest achievement of this Congress has been in the field of foreign trade, with major enactments regarding Africa, the Caribbean, and China. These, however, have been the province of the Finance Committee, and it was with great difficulty and at most partial success did Chairman BILL ROTH and I make the connection between world trade and world peace. This would have been self-evident at mid-century. I remark, and I believe there is a case, that any short list of events that led to the Second World War would include the aftermath of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. Indeed, in the course of the ceremony at which the President signed the measure naming possible permanent normal trade relations with China in connection with its admission to the World Trade Organization, I observed that the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, which conceived the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and anticipated an international trade organization, opened on the day I joined the Navy. For certain there was no connection, but my point was simply that in the midst of war the Allies were looking to a lasting peace that might follow, and this very much included the absence of trade wars. 
   But again, how to account for the falling-off of congressional involvement in foreign affairs. I offer the thought that the failure of our intelligence, in the large sense of term, to foresee--forsooth to conceive!--the collapse of the Soviet Union has brought forth a psychology of denial and avoidance. We would as soon not think too much about all, thank you very much. 
   I have recounted elsewhere the 1992 hearings of the Foreign Relations Committee on the START I Treaty. Our superb negotiators had mastered every mind-numbing detail of this epic agreement. 
   With one exception. They had negotiated the treaty with a sovereign nation, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Now they brought to us a treaty signed with four quite different nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. When asked when this new set of signatories was agreed to, the Committee was informed that this had just recently taken place at a meeting in Lisbon. An observer might well have wondered if this was the scenario of a Humphrey Bogart movie. The negotiators were admirably frank. The Soviet Union had broken up in December 1991. Few, if any, at their ``end of the street'' had predicted the collapse. Let me correct the record: None had. 
   As to the record, I would cite the 1991 article in Foreign Affairs by the estimable Stansfield Turner. The Admiral had served as Director of Central Intelligence and knew the record. He was blunt, as an admiral ought. I cite a passage in Secrecy: 
   [Turner wrote,] ``We should not gloss over the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis. We know now that there were many Soviet academics, economists and political thinkers, other than those officially presented to us by the Soviet government, who understood long before 1980 that the Soviet economic system was broken and that it was only a matter of time before someone had to try and repair it, as had Khrushchev. Yet I never heard a suggestion from the CIA, or the intelligence arms of the departments of defense or state, that numerous Soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem.'' Turner acknowledged the ``revisionist rumblings'' claiming that the CIA had in fact seen the collapse coming, but he dismissed them: ``If some individual CIA analysts were more prescient than the corporate view, their ideas were filtered out in the bureaucratic process; and it is the corporate view that counts because that is what reaches the president and his advisors. On this one, the corporate view missed by a mile. Why were so many of us insensitive to the inevitable? 
   Just as striking is the experience of General George Lee Butler, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) from 1990 to 1994. Again to cite from Secrecy. 
   As the one responsible for drafting the overall U.S. strategy for nuclear  war, Butler had studied the Soviet Union with an intensity and level of detail matched by few others in the West. He had studied the footage of the military parades and the Kremlin, had scrutinized the deployments of Soviet missiles and other armaments: ``In all, he thought of the Soviet Union as a fearsome garrison state seeking global domination and preparing for certain conflict with the West. The only reasonable posture for the United States, he told colleagues, was to keep thousands of American nuclear weapons at the ready so that if war broke out, Washington could destroy as much of the Soviet nuclear arsenal as possible. It was the harrowing but hallowed logic of nuclear deterrence.'' But Butler began having doubts about this picture, upon which so much of U.S. foreign policy was based, by the time of his first visit to the Soviet Union, on December 4, 1988. When he landed at Sheremetyevo Airport, on the outskirts of Moscow, he thought at first that the uneven, pockmarked runway was an open field. The taxiways were still covered with snow from a storm two days earlier, and dozens of the runway lights were broken. Riding into downtown Moscow in an official motorcade, Butler noticed the roads were ragged, the massive government buildings crumbling. He was astonished when the gearshift in his car snapped off in his driver's hand. After pouring over thousands of satellite photos and thirty years' worth of classified reports, Butler had expected to find a modern, functional industrialized country; what he found instead was ``severe economic deprivation.'' Even more telling was ``the sense of defeat in the eyes of the people. . . . It all came crashing home to me that I really had been dealing with a caricature all those years.'' 
   General Butler was right. More than he might have known. This fall former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski estimated that the economy of ``Russia is one-tenth the size of America and its industrial plant is about three times older than the OECD average.'' The population has dropped from 151 million in 1990 to 146 million in 1999. Infant mortality is devastating. Far from overwhelming the West, it is problematic as to whether Russia can maintain a presence east of the Ural Mountains. If you consider that the empire of the Czars once extended to San Francisco we can judge the calamity brought about by sixty-some years of Marxist-Leninism. 
   And yet we did not judge. To say again, the United States government had no sense of what was coming, not the least preparation for the implosion of 1991. 
   In 1919, John Reed, a Harvard graduate, and later a Soviet agent wrote Ten Days that Shook the World, his celebrated account of the Russian Revolution, as it would come to be known, in October 1917. In no time these events acquired mythic dimension for intellectuals and others the world over. At Harvard, Daniel Bell would patiently guide students through the facts that there were two Russian Revolutions; the first democratic, the second in effect totalitarian. But this was lost on all but a few. 
   It would appear that the Soviet collapse was so sudden, we were so unprepared for it, that we really have yet to absorb the magnitude of the event. It was, after all, the largest peaceful revolution in history. Not a drop of blood was shed as a five hundred year old empire broke up into some twelve nations, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine, whilst formerly independent nations absorbed into the Soviet Bloc, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia et al., regained their independence. In the aftermath there has been no book, no movie, no posters, no legend. 
   To the contrary, weak Russia grows steadily weaker--possibly to the point of instability, as shown in the miserable events in Chechnya. We see a government of former agents of the intelligence services and the secret police. We see continued efforts at increasing armament. Witness the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk. We see the return of the red flag. We see little engagement with the West, much less the East where China looms with perhaps ten times the population and far more economic strength. 
   And the United States? Apart from a few perfunctory measures, and one serious, the Nunn-Lugar program, almost no response. To the contrary, at this moment we have, as we must assume, some 6,000 nuclear weapons targeted on Russia, a number disproportionate at the height of the Cold War, and near to lunacy in the aftermath. When, as Senator LUGAR estimates, the Russian defense budget has declined to $5 billion a year. 
   What is more, other than the highest echelon of the Pentagon, no doubt some elements of the intelligence community, possibly the Department of State, no American knows what the targeting plan is. In particular, Members of Congress, possibly with very few exceptions, do not know. Are they refused information? Just recently, our esteemed colleague, J. ROBERT KERREY of Nebraska, wrote the Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen, a former colleague of ours, to set forth the facts of this insane situation. 
   There are signs that an open debate concerning nuclear weapons may be afoot. In The Washington Post recently, we learn of the response to a proposal by Stephen M. Younger, associate director of Los Alamos National Laboratory and head of its nuclear weapons work, proposing a great reduction in the number of massive weapons now in our arsenal in favor of smaller devices intended to deal with much smaller engagements than those envisioned during the Cold War. The Post reports that we now have some 7,982 warheads linked to nine different delivery systems, ICBMs, SLBMs and bombers. These are scheduled to decline to 3,500, half on Trident II submarines, under the Start II agreement. Younger argues that still fewer are needed. Any one of which would wipe out any large city on earth. It appears that other experts believe that a few dozen to several hundred of today's high-yield warheads would suffice to manage the standoff with Russia or China. There is, perhaps more urgently, the matter of nuclear weapons in what are for some reason still called Third World nations, a relic of Cold War usage. Nuclear standoff has settled into the South Asian subcontinent. The prospect that an ``Islamic Bomb'' will migrate westwards from Pakistan is real enough. It may be happening at this moment. The more then do we need open debate. The more urgent then is Senator KERREY's assertion that Congress be involved. His profound observation that ``Sometimes secrecy produces its opposite; less safety and security.'' 
   I have remarked on how little notice has been taken of the Russian revolution of 1989-91. By contrast, the ``information revolution'' has become a fixture of our vocabulary and our pronouncements on the widest range of subjects, and at times would seem to dominate political discourse. It might do well to make a connection as Francis Fukuyama does in the current issue of Commentary. In his review of a new book by George Gilder with the suggestive title Telecom: How Infinite Bandwidth Will Revolutionize Our World, Fukuyama makes the connection. 
   Why, then, do those convinced that the revolution is already triumphant shake their heads so sadly at those of us who ``just don't get it?'' True, people want to feel good about themselves, and it helps to believe that one is contributing to some higher social purpose while pursuing self-enrichment. But it must also be conceded that the information-technology revolution really does have more going for it than previous advances in, say, steam or internal combustion (or, one suspects, than the coming revolution in biotechnology). 
   The mechanization of production in the 19th and early 20th centuries rewarded large-scale organization, routinization, uniformity, and centralization. Many of the great works of imagination that accompanied this process, from Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, depicted individuals subsumed by huge machines, often of a political nature. Not so the information revolution, which usually punishes excessively large scale, distributes information and hence power to much larger groups of people, and rewards intelligence, risk, creativity and education rather than obedience and regimentation. Although  one would not wish to push this too far, it is probably no accident that the Soviet Union and other totalitarian regimes did not survive the transition into the information age. 
   Is it possible to hope that we might give some serious thought to the possible connection? And to ask ourselves just how we measure up in this regard? 
   That said, is it not extraordinary and worrying that of a sudden we find ourselves in a state of great agitation concerning security matters all across our government, from our nuclear laboratories at home to embassies abroad to the topmost reaches of government? The late Lars-Erik Nelson described it as ``spy panic.'' In the process the possibility emerges that our national security will be compromised to a degree unimaginable by mere espionage. 
   The possibility is that we could grievously degrade the most important institutions of foreign and defense policy--our capacity for invention and innovation--through our own actions. 
   Take the matter of the loss, and evident return in clouded circumstances of two hard drives containing sensitive nuclear information from the Nuclear Energy Search Team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This June, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson asked two of our wisest statesmen, the Honorable Howard H. Baker, Jr., and the Honorable Lee H. Hamilton, to enquire into the matter. Here are the Key Findings of their report of September 25th. 
   While it is unclear what happened to the missing hard drives at Los Alamos National Laboratory, it is clear that there was a security lapse and that the consequences of the loss of the data on the hard drives would be extremely damaging to the national security. 
   Among the known consequences of the hard-drive incident, the most worrisome is the devastating effect on the morale and productivity of LANL, which plays a critical national-security role for the Nation. 
   The current negative climate is incompatible with the performance of good science. A perfect security system at a national laboratory is of no use if the laboratory can no longer generate the cutting-edge technology that needs to be protected from improper disclosure. 
   It is critical to reverse the demoralization at LANL before it further undermines the ability of that institution both to continue to make its vital contributions to our national security, and to protect the sensitive national-security information that is critical to the fulfillment of its responsibilities. 
   Urgent action should be taken to ensure that Los Alamos National Laboratory gets back to work in a reformed security structure that will allow the work there to be successfully sustained over the long term. 
   Almost alone among commentators, Lars-Erik Nelson pursued the matter, describing the interviews Senator Baker and Representative Hamilton had with lab personnel. 
   They now report that ``the combined effects of the Wen Ho Lee affair, the recent fire at [Los Alamos] and the continuing swirl around the hard-drive episode have devastated morale and productivity at [Los Alamos]. 
   The employees we met expressed fear and deep concern over the . . . yellow crime-scene tape in their workspace, the interrogation of their colleagues by . . . federal prosecutors before a grand jury and the resort of some of their colleagues to taking a second mortgage on their homes to pay for attorney fees. 
   There is no denying that Lee and whoever misplaced the computer drives committed serious breaches of security. But the resulting threat to our safety is only theoretical; the damage to morale, productivity and recruitment is real. 
   Employees were furious at being forced to take routine lie-detector tests, a requirement imposed on them by a panicky Secretary of Energy. . . . 
   Obviously, there is a need for security in government. A Los Alamos employee gave Baker and Hamilton an obvious, easy solution. Unfortunately, it will be the one most likely to be adopted: ``The safest and most secure way to do work is not to do any work at all.'' 
   In the course of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy (of which more later), a Commission member, then-Director of Central Intelligence John M. Deutch, revealed to the American people the extraordinary work of the VENONA project, an enterprise of the Army Security Agency during and after World War II. During the war the agency began to copy KGB traffic from and to the United States. On December 20, 1946, Meredith K. 
   Gardner--I am happy to say still with us, buoyant and brilliant as ever--``broke'' the first. Dated 2 December 1944, it was a list of the principal nuclear scientists at Los Alamos. Bethe, Bohr, Fermi, Newman, Rossi, Kistiakowsky, Segre, Taylor, Penney, Compton, Lawrence and so on. The Soviets knew, and in time stole essentials of the early atom bomb. But what they could not do, was to slow down or deter the work of these great men, who would take us further into the age of the hydrogen bomb. Next, their successors to yet more mind-bending feats. The Soviets could not stop them. Would it not be the final triumph of the defunct Cold War if we stopped them ourselves? 
   Do not dismiss this thought. If you happen to know a professor of physics, enquire as to how many ``post-docs'' are interested in weapons research, given the present atmosphere. To work at one-third the salary available elsewhere, and take lie detector tests. 
   And then there is intelligence. Nelson quotes a ``former top intelligence official'' who told him, ``If you're not taking secrets home, you're not doing your job.'' And yet here we are harassing John M. Deutch, a scientist of the greatest achievement, a public servant of epic ability for--working at home after dinner. Would it be too far-fetched to ask when will the next Provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology choose to leave the banks of the Charles River for the swamps of the Potomac? 
   Now I don't doubt that, as opposed to an intelligence official, there are ambassadors who don't take their work home at night. Over the years the United States has created a number of postings with just that attraction. But these are few. The great, overwhelming number of our ambassadors and their embassy associates are exceptional persons who have gone in harm's way to serve their country. I was ambassador to India at the time our ambassador to Sudan and an aide were abducted from a reception by Islamic terrorists, spirited away and murdered. Some days later the Egyptian envoy in New Delhi asked to see me. He had a message from then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to tell me that their intelligence sources reported I would be next. It is a not uncommon occurrence. But nothing so common as taking work home, or working in a--usually heavily armored--embassy limousine. Ask any former ambassador to Israel. Our embassy in Tel Aviv is an hour's drive from the capital in Jerusalem. The drive up and back is routinely used to dictate memoranda of conversation, type them on a laptop. Whatever. This fall, the superbly qualified, many would say indispensable ambassador to Israel, Martin S. Indyk, was stripped of his security clearances for just such actions. I cite Al Kamen's account in The Washington Post. 
   Just the other day, ambassador to Israel Martin S. Indyk was deep into the State Department doghouse for ``suspected violations'' of security regulations. His security clearance was suspended, so he couldn't handle classified materials. He needed an escort while in the State Department building. The department's diplomatic security folks wanted him to stay in this country until their investigation was completed. 
   At a White House briefing Monday, a reporter asked if Indyk could ``function as ambassador? Do we have a functioning ambassador?'' 
   ``Not at the moment,'' press secretary Jake Siewert said. 
   Allow me to cite a report by the redoubtable Jane Perlez, who was just recently reporting from Pyongyang on the psychotic security measures in the capital of North Korea. Eerily similar antics were to be encountered on September 30, Ms. Perlez reported: 
   State Dept. Unfreezes Hundreds of Promotions After Delay for Security Review 
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.--A continuing security crackdown at the State Department led to the freezing of promotions for more than 200 senior officials, pending a review of their security records, department officials said today. 
   The director general of the Foreign Service, Marc Grossman, said he was assessing the promotion files for security violations  before sending the promotions to the White House, which then dispatches them to Congress for approval. 
   The release of the list was delayed after the suspension of the security clearance of one of the department's most senior officials, Martin S. Indyk, ambassador to Israel, and a sudden vigilance by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is under pressure from Congress on security problems. 
   This evening, the department said that ``under 10'' officials had been barred from promotions after Mr. Grossman's review of 400 candidates. The nearly 400 people included 200 midlevel officials, whose promotions were released today after a weeklong delay. 
   As word of the latest action spread through the department, an assistant secretary of state complained at a senior staff meeting this week that management faced ``rage'' in the building and increasingly demoralized employees, according to several accounts of the session. 
   Others, as well as diplomats abroad, complained of a poisonous atmosphere in the department created, in part, by security officials who grilled junior Foreign Service officers about their superiors. One senior official said the obsession with security had created a ``monster'' out of the bureau of diplomatic security, which Congress generously finances to the detriment of other areas of the department. 
   In a yet more eerie analogy, one department employee described the situation as a ``security jihad.'' 
   It doesn't stop. It accelerates! Just this month The Washington Post reported the resignation of senior diplomats, the suspension of another, the firing of a further two over security matters. 
   J. Stapleton Roy, one of the nation's two most senior foreign service officers and a three-time U.S. ambassador, has resigned in protest after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright suspended his deputy without pay and fired two other long-time State Department officials over a missing top-secret laptop computer. ..... 
   The departure of Roy and the reassignment of [Donald] Keyser will rob the department of two of its top China experts. The son of a missionary, Roy grew up in China, returned to the United States to go to Princeton University, then joined the foreign service. He later served as ambassador to China, Indonesia and Singapore. Keyser had served in Beijing three times, had been the State Department's director of Chinese and Mongolian affairs, and most recently held the rank of ambassador as a special negotiator for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and former Soviet republics. 
   ``That's a lot of brainpower suddenly removed from the State Department,'' said William C. McCahill, a recently retired foreign service officer who served as the deputy chief of mission in Beijing. ``Keyser is a brilliant analyst and a person of great intellectual honesty and rigor. Stape is the kind of person you want in INR, someone who can think beyond today and tomorrow, who can think beyond established policy.''--The Washington Post, December 5, 2000.  
   With some hesitation I would call to mind the purge of the ``China hands'' from the Department of State during the McCarthy era. As our Commission established with finality, there was indeed a Soviet attack on American diplomacy and nuclear development during and after World War II. There were early and major successes. The design of the first atom bomb. But not much else, and for not much longer. The real damage--the parallels are eerie--to American security came from the disinclination of the intelligence community--then largely in the Army--to share information with ``civilians.'' Specifically, documents obtained from the F.B.I. indicate that President Truman was never told of the Army Signals Security Agency's decryptions of Soviet cables during and after the war. He thought the whole business of Communist spying was a ``red herring.'' In 1953 he termed Whittaker Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley ``a crook and a louse.'' American diplomacy and the Department of State in particular were for years haunted by charges they could readily have dealt with had they but known what their own government knew. And who issued the instruction that the President was not to be told? General Omar N. Bradley whom the President had made Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. (Admittedly it is hard to prove a negative.) But I was reassured by an article in the Summer edition of the ``Bulletin'' of the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence. In it, Deputy CIA historian Michael Warner votes with the judgment I offered earlier in my book ``Secrecy.'' 
   What might it be that Secretary Albright needs to know today but has not been told? A generation hence we might learn. If, that is, the current secrecy regime goes unaltered. 
   For the moment, however, I have further distressing news for Ambassador Stapleton if he should have occasion to return to the Department of State main building for one or another reason. I have just received a copy of a letter sent to David G. Carpenter, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Another recently retired Ambassador, a statesman of large achievement and impeccable reputation recently called at Main State, to use their term. He was frisked at the entrance. He was allowed into the building, but assigned an ``escort,'' who accompanied wherever he went. Including, the ambassador writes, ``the men's room.'' 
   It is difficult not to agree with the Ambassador's assessment that ``the `escort' policy is insulting and totally out of proportion to any desired enhancement of security.'' But then so is so much of security policy as it has evolved over the past sixty years. 
   What is to be done? Surely we must search for a pattern in all this. Our Commission proposed a simple, direct formation. Secrecy is a form of regulation. 
   In the previous Congress, legislation was prepared to embody the essentials of the Commission recommendations. All classified materials would bear the name and position of the person assigning the classification and the date, subject to review, that the classification would expire. It is not generally realized, but apart from atomic matters, under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and a few other areas there is no law stipulating what is to be classified Confidential, Secret, Top Secret--and there are numerous higher designations. It is simply a matter of judgement for anyone who has a rubber stamp handy. Our bill was unanimously reported from the Committee on Governmental Affairs, under the fine chairmanship of Senator FRED THOMPSON, with the full support of the then-ranking Committee member, our revered John Glenn. But nothing came of it. The assorted government agencies, covertly if you like, simply smothered it. The bureaucracy triumphed once more. Thomas Jefferson's dictum that ``An informed citizenry is vital to the functioning of a democratic society'' gave way before the self-perpetuating interests of bureaucracy. 
   I am pleased to report that this year's Intelligence Authorization bill, which is now at the White House awaiting President Clinton's signature, includes the Public Interest Declassification Act. The measure establishes a nine-member ``Public Interest Declassification Board'' of ``nationally recognized experts'' who will advise the President and pertinent executive branch agencies on which national security documents should be declassified first. Five members of the Board will be appointed by the President and four members will be appointed by the Senate and the House. 
   The Board's main purpose will be to help determine declassification priorities. This is especially important during a time of Congress' continual slashing of the declassification budgets. In addition to the routine systematic work required by President Clinton's Executive Order 12958, the intelligence community is also required to process Freedom of Information Act requests, Privacy Act requests, and special searches levied primarily by members of Congress and the administration. 
   There is a need to bring order to this increasingly chaotic process. This Board may just provide the necessary guidance and will help determine how our finite declassification resources can best be allocated among all these competing demands. 
   My hope is that the Board will be a voice within the executive branch urging restraint in matters of secrecy. I have tried to lay out the organizational dynamics which produce ever larger and more intrusive secrecy regimes. I have sought to suggest how damaging this can be to true national security interests. But this is a modest achievement given the great hopes with which our Commission concluded its work. I fear that rationality is but a weak foil to the irrational. In the end we shall need character as well as conviction. We need public persons the stature of George P. Shultz, who when in 1986 learned of plans to begin giving lie detector tests for State Department employees, calmly announced that the day that program began would be the day he submitted his resignation as Secretary of State. And so of course it  did not begin. And yet with him gone, the bureaucratic imperative reappears. 
   And so Mr. President, I conclude my remarks, thanking all my fellow Senators present and past for untold courtesies over these many years.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in 1972, the Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, but subject to the passage of implementing legislation by Congress. The implementing legislation--the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCPIA)--became law in 1983. I wrote this legislation in the Senate in cooperation with Senators Robert J. Dole and Spark M. Matsunaga. It is technically a revenue measure and came under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee of which I was then a senior member, later chairman. Earlier I had been Ambassador to India and to the United Nations and was much aware of the issues surrounding cultural property. As Ambassador in Delhi I was responsible for negotiating the return of the Shiva Nataraja. I also was serving at the time as chairman of the board of trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and in that capacity I dealt at length with similar issues. 
   The CCPIA sets forth our national policy concerning the importation of cultural property. As part of the statute, we created the Cultural Property Advisory Committee (CPAC), an 11-member body appointed by the President to advise him concerning foreign government requests that import restrictions be placed on certain archaeological and ethnological material. The statute specified that each member should represent one of four categories: museums (two members), archaeologists/anthropologists (three members), dealers (three members), and the public (three members). There are different interests here, and my purpose was to see that these were represented in any recommendation the CPAC would make. In addition, the CCPIA explicitly states that the CPAC is subject generally to the Federal Advisory Committee Act provisions relating to open meetings, public notice, and public participation in its proceedings. As the last of the authors of the CCPIA remaining in the Senate, it fell to me to keep an eye on its implementation. 
   Earlier this session I introduced S. 1696, the Cultural Property Procedural Reform Act. Joining me as cosponsors on the bill are Chairman ROTH, and Senators SCHUMER, GRAMM, and BREAUX. Congressman RANGEL introduced companion legislation on the House side. I have pressed this legislation because I feel it provides an essential clarification of the CCPIA. 
   Unfortunately, time has run out in this session of Congress to pass S. 1696. Although some halting progress has been made by the executive branch in responding to the problems that S. 1696 sought to address, it is clear that the fundamental issues of procedural reform raised by S. 1696 have not been resolved. Therefore, it is imperative that congressional oversight continue in an effort to ensure that the implementation of the Act is faithful to the terms Congress promulgated. 
   We have seen a number of serious shortcomings in the administration of the CCPIA which led to the introduction of S. 1696. A central concern has been that the procedures of the CPAC remain essentially closed to nonmembers of the committee despite the provisions of the 1983 Act, such as 19 U.S.C. section 2605(h), that generally require open meetings and transparent procedures. I remain concerned that past proceedings before the CPAC and the administering agency have been conducted in almost total secrecy, thus denying interested parties a meaningful opportunity to respond to evidence presented by foreign nations concerning alleged pillage and with respect to the statutory requirements that must be satisfied. The result is that the CPAC is denied a full, unbiased record upon which to make its decisions. A central goal of S. 1696 is to open those proceedings. 
   The initial step in a CPAC proceeding is the publication of a notice in the Federal Register informing the public of the filing of an application by a foreign government. However, that notice of the request is often so cursory as to effectively deny interested persons an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to CPAC proceedings. An adequate notice should provide descriptive information from the foreign nation about the archaeological or ethnological materials, the pillage of which the requesting country claims is placing its cultural patrimony in jeopardy. This information is particularly important because the 1983 act explicitly authorizes the President to impose import restrictions only on particular archaeological and ethnological materials that are the subject of pillage, which, in turn, is jeopardizing the cultural patrimony of a requesting state. 
   Any notice of a foreign government's request should, at a minimum, put on the public record the approximate dates during which the cultural material at issue was produced, the approximate dates during which that material is alleged to have been pillaged, the cultural group with respect to which the material is associated (if available), the medium, and representative categories or types of cultural material that the foreign nation asked by barred from import into this country. This information will permit interested parties to prepare themselves to participate in an informed fashion in 
   proceedings before the CPAC. 
   Requiring the approximate dates of the alleged pillage is essential to carry out the purposes of the statute. Evidence of contemporary pillage is central to the goals of the 1983 act, which is based on the concept that a U.S. import restriction is justified only if it will have a meaningful effect on an ongoing situation of pillage. It is quite obvious that an import restriction in the year 2000 cannot deter pillage that took place decades or even centuries ago. Thus, the approximate dates of the pillage, which a fair notice would provide, is imperative to ensure that the administrative process is faithful to the goals of the CCPIA. 
   A second concern that led to the introduction of S. 1696 was the absence of meaningful art dealer participation in the proceedings of the CPAC. This year, in fact, art dealers have not been represented at all on the CPAC--all three dealer slots have been and continue to be vacant. This state of affairs is inconsistent with the CCPIA, which established an elaborate process to ensure that the views of archaeologists, art dealers, museums, and the public were taken fully into account when a foreign government asked us to prohibit the importation of archaeological and ethnological materials. 
   It is reported that the White House is now moving forward to fill all these are dealer vacancies and perhaps the introduction of S. 1696 helped move that process along. To ensure that in the future all interested constituencies are represented on the CPAC, it would be desirable to modify the CPAC quorum provisions to require the presence of at least one member from each statutory category. Moreover, the language describing the CPAC members should be  made consistent across all four categories and consistent with Senate report language stating that the members are to be ``knowledgeable representatives of the private sector.'' 
   Further, discussions on the bill have revealed that the process whereby the Executive Branch reports to the Congress on its actions under the 1983 act needs to be strengthened. Under current law, the CPAC and the State Department are to provide copies of their reports to Congress. These reports have not been transmitted to the Senate Finance Committee, the committee of jurisdiction in the Senate. Significantly, consultations have not occurred routinely on these matters since the original statute was enacted in 1983. 
   To implement the goals of the 1983 Act for open proceedings, the reporting requirements in the CCPIA should be made more consistent with the traditional consultation and layover provisions used by Congress to ensure adequate consultation. Thus, reports of the CPAC and State Department action should be sent to appropriate jurisdictional committees with a traditional layover period to permit consultation, as appropriate, between Congress and the executive branch. Consultation provisions can be developed that will not impair the executive branch's ability to proceed with import restrictions, after there is an opportunity for consultation with Congress. Such consultation would help ensure that executive branch procedures and actions do not stray from Congress' intent in passing the 1983 act, and would thus help allay concerns of interested persons that the statutory criteria are not being met. 
   One concern that I have heard repeatedly is that the CPAC and the agencies to which it reports have simply disregarded the multinational response requirement in recent actions imposing far-reaching restrictions on cultural property. Central to our intention in drafting the CCPIA was the principle that the United States will act to bar the import of particular antiquities, but only as part of a concerted international response to a specific, severe problem of pillage. The rationale for this requirement is that one cannot effectively deter a serious situation of pillage of cultural properties if the United States unilaterally closes its borders to the import of those properties, and they find their way to markets in London, Munich, Tokyo, or other art importing centers. Congress intended that the multinational response requirement be taken seriously--indeed its inclusion ensured the passage of the 1983 Act. I am concerned that the executive branch may not be giving serious weight to this requirement. 
   I am distressed that the procedural changes proposed in S. 1696 cannot be made in this Congress. A fair administration of the 1983 act is vitally important to our citizens and our cultural life. The United States has long encouraged free trade in artistic and cultural objects which has helped create a museum community in our Nation that has no equal. That policy of free interchange of cultural objects was narrowly modified in the 1983 act to respond to specific, severe problems of pillage. A diversion from this posture, which the current administration of the law suggests, can deny the American public the opportunity to view, study, and appreciate cultural antiquities that reflect the multicultural heritage that is the essence of our nation. 
   I trust, and urge, that the next Congress will address these issues vigorously.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Alan Emory, who for nearly half a century covered Washington for the Watertown Daily Times, passed away on November 27. Known for years as ``the Dean'' of the New York press corps, he was an indefatigable and prolific writer who often penned up to six stories a day in addition to a twice-weekly column. Even after retiring as bureau chief in 1998, he pursued stories with the same integrity and determination that first brought him to Washington in 1951. This past July, he broke the news that the Health Care Financing Administration intended to cut Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cancer care. Shortly thereafter, in a great part because of Alan's reporting, the plan was abandoned.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in late October, as many Senators will know, Vincent Canby, ``whose lively wit and sophisticated tastes illuminated film and theater reviews in the New York Times for more than 35 years'' died at age 76. Thinking of an appropriate manner in which the United States Congress might honor his most honored memory, there came to mind an observation he made in a review of a film based on E.M. Foster's novel ``Howard's End.''  
   It's time for legislation decreeing that no one be allowed to make a screen adaptation of any quality whatsoever if Ismail Merchant, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are available, and if they elect to do the job. Trespassers should be prosecuted, possibly condemned, sentenced to watch ``Adam Bede'' on ``Masterpiece Theatrer'' for five to seven years.  
   The legislative drafting service had no difficulty producing legislative language. I had in mind a joint resolution, which is, of course, a statute. However, in view of our oath ``to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States,'' I felt in need of a legal opinion as to whether there might be constitutional impediments to such a measure. I think for example of the ``taking clause'' of the fourth amendment recently much discussed in learned papers associated with the University of Chicago School of Law. And so I set out to obtain advisory opinions. Alas, I had tarried too long. November 7 had passed. The Presidential election was in dispute. All of the constitutional lawyers in Washington had decamped for Florida. 
   And now, in the closing hours of the 106th Congress, they are still there. 
   This leaves me with no choice but to withhold the measure for now. Happily I am informed that next April we will witness the premier of The Wandering Company's adaptation of Henry James' ``The Golden Bowl.'' What a splendid way to begin the new millennium. (For that is what the year 2001 will be, and our trio are naught if not scrupulous as to details.) Surely a Senator in the 107th Congress will wish to pursue this matter. The glory of three continents is yet to be proclaimed in law. 
   I regret the inconvenience this may cause viewers of ``Adam Bede,'' and I surely would not wish to denigrate ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' but Vincent Canvy was a just and moderate man. And, as is proclaimed on the wall above the bench of the Chenango County Courthouse in James Ivory's ancestral home of Norwich, New York ``Fiat Justica Ruat Coelum''.--Let justice be done though the heavens fall.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the majority leader has, on several occasions, noted that this Congress, particularly this session of this Congress, has been singular in the number of major trade measures that have been enacted. 
   With the cooperation of the minority leader, with the full support of the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH--who was here just a moment ago but whose schedule required that he leave as soon as the unanimous consent measure was adopted--we have agreed to major trade legislation with sub-Saharan Africa --that entire part of the continent; to expand the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which is hugely important in the aftermath of the North American Free Trade Agreement--which suddenly put island nations and nations on the isthmus below Mexico at a disadvantage, which no one intended and which we have now been able to redress in some considerable measure. The permanent normal trade relations with China was one of the most important pieces of legislation we have dealt with in a half century in the Congress. And we passed the Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000, granting, among other things, permanent normal trade relations to Georgia, just last week. 
   Now as the closing days are at hand, or may be at hand--in any event, it is the first of November--we have taken this action by unanimous consent to adopt an amended version of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. That is a long title for a simple proposition. The World Trade Organization ruled that a measure in our Tax Code which has been in place for many years now, the Foreign Sales Corporation, which gave a tax benefit for income earned overseas--it was to encourage overseas sales--was contrary to the World Trade Organization rules. 
   I think we do not disagree; when we look at the rules, look at the law, the ruling was correct. But we had to then change our laws in order to give equivalent treatment to American corporations working overseas so that they would remain competitive in those markets, but would not be in violation of the WTO rules. If we were not to do that, sir, and do it today, we would be subject to $4 billion a year in tariff retaliation from the European Union. It had the potential of a ruinous trade war. We have seen the animosity that arises over bananas. How the United States ever got into the business of exporting bananas, I do not know. I think I understand some of the politics involved, but that was unfortunate. But look at how quickly reactions occurred in Europe. Just wait, if $4 billion in retaliatory tariffs were to close off American access to European markets selectively--the more sensitive items chosen, the greatest damage doable--if that were the disposition of the ministers in Brussels, and it might well be. 
   Well, it is not going to happen. We have done this properly. It is no coincidence that the Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of my revered friend from Delaware, Senator ROTH, adopted this measure--it is a House measure, of course--on the same day we passed out the bill to grant China permanent normal trade relations. These are trade matters of great importance. 
   We did it. The House and Senate subsequently agreed to a slightly different version, which we have adopted today. It will have to go back to the House. There will be no problem. The House conferees have already agreed, in the comprehensive tax bill and the Balanced Budget Refinement bill, to the exchanges. 
   So it is a good day and a good morning's work. Not every morning do we avoid a trade war. This morning we did. We did not have an hour to lose. The deadline was November 1. We often do things at the last minute around here. But we often do things well also. 
   I see my friend from Texas is on the floor. I know he would agree that avoiding a trade war over the Foreign Sales Corporation is a very good thing indeed. We have done it this morning with not a moment to lose. My friend from Texas will recall the deadline of November 1. And it is now November 1. We have done well. 
   I thank Senator DURBIN and others who had amendments they wanted to offer--Senator WELLSTONE, Senator BRYAN. They had every right to do so, and they could have done so. They chose not in the larger interest of the United States. I think we should express our particular gratitude to them for their forbearance. 
   I have said my piece. I thank all on behalf of Senator ROTH and the Finance Committee, which acted unanimously in this regard. We have dodged a big bullet. We did it usefully and quickly in the spirit of cooperation about trade matters, which will mark this Congress. Perhaps we might even get that fact reported in the press somewhere. If not, we can maybe start a web site of our own. It would be worth it. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy. I see the assistant majority leader on the floor, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise for the pleasant purpose of noting the decision by the Committee on Rules to add two names to that very special group that is portrayed in our reception room--six of the most distinguished Senators in our history. We have now added two--or shortly will have done so--Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan and Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York. 
   The story of Robert F. Wagner is a quintessential and essential one, describing the life of a poor immigrant child born on the east side of New York, who, by steady succession made his way to this Chamber. In the process, he changed the United States, recognizing, at long last, that we had become an urban Nation with needs, in legislative terms, that such a transformation requires. 
   The census of 1920 determined, for the first time, that the majority of Americans lived in urban areas--rather loosely defined, but still--and intensely so on the island of Manhattan. It may seem difficult to believe, but in 1910, the population of Manhattan was twice what it is today, and the conditions were difficult indeed. 
   Yet there was a degree of social order, a very powerful and progressive political organization, Tammany Hall, which dates from the Revolutionary War days. Aaron Burr was the head of Tammany at one point. And in the person of Charles Francis Murphy, it became unexpectedly, but unmistakably, the single most powerful source of progressive ideas for social legislation in our history--ideas that became law that changed lives. 
   Perhaps the critical event was the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911. In downtown Manhattan, there were women in a sweatshop, as we would call it. A fire broke out. The doors were locked. They were left to leap from eighth-story windows. And the city never got over it. Frances Perkins, having tea in Gramercy Park, five blocks away, never got over it. But it was Robert Wagner and Al Smith who did something about it. 
   They had gone to Albany under the auspices of their district leaders, big Tom Foley in the case of Al Smith, from the lower east side, and McCardle from the upper east side. 
   Smith became speaker of the assembly; Wagner, President pro tempore of the Senate. 
   They chaired together a commission on the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. They came out with legislation calling for safety and sanitary conditions, restricting child labor, limiting the hours of working women and protecting the activities of trade unions--events which never before appeared on the legislative calendar of any State legislature, much less the Congress. And they passed. 
   Smith went on to become Governor of New York and created, with his company, a legislative agenda which Franklin D. Roosevelt, who succeeded Smith as Governor, would take to Washington. We call it the New Deal. 
   Wagner had already arrived in Washington and was well positioned to take up his work, beginning with the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933, and, in 1935, the defining Wagner Act, which is technically the National Labor Relations Act. It created the National Labor Relations Board and gave labor unions a right to exist and to be heard and not to be harassed. 
   He went on under President Truman. He allied himself with Robert Taft, and the first major housing legislation passed this body. Then health care was proposed by Wagner, with Truman's support. A half century has gone by, and we are still dealing with that issue. But it is well that we recognize the person--a person, not the only one--who singularly brought this matter to the nation's agenda. 
   I, as a New Yorker, am pleased, as all New Yorkers will be. I hope Senators will recognize that a just and honorable choice has been made. I am a member of the Rules Committee so it would not be appropriate to congratulate the Rules Committee, but I certainly thank the chairman and the ranking member, Senators MCCONNELL and DODD. 
   I see my friend from New Mexico is on the floor, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Sunday, October 1st, the Most Reverend Paul S. Loverde, Bishop of Arlington, delivered the Red Mass Homily at the Cathedral of St. Matthew here in Washington. It was the 48th annual Red Mass at St. Matthew's, all of which have been sponsored by the John Carroll Society. 
   The Red Mass--a Solemn Mass of the Holy Spirt--originated hundreds of years ago to mark the beginning of judicial year of the Sacred Roman Rota, which is the supreme ecclesiastical and secular court of the Holy See. The name of the Mass is drawn from the red vestments traditionally worn by the celebrants, and also by the scarlet robes of the royal judges who attended. The color red represents tongues of fire, symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit. 
   The tradition of the Red Mass spread from Rome to Paris--where it is now the only Mass held at La Sainte Chapelle, London--celebrated annually at Westminster Cathedral since the Middle Ages, and beyond. The tradition was inaugurated in the United States in 1928 at Old Saint Andrew's Church in New York City. Here in Washington, the Red Mass is held on the Sunday before the first Monday in October to coincide with the new term of the United States Supreme Court. Justices of the Court, other judges, law professors, lawyers, diplomats, government officials, and people of all faith attend the Mass to invoke God's blessing and guidance in the administration of justice. 
   As Bishop Loverde pointed out in his homily, this year's Mass is special since it occurs in a Jubilee Year and at the dawn of the third Christian Millennium. 
   The Jubilee tradition stems from the Book of Leviticus, in which God instructs Moses to ``hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.'' (25:10) God further admonishes Moses, ``Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the Lord your God.'' (25:17) 
   Fifty years ago, we were engaged in a twilight struggle with Communist totalitarianism. Today, the Soviet Union exists no longer, and we are at peace and prosperous--due in large part, no doubt, because we are a nation of laws. We think of our nation as young, but we are old: there are two nations on earth, the United States and Great Britain, that both existed in 1800 and have not had their form of government changed by forces since then. There are eight--I repeat, eight--nations which both existed in 1914 and have not had their form of government changed by violence since then. Do we recognize how extraordinarily blessed we re? We abide by the rule of law, and so persist and prosper. 
   Bishop Loverde lovingly reminds us that in this ``Year of Favor,'' the work of justice is peace--opus iustitiae pax. He quotes from Joseph Allegretti, who wrote, ``those who enter law with the intent to bring justice to a broken world, to vindicate the rights of the weak and vulnerable, to heal broken relationships, to ensure equality to all persons ..... these persons have responded to a true calling.'' Allegretti remarked that law ``is a vehicle of service to God and to neighbor, not simply a gateway to financial and social success.'' I might add that law is not only ``a vehicle of service to God.'' It is a gift from God which we must cherish. 
   It is fitting that the John Carroll Society sponsors the Red Mass each year. John Carroll helped the colonies win their independence. After the Revolution, he was appointed superior of all U.S. Catholics. In 1789, he founded Georgetown University. he and his brother, Daniel, who was a member of the Constitutional Convention, insisted that the new Constitution prohibit any religious test for public office, and were influential forces for the freedom of religion clause contained in the First Amendment. In 1790, Carroll was consecrated the first Catholic bishop in the United States, and served from his cathedral in Baltimore. Ten years later, four additional dioceses were created and Carroll became Archibishop. He established St. Mary's College and Seminary, and he encouraged Elizabeth Ann Seton to found the order of The Sisters of Charity.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that will benefit the cultural cornerstones of many of our communities--our nation's historic performing arts facilities. From the non-profit community theater housed in an historic opera house to the non-profit metropolitan performing arts complex of historic significance, this nation's historic performing arts facilities play a lasting and important role  in the cultural fabric and cultural evolution of this nation. 
   There are over 200 non-profit performing arts organizations with historic facilities nationally, including the Traverse City Opera House in Traverse City, Michigan; the Paramount Theater in Anderson, Indiana; the Polk Theater in Lakeland, Florida; the Strand Theater in Shreveport, Louisiana; the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island; and the Victoria Theater in Dayton, Ohio. As the cultural cornerstones of their communities and regions, these facilities also play an important economic role as the anchors of economic development within their communities. These theaters attract tourism, stabilize neighborhoods, and generate increased economic activity of surrounding businesses. 
   Since the 1950s, this nation has also seen the emergence of nearly forty larger multi-purpose, multi-use performing arts complexes in urban areas as part of a larger urban renewal movement, such as the Los Angeles Music Center, the Wang Center for the Performing Arts in Boston, the Cincinnati Music Hall and Aronoff Center for the Arts in Ohio, the Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Each of these performing arts organizations has revitalized and spurred development in its community, and many of these larger facilities are centered around historic facilities or are historic places themselves. 
   This bill, the Historic Performing Arts Facility Rehabilitation Act, provides parity between non-profit and for-profit historic performing arts organizations that rehabilitate these national treasures. For many years, for-profit entities, including for-profit theaters, that rehabilitate their nationally registered historic structures have qualified for a rehabilitation tax credit. This bill would simply permit non-profit performing arts organizations, with facilities similarly listed on the National Register of Historic Places, to benefit from the same program. 
   The bill permits non-profit performing arts organizations to receive the existing credit, equal to twenty percent of qualified rehabilitation expenditures, in the form of a credit certificate. The certificate would be transferable to a lending institution that provides all or part of the financing related to the qualified rehabilitation expenditure in exchange for a reduction in interest or principal. 
   This bill has the support of the performing arts community and the support of historic preservation organizations. I hope many of my colleagues will support this important legislation.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on October 16 the new United States Courthouse at Islip, New York, was dedicated in a splendid ceremony at which the distinguished architect Richard Meier spoke, in the company of Robert A. Peck, the singularly gifted Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration. 
   The ceremony was splendid for the simple reason that the courthouse is magnificent. Perhaps the finest public building of our era. Certainly the finest courthouse. And it could never have happened save for the Design Excellence Program Commissioner Peck has put in place with his characteristic compound of genius and persistence. 
   Major Peck, as he is known to his friends (he was a Green Beret officer), is a public servant of unexampled ability and achievement. His record is known to all. Some number of years ago when he was counsel to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, he put together for the Committee a slide show consisting of photographs of early public buildings in early America. He did not plead his case; he made it. The buildings exude a confidence and expectation that clearly explain the endurance of American democracy. I recall in particular a white wooden-frame courthouse in Rhode Island. Graceful, serene, unthreatening yet equally forceful. Of a sudden it came to us. As nowhere else on earth, the courthouse is a symbol of government in the United States. Go to London, go to Paris. There are courthouses, or at least courtrooms there. If you can find them. Amidst the cathedrals and the palaces, and to be sure, the buildings of the legislature. Here it is different. The courthouse square is where folk gather. 
   The Nation owes Robert A. Peck more than it will ever know. But this would hardly matter to him. As the time approaches when he will leave government, he takes with him the knowledge of his singular public service.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my great thanks to the chairman of the Finance Committee for his efforts in bringing this legislation, the Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000, to a successful conclusion. Last November, the World Trade Organization Seattle Ministerial ended in what The Economist magazine labeled a ``global disaster.'' Mr. President, our trade policy of 60 years--first established by Cordell Hull's Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934--was in a crisis. Since then, the Senate has worked hard to put our trade policy back on track. On May 11, 2000, Congress passed the Trade and Development Act of 2000, extending preferential tariff treatment to our friends in Africa and expanding benefits to our neighbors in the Caribbean Basin. Just this week, the President signed into law H.R. 4444, authorizing permanent normal trade relations for China. And today, the Senate has passed--by unanimous consent--our third piece of trade legislation this year, the Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000. There has not been a year in Congress so productive on trade issues since 1988, when we considered the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act and the legislation implementing the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. 
   H.R. 4868 contains over 150 tariff suspensions and reductions on a wide range of products, 19 reliquidations of prior entries, and 11 technical Customs  provisions, including one which provides economic incentives for importers to recycle. Notably, the bill also authorizes the President to grant Georgia permanent normal trade relations, bringing the total number of nations we have normalized trade relations with this year to four. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff which have worked late nights and long weekends to ensure that the Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000 was a success. On the Finance Committee Minority staff, Linda Menghetti, Timothy Hogan, Holly Vineyard, and Pat Heck, and on the Majority staff, Grant Aldonas, Faryar Shirzad, Tim Keeler, and Carrie Clark worked tirelessly to ensure the passage of this important bill. Polly Craighill, of the Legislative Counsel's Office, spent countless hours drafting and redrafting this extensive piece of legislation. Anita Horn and Gary Myrick of the Minority leadership were also crucial to its final passage. Mr. President, we have taken three major steps forward since Seattle, and I hope the momentum will continue.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the news from the Middle East is deeply painful to all who pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Three months ago at Camp David the State of Israel offered the Palestine Authority unprecedented concessions in an effort to end the cycle of violence and hatred. The rejection of these proposals has tragically led to the loss of numerous lives and the resumption of the cycle of violence and hatred. Our Government must tell the Palestinian leadership that the destruction of holy sites and mob violence have no place in civilized society.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a Sense of the Senate Resolution that calls on the National Park Service to relocate the Hamilton Grange, which is the home of Alexander Hamilton. As Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, delegate to the Constitutional Convention, Secretary of the Treasury, and founder of the Bank of New York and the New York Post, Hamilton was instrumental in determining the direction of the nation in its early years. The only home he ever owned is in New York City. It sits on a block in Harlem, bounded on the north by an apartment house and on the south by a church. The apartment house is inches away, the church a few feet. 
   For some forty years the National Park Service has been contemplating the relocation of the Grange to a better site. The plan now is to go around the corner to St. Nicholas Park. The park was part of the original Hamilton estate and would be a far more appropriate location for the house. The necessary civic approvals are nearly set. It will soon be in the hands of the Park Service to get this done. The resolution simply states that the agency should do so expeditiously, and should then proceed with the restoration projects that have been on hold. Alexander Hamilton and those who come to see his home deserve as much. I ask my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express concern and dismay over the unwarranted delay of a critical analysis of S. 172, the Acid Deposition and Ozone Control Act. This analysis thoroughly documents the substantial benefits to be achieved, at comparatively insignificant costs, by passing S. 172. Unfortunately, we have received this information only after it is too late to coordinate the bill's passage this year. 
   I first asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to analyze the impacts of S. 172 in 1998. Specifically, EPA was asked to calculate the costs and benefits of the legislation with regard to effects on human health, environment and the business community. EPA completed the report in March, 2000 and submitted it to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for their review. Unfortunately, OMB withheld the analysis for six months despite the fact that co-sponsors in both the House and Senate requested the report's release in letters to Director Jacob Lew. We have EPA's report today because Representative DAN BURTON, Chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, was willing to subpoena the report. I am disappointed that this course of events had to occur. 
   Nonetheless, I am quite pleased with the results of EPA's analysis. Not only would S. 172 significantly improve visibility and the state of ecosystems sensitive to acid rain and nitrogen loading, but it would produce approximately $60 billion in public health benefits annually and save 10,000 lives each year. All this for an additional cost to utilities of $3.3 billion. What a tremendous service we could do to society by simply passing this legislation. If we don't, an epidemic could ensue. For example, according to EPA an DGAO, 43% of the lakes in New York's Adirondack Park will become acidified by 2040 even with the reductions mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Amendments. 
   As far back as the 1960s, fisherman in the Adirondacks began to complain about more than ``the big one that got away.'' Fish, once abundant in the pristine, remote Adirondack lakes, were not just getting harder to catch--they were gone. 
   When I entered the Senate in 1977, there was much we needed to learn about acid rain. So I introduced the first Federal legislation to address our ``knowledge deficit'' about acid rain--the Acid Precipitation Act of 1979. My bill was enacted into law as Title VII of the energy Security Act, which Congress passed in June 1980. Title VII established the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP), an interagency program charged with assessing the causes and damages 
   of acid deposition, and reporting its findings to Congress. NAPAP spawned tremendous academic interest in the subject of acid deposition, and our understanding of the subject has since developed substantially. 
   In 1990, I helped write Title IV of Clean Air Act Amendments, which established a ``Sulfur Dioxide Allowance Program.'' Its creation represented a radical departure from the traditional ``command and control'' approach to environmental regulation, common at the time. This program was the first national, statutorily-mandated, market-based approach to pollution control. It has been immensely successful. 
   We can be proud of these accomplishments, but we have a long way to go yet. Since 1990 we have learned, for instance, that the sulfur dioxide (SO  
   2) emissions reductions required under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are insufficient to prevent continued damage to human health and sensitive ecosystems. NAPAP has reported that forests, streams, and rivers in the Front Range of Colorado, the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains of California are also now showing the effects of acidification and nitrogen saturation. We have learned that nitrogen oxides (NO 
   X), which we largely ignored nine years ago, are significant contributors to our nation's air quality deficiencies. And finally, we have demonstrated that legislation containing regulatory flexibility and market incentives is highly effective.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator ROTH, distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, in sponsoring the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Improvement Act of 2000. 
   As part of the effort to balance the Federal Budget, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided for reduction in Medicare payments for medical services. At the time of enactment, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that these provisions would reduce Medicare outlays by $112 billion over 5 years. We now know that these BBA cuts have been much larger than originally anticipated--some argue twice as large, although it's difficult to determine this with any precision. 
   Hospital industry representatives and other providers of health care services have asserted that the magnitude of the reductions are having unintended consequences which are seriously impacting the quantity and quality of health care services available to our citizens. 
   Last year, the Congress addressed some of those unintended consequences, by enacting the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), which added back $16 billion over 5 years in payments to various Medicare providers, including: Teaching Hospitals; Hospital Outpatient Departments; Medicare HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations); Skilled Nursing Facilities; Rural Health Providers; and Home Health Agencies. 
   However, Members of Congress are continuing to hear from providers who argue that the 1997 reductions are still having serious unanticipated consequences. 
   To respond to these continuing problems, the President last June proposed additional BBA relief in the amount of $21 billion over the next 5 years. On September 20, Senator Daschle and I, along with 32 of our Democratic colleagues, introduced a similar, but more substantial, BBA relief package that would provide about $40 billion over 5 years in relief to health care providers and beneficiaries. Today, along with Senator ROTH, I am pleased to be cosponsoring a bipartisan BBA relief bill to provider about $28 billion in relief over 5 years. 
   I want, in particular, to highlight that this legislation would--for fiscal years 2001 and 2002--prevent further reductions in the special Medicare payments to our Nation's teaching hospitals. A little background is in order. 
   Medicare provides support to our Nation's teaching hospitals by adjusting its payments upward to reflect Medicare's share of costs associated with care provided by medical residents. This is accomplished under two mechanisms: direct graduate medical education (direct GME) payments; and indirect medical education (IME) adjustments. Direct GME costs include items such as salaries of residents, interns, and faculty and overhead costs for classroom training. The separate IME adjustment was established in 1983 and pertains to residency training costs that are not directly attributable to medical education expenses, but are nevertheless associated with teaching activities and the teaching hospital's research mission--for example, extra demands placed on hospital staff, additional tests ordered by residents, and increased use of diagnostic testing and advanced technology. Prior to the BBA, the IME adjustment increased Medicare's hospital payments by approximately 7.7 percent for each 10 percent increase in a hospital's ratio of interns and residents to hospital beds. 
   The BBA included a reduction in the IME adjustment from the previous 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent in FY 1998; to 6.5 percent in FY 1999; to 6.0 percent in FY 2000; and to 5.5 percent in FY 2001 and subsequent years. In my judgment, these cuts would have seriously impaired the cutting edge research conducted by teaching hospitals, as well as impaired their ability to train doctors and to serve so many of our nation's indigent. 
   Last year, in the BBRA, we mitigated the scheduled reduction in FY 2000--freezing the IME adjustment at 6.5 percent; and the IME adjustment was set at 6.25 percent for FY 2001, and 5.5 percent thereafter. The package we are introducing today, would restore $600 million in funds for FY 2001 and FY 2002 by setting the IME adjustment at 6.5 percent in both years. The IME adjustment would then fall to 5.5 percent thereafter--a reduction which I had hoped to cancel this year, and sincerely hope the congress will cancel in future legislation. 
   I have stood before my colleagues on countless occasions to bring attention to the financial plight of medical schools and teaching hospitals. Yet, I regret that the fate of the 144 accredited medical schools and 1416 graduate medical education teaching institutions still remains uncertain. The proposals in this bill will provide critically needed financing--at least in the short-run. 
   In the long-run, however, we need to restructure the financing of graduate medical education along the lines I have proposed in the Graduate Medical Education Trust fund Act (S. 210). What is needed is explicit and dedicated funding for these institutions, which will ensure that the United States continues to lead the world in this era of medical discovery. The Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund Act would require that the public sector, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector through an assessment on health insurance premiums, provide broad-based financial support for graduate medical education. S. 210 would roughly double current funding levels for Graduate Medical Education and would establish a Medical Education Advisory Commission to make recommendations on the operation of the Medical Education Trust Fund, on alternative payment sources for funding graduate medical education and teaching hospitals, and on policies designed to maintain superior research and educational capacities. 
   In addition to restoring much needed funding to our Nation's teaching hospitals for the next two years, this bill would add back funding in many vital areas of health care. Key provisions of the bill we are introducing today would: provide full market basket (inflation) adjustments to hospitals for 2001 and 2002; target additional relief to rural hospitals; reduce cuts in payments to hospitals for handling large numbers of low-income patients (referred to as ``disproportionate share (DSH) hospital payments''); delay the scheduled 15 percent cut in payments to home health agencies; improve funding for skilled nursing facilities; and assist beneficiaries through preventive benefits and smaller coinsurance payments. 
   Let me close by again complimenting Senator ROTH on developing this bill on a bipartisan basis and expressing my hope that the forthcoming information negotiations with committees of the House will be similarly conducted on a bipartisan basis.

   This is absolutely must do legislation. If we do not do it, we put ourselves at risk of a probable certain outcome--a trade war with Europe. In fact, it would astonish us and injure us, and we will wonder what happened. And nothing need have happened. 
   It was found that our tax arrangements for foreign sales corporations were in violation of WTO rules. Fine. We said we will produce a different measure that is compliant. The American industry is very happy. We have the bill. All we need to do is pass it. The deadline was October 1. It has been extended to November 1. If we do not do this, we will be remembered as a Congress that did not, and not favorably, sir. 
   I thank you for bringing it up. I regret there are reservations, but they have nothing to do, that I know of, with the essence of this measure.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last week the Finance Committee was scheduled to mark up the ``Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000,'' but the legislation became burdened by extraneous matters, and the Committee was unable to complete the mark-up. I rise today to join my good friend and Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, in introducing the ``Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000'' as an original bill with 15 cosponsors from the Finance Committee. 
   Sir, we all should be grateful for Senator ROTH's leadership in this matter. Community renewal is an effort to rebuild American communities, which is based on an agreement reached between the President and the Speaker of the House that this is legislation we ought to have. The signals are clear: the legislation will be enacted this year with or without us. Today, Senator ROTH and I give a voice in this process to the Finance Committee and the Senate. 
   Mr. President, this bill represents the will of the Finance Committee. It incorporates the worthwhile ideas of its members, including the work of my good friend, Senator ROBB, who, along with Senator ROCKEFELLER, has worked tirelessly to provide meaningful incentives for investment in distressed communities. 
   I also take a moment of the Senate's time to echo Senator ROTH's tribute to Senator John Chafee. It is fitting that we should enact, in a bipartisan bill, the tax credit for renovating historic homes in honor of a great Senator. 
   Substantively, the Community Renewal legislation is significant in several respects. First, it provides a notable measure of tax simplification, even as it accomplishes a worthwhile goal--tax benefits for investment in poor communities. While the bill designates 30 new ``Renewal Zones,'' it also conforms the tax incentives available to individuals and businesses investing in any of the zone designations, current or future. Our legislation smartly unifies these Empowerment and Renewal Zones and creates a common set of incentives. This is the right kind of legislation. 
   I also note, Mr. President, with some appreciation, two provisions that will make transportation and data transmission very quick indeed. The bill includes provisions to accelerate and expand access to high-technology infrastructure for all communities. First, it authorizes $10 billion of tax credit bonds for Amtrak to develop high-speed railways. High-speed railways have the potential to connect the very communities targeted by this legislation and provide them with greater access to information. 
   Second, the bill includes a proposal that I first introduced on June 8, 2000. That proposal, which now has 52 Senate supporters, provides graduated tax credits for deployment of high-speed communications--called ``broadband''--to residential and rural communities. Current market forces are driving deployment of broadband technology almost exclusively to urban businesses and wealthy households. The proposal in the bill will encourage broadband providers to act quickly to deploy broadband to Americans in all communities. 
   Mr. President, if you will allow me one further observation, as I am compelled to compliment the bill in one other respect. Consistent with the purpose of this legislation, it includes a  tax incentive for investment in labor in Puerto Rico. The provision does not accomplish all that I had hoped it would, but I believe it represents a positive step forward. It extends to Puerto Rico tax incentives for job creation similar to the ones in other areas of the bill, and it does so, quite simply, through an existing tax-code provision, the Puerto Rico economic activity credit. 
   Mr. President, I again applaud the leadership of our revered Chairman and proudly join him in introducing the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in April, 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin proposed to the Senate a national system of roads and canals, an idea feasible because payment of the National debt was within reach. It was a time for thinking big. A canal between the Hudson River and Lake Erie was one of his recommendations. As assemblyman from Onondaga County, Joshua Forman, traveled to Washington to tell President Jefferson that New York was ready to proceed with a canal 350 miles through the wilderness. Jefferson said ``..... it is little short of madness to think of it at this day,'' and later wrote that New York had anticipated by a full century the means to build such a waterway. 
   New York proceeded on its own. Seventeen years and $7,143,789 later we had our canal, the Erie Canal. Towns sprang up along the way, often at the locks, and prospered. Lockport, Spencerport, Fairport, Macedon, Utica, Canajoharie, Scotia. Then the railroads came, and some could not maintain that prosperity. The canal was rebuilt and enlarged between 1835 and 1862 to accommodate larger vessels. At the turn of the 20th century much of the original channel was abandoned and a new one was created by greatly altering natural waterways. This canal system continued to support considerable freight traffic until the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. 
   Today many segments and fragments of the original canal still exist across the state, as do examples of the first expansion in the 1830s. Together they show us one of the first great public works projects in this country, the means by which many thousands of settlers moved west and many tons of food and raw materials moved east. The Erie Canal created the first effective means of interstate commerce in the nation and realigned the relationship among regions. In conjunction with the Hudson River it fueled the growth of New York City. Put simple, New York would not have become the Empire State without it. 
   The canal today is primarily a recreational resource. Thanks to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972, the water flowing out of Lake Erie is much cleaner than it once was, making boating and recreation along the canal much more enjoyable. Today my colleague Senator SCHUMER and I are introducing a bill that would establish the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor. The National Park Service conducted a special resource study and found that the canal system ``contains resources and represents themes that are of national significance.'' Moreover, ``no single unit (of the Park Service) now exists that can offer as complete a portrait of the development of the United States from the last part of the 18th through the early 20th centuries.''

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, I would like to speak to the matter that the Senator from West Virginia has addressed from the perspective of the Finance Committee. I think the Senator will agree that most of the budget of the Federal Government goes through the Finance Committee in terms of tax provisions, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the public debt, which is a very large sum, which we do not debate much because we have to pay it. 
   The two committees--Finance and Appropriations--were formed at about the same time in our history and have had the preeminent quality that comes with the power of the purse, that primal understanding of the founders that this is where the responsibilities of government lie--to lay and collect taxes; to do so through tariffs, to do so through direct taxation. 
   We had an income tax briefly in the Civil War, but there was the judgment that we ought to amend the Constitution to provide for it directly. 
   Sir, I came to this body 24 years ago. I have learned that, as I shall retire in January--and, God willing, I will live until then--there will only have been 120 Senators in our history who served more terms. So they claim a certain experience. 
   I obtained a seat on the Finance Committee with that wondrous Senator from Rhode Island. We were in the same class, Senator Chafee and Senator Danforth and I. I obtained a seat as a first-time Senator, through the instrumentality of the new majority leader. I avow that. I acknowledge it. I am proud of it. I will take that with me from the Senate as few others. 
   I underwent an apprenticeship at the feet, if you will, of Russell Long, the then-chairman, who, for all his capacity for merriment, was a very strict observer of the procedures of this body and the prerogatives of the Finance Committee. 
   We brought bills to the floor. They were debated. They were debated at times until 4 in the morning. I can remember then-Majority Leader BYRD waking me up on a couch out in the Cloakroom to say, ``Your amendment is up, PAT,'' and my coming in, finding a benumbed body. The vote was aye, nay. It wasn't clear. It was the first time and the last in my life I asked for a division. And we stood up, and you could count bodies, but you could not hear voices. 
   Then we would go to conference with the House side. The conferees would be appointed. Each side would have conferees, each party. They each would have a say. We would sit at a table--sometimes very long times, but in time--and we would bring back a conference report and say: Here it is. And if anyone would like to know more about it, there are seven of us in this room who did the final negotiations with the House. It is all there. It is comprehensible. And it is following the procedures of the body. 
   I stayed on the committee, sir. This went on under Senator Dole as chairman; Senator Bentsen as chairman. I would like to think it went on during the brief 2 years that I was chairman. 
   In the 6 years since that time, I have seen that procedure collapse. In our committee, we have a very fine chairman. No one holds Senator ROTH in higher regard than I do. I think my friend recognized this when he saw the two of us stand here for 3 weeks on the floor to pass the legislation which he did not approve. Senator BYRD did not approve of permanent normal trade relations, but when it was all over, he had the graciousness as ever to say he did approve of the way we went about it. Every amendment was offered. Cloture was never invoked. And in the end, we had a vote, and the Senate worked its will. 
   Now, in the last several days in the Finance Committee, we have been working on major legislation, legislation for rebuilding American communities, which is based on an agreement reached between the President and the Speaker of the House that this is legislation we ought to have, which is fine. The President should have every opportunity to reach some agreement with the leadership over here and say: Let us have this legislation. You send it to me; I will sign it. But you send it to me; I won't write it. I might send you a draft. 
   We were not even contemplating bringing the bill to the floor, passing it, going to conference. It is just assumed that can't happen. And indeed, in the end, we could not even get it out of committee. So the chairman and I will introduce a bill and a rule XIV will have it held here at the desk so it is around when those mysterious powers sit down to decide what our national budget will be. 
   You spoke of something difficult to speak to but necessary in this body, which is our relations with the Executive, which increasingly have found themselves not just with a place at the table, as you have so gentlemanly put it, but a commanding, decisive role in the legislative process. 
   Sir, I can report--and I don't have to face constituents any longer, so I might just as well--I can recall around 11 o'clock one evening on the House side in the Speaker's conference room--that particular Speaker had a glass case with the head of an enormous Tyrannosaurus rex in it, a great dinosaur--and tax matters were being taken up. There were representatives of the White House, representatives of  the majority leadership in the House, the leadership in the Senate. I didn't really recognize any committee members, just leadership. And I arrived in the innocent judgment of something in which I wouldn't have a large part, but I would be expected to sign the papers, the conference papers the conferees sign, a ritual we all take great pleasure in because it means it is over. 
   Sir, I was asked to leave the room. I was asked to leave the room. There as a Member of the Senate minority, the ranking member of the committee, that decision was not going to have anything to do with the Finance Committee or much less the Democrats. It would be a White House and a congressional leadership meeting. 
   In 24 years, nothing like that had ever happened. I don't believe, sir, it ever happened. I can't imagine how we came to this. I do know how, from the point of view of our party--the calamitous elections of 1994, when we lost our majorities in both bodies. 
   So I would say, I do not believe in the two centuries we have been here--and we are the oldest constitutional government in history, but we have seen our constitutional procedures degrade. We have seen practices not ever before having taken place, nor contemplated. They are not the way this Republic was intended. They are subversive of the principles of our Constitution, the separation of power. 
   The separation of powers is the first principle of American constitutional government. We would not have a King or a King in Parliament. We would have an elected President, an elected 
   Congress and an independent judiciary. When the White House is in the room drafting the bill that becomes the law, the separation of power has been violated in a way we should not accept.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from Alaska, my friend of all these years. Just to conclude my thought, which is that the separation of powers is what distinguishes American government. We brought it into being. It did not exist in any previous democratic regimes, the various Grecian cities, the Roman era had a legislature period. There was no executive authority. What Madison once referred to as the fugitive existence of the ancient republics was largely because they had no executive authority to carry out the decisions of the legislature. The legislature was left to be the executive as well. It didn't work. 
   We have worked. There are two countries on Earth, sir, that both existed in 1800 and have not had their form of government changed by violence since 1800: the United States and the United Kingdom. There are seven, sir, that both existed in 1900 and have not had their form of government changed by violence since. Many of the British dominions were not technically independent nations. 
   The separation of powers is the very essence of our system. We have seen it evanescing before us. I say evanescing because--the misty clouds over San Clemente, noise rising from the sea--because I was not in that room after I was asked to leave, nor was there any journalist, nor were there any of our fine stenographers. No one was there save a group of self-selected people. They weren't selected for that role. They should not have been playing it. This has gone on too long, and it ought to stop. 
   With that, sir, I thank my friend from Alaska and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, early this Congress, I introduced S. 224, the Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act or STADIA for short. This bill would end a tax subsidy that inures largely to the benefit of wealthy sports franchise owners, by eliminating tax-subsidized financing of professional sports facilities. This legislation would close a loophole that provides an unintended Federal subsidy--in fact, contravenes Congressional intent--and that contributes to the enrichment of persons who need no Federal assistance whatsoever. 
   This is the fourth time I have introduced this legislation, and I chose to keep the original effective date for a number of reasons. Most importantly, because Congress intended to eliminate the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to finance professional sports facilities as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
   At the same time, I recognized that a few localities may have expended significant time and funds in planning and financing a professional sports facility, in reliance upon professional advice on their ability to issue tax-exempt bonds. Thus, in my original introductory statement, I specifically requested comment regarding the need for equitable relief for stadiums already in the planning stages. 
   In response to my request, several localities that had been planning to finance professional sports facilities with tax-exempt bonds came forward and provided the details necessary to craft appropriate ``binding contract'' type transitional relief. Accordingly, I agreed to change the bill in subsequent Congresses to exempt projects which had progressed to a point where it would be unfair to stop them. 
   Now I have been contacted by others who make the case that retaining the 1996 effective date creates a lack of certainty which is unhealthy for communities desiring new stadiums and for the bond market itself. Therefore, I am inserting into the record my intention to modify the effective date if and when S. 224 is adopted in committee or on the Senate floor.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Catholic Charities USA on this their 90th anniversary of commitment to social change. Their organization has done tremendous work in the community towards reducing poverty and working with lawmakers to improve so many lives. 
   Catholic Charities USA began as a small group called the National Conference of Catholic Churches in 1910, with the goal in mind of providing legal representation for impoverished persons. They have grown under the current leadership of Father Kammer, SJ, to include after-school programs and parenting classes, all of which have made an impact on the people they have touched. In celebrating their 90th anniversary, I want to thank Catholic Charities USA for their devotion in developing stronger families and neighborhoods and wish them many more years of success.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senate for again unanimously passing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000. Today it passed as an amended version of S. 324, of which I am an original cosponsor, in Title XXXV, sections 3501 and 3502, of the Senate substitute to the Children's Health Act of 2000, H.R. 4365. The Senate's action today marks a milestone in the treatment of opiate dependence. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act increases access to new medications, such as buprenorphine, to treat opiate addiction. I thank my colleagues Senator LEVIN (whose long-term vision inspired this legislation), Senator HATCH, and Senator BIDEN for their leadership and dedication in developing this Act, and I look forward to seeing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 become law. 
   Determining how to deal with the problem of addiction is not a new topic. Just over a decade ago when we passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, I was assigned by our then-Leader, Senator ROBERT BYRD, with Senator Sam Nunn, to co-chair a working group to develop a proposal for drug control legislation. We worked together with a similar Republican task force. We agreed, at least for a while, to divide funding under our bill between demand reduction activities (60 percent) and supply reduction activities (40 percent). And we created the Director of National Drug Control Policy (section 1002); next, ``There shall be in the Office of National Drug Control Policy a Deputy Director for Demand Reduction and a Deputy Director for Supply Reduction.'' 
   We put demand first. To think that you can ever end the problem by interdicting the supply of drugs, well, it's an illusion. There's no possibility. 
   I have been intimately involved with trying to eradicate the supply of drugs into this country. It fell upon me, as a member of the Nixon Cabinet, to negotiate shutting down the heroin traffic that went from central Turkey to Marseilles to New York --``the French Connection''--but we knew the minute that happened, another route would spring up. That was a given. The success was short-lived. What we needed was demand reduction, a focus on the user. And we still do. 
   Demand reduction requires science and it requires doctors. I see the science continues to develop, and The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 will allow doctors and patients to make use of it. 
   Congress and the public continue to fixate on supply interdiction and harsher sentences (without treatment) as the ``solution'' to our drug problems, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge what various experts now know and are telling us: that addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease; that is, the brain undergoes molecular, cellular, and physiological changes which may not be reversible. 
   What we are talking about is not simply a law enforcement problem, to cut the supply; it is a public health problem, and we need to treat it as such. We need to stop filling our jails under the misguided notion that such actions will stop the problem of drug addiction. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 is a step in the right direction.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator DASCHLE and many of my Democratic colleagues in sponsoring the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 (BBRA-2000). First, a few words on the genesis of this bill. 
   As part of the effort to balance the Federal Budget, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided for reduction in Medicare payments for medical services. At the time of enactment, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that these provisions would reduce Medicare outlays by $112 billion over 5 years. We now know that these BBA cuts have been much larger than originally anticipated. 
   Hospital industry representatives and other providers of health care services have asserted that the magnitude of the reductions are having unintended consequences which are seriously impacting the quantity and quality of health care services available to our citizens. 
   Last year, the Congress address some of those unintended consequences, by enacting the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), which added back $16 billion over 5 years in payments to various Medicare providers, including: Teaching Hospitals; Hospital Outpatient Departments; Medicare HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations); Skilled Nursing Facilities; Rural Health Providers; and Home Health Agencies. 
   However, Members of Congress are continuing to hear from providers who argue that the 1997 reductions are still having serious unanticipated consequences. 
   To respond to these continuing problems, the President last June proposed additional BBA relief in the amount of $21 billion over the next 5 years. On July 27, Senator DASCHLE and I announced the outlines of a similar, but more substantial, Senate Democratic BBA relief package that would provide about $40 billion over 5 years in relief to health care providers and beneficiaries. Today, along with many of our colleagues, Senator DASCHLE and I are introducing this package as the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 (BBRA-2000).

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I know Senator ROTH will join me in expressing great gratitude and appreciation for Senator WARNER's characteristic generosity. It comes from the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, which is doubly important. 
   Mr. President, we are nearly there. In a short while, the Senate will cast an epic vote. At the Finance Committee's final hearing on China this spring, on April 6, 2000, our last witness--Ira Shapiro, former Chief Negotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative--put it this way:  
   ..... [this vote] is one of an historic handful of Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing that members of Congress do this year--or any other year--could be more important.   
   This achievement--for it is a crowning achievement--caps an eventful year. All the more impressive in light of last December's ``global disaster''--as the Economist magazine on December 11, 1999, put it--that was the Seattle World Trade Organization Ministerial. 
   In January, it was thought that our long-standing trade policy was in serious jeopardy--the trade policy that, for 66 years--ever since Cordell Hull created the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program in 1934--has contributed so much to our nation's prosperity. 
   But we have prevailed. And more. In May, the Senate took up and passed--the vote was 77 to 19--the conference report on the Trade and Development Act of 2000--establishing a long overdue trade policy for sub-Saharan Africa and putting in place new trade benefits for the Caribbean Basin countries. That measure was the most significant trade legislation passed by the Congress in six years--ever since the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994. 
   Now, just four months later, we are about to give our resounding approval to H.R. 4444, authorizing the extension of permanent normal trade relations to China. And with this action, we will have passed more trade legislation--important trade legislation--in this session of Congress than any session of Congress in more than a decade. 
   It has taken us a long while to reach the point of final passage of the PNTR legislation. We have most certainly not rushed this legislation through the Senate. The House approved the measure nearly four months ago, on May 24, by a vote of 237-197. The Senate, in effect, began its consideration before the August recess--on July 27th, when we invoked cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. The vote was a decisive 86 to 12. 
   By the time this vote is cast, we will have completed eleven full days of debate. We have taken up and debated 19 amendments. We have considered every facet of U.S.-China relations, and we are now ready to give this measure our overwhelming approval. 
   And so we ought to do. We are giving up very little--the annual review of China's trade status that has had at best an inconsequential effect on China's domestic policies. In return, we are bringing China back into the trading system that it helped to establish out of the ashes of the Second World War. 
   For with its accession to the WTO, China merely resumes the role that it played more than half a century ago: China was one of the 44 participants in the Bretton Woods Conference--July 1-22, 1944. It served on the Preparatory Committee that wrote the charter for the International Trade Organization that was to complement the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. And China was of course one of the 23 original Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade--initially designed to be an interim arrangement until the ITO Charter would come into force. It did not: the ITO failed in the Senate Finance Committee and we were left with the GATT. 
   And in China, revolution intervened. The Republic of China (now on Taiwan) notified the GATT on March 8, 1950, that it was terminating ``China's'' membership. It was not until 1986 that the People's Republic of China officially sought to rejoin the GATT, now the World Trade Organization. And now, after 14 years of negotiations, China is poised to become the 139th member of the WTO. 
   It is elemental that China belongs in the WTO. It is in the interests of all trading nations that a country that harbors one-fifth of mankind, a country that is already the world's ninth largest exporter and eleventh largest importer, abide by the rules of world trade--rules that were, I would point out, largely written by the United States. 
   We, too, must abide by the WTO's rules. And thus we will approve today the legislation extending permanent, unconditional normal trade relations to China--fulfilling the most basic of our obligations under the WTO's rules--nondiscriminatory treatment. 
   Let me leave the Senate with the following observations from Joseph Fewsmith, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University and a specialist on the political economy of China. He writes in the National Bureau of Asian Research publication of July 2, 2000:  
   Some historical perspective is necessary when thinking about PNTR. When President Nixon traveled to China in 1972, China was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution. Mao Zedong was still in command, there were no private markets, intellectuals were still raising pigs on so-called ``May 7 cadre schools,'' and labor camps were filled with political prisoners. Nixon was treated to a performance of ``The Red Detachment of Women,'' one of only eight model operas that were permitted to be performed. Nearly three decades later--not a long period in historical terms--China has changed dramatically. Communes are gone, the planned economy has shrunk to a shadow of its former self, and incomes have increased dramatically. Personal freedoms, while by no means perfect, are greater than at any other time in Chinese history. China's opening to the United States is a major reason for these changes, a dramatic demonstration of the impact of international influence.  
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cast their votes in support of H.R. 4444. 
   I would like to attenuate my remarks simply to take up the question of Taiwan and its accession to the WTO. This ought to be explicit and perhaps the last thing said in this debate. 
   Just as China ought to be in the WTO--will be in the WTO--so will Taiwan. Despite the bluster of senior Chinese officials, intermittently, and recently as well, Taiwan is on track to be invited to join the WTO at the same General Council session that will consider China's application. 
   Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the WTO provides that:  
   ......any State or separate customs territory possessing full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations.......may accede to the WTO.  
   In September 1992, the GATT Council--for the WTO was not yet in existence--established a separate working party to examine Taiwan's request for accession. The nomenclature was carefully chosen. Taiwan was called the ``Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.'' That is the formulation under which Taiwan will enter the WTO. 
   The President has confirmed this and confirmed in the strongest possible terms that the United States will not accept any other outcome. The President was adamant on this point in his letter of September 12. A copy was sent to me, and I believe a copy was also sent to our distinguished chairman. It says this:  
   There should be no question that my administration is firmly committed to Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I reiterated in my September 8 meeting with President Jiang Zemin. Based on our New York discussions with the Chinese, I am confident we have a common understanding that both China and Taiwan will be invited to accede to the WTO at the same WTO General Council session, and that Taiwan will join the WTO under the language agreed to in 1992, namely, as the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese Taipei''). The United States will not accept any other outcome.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if China should attempt to block Taiwan's accession, I suggest to the Senate that there is a remedy. H.R. 4444 gives the President the authority to extend permanent normal trade relations status to China upon its accession to the WTO, but he need not do so. Indeed, if Taiwan's membership in the WTO is blocked, I would urge--and I am sure my beloved colleague, Senator ROTH, would urge, as I see him nodding--the President to simply refrain from extending PNTR to China. So we ought to put this matter to rest. 
   I have no doubt that there will continue to be bumps--some serious crises indeed--in our relationship with China. Neither membership in the WTO nor normalized trade relations with the United States will magically impose the rule of law in China or institute deep-seated respect for human rights. But certainly it has the potential to advance those purposes. That is why we are here and why we will shortly make this epic decision. 
   Finally, if I may have the indulgence of the Senate--and I know this is shared by the chairman--I want to read a short paragraph. 
   My only regret today is that with the final vote on PNTR for China, we must  bid farewell to our chief trade counsel, Debbie Lamb, who joined the Finance Committee staff over 10 years ago, in June 1990. Ms. Lamb has played an integral part in every major piece of trade legislation over the past decade--from the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round to our attempts to renew so-called fast-track negotiating authority to the two pieces of trade legislation that we passed this year: The Trade and Development Act of 2000, and now, at last, PNTR for China. Her knowledge and dedication to our committee's work has been exemplary. She is something that is very rare in Washington--a person with great breadth and great depth. The committee and I will miss her deeply as she leaves today to pursue the next phase of a distinctly distinguished career.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have a simple proposition to make, after discussions with the Treasury Department, which is simply to say the amendment is burdensome in the extreme and would discourage U.S. listings. The amendment would place an enormous, costly, and pointless regulatory burden on publicly traded companies in the United States. Firms would be required to list every single one of their overseas employees as well as every single employee of any foreign company with which they do business. They would also be required to calculate the total value of all their exports and imports. 
   Such a regulatory burden would be a nightmare for both such firms planning to go public--for most firms planning to go public. On the other hand, it would not discourage foreign firms from listing in the United States. This is not a regulation we want to impose on American business--startup businesses, small cap businesses. I hope we will not approve this. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, could I respond in the most emphatically sympathetic and supportive way to the statement of the Senator from Texas. 
   In 1993, this Congress passed legislation to create the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy in the United States. We had a fine commission. Senator HELMS and I represented the Senate, and in the House, LARRY COMBEST and Lee Hamilton, and John Deutch of the CIA. The commission came up with a unanimous finding. 
   We began with the proposition--and I can say to a fellow academic; he will recognize it--Max Weber set forth that secrecy is the natural weapon of a bureaucracy against the parliament and against the other agencies of the political system. We found the most extraordinary things. I later wrote about this. 
   In December 1946, a brilliant crypto analyst at Arlington Hall Girl's School, not far from the Pentagon, and broke the first of the Soviet KGB codes. These are one-time pads. You ``can't break them'' but they got a little careless, used once or twice. There were the names of all the physicists at Los Alamos, the principal ones. A measure of the extent of the KGB operation in this country? As our crypto analyst worked along, an Army corporal cipher clerk handing him pencils, coffee, whatever, an Army corporal cipher clerk, a KGB spy. In very short order, the KGB knew we were breaking their code. 
   Then, of course, Kim Philby was at the British Embassy and we shared some of these findings with the British--we probably still do. Then he defected. In no time at all, they knew that we knew, and we knew that they knew that we knew. 
   People might be interested to learn, who was the one person in the U.S. Government who did not know? The President of the United States. On whose orders was this the case? Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is Army property. I guess he had a sense that if he said, ``Give everything to the White House,'' it gets out. 
   President Truman never knew any of these things. 
   With the exceptions of the Rosenbergs, none of these persons were ever prosecuted. One of them, the most important, Hall, teaches physics at Cambridge University in England, and comes back and forth to this country. He had been part of that tremendous effort. He was from an immigrant family living in Manhattan, went to Queens College. They spotted him at Queens College, and they sent him up to Harvard. Then he was sent to Los Alamos. He was never prosecuted because to prosecute, it must be stated where we got the information and so forth. 
   Secrecy can be so destructive to the flow of information that is needed. It will continue long after there is any conceivable need for secrecy. We estimated recently that the classified documents we have in place now would be 441 times stacked up the height of the Washington Monument. 
   A trivial example, but a characteristic example, President Ford at one point had in mind that I might be Librarian of Congress. I was in India, leaving the post as Ambassador and had a cable exchange with the head of personnel in the White House. I was going back through Peking, staying with the Bushes, stopped at Pearl Harbor, and then would be here. An historian writing about the Library of Congress--an interesting post; there have only been seven or eight in our history--picked this up and went to the Ford Library. Yes, there is information; but no, she couldn't see it, it was classified. It took months to get the cable to Washington declassified. 
   One could argue that there was good reason to keep that classified for seven days, but 30 years later? That is a pattern. It is a pattern that the people who deal with these things as classified don't know the material, the subject matter; they don't know the physics taught to first-year graduate students  at MIT, but information is still classified ``top secret, no form,'' in some bureaucracy in Washington. The absolute standard operating procedure is to classify something ``Top secret'' and then send it to the President in the hopes that it will get on his desk if it looks really enormous. 
   There are endless examples of clippings from Newsweek magazine stamped ``Confidential.'' Just a bureaucratic mode. 
   The idea that Dr. Lee was imprisoned is hard to understand. Solitary confinement, worse. But leg irons? There were leg irons so one could not run off to Mexico. Obviously, much needs to be explained. 
   I say also for Dr. Deutch, this is a man of utmost patriotism. What was his offense? I don't think it is a crime at all. He took work home with him. After dinner he would sit down and work. 
   There is a penalty for that, and he accepted it. He has had all his clearances removed, which is a heavy price for a scientist, but he has accepted that. The idea that he has done anything wrong beyond that is to say to people: Don't go near the clandestine services of the United States, don't go near the atomic laboratories. 
   I have no standing as a scientist, but I was a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee, and I am a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and having been a member of the board and vice president at one point, I can say I know a fair number of scientists. Their postdoctorate students don't want anything to do with the Federal laboratories. 
   If you want to do something to the national security of the United States, keep the best minds out of the weapons labs. That will do it faster than any transfer of information, which has a half-life of nine months before others catch up or they think it up on their own. 
   I can speak to this. For example, with atomic secrets, we have a wonderful person, a great man, Hans Bethe, who was standing alongside Oppenheimer at Los Alamos. A man of luminous intelligence. There is nothing that he is more skeptical about than the idea of keeping physical science secret. He tells the story that after the atomic bomb was detonated, he and the other physicists involved said: All right, but no hydrogen bomb. 
   No, that is too much. 
   And there was the further advantage:  
   And thank God, nobody knew how. It was not possible to make one. It can't be done. The physics just won't work.  
   And then he said: Stanislaw Ulam and Edward Teller figured out how it could be done. 
   And we said: Oh, Lord, if Ulam can think of it, Sakharov will think of it. So we had better go through with it. 
   He and Oppenheimer said:  
   You have to go through to a hydrogen bomb because science is not in a box that you can put in a closet.  
   I also want to say on this floor that I have not known a more patriotic man than John Deutch; absolutely committed to this country's security. Provost at MIT, a physical chemist, a man of great science, who made the error of working after supper at home. Nothing was ever transferred to anybody. He was working. What do I do in the morning? That kind of thing. And the very idea we would try to punish him for that is to put, I say, in jeopardy the whole reputation of American classified science and clandestine service. We do that at a great cost, which you will not recognize for half a century, perhaps. But it will come. 
   I thank the Senator from Texas for what he has said. I appreciate his indulgence in what I have joined him saying. 
   I see my colleague seeks recognition. I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just 2 days ago, the Washington Times carried a fine article by our former colleague, Rudy Boschwitz, and Robert Paarlberg, who is a professor of political science at Wellesley College, entitled ``China Trade Boosts Farmers,'' subtitled, ``Senate should back PNTR.''  
   Farm state legislators should be particularly sensitive to the fact that China's joining the WTO will be a pre-emptive strike benefiting American farmers. Membership in the WTO will preclude China from later raising trade barriers on agricultural products.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, before our beloved chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, leaves, may I thank him for his remarks. All anyone need say is what he has said. I would just supplement them with one comment to reinforce what he has said. We, the Finance Committee, held a long series of hearings on the bill. It happens, in the last paragraph of the last witness, the Honorable Ira Shapiro, who has been previously our chief negotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said thus:  
   This vote is one of an historic handful of congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing that Members of Congress do this year or any other year could be more important.  
   He was not simply speaking of trade and the standard of living. He was talking about the large geopolitical fact of do we include one-fifth of mankind in the world's system we wish to create, we have created, and are creating, or do we say, no, you are out, and invite hostility that could spoil the next half century? 
   We have not. Today we voted by a two-thirds majority to go forward. I thank the Senator for his vote and his leadership throughout. It is a cheering experience in what has not been always a cheering year.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I might respond, there is an extraordinary symmetry to what we are doing today. Toward the end of the Second World War, when China was our ally, we gathered at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire and drew up the plans for what became the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and an International Trade Organization to establish common rules for trade that would be abided by, a rule of law that could be adjudicated and settled. China was a full participant at the Bretton Woods Conference. China joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after the International Trade Organization, sir, was defeated in the Senate Finance Committee. 
   They withdrew after the Chinese Red Army overran the mainland. But now the People's Republic has asked to come back and join the revived International Trade Organization, now the  World Trade Organization, which has rules that are to be abided by, and nondiscrimination is the first rule. 
   That is why this measure is so important because we could not be in the WTO with China if we had a provision that we must renew normal trade relations status once a year. No, but each of us must abide by the rules. It is now up to the vigilance of our Department of Commerce, the Trade Representative, American business, and labor unions to see to it that the rules are abided by. You can't hope for more. 
   Let us go forward in confidence and determination, as the Senator described. I thank the Senator.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly to the important issues my friend, the Senator from North Carolina, has raised and to suggest that we have the necessary international agreements already in place to address the more fundamental issues with which he is concerned, as is my friend from Minnesota. 
   It happens I have spent a fair amount of my early years as a student of the International Labor Organization which was created as part of the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1918. Samuel Gompers of the AFL-CIO was chairman of the commission in Paris that put it together. A very major matter in the mind of President Wilson as he campaigned for the treaty, he talked about the ILO as much as any other thing. 
   The first international labor conference met here in Washington, just down Constitution Avenue at the building of the Organization of American States. It was a dramatic time. 
   President Wilson had been struck down by a stroke. The Congress, the Senate was tied up with the question of ratifying the treaty. But the treaty provided that this meeting should take place in Washington, and it did. It did so with great success. International labor standards were set forth, and China was one of the nations present at the international labor conference. The person who provided most of the facilities for it was the young Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a man named Franklin D. Roosevelt, who later became involved. One of the first things he did when he became President was move to join the ILO. 
   Now, over the years the United States has been an active member of the ILO. We had the Secretary General at one point, Mr. Morris, a former Under Secretary of Labor. 
   We have not ratified many conventions. I have come to the floor at least four times in the last 24 years and moved a convention. Once it was done by our revered Claiborne Pell, who then turned the matter over to me. We think of there being eight core conventions. The simple fact is that the United States has only ratified one of them, in a membership that goes back to 1934. 
   However, it is not necessarily the case that if you have ratified a lot of conventions, you are very much in compliance with the principles there involved. I once suggested, not entirely facetiously, that there was an inverse relationship between the number of ILO labor conventions that had been signed by a country and the actual condition of labor relations in that country. But no matter. 
   In 1998, at the 86th session of the International Labor Organization, the oldest international organization in the world of this nature--the postal union is the oldest--adopted an ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and its followup. I will read this provision: 
   The international labor conference declares that all members, even if they have not ratified the conventions in question, have an obligation, arising from the very fact of membership in the organization, to respect, to promote, and to realize, in good faith and in accordance with the Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those conventions; namely:(a), freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right of collective bargaining;(b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor;(c) the effective abolition of child labor; and  (d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
   These are international obligations. They obligate the People's Republic of China, and they obligate the United States. The provision for bringing the issues to the International Labor Conference which meets every year in June in Geneva are well established. 
   I find it very curious, almost at times sinister, that just at the point the ILO has said these are the world's standards, international standards, binding legal commitments, and here we are to do something with them, suddenly people are saying, no, these matters should be dealt with in the World Trade Organization, which can't deal with them. 
   It is interesting that the WTO now occupies the original buildings on Lake Leman in Geneva of the ILO. But why not stay with the ILO and work with this history and hold China to its commitment as China can hold us? It is something we have believed in and worked with from 1918 on. 
   The issue of trade and its effect on the internal behavior of government is an elusive one. But, if I may say, I was in China during the regime of Mao Zedong. I stood there in Tiananmen Square and looked up at these two enormous flagpoles. On one pole were two 19th century German gentlemen, Mr. Marx and Mr. Engels. What they were doing in the center of the Middle Kingdom, I don't know. Over on the next pole was the rather Mongol-looking Stalin, and Mao. 
   That is gone. 
   At one of the entrances to the Forbidden City there is a sort of smallish portrait of Mao. That is all. That world is behind us. The world is looking forward from the 1960s. 
   The Cultural Revolution, which Mao declared because there had always been revolutions, may have resulted--I don't think anybody knows, and I don't think we will ever know--in somewhere between 20 million and 40 million persons murdered, starved, dead. It is beyond our reach of our imagination. It happened. That doesn't happen anymore. Do disagreeable things happen? Do illegal things happen? Do bad things happen? Yes. But a certain sense of proportion, I thought, that was very much in evidence in testimony that our revered chairman will perhaps recall, I am sure he will. 
   Before the Finance Committee on March 23 of this year, Professor Merle Goldman, who is at the Fairbank Center at Harvard University--a name for a great Chinese scholar and very fine group of people--said:  
   ..... the linkage of economic sanctions to human rights is counter-productive. As Wang Juntao [a Tiananmen Square coordinator who was sentenced to 13 years of prison] says, it arouses the antagonism of ordinary Chinese people toward the U.S. and fuels increasing nationalism in China, which ultimately hurts the cause of human rights in China. Even when the threat of economic sanctions in the past led to China's release of a small number of famous political prisoners, it did not in anyway [sic] change or end the Chinese government's abuse of human rights.
   Nevertheless, China's views on human rights have been changing ever so slowly in the post Mao Zedong era primarily because of China's move to the market and participation in the international community. During the Mao era (1949-1976) when China was isolated from the rest of the world, China's government did not care about human rights and international pressure. But as China opened up to the outside world politically as well as economically during the Deng Xiaoping period (1978-1997) and during that of his successor Jiang Zemin (1989- ), China began to care about how it was viewed. It wants to be considered a respected, responsible member of the world community. ..... 
   Human rights abuses continue and in fact, increased in 1999, but compared with the Mao era when millions were imprisoned and silenced, the numbers in the post-Mao era are in the thousands.  
   That was from Professor Merle Goldman. 
   I say in conclusion of these small remarks that the head of the Chinese Government, Jiang Zemin, last week was in New York City talking to a luncheon of business executives. That is a world that would have been inconceivable when I visited George Bush in Peking, as it then was in 1975. A quarter century has gone by, and there is the President of China in a blue suit and a white shirt with the correct tie at the Waldorf Astoria or somewhere talking to a luncheon of businessmen interested in trade and development and such matters. That is another world. Let's not put that in jeopardy by losing this extraordinary important trading agreement. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Since the 1930s, section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and the Smoot-Hawley tariff, has made it illegal to send prison labor products to this country. If it still continues to be done, doesn't that problem involve our vigilance? Shouldn't we focus our attention on our own Customs Service, the law is ours to be enforced.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a goodly number of Senators know Adam Clymer of The New York Times as a cheerful, even avuncular, reporter affably working the corridors here in the Capitol carefully chronicling our not always cheerful proceedings. He was prominent in the pages of the Times, but was not much in evidence in the electronic media. Alas, all that changed in an instant last week. This paragon of journalistic self-effacement had celebrity thrust upon him by an open microphone. With characteristic detachment, he related this not altogether welcome experience in an article, ``My Media Moment,'' which appeared in this Sunday's Times. May an admirer and friend wish that it last more than the allotted fifteen minutes. 
   I ask that the article be printed in the Congressional Record.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. That would be four months ago, in mid-May. There has been plenty of time to examine it. The House bill has a few additional features we find attractive and which we think we could adopt and send right to the President who would sign it. It is a bipartisan measure. 
   There are those who do not want this legislation. 
   It has been avowedly, unashamedly, and legitimately their desire to prolong the debate until time runs out. If they could just add one amendment, the measure would have to go back to the House, then to conference, then to the floor. Time would run out. 
   We have passed two appropriations bills. We are in a Presidential election year. That election is less than 60 days away. The desire to get back to our constituencies is legitimate and proper. Therefore, the device of delay is a legitimate, recognized, and familiar strategy. 
   However, this is not a matter on which to delay. The Chairman was absolutely right, this may be the most important vote we take this decade. In my opening statement, I referred to the testimony of Ira Shapiro, our former Chief Negotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. He, just by chance, concluded his testimony, in the last testimony we heard, as it happened:  
   ..... [this vote] is one of an historic handful of Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing that Members of Congress do this year--or any other year--could be more important.  
   Well, let us be about it. We look around and we are happy to see our friend from South Dakota, Senator JOHNSON, who wishes to speak on behalf of the measure. We welcome any other Member who wishes to speak. We have heard many. The real matter before the Senate is those who wish to offer amendments. A good friend, a distinguished Senator, the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, laid down a measure last evening. We had to juggle our schedule to go to the water appropriations measure. But he is not here this morning. He claimed a place--which is fine, legitimately--but the place is empty. When I arrived, as when the Chairman arrived, looking to start the amendment process, no one was here. 
   Now, sir, there can be only one response, and the Chairman has stated it. On Tuesday, I hope the Majority Leader will move to close debate by invoking cloture. It is a process with which we are familiar. We are not cutting off amendments; amendments will be in order afterwards. But we are sitting here asking for amendments, and none comes forward. This matter is of the utmost gravity, urgency, the issues that are in balance, and not just economic issues but political, military issues of the most important level. That is what is at stake. If nobody wishes to debate it, let's proceed to a final vote.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Kentucky will indulge me for a 90-second comment, I thank my friend from South Dakota for that superb address of the importance of a mixed economy and the contacts they already have. I ask to be indulged a moment from an academic past. 
   I was once a colleague and remained a good friend of Raymond Vernon, an economist who developed the theory of the product cycle: How a product begins to be produced in one nation, then will be exported, consumed abroad, then produced abroad and exported back. This goes on. 
   The soybean--I now have to invoke my age in this regard. I remember as a boy in the 1930s reading in the Reader's Digest about this magic little bean that was grown in China and contained proteins of unimaginable consequence and would some day come to our country and be grown, and we would all be so much healthier and happier. 
   That happened, and now those very Chinese are coming to South Dakota negotiating the sale of soybeans back to China. This is Vernon's product cycle, part of the dynamism of trade. It is never one way. It goes back and forth, not to be feared, not by us. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I may, the chairman is absolutely correct. I believe it to be the case. You can't obviously say this with complete confidence, but China will become a member of the WTO with us or without us. They have completed their negotiations with the great majority of the 137 members of the WTO. They will be admitted. However, having been admitted, the privileges of the relationship the WTO establishes includes being subject to the rule of law. Panels say what the trade law means. What have you done? What are the facts? Here is the judgment handed down, which can be appealed. It is a rule of law process. That is only available to countries that have met the WTO standard enunciated in Article 1, which says you must have given unconditional normal trade relations. If you have done that with another country, then you can non-apply the WTO to that country (and not gain any of the benefits the other country's concessions) or that country can take you into court--if you would like to put it that way--and you can answer the decisions and so forth. 
   This is everything you would hope for in a relationship where, up until now, we have had no recourse to binding dispute settlement. When faced with the unwillingness of the Chinese government from time to time to comply with trade agreements, we could do nothing, excepting to complain to them and say: We very much regret you did that. We don't want you to do it again. Once China joins the WTO and we extend PNTR, we will have a different answer: If you do it again, we will do this instead of saying you have broken a rule, as we judge it, and we will go to court. 
   Going to court is so much better than going to war or otherwise.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Chairman is absolutely correct. 
   If I could make a point here--it is a personal one, but so be it--I first visited the People's Republic of China in 1975. I had been Ambassador to India, and, for reasons that were undiscernible at the time, the Foreign Minister of China wished to talk to me as I was on my way home. I received this message from George Bush, who represented our interests there. He was not ambassador. And, oh gosh, he was kept to the end of every line, and he had the smallest compound, and all the help went home at 7 o'clock. But he and Barbara were in good spirits. 
   I made my way up to Tiananmen Square, to two enormous flagpoles. One of them had vast portraits of 19th century German gentlemen: Marx and Engels; the other, a rather Mongol-looking Stalin. They were the vanguard of revolution. 
   At that point, one of the big issues was, When would the fourth Communist Party take place--the fourth in their history? The French Ambassador thought in the spring; the British Ambassador thought June; some said maybe it had been canceled. We were on Tiananmen Square. There was a  Great Hall of the People. It had the look of a post office on a Sunday morning. The very week I was there and everyone was thinking about when it would happen, it was happening. That is how secret that world was. Four thousand delegates made their way in and out and voted unanimously. The Foreign Minister succeeded Mao. 
   This was a Communist country. Everybody wore Mao jackets. The people were color-coded. The army was green; the civil service was blue; the workers were gray. We were taken to see the model apartments and so forth. The children would sing about growing up with industrial hands: We will settle the western regions; we will smash the imperialists. 
   It is over. First they rejected Stalin. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic were, at times, in a shooting war--which never sank in across the river, but all right. Then Mao disappeared. Go there now, and there is a little portrait of Mao above an entrance to the Forbidden City--this nice portrait, nothing domineering. 
   Had anyone noticed in the photographs of the leaders of the United Nations, the head of the Chinese Government wears a blue suit, a white shirt, and a tie such as the distinguished Chairman? 
   We just heard an hour ago from our Senator from South Dakota, last year there were 29 Chinese agronomists in South Dakota discussing the purchase of soybeans. They wouldn't come near us 30 years ago. They are here now. 
   Can't we grasp this? Is there something missing?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about those most elemental rule principles that Adam Smith laid down so many years ago: Comparative advantage. 
   Remember, he used the image, he said: You could make port wine in Scotland and you could grow wool in Portugal. But on the whole, it is to our comparative advantage if Scotland made the wool cloth and sold it to the Portuguese who made the port wine and sent it to Scotland. 
   I hope it is not indiscrete--I am sure it isn't because it came up in the Finance Committee--there is a wonderful compatibility between the poultry industry in Delaware and the Chinese trading system. The Chinese cuisine, Chinese tastes, happen to be for parts of the chicken which are least liked, in least demand among Americans. By contrast, the portions of the chicken which are most demanded among American consumers are least demanded among Chinese. What a happy arrangement to just trade. We keep what we would most desire, they take what they most desire, and we are better off. 
   The Chinese importing animal protein? When we were there first, a Chinese family might see such a meal once a year. Hey, Americans, loosen up. Something good is happening. And be careful lest we miss an opportunity and something bad happens. 
   I will say one more thing. I am sure he won't mind. After Senator ROBERTS of Kansas spoke yesterday, I happened to say to him on the floor what a fine statement he made. 
   He said: You know, I am glad you mentioned that century and a half of the Chinese exclusion law--century. He said: My father was on the Panat. Like the father of our distinguished Presiding Officer, he showed great heroism, and was awarded the Navy Cross. He came back to Kansas and he said he never stopped talking about the way we treated the Chinese. 
   You might start by saying what is that gunboat doing up the--was it the Yangtze?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. If we found a Chinese gunboat on the Missouri, we might say: I think you got your charts wrong here. This is U.S. waters, not yours. 
   It is easy for us to forget because there was no indignity done us. It is not easy for them. I am not asking any sympathy for them, I am just giving a fact. If we suddenly break into that appearing hostile mode of wanting hegemony and all that, I shall be happy to have been out of this by then because we will be asking for terrible events: Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India--let's not do this. Let's do the sensible thing we have been trying to do since the day we began the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program in 1934. 
   My colleague is bringing it to a culmination. I hope he is proud.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I simply say we have been here all morning. We would be here all afternoon and into the evening if there were occasion--demand for it. We expected a measure to be brought up that was laid down last evening. It was not. We would be here all Monday. But when, on Tuesday, we move to close debate and the final 30 hours during which amendments will be offered, that is only appropriate. It is fair play by the rules and we will get to some conclusion. It will be a very fine conclusion. We began it yesterday morning when the motion to proceed was adopted, 92-5.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. On August 19, 2000, President Clinton signed into law bipartisan legislation that pledges more than $400 million to fight AIDS and other infectious diseases in Africa and around the world. 
   There are few greater crises that face us today than the AIDS pandemic. Alarming statistics are reported from around the globe. In Africa, more than 13 million people have died from AIDS, and an estimated 24.5 million are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV. More than 1 in 3 adults in Botswana are HIV-positive. Burma and Cambodia have recently had the sharpest increases in the rate of infection. In Haiti, more than 1 in 20 adults are infected. 
   The XIII International AIDS Conference in South Africa was defined by the fact that 90 percent of those infected with HIV do not have the means to pay for the drugs to treat it. The epidemic is fueled by poverty, poor health, illiteracy, malnutrition, and gender bias. These are the same problems that developing nations have struggled with for many years. But even more urgency becomes warranted as these factors contribute to the exponential growth of an epidemic. 
   According to AIDS expert Peter Godwin, an epidemic requires specific responses in three areas: long-term protection of vulnerable populations; short-term relief and rehabilitation of those in crisis; and the strengthening  of basic institutions against future shocks to come. Each of these responses comprises an infinite number of sub-components. 
   The Senate's passage of this bill is remarkable. But our work has just begun. According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, Asia has reached a critical point in the development of the AIDS epidemic. Though India has a relatively low infection rate, it has more than four million cases and is now the nation with the largest number of HIV cases in the world. In Africa, the U.N. has predicted that half of all 15-year-olds in the African countries worst affected by AIDS will eventually die of the disease, even if the rates of infection drop substantially in the next few years. Sandra Thurman, the director of the Clinton administration's anti-AIDS effort, put it best: ``We are at the beginning of a pandemic, not the middle, not the end.'' 
   On February 3, Mr. FEINGOLD and I introduced S. 2032, the Mother-to-Child HIV Prevention Act of 2000. This bill has been included in this assistance package and will authorize $25 million to bolster intervention programs, which include voluntary counseling and testing, antiretroviral drugs, replacement feeding, and other strategies. 
   At the beginning of this year, a score of bills were introduced by my colleagues in this body. Some proposals were more ambitious than others. No single proposal would have been a complete solution. Neither is the relief package before us. But each was an approach that did not require waiting for a cure. And each could make a difference. I hope this momentum will not face--but instead, grow internationally and exponentially--and that we will not become fatigued by this most formidable challenge.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday in remarks following an extensive comment by our sometime President pro tempore, our revered Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Delaware and I would have to oppose all amendments. Whatever their good intentions or sound assertions, they would simply have the effect of costing us this epic and fundamentally important measure. 
   I will just say one thing about clean coal. It is remarkable how much progress has been made in our time. I can recall, as a graduate student after returning from the Navy, I received a Fulbright fellowship to the London School of Economics. The clean air technology was so bad in Britain that there would be days, theoretically full daylight, in which the buses would be preceded by busmen carrying electric lights to show them their way through the streets of London. It was darkness at noon in the most extraordinary way. 
   I visited what was then Peking, in our usage, in 1975. The air was not breathable. 
   At that time, or just previously, the Mao government put out large matters about biological warfare by the United States which required the citizens to wear white masks during the day. Certainly it wasn't biological warfare; it was the air quality. It is not what it should be today. It is vastly better than what it was, and it will be vastly better yet as economic development proceeds. 
   So with a measure of regret and great respect, I have to urge our Members to vote against this otherwise admirable amendment. On another vehicle, at another time, yes, but not this afternoon. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with deference and not a small measure of awe at the continued erudition of my colleague from West Virginia. The first decision I made when I came to the Senate was to support him for majority leader, and I have not made one of equal consequence since. None has given me greater pleasure. 
   I say on the question of amendments that it is a point of significance. When the Finance Committee reported a measure on its own, it was a two-page bill. It was not a complicated matter. It was just agreed to. It will allow us to reap the benefits of an agreement that was reached between two countries. 
   Now, I must say with absolute openness--and I hope always to be such. Yes. It is the hope of the managers of the legislation that the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and the ranking member, that we not amend the House bill. We have agreed to take up H.R. 4444, because if we amend it with a semicolon, it will require us to go back. The bill will go back. I do not have to tell the Senator. It will have to go to conference and pass the House again, and then come here and pass the Senate. Time has run out. This would have been a wholly acceptable and sensible approach in May, but here we are in September of an election year in the last weeks of the Senate. 
   So the Senator from West Virginia is right. He said he has read it in the newspapers. I stand here to tell him that it is the case. I hope we made no effort to conceal this. It is simply our judgment and the administration's judgment. 
   I would like to say one last thing about fast track. The Senator could not be more correct--that we have given up our right to amend the trade agreements. But we did that in the aftermath of the disastrous experience, which was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. If you were to make a list of five events that led to the Second World War, Smoot-Hawley would be one. We raised our tariffs to the 60-percent level by trading on the floor in the most normal political process that works very well in most matters. But in trade it can be ruinous. We reached a level of tariffs of 60 percent. We were in that early stage of a sharp market crash. The economy was down. But it came back up. But with Smoot-Hawley, indeed imports dropped by two-thirds. And exports dropped by two-thirds. The British went off free trade into commonwealth preferences. The Japanese went to the Greater East Asian Coprosperity sphere. 
   In 1933, with unemployment rates of almost 33 percent, Germany elected Hitler chancellor. 
   So under Cordell Hull, that great statesman from Tennessee, and Secretary of State under President Roosevelt, we began reciprocal trade agreements. We gave the President the authority to negotiate reciprocal reductions in tariffs without coming back for the formal approval of the Congress. This was the predecessor of, the precedent for, the fast track procedures that were established in the Trade Act of 1974. In effect, the Congress itself said we will deny ourselves this temptation, if you like. We can always take it back. 
   Indeed, right now the President has no fast-track authority. It expired in 1994. He could not get it in the atmosphere of the divided parties. 
   It is that atmosphere, too, that leads us to believe that we should not send this measure back to the House. It had been thought that the permanent normal trade relations bill might pass by two or three votes. It was more, but not overwhelming. As the Senator from West Virginia knows, here in the Senate Chamber 86 votes were cast in July on the motion to proceed. 
   I want to be open about this matter, if I can, and as I am. There is nothing more to say than what I have said, save that I believe I have more time--possibly 3 hours--apportioned to me 
   in this debate. If the beloved President pro tempore--and all of those things--would wish more of my time to speak further, he would only have to ask. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Two-thirds of the State of New York is covered by hardwood forests and some cedar and pine. But these are important propositions that should be listened to intensively. I surely wish to be one who will do so, and I look forward to supporting the efforts that are indicated.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my revered chairman for this opportunity to discuss the most important issue we will deal with in this portion of this session of Congress. 
   At the Finance Committee's final hearing on China this spring, on April 6, our last witness, Ira Shapiro, who was formerly the chief negotiator for Japan and Canada at the U.S. Trade Representative's office, closed his testimony with these words.  
   ..... [this vote] is one of an historic handful of Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing that Members of Congress do this year--or any other year--could be more important.  
   I rise to suggest, sir, that he is not wrong, and to explain at some length, if I may be indulged, the reasons therefor. 
   The United States has a long history of commercial ties with China, beginning at a time when we exported raw materials, medicinal herbs and such like products, in return for sophisticated manufactures. 
   The first American ship to visit China, the Empress of China, cleared New York harbor more than 216 years ago on February 22, 1784. It carried a cargo of 300 tons of ginseng, a wild root found in the uplands of States such as New York, where it is gathered to this day and is known as shang. The cargo included wool, cloth, lead, cotton, and pepper--pepper, I take it, to be a transshipment of pepper received from South Asia. She reached Canton 7 months later, on August 23, 1784, and returned to New York the following May where the vessel created a sensation with its exotic cargo of manufactures: porcelain, umbrellas, fans, and then some tea and spices. 
   By the 1830s American commercial interests in China had grown considerably despite China's restrictions on trade. But American traders lagged far behind their British counterparts--one might say the Portuguese, as well, who were the first in the Far East--and when the British secured additional trading rights by the Treaty of Nanjing, concluded in 1842 after the first Opium War, as it was known, the merchants of Boston became especially fearful that American traders would suffer discrimination. 
   In the context of today's debate, it is worth recalling that the U.S. response a century and a half ago to the fears that we were being locked out of the China market was just what we are talking about today. We sent a special emissary to ask the Chinese to grant the United States what is in effect normal trade relations status. Congress voted $40,000--some Members thought it to be an exorbitant sum--for a special diplomatic mission to China. Congressman Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts was dispatched as minister plenipotentiary. His instructions stated that his primary object was to secure for the United States the same commercial privileges that had just been won by the British. 
   On July 3, 1844, Cushing signed the United States' first treaty with China. It was called the Treaty of Wanghia, named after a village near Macao which was a Portuguese settlement. Its centerpiece was ``a most favored nation clause.'' That was the 17th century term used at the time. The meaning is that you will get the same treatment as that nation which has the most favored treatment, which in effect means equal treatment for all, or what we call normal trade relations. Just equal treatment for all, ensuring that the American merchants would have the same terms of trade and negotiation as did the French and the English traders. 
   A century and a half later, we are still grappling with these very same concerns. Thus, we find ourselves on September 5, 2000, debating the merits of establishing permanent normal trade relations with China, that term, ``normal trade relations,'' having been changed, having been adopted in the Finance Committee. We are very proud of our chairman in this regard, to have succeeded in changing the 17th century term ``most favored nation,'' which gave altogether the wrong impression to any but skilled trade negotiators and merchants. 
   Our purpose is to ensure that Americans are not disadvantaged in the Chinese market and the Chinese not disadvantaged in ours. 
   We begin the debate on a high note and with great expectations. Just as we left for the August recess on July 27, an overwhelming majority of Senators voted, 86-12, in support of the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. That is what we are doing now. It was almost exactly proportionately divided: 45 Republicans and 41 Democrats voted for cloture. 
   The vote followed an unquestionably impressive and somewhat surprising  vote in the House of Representatives on May 24. A margin of three or four votes had been predicted, with a 10-vote margin the most optimistic projection. 
   In the end, the measure passed decisively: 237 yeas to 197 noes. The Finance Committee also has wholeheartedly endorsed the bill, on a bipartisan basis. On May 17, the committee ordered reported a very simple two-page bill, S. 2277. It is not a complicated matter, two pages states it all, to extend permanent normal trade relations to China. The vote was near to unanimous, 19-1. 
   I remind my fellow Senators on this side of the aisle that all Democratic members of the Finance Committee voted in support of the bill. 
   The House saw fit to add several provisions designed to implement elements of the November 15, 1999, U.S.-China bilateral World Trade Organization agreement to address several other facets of U.S.-China relations. Thus, the House bill, H.R. 4444, includes an import surge mechanism which codifies a provision of the November agreement, negotiated by our Trade Representative, to deal with that possibility in trade. It creates a human rights commission loosely modeled upon the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission, and it authorizes appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, State, and Labor and the U.S. Trade Representative's office to monitor China's compliance with its World Trade Organization commitments--nothing major, nothing troubling. 
   On June 17, the Finance Committee examined the House-passed bill in executive session. It was the near unanimous view of the committee that we simply ought to take up the House bill, pass it, and send it to the President, who has committed to signing it. It, after all, represents an enterprise that has been afoot through many administrations, and came to a successful conclusion in his when the World Trade Organization was created and the trade agreement was negotiated. And, so, the sooner the better. 
   We all need some reminding of our history. China's accession to the World Trade Organization is consistent with longstanding U.S. trade policy and allows China to resume the role it played 50 years ago. There can be no doubt that passage of this legislation is in the interest of the United States. This is true whether we view the matter from the overarching perspective of our broad trade policy goals or look more narrowly at the benefits that China's accession to the World Trade Organization will bring to American farmers, industry, and workers. 
   Let me make the case from both vantage points. In a very real sense, America's trade policy over the past 66 years--two-thirds of a century, ever since Cordell Hull created the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Program in 1934 in the depths of the Great Depression--ever since then we have pursued policies that have brought us to this moment of extraordinary completion. With its accession to the World Trade Organization, China merely resumes the role that it played half a century ago when it was instrumental in United States-led efforts to build a multilateral trading system from the economic rubble generated by us in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. If you were to make a short list of five events that led to the Second World War, sir, Smoot-Hawley would be one of them. 
   Tariffs in that act of 1930 increased to unprecedented levels--on average 60 percent. As predicted, imports dropped by two-thirds in value terms. But what had not been predicted was that there was a corresponding and almost precisely equal drop of two-thirds in the value of exports which materialized when our trading partners responded in kind and hiked their tariffs just as the United States had done. 
   The result was ruinous, not only for the United States but for our trading partners. The British abandoned free trade and adopted Commonwealth preferences. The Japanese began the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. In 1933, with unemployment at 33 percent, Hitler was elected Chancellor of Germany. 
   It took the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 to get the trade policy of the United States back on track. The impetus behind the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program was predicated on the view that the recovery of the U.S. economy depended on finding outlets for our production--that is, opening and developing export markets--and that the only way to accomplish this was to negotiate reciprocal reductions in tariffs. 
   If I may be permitted a personal note, I was taught, after returning from the Navy in World War II--I was taught this subject by Harry Hawkins, a great State Department official who Cordell Hull, in his memoirs, observes handled reciprocal trade. This was not to them a mere economic issue--prices, trading and such like. This was an issue that had led the world to the brink of destruction in World War II. It was hoped that would never happen again. 
   This is what we are talking about now, at a more attenuated level. But the belief that has driven American policy for two-thirds of a century is still alive and happily and importantly so. 
   We did this initially on a country-by-country basis. From 1934 through 1947, the United States negotiated separate agreements with 29 countries. 
   That is a large number. I believe the initial membership of the United Nations was in the neighborhood of 55 countries. So half the countries in the world had entered agreements by this time. 
   With the conclusion of the Second World War, trade assumed an important role in postwar economic reconstruction plans, and the conviction emerged that multilateral trade agreements were more efficient and ultimately a more trade liberalizing means of spurring economic growth than a web of bilateral agreements, having all the countries involved reach the same agreement in the same setting. 
   China played a central role in that thinking and planning from the beginning. China was one of the 44 participants in the Bretton Woods Conference of July 1 to 22, 1944. We saw the war coming to an end, and we were preparing for the aftermath. Bretton Woods established the International Monetary Fund down on Pennsylvania Avenue and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which we know as the World Bank, again not 20 blocks away. 
   A multilateral trade agreement was expected to complement these institutions. There were three in mind: the fund, the bank, and the trade organization. Postwar planners did not turn their attention to trade until 1946. That year, China was appointed to the preparatory committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment, which was charged with drafting the charter for the International Trade Organization, the ITO. Thus, it was that China became one of the original 23 contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which was but one of the chapters of the ITO charter. It came to be known by its initials, the GATT, and it was put into effect in 1948 as an interim arrangement until the charter had been ratified. It was just a very small office in Geneva. A British Treasury official, Eric Wyndham White and three secretaries, as I recall from those days, in a small house above Geneva ran it all and ran it wonderfully waiting for the ITO. 
   The ITO never came to pass or did not come to pass at that time. It died in the Senate Finance Committee. The GATT survived. China remained a part of the GATT until March 8, 1950, when the Republic of China, by now located on Taiwan, notified the GATT that China would withdraw. 
   I note, and I do not want to insist as my history is not that clear, but it was the Government of China of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan that withdrew. I do not believe we have any record of the PRC, the People's Republic, as such having done it. It would not have mattered, but effectively China was out. It is to be noted--I am subject to correction--but it is to be noted. 
   It was not until 1986 that the People's Republic of China became sufficiently interested in the subject of GATT to try to reclaim its seat, and the accession negotiations began. Indeed, China had hoped to become a founding member of the World Trade Organization which came into effect on January 1, 1995, only 5 years ago, and, in effect, incorporated the GATT and succeeded it, the GATT having been originally a part of the ITO. 
   The negotiations with China proved too complex to meet that deadline, but  they continued. Today after 14 difficult years in negotiation with the whole international community--not with our Trade Representative--China is within striking distance of becoming the 138th member of the WTO. It seems elemental that China, the world's 9th largest merchandise exporting nation in 1999 and the 11th largest importer--these are WTO statistics--ought to be in the World Trade Organization, and this is universally agreed. Agreed elsewhere, not unanimously agreed in the United States, but here we are with an 86-12 vote saying, ``Let's do it.'' 
   It is equally obvious that it is in the United States' interest to have such a commanding player in a rules-based system that is largely the design and certainly is entirely the inspiration of the United States with the assent at that time of the United Kingdom and the participation of China and, I must 
   grant, the U.S.S.R. and France. 
   This brings me to a second broad observation. The economic case for permanent normal trade relations is, I would think, unassailable. Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated an outstanding market access agreement. That much is not in dispute. It was China and not the United States that had to make significant and wide-ranging market access commitments. 
   Take just a few of the products that are of great importance to my State of New York. In 1998, New York's direct exports to China totaled $596 million, $1 billion all told if shipments to Hong Kong are taken into account as now they ought to be. New York's exports are no longer principally ginseng, although I would note that in 1999, the United States exported just over 512 tons to China and Hong Kong. 
   Almost 90 percent of New York's exports are manufactured goods. On average, tariffs on such products under the agreement before us will fall from 25 percent to 9 percent by the year 2005. We are a leading producer of information technology, paper, optical fibers, photographic equipment, and photocopier parts. China will eliminate its tariffs on information technology products and photocopier parts. It is not in their interest to charge themselves more for the products that they want. 
   China has promised deeper cuts on other products. Of particular interest, the tariff on digital cameras will fall from 45 percent to zero. Tariffs on wood and paper fall not to zero but to very low rates, in the 5 to 7.5 percent range. 
   The opportunities for New York's financial services industry are staggering. Take insurance. Currently, the Chinese insurance market is valued at $10 billion a year and is estimated to be growing 20 percent annually. Twenty percent annually doubles every 4 years. At present, per capita spending on insurance in China is under $8, compared to a world average of $431. The market is there. 
   Under its WTO agreement, China will eliminate current requirements that restrict foreign insurance companies to a handful of cities. 
   China would also allow insurers to offer different types of policies--health insurance, group insurance, and the like. 
   Again, to keep in the Senate tradition of speaking first of my own State, while this is not well appreciated, New York is still a major agricultural State. We are the Nation's second largest producer of apples and third largest producer of dairy products, grapes, and wine. Our agricultural exports are well above a third of a billion dollars. This agreement reduces tariffs on apples and pears and cherries from 30 percent to 10 percent, and on wine from 65 percent to 20 percent. 
   I must not fail to mention that the Chinese will also cut their tariff on ginseng from 40 percent to 10 percent. 
   New York is by no means the only State that will benefit. The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee pointed out on July 27, just before we broke for the August recess, how China's accession to the WTO will benefit the State of Delaware, which is a major manufacturer, producing automobiles in abundance, chemicals beyond the imagination of most of us, and with a two-century tradition thereof. We grow ginseng; you produce chemicals--a pattern that I do not know if we want to maintain entirely, but there it is. 
   California, which exported $2.5 billion in goods to China in 1998, will surely gain from China's commitments to eliminate tariffs on information technology products. What we think of in Silicon Valley, that is what we are talking about. There will be no tariffs on those products. 
   Minnesota's exports to China more than doubled from 1993 to 1998--doubled, sir--increasing from $119 million to $316 million. China will cut in half its tariff on scientific instruments--which Minnesota is probably internationally acclaimed for--cut them down to 6.1 percent, which is a derisory number, as any international trade expert will tell you. 
   Minnesota's farmers will gain. China is already the world's largest growth market for soybeans and soybean products. I can remember as a boy in the 1930s reading--and for some reason I can remember--an article in the Reader's Digest telling us about the soybean, this amazing product that was grown in China that had such enormous potential for the rest of mankind. Indeed it did. Indeed it came here. And now we are sending it there. 
   That is a pattern and point of fact that is well established in trade. We think of it mostly in terms of manufacturers. But it can obviously apply to agricultural products, too. Raymond Vernon, at Harvard, described this as the product cycle theory of international trade. A country begins to produce a certain product. It then begins to sell the product overseas. The product begins to be produced overseas. And then it begins to be sold back to the original nation, the nation where it was originally produced. 
   We have seen this in automobiles, going from the United States to Asia, or Europe, and then coming back. I observe, sir, that we see it with soybeans. They came first from China. We consumed them, then produced them, and now we are sending them back to China. That is the felicity of trade and the importance of it. 
   It can be said with certainty that every State in the Union will benefit from China's accession to the World Trade Organization. 
   Permanent normal trade relations for China is necessary to realize the full benefits of China's accession to the WTO. Here is the rub: Our producers and workers and companies will not be guaranteed the full benefits of China's concessions until we grant China permanent normal trade relations status. The welfare of our workers, our manufacturers, our farmers, our lumbermen, our fishermen is at issue here. 
   This is because the World Trade Organization requires that member states extend to each other unconditional normal trade relations. This principle is enshrined in the World Trade 
   Organization--in the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights--a matter of increasing importance to the United States. It is an absolute requirement, and should be. 
   That is what we had in mind at Bretton Woods in 1944, what we put in place, as we hoped, in 1946 with the International Trade Organization, which never came into being--or did not come into being until now. Sir, it is the very same principle that the United States sought to establish in our first trade treaty with China in 1844. 
   We do not meet this requirement today since the U.S. law requires that China's trade status must be renewed annually, based on a review of China's immigration policies, to which I will address myself in a moment. 
   But, sir, as we well know, this legislation was created during the cold war, was directed against the Soviet Union and the satellite states, and had nothing whatever to do with China. H.R. 4444--that is the bill before us--will put us into compliance with our WTO obligations with respect to China and allow us to gain--in full--the considerable benefits that Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated in the November 1999 agreement. 
   There are those who argue that granting permanent normal trade relations is not necessary and that we will still reap at least some of these hard-fought gains by virtue of our previous trade agreements. I beseech the Senate, do not be lulled by this argument. 
   First, it is contradicted by nearly all experts who have examined it in detail--the administration, the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Research Service, and others.  
   Second, our competitors will not be similarly hamstrung. They will benefit from all of the concessions that China made without restriction or question. They will prefer this situation from which we are excluded, and they will necessarily and legitimately seek to maintain it. We will have done ourselves the injury. No others can be blamed. 
   More important--much more important, sir--China will view failure to enact this legislation as an unfriendly act, at the very least. The consequences could be severe, and they could endure. I would expect that they will because, sir, we have a long and troubling history of antipathy toward the Chinese. It is a strong term. I use it on this floor because it has been stated on this floor for a century and more; 
   it is time to reverse it. 
   Opposition to this measure--permanent normal trade relations--will be puzzling to many. But, sir, there is a long and rueful history in the United States of our racial antagonism toward Chinese emigration to this country, which now appears as an antagonism to the arrival of Chinese goods. 
   It is not a pleasant history and it is painful to recount it. But it is necessary. It begins in California--which is understandable--where the movement to put an end to Chinese immigration into this country began in the late 1850s. 
   By way of background, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that only 46 Chinese emigrated to the United States in the three decades between 1820 and 1850. The Chinese immigration explosion began in the 1850s, fueled by the California gold rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. From 1851 to 1880, 228,899 Chinese emigrated to the United States. By 1880, Chinese immigrants in California alone numbered 75,000, more or less--about 9 percent of the State's total population. 
   Such was the demand for Chinese labor that the United States reinforced its ``open door'' policy by treaty: The Burlingame Treaty of 1868 guaranteed to the Chinese Government the unrestricted immigration of its citizens to the United States. The State of California applauded the arrangement at the time. 
   But there was an almost immediate backlash from workers in California who had organized themselves into so-called ``anti-coolie'' associations beginning in the mid-1850s. 
   In the 1870s, the anti-Chinese movement gained momentum in the face of an economic downturn and the near completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. In 1876, a special committee of the California State Senate examined the problem and issued a report to the U.S. Congress entitled ``An Address to the People of the United States upon the Evils of Chinese Immigration.'' 
   And in July 1876, the United States Congress established a Joint Special Committee to Investigate Chinese Immigration, chaired by Senator Oliver Morton of Indiana. The joint committee held 18 days of hearings in San Francisco in October and November 1876, and issued its final report in February 1877. A statement presented to the joint committee on October 26, 1876, on behalf of the ``Labor Union of San Jose, CA,'' was typical:  
   Do they [the Chinese] prevent white immigration? We know that most assuredly they do, as of our personal knowledge we know numbers of laboring men during the past year that have come to the coast, and have had to leave the coast for lack of employment, in consequence of their inability to compete with Mongolians, and thus sustain a loss, through their influence, when they return to their old homes, not yet cursed by the presence of the Chinese.  
   This will be found in the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Chinese Immigration in Senate Report Number 689, 44th Congress, second session, page 1172, in the year 1877. 
   Please note that this was written years before the establishment of the American Federation of Labor, which has had no such views; to the contrary. Still it was heard. 
   The joint committee's final report makes painful reading, and I quote, Mr. President:  
   To anyone reading the testimony which we lay before the two Houses it will become painfully evident that the Pacific coast must in time become either American or Mongolian. There is a vast hive from which Chinese immigrants may swarm, and circumstances may send them in enormous numbers to this country. These two forces, Mongolian and American, are already in active opposition. ..... The American race is progressive and in favor of a responsible representative government. The Mongolian race seems to have no desire for progress, and to have no conception of representative and free institutions. ..... 
   It further appears from the evidence--and I continue to read from the report of the Joint Committee of Congress--that the Chinese do not desire to become citizens of this country, and have no knowledge of or appreciation for our institutions. Very few of them learn to speak our language. ..... To admit these vast numbers of aliens to citizenship and the ballot would practically destroy republican institutions on the Pacific coast, for the Chinese have no comprehension of any form of government but despotism, and have not the words in their own language to describe intelligibly the principles of our representative system.  
   That is in the report of the Joint Special Committee to Investigate Chinese Immigration, to be found in Senate Report 689, 44th Congress, second session at pages Roman V to Roman VII. 
   The joint committee's report paved the way for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which suspended immigration by Chinese laborers for 10 years. The scope of the act was expanded in 1888, and renewed for another 10 years in 1892. And then, in 1902--the century we are still in if we count the numbers--Congress indefinitely renewed the Chinese Exclusion Acts. 
   We handled these things somewhat more diplomatically with Japan. When the San Francisco Board of Education passed an order requiring all Oriental pupils--there were 93 at the time--to attend a public school specially set aside for them, President Theodore Roosevelt averted a foreign policy crisis by persuading the Board to rescind its order in exchange for his commitment to negotiate a ``gentlemen's agreement'' with Japan. The agreement of 1907-1908 was actually a series of diplomatic notes in which the Government of Japan voluntarily pledged to issue no more passports to coolies going to the mainland of the United States--coolies being the term for common laborers. 
   The Chinese Exclusion Acts were not repealed until 1943. 
   It was not until 1943 when Chinese immigrants were, for the first time, allowed to become naturalized American citizens. No other group on Earth has faced this discrimination. In the middle of the Second World War, we were allies. We were one year from the Bretton Woods agreement where China would sit with us and plan the postwar institutions of the world. Only then did we repeal that exclusion--not just in country but from the right of citizenship. 
   Pay heed: This animus continued for the longest while, and sometimes from the most unexpected places. The term ``coolie labor'' became a term of opprobrium and hostility extending the globe over. 
   Thus, in this past Sunday's New York Times book review came the review of the book, It Didn't Happen Here: Why Socialism Failed in the United States, by our preeminent political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks, describing how one of the great socialist leaders of the early 20th century, a man esteemed in our history and a Member of the House of Representatives, had this to say on the floor of the House. I quote the review by David Glenn.  
   Milwaukee's best-known Socialist leader, Victor Berger (himself an Austrian Jewish immigrant), delivered a racist harangue on the floor of Congress in 1911 against the immigration of ``modern white coolies ..... Slavians [sic], Italians, Greeks, Russians and Armenians.''  
   --this from a man who inspired the brotherhood of workers the world over. 
   Allow me to quote Representative Berger's statement more fully, as reported in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of June 14, 1911.  
   While the products of our factories are highly protected, sometimes as highly as 200 percent, the producers of these products are not protected at all. On the contrary, during the last 20 years Slavonians, Italians, Greeks, Russians, and Armenians have been brought into this country by the million. Simply because they have a lower standard of living they have crowded out the Americans, Germans, Englishmen, and Irishmen from the workshops, factories, and mines of our highly protected industries.  
   He goes on to compare the wage rates that he believed to have fallen in the aftermath of white immigration. As I have said, one of the most enlightened  men of that age used the term ``modern white coolies.'' That is a part of our history. It is time we moved on. I will move on in conclusion to two points. 
   First, the macroeconomic implications of our trade policy. 
   Discussions of trade policy would be incomplete without mention of the macroeconomic implications of trade policy and the Nation's persistent balance of payments deficit--an issue addressed by Wynne Godley in ``Drowning In Debt'' a Policy Note recently published by the Jerome Levy Institute. The issue is somewhat complicated and centers around some complex economic interactions. But certain simple propositions warrant revisiting. 
   First, the large and persistent balance of payments deficit reflects an imbalance between domestic saving and domestic investment. Simply put our Nation is not saving enough. The improvement in government finances--moving from deficits of more than 4 percent of GNP to surpluses of more than 2 percent of GNP--have been partially offset by a decline in private savings. At the same time, an investment boom has required even more saving. In the short-run, this is not a problem, particularly since the investment boom will yield some dividends in the form of higher economic growth. 
   Second, in the long-run, this imbalance cannot continue, particularly as we approach the retirement of the baby boom generation. Indeed, it would be more prudent to now run balance of payment surpluses, reflecting an abundance of domestic savings, which so to speak can be cashed in when the baby boom generation retires. 
   Third, trade policies, such as approving PNTR for China will increase economic efficiency, but may or may not reduce the balance of payments deficit. Only sound domestic policies can do that, for example a responsible fiscal policy that encourages domestic saving including budget surpluses, can reduce the balance of payments deficits. 
   Allow me to close on a personal note. In January 1975, returning from a posting at U.S. Ambassador to India, I had the great pleasure of visiting Peking--as it then was--as a guest of George and Barbara Bush, who then represented the United States at the capital in a less than ambassadorial capacity. We had not yet exchanged ambassadors with the Communist regime. I was struck by a number of seeming contradictions. The great Tiananmen Square was dominated by two vast flag poles. At the top of the first were two massive portraits of 19th century hirsute Victorian gentlemen, Marx and Engels. The other had portraits of a somewhat mongol looking Stalin and, finally, Mao Zedong, who died in 1976. The Great Hall of the People, as I wrote later, maintained throughout my visit ``the inert external manner of a post office on Sunday morning.'' In fact that very week, some 2,864 delegates had assembled there for the Fourth Party Congress. A new Constitution was adopted, Zhou Enlai was confirmed as Premier. And he declared that world war was inevitable. 
   But that was not the impression one carried away. I have some confidence in what I say as two weeks later I wrote a long ``Letter from Peking'' for the New Yorker magazine. China, I wrote, ``is a huge industrializing nation.'' Its products were not at that point overwhelmingly impressive: ``In sum, Stalinist art and Meiji manufacture.'' Even so, Premier Zhou had predicted that by 1980 China would have a ``relatively comprehensive industrial and economic system,'' and that by the end of the century this, combined with science and technology, would put her ``in the front ranks of the world.'' Here we are at the end of that century. 
   I came away from Peking convinced that the regime had broken its ties with Moscow. No one with an elementary sense of Eurasian history could believe they would last much longer. None you might say other than our intelligence agencies. Now the cult of Mao has receded. Some years ago I was back in what was now Beijing on a CODEL headed by much-loved Republican leader Bob Dole. The portraits atop the flag poles had vanished. Mao was consigned to a smallish portrait above an entrance to the Forbidden City on one side of the square. Industry and business moving forward regardless of ideology. At Shanghai the old European banks on the Bund were nominally empty--no exterior signs of any activity within--but were in fact bustling within, banking, as they had been 60 years earlier. 
   No one should think of the People's Republic as a ``normal'' nation. It has a century of revolutionary past to accommodate to a more settled future. The potential for estrangement and worse is still there. To the extent that trade moderates international tensions, surely we will do so; indeed, insist on doing so. Too much is at stake not to do. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, William Maxwell has left us. As he once put it, an afternoon nap into eternity. Wilborn Hampton, in his wonderful obituary in The New York Times, ends with Bill wondering what he would do there where there was nothing to read! 
   His list of books ends with the Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats. It would be appropriate to add Yeats' account of a contemporary: ``He was blessed, and had the power to bless.'' 
   He was surely such to this senior Senator. I was a ragamuffin of a lad some fifty-sixty years ago. He suggested to me that I might one day write for The New Yorker. I took the compliment with as much credence as if he had said I might one day play for the Yankees. But then, many years later, I did write for The New Yorker. He had the power to bless.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee. This measure has now had its first test. It has passed overwhelmingly, 86-12. 
   We have trouble getting such votes on the Fourth of July celebrations. 
   Here is some sense of how epic this vote will be. At the Finance Committee's final hearing on China, on April 6, the former Chief Negotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative closed his testimony thus: ``this vote is one of an historic handful of Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing that Members of Congress do this year or any other year could be more important.'' 
   We are asking, pleading to leave this bill untouched. We want it to go out of this Chamber directly to the President at the White House where it will be signed. We do not want a conference. We do not want another vote on the House floor. 
   The majority leader promised that the Senate would begin its consideration of H.R. 4444, the legislation authorizing the extension of permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, to China before the August recess. He has kept his word. We owe great thanks as well to our esteemed minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, who has been tireless on this matter, and to our great Chairman, Senator ROTH, whose efforts have brought us to this day. Today's vote puts us on course to take up and pass this important legislation early in September. 
   I have no doubt that the measure will prevail--and by a wide margin. It comes to us following the decisive vote in the House of Representatives on May 24--over two months ago now--237 ayes, 197 noes. And it comes to the floor with the unequivocal endorsement of the Finance Committee: on May 17, the Finance Committee reported out a simple, 2-page bill--a straight-out authorization of PNTR. The vote was nearly unanimous, 19-1. 
   The House saw fit to add a few more provisions, which the Finance Committee studied in Executive Session on Wednesday, June 7. Our conclusion was that there is nothing objectionable in it. 
   The House added the package offered by Representatives LEVIN and Bereuter. It includes an import surge mechanism to implement one of the provisions of the November 1999 U.S.-China agreement, fully consistent with existing law. It creates a human rights commission loosely modeled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. And it authorizes appropriations to address China's compliance with its WTO commitments. 
   Nothing major. Nothing troubling. It was the nearly unanimous view of the Finance Committee that we ought simply to take up the House bill and pass it. And the sooner the better. 
   I will make two observations. First, with its accession to the WTO, China merely resumes the role that it played more than half a century ago. China was one of the 44 participants in the Bretton Woods Conference, July 1-22, 1944, and its representatives were seated on the executive boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund when those two organizations came into being in 1946. 
   That same year, China was appointed to the Preparatory Committee of the  United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment, which was charged with drafting both the Charter for the International Trade Organization (ITO) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China was one of the original 23 Contracting Parties of the GATT, which entered into force for China on May 22, 1948. 
   Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan) notified the GATT on March 8, 1950 that it was terminating ``China's'' membership. Thirty-six years later, in 1986, China officially sought to rejoin the GATT, now the WTO. After 14 years of negotiations, it is now time. 
   My second broad observation is that the economic case for PNTR is unassailable. Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated an outstanding market access agreement: that much is not in dispute. It is a one-sided agreement: it was China, and not the United States, that had to make significant and wide-ranging market access commitments. 
   Once China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization--and China will become a WTO member with or without the support of the United States Congress--the concessions that China has agreed to in negotiations with the United States and other countries will be extended to all countries that enter into full WTO relations with China. This is simply a consequence of the operation of the ``normal trade relations'' principle--the old ``most-favored-nation'' principle, to use the 17th century term. 
   But until the United States grants China permanent normal trade relations, we will not be guaranteed the benefits that our own negotiators secured. This is because the process of annual renewal and review of China's trade status, conditioned as it is on freedom-of-emigration goals, violates the core principles of the WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights--all of which require unconditional normal trade relations. 
   A vote in support of PNTR for China is not an endorsement of China's record on human rights. To be sure, there is much to be done. But the annual NTR review process has simply not provided us much leverage on human rights because the sanction is too extreme--the reimposition of the Smoot-Hawley tariff rates, that would choke off our trade with China-- and has never been imposed. 
   The United States has extended our ``normal''--i.e. ``normal trade relations'' or NTR--tariff rates to China each year for the past 20 years. Since 1980. Without a break. This legislation simply recognizes that this long-standing policy will continue. 
   We will have a good debate when we return in September. And then I predict that the Senate will pass H.R. 4444 by an overwhelming margin, as we ought to do. 
   I again thank our dear friend from North Carolina.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Democratic Leader Senator DASCHLE on his statement and join him in supporting the Democratic BBA Refinement and Access to Care Proposal. As the Leader said, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) has cut Medicare spending far more than had been intended. Our Democratic proposal would spend $80 billion over 10 years to mitigate the unintended effects of the BBA on our nation's health care providers and beneficiaries. 
   In particular, I want to highlight that our package would prevent further reductions in payments to our Nation's teaching hospitals. The BBA, unwisely in my view, enacted a multi-year schedule of cuts in payments by Medicare to academic medical centers. These cuts would seriously impair the cutting edge research conducted by teaching hospitals, as well as impair their ability to train doctors and to serve so many of our nation's indigent. 
   Last year, in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), we mitigated the scheduled reductions in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The package we are proposing today, would cancel any further reductions in what we call ``Indirect Medical Education payments,'' thereby restoring nearly $7 billion to our Nation's teaching hospitals. 
   I have stood before my colleagues on countless number of times to bring attention to the financial plight of medical schools and teaching hospitals. Yet, I regret that the fate of the 144 accredited medical schools and 1416 graduate medical education teaching institutions still remains uncertain. The proposals in our Democratic BBA refinement package will provide critically needed financing in the short-run. In the long-run, we need to restructure the financing of graduate medical education along the lines I have proposed in the Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund Act that I have introduced in the last 3 Congresses. That legislation would require the public and private sectors to provide support for graduate medical education. More on that later. 
   My particular interest in this topic goes back to 1994 when the Finance Committee took up the President's Health Security Act. As Chairman of the Committee I asked Paul Marks, then President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Cancer Center to arrange a ``seminar'' for me on health care issues. We convened on Wednesday, January 19, 1994 in the Laurance S. Rockefeller Boardroom at 10 a.m. At about a quarter past the hour I was told that the University of Minnesota might have to close its medical school. 
   Whereupon my education in this began. Minnesota is where the Scandinavians (Swedes) settled. They don't close medical schools; they open medical schools. What was going on? It was simple enough: managed care had reached the high plains. The good folk of Lake Wobegon had dutifully signed on, only to learn that market-based health plans do not send patients to teaching hospitals, because they cost too much. No teaching hospital; ergo no medical school. 
   In the Clinton Administration health security plan, they assumed health care costs would continue to rise. The Administration's solution to this was rationing--cut the number of doctors by one quarter, specialists by one-half and so on. 
   As I have described elsewhere, a dissenting paper dated April 26, 1993, by ``Workgroup 12'' of ``Tollgate 5,'' was written by a physician in the Veterans' Administration. Workgroup 12 was part of the 500 person Clinton health care task force. The paper began:

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I first express my gratitude to our chairman who suggested that the 10 hours reserved for a conference committee report be reduced, in this case, to a half an hour in order that we might continue with the Senate's business on appropriations, the sooner to reach the issue of permanent normal trade relations with China, which is a wholly admirable purpose with which I agree and congratulate him. 
   Having said that, I cannot wholly recognize the legislation he describes. I cannot be entirely certain because, although I was a conferee, as appointed by the Senate, to the House-Senate conference on the bill, I was never notified of any meeting, and all I really know about this legislation is what I read in the newspapers. 
   I read this morning in the New York Times on the front page an article by Richard W. Stevenson, a well-respected journalist, with the headline: ``An Effort to Soften a Tax Cut Only Hardens the Opposition'':  
   Hoping to make it harder for President Clinton to veto a measure they see as having tremendous political appeal, Republicans have unveiled a new version of their tax cut for married couples, but as the bill passed the House today, they promptly found themselves under fire for making the bill cost $44 billion more overnight.  
   Mr. President, $44 billion more overnight. The ways in which this happened are obscure, but the outcome is clear. The House originally passed a $248 billion measure. This now is $292 billion, almost a third of a trillion dollars. 
   In the Finance Committee and on the floor, the Democratic Members made the point that, yes, the marriage penalty needed to be addressed, and we had a measure, a device that was simplicity itself. We said in one sentence: A couple is free to file jointly or singly, period. 
   There are 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code. The measure before us deals with one, half of another, and half of yet another, leaving, if you count, as you will, 62 or 63 untouched. 
   The most notorious and the most difficult, dealing directly with a palpable social problem, which is that of single parents, is the earned-income tax credit. In this morning's New York Times, also, there is an article by David Riemer, who is the Milwaukee director of administration for the Wisconsin's welfare replacement program, which has received very encouraging notices in recent years. It is entitled ``The Marriage Tax on the Poor.'' He describes how this works. 
   The earned-income tax credit evolved in the aftermath of President Nixon's effort to establish a guaranteed national income, family assistance plan, and Congress rejected that. The House passed it. The Senate did not. The Senate thought at least we should do something equivalent for people who work; hence, the earned-income tax credit. It has been expanded over the years, and it is our most effective antipoverty program, period, if you describe poverty in terms of resources, of income. 
   I read one paragraph:  
   The earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty can be huge. Imagine a young woman and the father of her two children, living together as one household, unmarried but hoping to wed. She earns $12,000 a year; he earns $20,000. Under the tax rules, her credit is the maximum, $3,888. If they marry, the mother's ``family earnings'' will rise from $12,000 to $32,000. Her credit will go from $3,888 to zero--a big loss of income for a couple of such modest earnings.  
   The bill before us does almost nothing about that, less than the bill that left the floor in the middle of this week. 
   Our alternative measure is simplicity, one line, which says to that couple, as to any other: By all means, get married and choose to file jointly or separately. Separately, you retain the mother's earned-income tax credit. 
   This is a great opportunity lost, part of a strategy to have lots of individual tax cuts which will cumulate into an enormous tax cut. The President has said he will veto it. He should. We can get back to this next year. Do the simple thing, the reasonable thing: Get rid of all marriage tax penalties, 65 in all, and particularly those on the poor deriving a significant benefit from the earned-income tax credit.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on the first of May of this year our nation lost a great friend. David Mahoney's meteoric rise in the world of advertising and business is well-chronicled. But less known are the extraordinary contributions he made to the advancement of science--in particular, the vast field of research associated with the human brain. 
   After an astonishingly successful career at conglomerates such as Colgate-Palmolive and Norton Simon, David Mahoney spent the last ten years of his life devoted to the work of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives. This group has brought together the world's foremost neuroscientists who work tirelessly to discover the scientific breakthroughs that will one day provide us with the capability to prevent  and effectively treat such disorders as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, depression and Alzheimer's disease. 
   David Mahoney was an individual of remarkable accomplishment and dedication. Together with his family and enormous circle of friends, we shall miss him greatly. We are consoled in part to know that the work he did lives on. 
   The attached notice of David Mahoney's death appeared in the New York Times on Tuesday, May 2, 2000. Of particular interest is the moving tribute written by Dr. Max Cowan as published in the Dana Alliance newsletter. I ask that both articles be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Howell Raines, Editorial Page Editor of The New York Times has written a warm and wonderful tribute to Paul Coverdell, recalling his career in the Georgia State Senate in the 1970s. It is part of his life story that is not widely known here in Washington--certainly not by me--and helps to account for the great affection and respect in which he was held here in the United States Senate. 
   Withal this adds a touch to our mourning, we are much indeed indebted to Mr. Raines memoir. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the ``Editorial Notebook'' from this morning's New York Times be printed in full in the RECORD.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the courtesy of my friend from Vermont because I rise to support the views of my friend from Utah, who spoke so carefully about the matter of price controls. 
   Sir, I do not expect to have any considerable influence on what we do today. But I would like, in a very short order, to try to put what we are doing in a perspective. 
   This began, for me, during the period of the Finance Committee hearings on the health care legislation submitted to us by the administration in 1993. 
   At one hearing, a professor, Charles Fahey, of Fordham University, speaking for the Catholic Health Association, said: What we are witnessing in the country is the commodification of medicine. 
   And down the table, the head of the UCLA hospital said: Can I give you an example? In Southern California, we now have a spot market for bone marrow transplants. 
   This thought stayed with me, that market forces were beginning to shape decisions in health matters as they had not done before. 
   It was particularly poignant that the first institutions that would have trouble in this new situation would be the medical schools and the teaching hospitals, which, as economists say, are public goods. Everybody benefits from public goods so no one has an incentive to pay for it--and we are seeing this all over the country in a short 6 years. 
   Now, today, we are seeing another phenomenon of a market that comes into being as railroads did, as oil refineries did, oil producers, as has been going on through the history of free markets and free enterprise, which is price controls. There is something about our political systems in the West that responds to the creation of new markets and the seeming rise in prices in those markets--when, in fact, quality rises--that says perhaps we could control this by controlling the price. 
   It always fails, Mr. President. It is the one thing you can say with a large degree of confidence that in the 20th century this effort always fails. Sometimes it fails by producing black markets where the laws are not obeyed; others by simply depressing the quality of the products in the market. That is what we have to watch for here in the main. 
   We are dealing with thoroughly responsible organizations. The Pfizer Corporation, from my city of New York, began work in Brooklyn in 1849, developed the first treatment for parasitic worms in the mid-19th century when that was a rampant endemic disease. It has since gone on to do other extraordinary things. It was the first major producer of penicillin in the United States, which was a drug of such enormous consequence in the Second World War, the first time we were able to destroy one cell in a body without destroying others. 
   Today Pfizer has 12,000 researchers with a budget of $4.7 billion, larger than the budget of the National Science Foundation. I say, sir, impose price controls, which always seems like a good idea at the time, and in a short order there will be no such budget. A period of enormous innovation, very recent in the history of medicine, will come to a close. 
   I see my time has come to a close. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the paper I gave at the 42nd annual Cartwright Lecture as reprinted in ``Academic Medicine,'' the journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges.

   There are, sir, 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code. This amendment abolishes them all. It would not allow the alternative minimum tax to take away the benefits of marriage penalty relief either. Whereas we have before us as a basic amendment that which would only take care of one marriage penalty and touch two others, here is the opportunity to get rid of them all. 
   In our tax system, no matter how large or small, whatever we do, we must see that the American public believes the tax system is fair. If there is a considerable judgment anywhere that something is not fair, then it ought to be corrected. Our amendment will do that, sir. 
   Thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the proposal we make is somewhat without precedent as a tax measure. It can be described, sir, in one sentence: It says, with regard to the marriage penalty, married couples are free to file jointly or individually. They choose. The present regime, with persons having the sense of being treated unfairly, I hope disappears in this regard. The one thing about the Tax Code--whatever its size--it must not be seen to be unfair. There are people--and they are many--who think this present arrangement is unfair. We say: You choose; it is your choice. 
   Mr. President, for the second time in three months, the Senate is considering a marriage penalty relief bill that only partly addresses the marriage penalty. While Democrats strongly support marriage penalty relief, we cannot support the bill before us today because it fails to eliminate the marriage penalty. I will soon explain the specific objections to the GOP bill and the benefits and simplicity of the Democratic substitute amendment. First, I would like to frame the debate by explaining what a marriage penalty tax is and the history of the tax. 
   The ``marriage penalty'' is the additional tax paid by a husband and wife over and above what the couple would have paid in the aggregate if they were not married. Marriage penalties are more likely to occur where both spouses have roughly similar income, i.e., a division between 50/50 and 70/30. On the other hand, a marriage bonus can occur where one spouse receives substantially more income than the other, i.e., a disparity in earnings of 70/30 or greater, where the spouses together pay less tax in the aggregate than they would if not married. 
   For years, we have struggled to achieve the right balance in the taxation of single and married taxpayers. In 1948, to maintain parity between married couples in community property and separate property states, Congress created the joint tax return with rate brackets double the width of the rate brackets for single filers. Thus, a married worker with a non-earning spouse had a much lower tax liability than an equal-income single person. Not surprisingly, single taxpayers viewed this change as creating a singles penalty rather than a bonus for married couples, an effect magnified by the high marginal tax rates paid by upper-income taxpayers. By 1969, a single taxpayer with the same income as a married couple could expect to pay as much as 40 percent more in income tax. To address this inequity, a special rate structure was introduced for single taxpayers in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. The 1969 Act limited the tax liability of single taxpayers to no more than 20 percent above that of married couples with the same taxable income. 
   Now married couples have come to view the current structure as penalizing them, and we are therefore on the verge of changing the tax code once again in the never ending attempt to find balance. 
   Why do we repeatedly revisit this issue? Because of the inherent conflict in three fundamental tax policies: (a) the use of progressive tax rates, under which persons with higher incomes pay higher marginal tax rates, (b) neutrality among married taxpayers, where all married couples with the  same income face identical tax burdens, and (c) neutrality between marriage and remaining single, where the tax burden does not change due to marital status. Only two of the three conditions, in any combination, can be satisfied. 
   Which leads me to my objections to the bill before us today. First, many Democratic members believe the best thing we can do with on-budget surpluses is to pay down the federal debt. I think all Democratic members agree that if we are going to have tax cuts, however, we should consider them in a comprehensive fashion that allows us to balance priorities. Instead, this Congress is considering tax cuts in piecemeal fashion. Although the magnitude of any one individual proposal may not threaten our expected 10-year budget surplus, Congress has already passed--in one chamber or the other--$551 billion in tax cuts, including the marriage tax proposal now on the floor when considered on a normal 10 year basis. The 10-year price tag on these cuts, however, is not exhaustive. The cuts come with an additional cost. For every dollar that goes toward cutting taxes rather than paying down debt, there is a corresponding interest cost. For example, the interest cost associated with the $551 billion in tax cuts already passed is $127 billion. The country wants a responsible Congress that allocates the surplus to provide sufficient funds for reducing the national debt, bolstering Medicare and Social Security, and investing in other priority programs such as a prescription drug benefit. 
   Second, while several of the marriage penalty bill's provisions have merit as tax policy matters, the bill is not targeted at eliminating the marriage penalty. Instead, the standard deduction and bracket expansion proposals would increase the marriage bonus for millions of couples. The Department of Treasury estimates that only about 40 percent of the tax reduction would go to couples currently experiencing a marriage penalty. 
   I point out that a marriage bonus is equivalent to a singles penalty. The GOP bill increases the singles penalty because it increases the marriage bonus for people already receiving a bonus. Marriage bonuses cause undue and unfair burdens on singles, including widows and widowers 
   Third, the GOP bill does not comprehensively address the marriage penalty. Of the 65 known provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that have a marriage penalty effect, the Committee-passed bill eliminates only one and partially addresses only two more. If the committee bill is enacted, we will have made little progress in eliminating discrimination in the tax code based on marital status. 
   Finally, because the GOP bill does not completely exempt its marriage penalty relief benefits from the alternative minimum tax calculation, some 5 million taxpayers would immediately lose those benefits as a consequence of becoming newly subject to the AMT. 
   In March of this year, Democratic members of the Finance Committee proposed an alternative marriage penalty relief bill which was more comprehensive, more targeted, and more generous to those actually experiencing a 
   marriage penalty than the majority proposal. However, Committee Republicans rejected it, opting for a flawed proposal identical to the one they have passed. In the June 28, 2000 markup of the Budget Reconciliation Bill, Finance Committee Democrats offered another proposal that varies slightly from the March proposal. The new version caps the benefit with a phase out that begins at adjusted gross income of $100,000 and phases out completely at AGI of $150,000. 
   The Democrats' marriage penalty relief proposal is a comprehensive, targeted, and fiscally responsible approach. Democrats believe, first of all, that if we are going to address the marriage penalty, we must do it comprehensively. The Democratic alternative would give married couples the option of filing as single individuals or as a couple. When fully phased in by 2004, this approach would eliminate for eligible couples all 65 marriage penalty provisions in the tax code by allowing them to choose whichever filing status is more beneficial. Separate filing would address all aspects of the marriage penalty, including penalties associated with such divergent matters as the taxation of social security benefits, education tax incentives, and retirement savings. Moreover, this proposal would eliminate the penalty inherent in the earned income tax credit--the most severe marriage penalty in the tax code--which creates a substantial disincentive to marry for EITC beneficiaries. Finally, the benefits of this approach would also be available under the AMT. 
   Perhaps the most striking difference between this approach and the Republican plan is the targeting of benefits. The Democratic alternative would dedicate 100 percent of its benefits to fixing the marriage penalty problem and would not spend resources on expanding marriage bonuses. 
   Permitting married couples to file as if they were two single individuals is not a new concept. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow married couples to pay taxes on their separate incomes as if they were single. And in 1994, 19 of the 27 OECD countries provided one rate schedule whether taxpayers were married or single. Countries such as Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom treat each individual as a taxpaying unit. Thus, in those countries marriage has little effect on the couple's tax liability. 
   Optional separate filing is the correct approach. We urge the Senate to adopt the Democratic alternative. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to simplify the taxation of life insurance companies under the Internal Revenue Code. This bill repeals two sections of the Code that no longer serve valid tax policy goals, section 809 and section 815. 
   Section 809, which was enacted in 1984 as part of an overhaul of the taxation of life insurance companies, disallows a deduction for some of the dividends that mutual life insurance companies pay to their policyholders. It was enacted at a time when mutual life insurance companies were thought to be the dominant segment of the industry and was intended to ensure that stock life insurance companies were not competitively disadvantaged. Since that time, however, the number of mutual life insurance companies has dwindled while the number of stock life insurance companies has grown and the industry estimates that mutual life insurance companies will constitute less than ten percent of the industry within a few years. The section 809 tax has not been a significant component of the taxes paid by life insurance companies but it has been burdensome because of its unpredictable nature and complexity. Moreover, the original reason for its enactment no longer exists. Therefore, the bill would repeal section 809. 
   Section 815 was enacted in 1959 along with other changes to the taxation of life insurance companies. The 1959 changes permitted life insurance companies to defer tax on one-half of their underwriting income so long as such income was not distributed to their shareholders. The tax deferred income was accounted for through ``policyholder surplus accounts.'' In 1984, Congress revised the taxation of mutual and stock life insurance companies and as part of these revisions, stock life insurance companies were no longer permitted to defer tax on one half of their underwriting income or add to their policyholder surplus accounts. At the same time, Congress did not eliminate the existing policyholder surplus accounts or trigger tax on the accrued amounts but instead left them in place. Thus, the amounts in those accounts remain subject to tax only when a triggering event occurs (for example, direct or indirect distributions to shareholders). Since 1984, little revenue has been collected under this provision as companies avoid triggering events. The Administration recently has proposed taxing the amounts in the accounts, creating uncertainty for companies with these accounts. Finally, only life insurance companies that were in existence in 1984 even have these accounts. The bill would repeal this provision. 
   Elimination of these complicated and outmoded provisions will provide greater certainty to the taxation of these companies and allow them to restructure their businesses to compete in the developing global financial services marketplace. While this bill is only a modest attempt to simplify the taxation of one sector of our economy, it represents a first step towards overall simplification of our Internal Revenue Code.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as those who were present will recognize, Monsignor Peter Vaghi is a member of the Senate family. He served here some years ago as the assistant to our esteemed and beloved brother, PETE DOMENICI. He is now the pastor of old St. Patrick's, or St. Patrick's Church on 10th Street, in the city, which is the oldest denominational church in the Federal city. It was founded in 1794 to provide for the religious needs, in the main, of Irish construction workers building the White House and the Capitol. Then came the Italians who were recruited for Jefferson's Marine Band, which was the principal source of culture and enthusiasm in the city in those days. 
   When the British arrived with their horrendous purposes--corresponding exactly, I have to say, as a New Yorker, to the New York forces, which rode across Lake Ontario and burned the city of York, then their capital, what we now know as Toronto--in the manner of the military of those days, they responded. 
   There were a sufficient number of British troops in town for a period that they, too, went to St. Patrick's. It has been a long relationship with the Nation's Government, as well as the parish--in no sense to make an issue of the matter, but simply to record a certain amount of patience. Monsignor Vaghi is, of course, a Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic ministers are descendents of the one Roman Catholic Chaplain we have ever had in the Senate, Rev. Charles C. Pise, who served a year, as was the practice, from 1831 to 1832. 
   There descended on the Nation a spell of religious fanaticism--if you like that term, if you accept that term--which we associate with the ``know-nothings.'' When they were asked what they were doing about these matters, they would respond, ``I know nothing.'' And for a period of about 40 years--up to and including the Presidency, one regrets to say, of Ulysses S. Grant--the anti-Catholic forces in this country were quite alarmed and, if not ubiquitous, to be found in most places. 
   We have a curious debt to those people, which is the Washington Monument, as designed by Mills. It was to be the great obelisk, but it also was to be surrounded at the base with prancing stallions, such that we would never see the pristine statement that we now have. It was built with voluntary contributions by the Washington Monument Association. You can see them if you walk up; there are bas-reliefs inside saying who contributed. 
   In 1854, Pope Pius IX contributed a block of marble from the Temple of Concord in Rome, and a group of alert citizens learned that the installation of this block of marble was to be the signal for the Catholic uprising, and they broke into the stoneyard and dumped the block of marble somewhere in the Potomac. There was a measure of scandal, and the stump just stayed there indefinitely--until 1880. The Congress got nervous about the matter as the Centennial was coming, and the Corps of Engineers was dispatched to finish the job, which they did. 
   You can see a change in the color about a quarter of the way up. But also we were spared the prancing stallions, so there is some good that comes of all these things. 
   It is just such an honor to have the Monsignor with us. I speak as one of his parishioners. His family, Mr. and Mrs. Vaghi, are in the gallery today, as  is Father Murphy and another parishioner. We welcome them. Although we are formally not supposed to acknowledge that anybody is up there, I think no one will mind on this occasion. 
   It is very fortunate for us to have him today. We thank him. We will spare him the debate that now commences with my dear friend, Senator ROTH, one long day of the death tax. 
   With that I thank him, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a little background. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt sent a proposal to Congress to impose an estate tax. He justified the measure as follows. He said:  
   A heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune is in no way a tax upon thrift or industry as a like tax would be on a small fortune. No advantage comes either to the country as a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the transmission in their entirety of the enormous  fortunes which would be affected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would help preserve a measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood.  
   That is why we have an estate tax today. Congress had imposed such taxes in the 1800s, generally to fund wars, and indeed we had an income tax during the Civil War. When the need for such revenues eased, why these taxes, including the estate tax, were put aside. Theodore Roosevelt championed the enactment, on a number of times, of the measure that is in the code today. Over the years, the number of taxable estates, estate returns as a percentage of total deaths, has fluctuated, but not very much, from under 1 percent in 1935--which is the very depths of the depression of that decade--to a high of almost 8 percent in 1977, when we changed the tax to bring it back down. And the number of taxable estates today ranges between 1 percent and 2 percent, a level not that different from that of the depths of the depression. 
   If we make no changes to the tax rules in 2006, the percentage of taxable estates is projected to be lower than today because we raised the limit. The Joint Tax Committee projects that 1.82 percent of estates will be subject to tax. We are still within that very low historic level, that was run up after World War II, and which we brought back down in 1977. It is not a principal source of Federal revenue. I think it generated $24 billion in 1998, which was 1.4 percent of Federal revenues. Absent change, it might rise to $42 billion in 2008--not even a doubling in 10 years. 
   The bill before the Senate, H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act, would repeal the tax in the year 2010. It moves about during the next 10 years, but then it stops altogether, at which point we deal with a revenue loss of $50 billion a year. Mr. President, $50 billion, even in this momentary glow of surpluses, is a large amount of money. That is half a trillion dollars in a decade. It is much more than we should ever give away before we see whether the surplus we are projecting will actually occur, and indeed for the social reasons that Theodore Roosevelt spoke about at the beginning of the century. 
   The Federal Government is not the only government that would be impacted by the legislation that has been sent us from the House. The estate tax provides revenue for our State governments as well. Under our Federal estate tax laws, States may enact an estate tax without increasing taxes on decedents' estates or their heirs. This is because the Internal Revenue Code provides a dollar-for-dollar reduction in Federal estate tax liability for each dollar collected by the State, up to certain limits. Almost every State has enacted such legislation, and States collect about one-quarter of all estate taxes. The Treasury Department reports that in 1997, the States collected $4.3 billion in estate taxes while the Federal Government collected $16.6 billion. 
   Repeal of the estate tax would eliminate this source of revenue for State governments. They have not been consulted in the matter, but I cannot imagine they would be enthusiastic. 
   Finally, we on the Senate Democratic side are concerned about the adverse effect the repeal could have on charitable contributions. We cannot be sure of it, but the Joint Tax Committee estimates that estates are expected to contribute $330 billion to charities over the next 10 years, a third of a trillion dollars. 
   The question of how much of these contributions would continue or what portion would disappear if we abolish this tax altogether cannot be stated with any confidence, but it is the large estates that contributed the bulk of the $330 billion; $190 billion comes from estates with values over $10 million. We know this as we look around us at the great foundations, some of which date from earlier in the century but others of which reflect the accumulation of wealth in new economic activities in our age, and the estate tax surely has an influence. It should not be the principal concern for us, but it is a fact of our society. 
   Accordingly, we propose a modification of the existing program whilst retaining the essential legislative measure. We can describe it in two numbers: $2 million and $4 million. Under our amendment, no estate with assets under $2 million would be subject to estate tax. No estate with a family-owned business or farm valued at less than $4 million would be subject to estate tax. 
   There are very few farms that could be described with even a measure of exaggeration as a family farm worth more than $4 million. New York State is a farming State. It always has been. Ray Christensen, the Special Assistant with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, estimates that our farms sell in the range of about $257,000. I cannot imagine those in Pennsylvania, just over our border, would be very different. They are nowhere near $4 million. I cannot imagine there is such a place, save a nominal farm kept for recreational purposes on the eastern end of Long Island or in the Hudson Valley. 
   Our proposal would increase the general exemption, which is applicable to all estates, to $1 million immediately--it is $675,000 today--and to $2 million by the year 2009. This would eliminate two-thirds of the approximately 50,000 estates currently subject to tax. In addition, our proposal would increase the exemption for family farms and family-owned businesses from $1.3 million to $2 million immediately and to $4 million by 2009. Our increase would eliminate the estate tax on virtually all family farms and 75 percent of the family-owned businesses. 
   The measure is costly but not extravagantly so. It costs $65 billion over 10 years, compared to $105 billion under the House proposal, which we have before us. This bill, as I said earlier this week--and I repeat to my esteemed friend, our chairman--should have been referred to the Finance Committee. It was not. The Senate will learn to its cost one day that the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over these matters because we have some competence in them, and not for nothing, for example, did we bring about the 1977 measures--I was then a member of the committee--to 
   lower the estate tax which had commenced to reach almost 8 percent of estates, which is much higher than the historic average. We are back down to where we have been through the century. 
   I suggest, once again, that we ought to stay with a tax that has served us well. Nearly 100 years ago, Theodore Roosevelt urged adoption of a tax that would ``be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits.''

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with some potential embarrassment that I stand here and say I may be the only person in the Senate who lives on a farm and has done so for 36 years. It is a dairy farm, with cows in the pasture and in the barn. The neighbors are all dairy farmers--not all, but most. 
   Meaning no disrespect, if anyone presumes to think that the American Farm Bureau speaks for the farmers of Delaware County, they have not been in Delaware County. An insurance firm looks after a very small number of very well-to-do people. In New York State, according to Ray Christensen, who was the Delaware County Republican supervisor before he became assistant commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Markets, the average sale price of a farm is about $257,000. 
   Here--quite unexpected, but very welcome--in this morning's New York Times, the lead article of the business section talks about the Democratic estate tax plan. It cites Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a leading estate tax adviser to Midwestern farmers. He says that only a handful of working family farms have a net worth of $4 million.  
   Above that, with very few exceptions, you are talking about the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are not working farmers.  
   Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not calling lawmakers to demand that they take the President up on his promise--which the President has promised--to sign the Democratic bill. The article concludes:  
   Professor Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax expert, said that he had heard many horror stories about people having to sell farms to pay estate taxes. But in 35 years of conducting estate tax seminars for farmers, he added, ``I have pushed and pushed and hunted and probed and have not been able to find a single case where estate taxes caused the sale of a family farm; it is a myth.''  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would simply like to say that there is not a word in the remarks of my close friend from Utah with which I would disagree. I have now served 24 years on the Finance Committee, and the last 20 years has been a continued frustration in our disinclination and refusal to make the research and development credit permanent. 
   It is elemental that research projects go beyond 2, 4, or 20 years. It is elemental and in the interest of society that these projects should take place. We allow the credit to be taken but only in 2-year intervals, as it were, such that there will obviously be some decisions made that it is too risky and maybe they won't do it next time. We always renew it, but at a cost. There is an efficiency cost which is clear. 
   I, for one, will happily vote in support of the Senator's proposal.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would first like to respond to the minority leader and my friend from Montana. 
   I once served as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I managed major transportation legislation. 
   I can say to you that absent this revenue from the gasoline tax, which we imposed under President Eisenhower in 1956, and which built the Interstate Highway System and transformed American society, the transportation programs will just stop. There is no other revenue for it. It is a dedicated revenue. They are planned on. This would be the first time they have been interrupted. A whole industry would be interrupted, not to mention the urban and State planning that goes on; not to mention measures such as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which is hugely important to Virginia and to the District of Columbia. 
   Another point on the matter of the price of gasoline: Over the past two decades the price of a gallon of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by exactly a third--from $1.49 in 1981 to, in those dollars, $1 in June of this year. 
   We are not paying more for gasoline. We are paying less for it. 
   There can be an argument made that the price is too low, but not that we should lower it further and deprive ourselves of the essentials of the transportation infrastructure and construction in this Nation. 
   Our faithful friend, Dr. Podoff, brought along, as he feels he should, Marshall's Principles of Economics. 
   In Marshall's ``Principles of Economics,'' the great text at the end of the 19th century, Marshall taught Keynes, who has taught the world, made it very clear, that in situations of shortage such as we are temporarily facing--he was talking about fish, meat; he was not talking about gasoline--the price to the consumer will not be reduced. This is a proposition that drives from theory and is confirmed now by a century of observation in the aftermath of Marshall's principles. 
   Consumers will get nothing, transportation departments will get nothing, and the public will get a serious disruption in its basic transportation infrastructure, which is not simply highways, but all the other related modes of transit. This is what we have at issue here. I cannot imagine we will do other than continue a program we have had in place since 1956, a third of a century, with extraordinary results. To stop it now would be, in my view, irresponsible. 
   Based on what Marshall taught us, repealing the gasoline tax, even temporarily, represents a futile attempt to repeal the laws of supply and demand. This is a somewhat curious activity for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who often express a strong commitment for market economies both at home and abroad. 
   Let me add a few other facts about the market for gasoline and other fuel products--facts that are obvious even to those with no formal training in economics. 
   The increase in the price of a gallon of gas from an average of $1.15 in June 1999 to a peak of $1.71 in June 2000--a 56 cent increase--has nothing to do with a 4.3 cent per gallon tax increase, enacted in 1993, or the total federal tax on a gallon of gas of 18.3 cents, neither of which have increased over the past 12 months. 
   The price of a gallon of gas peaked at about $1.71 in mid-June and has already declined by about 8 cents. The change in the prices has nothing to do with tax policy and is mostly related to OPEC's production decisions. 
   In September, 1993, the month before the 4.3 cent tax increase went into effect, the price of a gallon of gasoline was $1.15. Three months later, after the tax increase, the price was $1.14. 
   In 1996, the cost of gasoline increased rapidly from $1.19 in January to $1.39 in May--following roughly the same pattern that we are now observing. The Senate debated repeal of the 4.3 cent tax, but fortunately took no action as two attempts at cloture failed. By January, 1998 the price of a gallon of gasoline was back to $1.19--and in real terms had actually declined a few pennies. 
   And, as I noted earlier, over almost two decades, the price of a gallon of gasoline in constant (inflation adjusted) dollars has fallen by about a third, from $1.49 in 1981 to about $1.00 in June of this year. The reduction in gasoline prices occurred even as the economy expanded almost continuously--92 months in the 1980s and a record setting 112 months in the current expansion, which shows no signs of ending. Over the past two decades the economy, in real terms, has almost doubled, while the unemployment rate has been cut by half. 
   True, over the past two decades the price of fuel products has fluctuated, often somewhat unpredictably. For example, in 1986 the price of a gallon of gasoline decreased by 36 cents from the beginning to the end of the year. The next year the price increased by 11 cents. While economists often cannot predict, or even explain, energy price volatility, they can tell us the effect, in the short-run, of reducing fuel taxes. The price to the consumer will not be reduced. This is something we know; or it can be said as much as things like this are knowable. For a century, it has been the clearest understanding of the economics profession that under short-run supply conditions, a change, such as a reduction in an excise tax, does not affect the price paid by the 
   consumer. 
   During a similar debate on gas tax repeal in May of 1996, I also referred to the theories of Marshall and attempted to summarize his wisdom. Here is what I said then: 
   Marshall took the example--to illustrate short-term supply, a fascinating thing--he took the example of fish. He said, what happens if there is a sudden change in the situation? Weather makes fish more or less available--a nice point--or if there is an increased demand for fish caused by the scarcity of meat during the year or two following a cattle plague. Mad cow disease in the late 19th century. A scarcity of fish caused by uncertainties of the weather ........These things come. Would outside intervention change the price of fish to the consumer in that circumstance, when there was a fixed supply? The answer from Alfred Marshall is emphatically ``no.'' Students of economics my age will remember this book. It is a very heavy book, but it is still around and it works. What it propounded is very clear. 
   And now let me state the conclusion as simply as possible. Market values are determined by the relationship between supply and demand. 
   This is something businessmen know. In 1996, Mr. Mike Bowlin, Chairman of ARCO, had this to say about the matter when he appeared on ABC's ``Nightline'':  
   My concern is that there are other market forces that clearly will overwhelm the relatively small decrease in the price of gasoline, and that alarms me, that people's expectations will be that the minute the tax is removed, they want to see gasoline prices go down ......and that won't happen.  
   At about the same time--May 1996--I noted, on the Floor of the Senate, the comments of Dr. Philip Verleger, a well-known energy economist. The author of several books on the subject, including Adjusting to Volatile Energy Prices, Dr. Verleger was, at that time, quoted in The Washington Post:  
   The Republican-sponsored solution to the current fuels problem.......is nothing more and nothing less than a refiner's benefit bill....... It will transfer upwards of $3 billion from the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and gasoline marketers.  
   In March of this year, when the Senate was considering a change in gas tax  policy, I wrote the following to Dr. Verleger:  
   I assume that since the economics of a gas tax reduction has not changed--something we have known since at least Alfred Marshall--neither have your views.  
   He replied the very same day:  
   In my view, the US petroleum industry is operating at or close to capacity. Thus refiners will be unable to boost gasoline production if the tax [repeal] becomes law. Further, inventories of gasoline are currently very low due to the destabilizing actions taken by OPEC. This means that the supply of gasoline has been essentially determined--totally inelastic in technical terms--through the summer. Under these circumstances, consumers are not likely to see any benefit from suspension or repeal of the gasoline tax.  
   Dr. Krugman said much the same thing in a March 15, 2000, New York Times op-ed. For Professor Krugman there simply is no getting around the fact that we face a supply problem:  
   Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the price of gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy more gas. But there isn't any more gas, so the price at the pump, inclusive of the lowered tax, would quickly be bid right back up to the pre-tax-cut level. And that means that any cut in taxes would show up not in a lower price at the pump, but in a higher price paid to distributors [emphasis added]. In other words, the benefits of the tax cut would flow not to consumers but to other parties, mainly the domestic oil refining industry. (As the textbooks will tell you, reducing the tax on an inelastically supplied good benefits the sellers, not the buyers.)  
   It is worth repeating Krugman's conclusion--``benefits of the tax cut would flow not to the consumers but to other parties, mainly the domestic oil refining industry.'' 
   We here in Congress know this too, and I suspect that is why the legislation we have before us contains a ``Sense of the Congress'' section that ``consumers immediately receive the benefit of the reduction in taxes.'' We surely want the consumer to realize some savings, but doubt that they will. The question for this body is whether we should approve legislation that contains what amounts to a concession of failure within its very text. Discouraging. 
   Finally, I would point out to my colleagues that the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century was signed into law less than two years ago. TEA-21 as it is known, is a six-year Federal surface transportation bill that consumed nearly two years of committee action and Floor debate. In the end, the bill passed 88-5 based on the agreement that Federal motor fuel excise taxes would be collected at least through Fiscal Year 2003--the last year of TEA-21's authorization. During the debate on TEA-21, the Senate was afforded the opportunity to repeal 4.3 cents per gallon of the Federal motor fuel excise taxes. By an 80-18 vote, we rejected repeal and instead opted to invest that revenue in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
   Just this past April, the Senate went on record again to reject any type of suspension of the motor fuel excise tax by a 56-43 vote on the Majority Leader's bill S. 2285, which would have called for a fuel tax holiday of the 4.3 cents for a six month period. 
   According to figures from the Federal Department of Transportation, if the entire 18.3 cents gas tax were to be suspended for six months, the Federal-aid Highway program could lose an estimated $9.6 billion in fuel tax revenues. 
   Mr. President, suspending the Federal taxes on motor fuels will do little or nothing to lower fuel costs. But it will cause considerable disruption to our Federal transportation program, even with a ``hold harmless'' provision. We ought not set precedents of this kind. They will come back to haunt us another day. 
   I would caution my colleagues to exercise caution when they propose to undo agreements made by such overwhelming majorities. 
   Mr. President, suspending portions of the Federal excise taxes on motor fuels will do little or nothing to lower fuel costs. To my mind, that is reason enough to reject this measure. 
   OPEC's decision last year to restrict supply was the primary reason fuel costs increased. OPEC's future production decisions will be the primary reason gas prices go up or down in the future.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I make the point that the provision that the Senator from Nebraska is offering is part of S. 21, a bill that we introduced in the first session of the 106th Congress almost 2 years ago. It was a bill to reduce Social Security payroll taxes, provide KidSave, and provide for those who wish to take the option, a 2-percent thrift savings plan equivalent throughout their working years to provide wealth. 
   The Senator has a powerful idea. We have provided security in the course of a long century, beginning with workman's compensation, widows' pension, and then Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. But we have never been able to provide a great portion of our population, that which distinguishes this Nation, with a measure of wealth, an estate. Not an estate which would be much affected by the underlying bill we are talking about today. Not many $4 million estates would be acquired in the process, but there would be a measure of wealth. 
   It would be the first American initiative in the area of social welfare. This starts right here in this Chamber, S. 21. The first 20 numbers are reserved for the majority and minority leaders; the first bill otherwise in this Senate is this provision. We have not got to it in committee, but we have a part here on the floor. I welcome it.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I simply point out that this amendment would move us backward in our efforts to produce a stable and continuous Social Security and Medicare systems. 
   In 1993, I was chairman of the Finance Committee. We expanded provisions with respect to the normal taxation of benefits received from Social Security, just as all other pension benefits, are taxed, which is to say, taxes on that part which is not taxed as employee income at the time the contribution is made. This obviously only affects persons with substantial income who are subject to the income tax. I think a quarter of Social Security recipients will pay no tax of any kind, they having low incomes generally and are below the income tax thresholds. 
   We did this as part of a general program to secure the Social Security system for the next 75 years. We have not completed this work. We have to adjust the Consumer Price Index. We have to bring in State and local employees, almost a quarter of whom pay no Social Security tax on their regular job but pick up Social Security on the side and get a much higher return than the persons who pay through their regular employee. 
   The exemption for State and local employees is an anachronism that we inherited from 1935 when it was not clear that the Federal Government could tax a State government, and the issue was just not joined. It is now clear. Most State governments do it; some do not. 
   There are another few corrections that could be made. And then we have an actuarially sound program for 75 years. To go back now on this one step we have made is to go back to a prospect that in 15 years' time the Social Security system will not be bringing in the amount of revenues it needs to pay benefits and we will start drawing out of general revenues, and very quickly the insurance system will cease to be that, it will be a transfer of payments subject to all of the difficulties we have seen with such payments. And we will do the same to the solvency of Medicare as this change would accelerate the date of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from 2025 to 2020. 
   I remind the distinguished Presiding Officer that the one change we have seriously made in the Social Security system in this decade is to abolish the provision for children, title IV-A, which was a direct transfer. 
   I hope we do not accept this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I repeat, sir, that the 1993 measure was part of a long-range effort to restore actuarial balance to the Social Security and Medicare systems. It treats Social Security income, retirement income, as all other retirement income is treated. That part for which taxes have been paid is exempted. The rest is taxed normally for others. Low-income beneficiaries of Social Security would pay no tax. This money goes into the Medicare trust fund and is part of the long-term solvency we seek. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as a New Yorker--and I am sure my esteemed chairman will understand--I rise in defense of Theodore Roosevelt's estate tax: One of the great achievements at the beginning of this century and of the last century--although we have members of the Finance Committee staff who still think we are in the last century, but we won't get into that matter. Today, we are here to decide if a century later we should repeal it. 
   Again, I don't want to press this on my colleague and friend, the Senator from Delaware, but this matter should be in the Finance Committee. My friend doesn't have to say a word. We are the Committee that considers tax matters. It should have been referred to us and not sent directly to the floor. 
   When we begin the debate and the voting begins, the Democrats will have an alternative. It is simple. I say forthwith and I will say no more, it is less costly than the measure we have received from the House. We would increase the general exemption from the present $675,000 to $1 million immediately--it was scheduled to rise to that level in the year 2006--and then to $2 million in the year 2009. We would increase the exemption for family-owned businesses and farms from $1.3 million to $2 million immediately and to $4 million by the year 2009. This increase would eliminate the estate tax on virtually all family farms and 75 percent of family-owned businesses that would otherwise be subject to the estate tax. This measure will cost $64 billion over 10 years, roughly half the cost of the Republican proposal. 
   Of course, the measure the House has sent us, as our Chairman has stated, in the year 2010 repeals all estate taxes, and thereafter the true cost would be approximately $50 billion each year indefinitely. 
   We think this is an extravagant proposal driven by the legitimate politics of the hour. I understand that. I understand the President will veto the measure. I look forward confidently to its being passed and vetoed and not forgotten. It will be raised in the campaign. That, too, is legitimate. 
   But I have to say, sir, having lived on a farm for 36 years in upstate New York, the dairy farming world of that State has not prospered for half a century. We have a considerable number of meadows, in one of which the press gathered just a year ago last week to have Mrs. Clinton announce her candidacy for the seat I have the honor to hold right now. There were hundreds of journalists there. It amazed the world to look at it. 
   Sir, I have to suggest that if we had an equal gathering of family farmers in New York State whose farms would sell for $2 million, the turnout would be desultory and the press would report disaster. Does anybody here know a family farmer whose farm is worth $2 million a year? I don't mean farms in the eastern end of Long Island where viniculture takes place.

   With that, sir, the vote being announced 4 minutes late, I yield the floor and suggest we proceed under the order.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to express great appreciation for the confirmation of Russell John Qualliotine to be United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York. Hailing from Nesconset, New York, he served more than a quarter century with the New York City Police Department, retiring this past January. As an Officer of the NYPD, he held the position of Detective First Grade in the elite Personal Security Section of the Intelligence Division. The NYPD has given him four outstanding achievement awards, three awards for excellent police work, and one for meritorious service. From 1969 to 1972, he also served in the United States Army and earned an Army Commendation Medal. 
   In his roles as police detective and soldier, Mr Qualliotine has displayed exemplary dedication, character, and professionalism. He is superbly qualified, and I am confident he will make an excellent United States Marshal.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a joint resolution, recognizing Commodore John Barry as the first flag officer of the United States Navy. Commodore Barry had been described as the ``Father of the American Navy'' by his contemporaries for his unfailing service to the United States Navy. The Commodore, born in Tacumshin Parish in County Wexford, Ireland and son to a poor Irish farmer, began his maritime career at an early age. He rose through the ranks and, at the outset of the American Revolution, was made responsible for outfitting the first Continental Navy ships. On March 14, 1776, the Marine Committee awarded Barry with a Captain's commission to the Continental Navy and his first warship, the brig Lexington. In his first conflict at sea with this ship, the Commodore brought the fledgling Navy its first victory at sea and captured the Edward, a British tender. Barry reported to the Congress, ``This victory had a tremendous psychological effect in boosting American morale, as it was the first capture of a British warship by a regularly commissioned American cruiser.'' 
   While awaiting the completion of his second warship, the Effingham, Barry enlisted as a soldier in the Continental Army and served under General John Cadwalader, fighting in the Battles of Trenton and of Princeton. But it was not until his return to the Navy that the Commodore fought his most famed battle. Aboard the 36-gun frigate Alliance, Barry put up a brilliant defense against two British sloops, the Atlanta and the Tresspassy. In his crusade, he was badly wounded in his shoulder and lost a large volume of blood. His second-in-command reported that the ship was in a desperate condition and recommended that the ship surrender. But the Commodore refused. He said, ``If this ship cannot be fought without me, I will be brought on deck!'' Broken and bandaged, Commodore Barry continued forward with the battle. After almost four hours, the Atlanta and the Tresspassy surrendered. 
   The Commodore's final battle in the American Revolution was also the final sea battle of the Continental Navy. Aboard the Alliance, Barry escorted the Duc De Sauzon, a ship carrying Spanish silver, and warded off the Royal Navy's Sybil, protecting the vital cargo destined for the Continental Congress. Even after his retirement from battle, Barry's contributions to the Navy continued. In 1797, President Washington invited Barry to receive Commission Number One in the Navy. His new position placed him in charge of the new Navy and oversight of the construction and outfitting of its first frigates. The U.S.S. United States and the U.S.S. Constitution were both built under his command. 
   Commodore John Barry served as Commodore under Presidents Washington, Adams and Jefferson until he died in 1803. 
   Before he died, the Commodore wrote a Signal Book for the Navy, which provided a practical means of communication between ships. He also suggested creating the Department of the Navy, a separate Cabinet position from the Secretary of War. This vision was realized in 1798 with the creation of the United States Department of the Navy. Most importantly, Barry was responsible for training many Naval heros of the War of 1812. 
   It is with great honor and pride that I introduce this joint resolution, recognizing Commodore John Barry, a fellow Irishman and Naval Officer, as the first flag officer of the United States Navy.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the New-York Historical Society mentioned in the Committee Report to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. The Society is a wonderful New York institution that has outstanding collections and runs outstanding educational programs. One such program would soon bring to the general public one of the nation's most extensive collections of Revolutionary War materials; documents, manuscripts, artifacts, and works of art. Tied to the collection will be a program that will tie in with social studies and history classes across the nation. 
   The key components of this effort are digitization of primary documents and museum objects to make them available on the World Wide Web and workshops for teachers to be held at the Historical Society to show creative approaches to interpreting history using documents and artifacts. Video conferencing will make teacher workshops available around the country as well. 
   Published school curricula and resources kits based on the Society's Revolutionary collections will be available to teachers as well. There will also be an interactive web site for teachers and students, a linkage of the Society's library and museum collection databases, providing one unified source of information on the collections. The Society also hopes to develop a 30 minute interactive video in English and Spanish available in the Society headquarters and on the web. Finally, hand held scanners will give visitors instant electronic access to information about the collections as they are viewed and access to related websites. 
   Mr. President, the Historical Society has wonderful plans for its future. I hope we are able to assist with what is truly a project of national scope when we finalize this bill during the coming months.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, while I support the objectives of this legislation, I regret that the Senate has chosen to rush ahead with a vote on this matter without following the customary Senate procedure. This bill should have been referred to its committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Finance, and that committee ought to have had the opportunity to consider all its implications. 
   In fact, Chairman ROTH and I agreed to schedule a hearing on this matter for July 12. We contacted election and tax law experts to ask their opinions regarding fundamental questions surrounding Section 527 organizations. 
   As we thought, there are constitutional questions, and the possibility of unintended consequences that might result from this or similar legislation. The careful examination that Senator ROTH and I had planned is going to be cut short by our actions today. Without that careful examination, we can only hope that our conduct will withstand judicial scrutiny and not create additional problems.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in opposition to two key provisions which should not have been included in this appropriations bill. I commend my colleagues, particularly Chairman STEVENS and Chairman ROTH, for reaching an understanding that the funds taken by these provisions will be entirely restored in the conference report on the Labor/HHS appropriations bill. 
   The first provision relates to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) we created in 1997. Put simply, it will prevent uninsured, low-income children from receiving health care services they need and may even jeopardize the future of this critically  important children's health program. Enrollment in SCHIP has been increasing--doubling from just under 1 million to 2 million children between 1998 and 1999. But the SCHIP funding cut included in the Labor-HHS bill will undermine this progress and discourage State efforts to increase enrollment. If the precedent is set for using these funds as offsets, States could not rely on the future availability of their SCHIP allotments. 
   The second provision is a massive unwarranted cut in funds for the Social Services Block Grant, from $1.7 billion to $600 million. SSBG is a most flexible source of social services funding. The States and local communities decide, within broad parameters, which needs to address. Among many things, SSBG supports: 
   Help for the home-bound elderly; 
   Assistance for adoptive families; 
   Elder abuse prevention; and 
   Foster care for abused children. 
   In my own State of New York, we use most of our SSBG funds to provide child protective services and for day care. There is no reason to, in the words of the President, ``bankrupt'' SSBG. 
   I recognize that the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee faced very difficult decisions in light of the unreasonably low allocation it received. These problems were created by the FY 2001 Budget Resolution which underfunded this and other appropriations measures while providing for a large tax cut. This tax cut, if merited, should not be paid for by limiting insurance coverage for low-income children and reducing help to the aged and disabled. 
   With the Congressional Budget Office expected to increase its estimate of the on-budget surplus, there is no good reason for these two provisions.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today on the East Front of the Capitol ground is being broken for the new Capitol Visitor Center, a project that will take at least five years and hundreds of millions of dollars to complete. Nearly a century ago, in March 1901, the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia embarked on another project. The Committee was directed by Senate Resolution 139 to ``report to the Senate plans for the development and improvement of the entire park system of the District of Columbia.*.*.*. (F)or the purpose of preparing such plans the committee *.*.* may secure the services of such experts as may be necessary for a proper consideration of the subject.'' 
   And secure ``such experts'' the committee did. The Committee formed what came to be known as the McMillan Commission, named for committee chairman, Senator James McMillan of Michigan. The Commission's membership was a ``who's who'' of late 19th and early 20th-century architecture, landscape design, and art: Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., Charles F. McKim, and Augustus St. Gaudens. The commission traveled that summer to Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, and London, studying the landscapes, architecture, and public spaces of the grandest cities in the world. The McMillan Commission returned and, building on the plan of French Engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant, fashioned the city of Washington as we now know it. 
   We are particularly indebted today for the commission's preservation of the Mall. When the members left for Europe, the Congress had just given the Pennsylvania Railroad a 400-foot wide swath of the Mall for a new station and trackage. It is hard to imagine our city without the uninterrupted stretch of greenery from the Capitol to the Washington Monument, but such would have been the result. Fortunately, when in London, Daniel Burnham was able to convince Pennsylvania Railroad president Cassatt that a site on Massachusetts Avenue would provide a much grander entrance to the city. President Cassatt assented and Daniel Burnham gave us Union Station. 
   But the focus of the Commission's work was the District's park system. The Commission noted in its report:  
   Aside from the pleasure and the positive benefits to health that the people derive from public parks, in a capital city like Washington there is a distinct use of public spaces as the indispensable means of giving  dignity to Government buildings and of making suitable connections between the great departments . . . (V)istas and axes; sites for monuments and museums; parks and pleasure gardens; fountains and canals; in a word all that goes to make a city a magnificent and consistent work of art were regarded as essential in the plans made by L'Enfant under the direction of the first President and his Secretary of State. 
   Washington and Jefferson might be disappointed at the affliction now imposed on much of the Capitol Grounds by the automobile.  
   At the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue is a scar of angle-parked cars, in parking spaces made available temporarily during construction of the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building. Once completed, spaces in the building's garage would be made available to Senate employees and Pennsylvania Avenue would be restored. Not so. Despite the ready and convenient availability of the city's Metrorail system, an extraordinary number of Capitol Hill employees drive to work. The demand for spaces has simply risen to meet the available supply, and the unit block of the Nation's main street remains a disaster. 
   During the 103rd Congress and thereafter I proposed the ``Arc of Park,'' legislation that would almost completely eliminate surface parking. Under my proposal the Architect of the Capitol would be instructed to eliminate the unsightly lots, and reconstruct them as public parks, landscaped in the fashion of the Capitol Grounds. A key element of my proposal was that--to the extent we continue to offer it--parking must be put underground. I rise today to emphasize the need for us to remain focused--as we break ground for the Visitor's Center--on a project currently being designed: an underground parking structure. 
   One year ago the Architect of the Capitol received approval from Chairman MCCONNELL of the Rules Committee to proceed with preliminary design for an underground garage to be located on Square 724, which is just North of the Dirksen and Hart buildings. Upon completion it will replace the existing lot of surpassing ugliness. By getting cars off the streets and underground it will bring us nearer to the pedestrian walkways and parks McMillan--and before him L'Enfant--envisioned. 
   The final garage will include three levels with capacity for 1210 parking spaces. The 1981 report on the Master Plan identified Square 724 as the site for a future Senate office building. Thus the garage will be designed and constructed to accommodate an eight story office building on top of it, should the need for such building ever arise. The current plan, however, would be to top the garage with a simply landscaped plaza. Upon approving advancement with the design of the new structure, Chairman MCCONNELL stated that, ``Square 724 appears to offer the most cost-effective opportunity for phased growth of Senate garage parking within the Capitol Complex.'' I understand that this time next year, after I have left this Body, the Architect of the Capitol will ask Congress to appropriate the funds needed to actually build Phase I of the garage, which will accommodate 500 cars. And then funding will be crucial--with the Russell garage in dire need of renovation and the Capitol Visitor Center expected to displace some parking. I urge you to support the Architect in his request. 
   Today, as we break ground on a new project, one that will nearly double the size of the Capitol, let us not forget the grand vision of the McMillan Commission from a century ago. Washington is the capital of the most powerful nation on earth, and deserves to look it.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, joined by my colleagues Senators KERRY, ROCKEFELLER, SNOWE, ALLARD, BAUCUS, BREAUX, BROWNBACK, BRYAN, BUNNING, BURNS, DASCHLE, DURBIN, ENZI, HOLLINGS, HUTCHINSON, JOHNSON, KENNEDY, KERREY, LANDRIEU, LINCOLN, MIKULSKI, REID, ROBB, ROBERTS, SCHUMER, and THURMOND, I am introducing the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. This legislation provides a tax incentive to stimulate rapid deployment of high-speed communication services to residential, rural, and low-income areas. 
   A term of art often used for high-speed communication service is ``broadband.'' The term is a remnant from the era of analog systems. It refers to the size of spectral bandwidth over which signals can be transmitted. Even though it is not essential to have wide spectra in the digital world to transmit vast amounts of data, ``broadband'' remains in our digital society's lexicon for high-speed communication or throughput. 
   In common use, broadband connotes fast Internet access, and that is certainly part of the goal of this legislation. The grander goal, however, extends beyond simply expediting traditional Internet use. It is to deliver, in the near future, a wide array of voice, video, and data communication services, at extremely fast speeds, to all Americans. 
   The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 provides graduated tax credits for deployment of high-speed communications to residential and rural communities. It gives a 10-percent credit for the deployment of at least 1.5 million bits per second downstream and 200,000 bits per second upstream to all subscribers--residential, business, and institutions--in rural and low income areas. This is essentially ``current generation'' broadband. The bill gives a 20-percent credit for the deployment of at least 22 million bits per second downstream and 10 million bits per second upstream to all subscribers in rural and low income areas, and to all residential customers in other areas. This is what we are calling ``next generation'' broadband. 
   The bill does not dictate the technological means by which these broadband services are to be delivered. Today, the possibilities include telephone lines, cable modems, fiber optics, terrestrial wireless, and satellite wireless. In the future there may be others. Whether high-speed communications are delivered by electrons or by photons, with wires or without wires, by copper or by glass, by terrestrial or by extraterrestrial means, is immaterial. With a temporary tax credit, it is economically feasible to push national communication capabilities forward by ten or perhaps twenty years. The bill permits a variety of technological approaches to make under-served areas more economically attractive to broadband providers. Yesterday we had electronics. Today we have photonics. Tomorrow we will have some ``future-onics.'' 
   Mr. President, as I stand before you today, the streets of Washington, D.C. and of many other major cities in this country are being torn-up to lay cables for high-speed communication. Line-of-sight communication ``dishes'' are being installed on office buildings permitting business-to-business voice, video, and data transmissions. The problem is, market forces are driving deployment of high-speed communication capabilities almost exclusively to urban businesses and wealthy households. Low-income families, exurban communities, rural businesses, and rural families are relegated to the back of the queue. The bill gives private industry economic incentives to accelerate high-speed communication capabilities to Americans who are at the end-of-the-line. 
   Why is this important? Let me offer examples of this technology's power and importance. I start with two historical cases. 
   During the 1950's the National Institute of Mental Health funded a 1,278-  mile closed-circuit telephone system between seven state hospitals in Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Health care providers at the hospitals held weekly teleconferencing lectures via this system. By 1961, the system included both audio and video, and psychiatrists successfully used it to care for patients under a program called ``telepsychiatry.'' 
   At about the same time, radiologists in Montreal had a coaxial cable laid between two hospitals three miles apart, thus connecting them for audio and video communications. Doctors were regularly transmitting radiographic images to each other to consult on difficult cases and to conduct educational conferences. 
   As a result of these two projects, patients were treated by physicians who were, in some cases, hundreds of miles away. The medical profession was able to share information and ideas, which improved healthcare in this country and Canada. 
   Unfortunately, such ``telemedicine'' links are very few, even though our ability to transmit data has increased. Why? Because there is no nationwide high-speed data-transfer infrastructure. Instead, the standard business Internet speed in rural areas is 56,000 bits per second. What can be done at that speed? Printed matter can be sent and received reasonably quickly. But photographs or graphics, require long waits, and then often with poor image quality. More advanced uses, such as video conferencing, are out of the question. At faster Internet speeds of, say, 200,000 to 300,000 bits per second, information can be sent much faster. Photographs and graphics leap to the screen, instead of crawling. Video conferencing also is possible, although jittery images and low image resolution make it impractical. Music and movies can be downloaded slowly to a compact disk. 
   At higher data transfer speeds--about 1.5 million bits per second--the amount and quality of information that can be transmitted becomes quite good. Very good video conferencing is possible. Two or more people in different places can see and talk to each other as if in the same room, at a crisp image resolution and without image jitter. 
   And at even higher speeds, extraordinarily rich images of movement, color, and detail can be transmitted as if one were looking at them in person. Complex medical images can be sent and received. At twenty million bits per second, a digitized mammography image can be transmitted in about fifteen seconds, and a standard chest x-ray in about four seconds. 
   Twenty million bits per second is about 360 times faster than the fastest speeds available on a conventional modem attached to a Plain Old Telephone Service, or, as I am told, POTS. Is it really possible to do this? Indeed, it is. The technology exists now. Over ordinary copper wire, some of our communication companies are now offering data speeds of 26 million bits per second. 
   Imagine the tremendous personal and economic benefits our nation will reap with universal high-speed communication access, including telemedicine; telecommuting; distance learning at all education levels; electronic commerce in low-income and rural communities; digital photography; and entertainment video. As a result, we will enjoy greater educational opportunities, greater geographic freedom, increased wealth in low-income areas, and even decreased urban congestion. 
   So if the benefits are so great and the capability exists, why are these technologies not widely available? Simple economics. It is much more lucrative to provide services to business customers. Although a few affluent individuals in urban areas have high speed Internet access, the great majority of Americans are limited to extremely slow communication or to none at all. 
   That is why it is appropriate for government to step in at this time and provide an incentive to stimulate deployment of high-speed communication service to residential areas and small businesses, especially in rural and low-income areas of the country. Our country has a proud history of supporting critical services in rural and under-served communities. 
   Three major examples are utilities, interstate highways, and the airline industries. 
   The Rural Utilities Service is a federal credit agency within the Department of Agriculture that helps rural areas finance electric, telecommunications, water, and waste water projects. Its lending creates public-private partnerships to finance the construction of infrastructure in rural areas. Working in partnership with rural telephone cooperatives and companies, the Department of Agriculture helped boost the number of rural Americans with telephone service from 38 percent in 1950 to more than 95 percent in 1999. 
   The federal government funded 90 to 100 percent of the cost of building the interstate highway system. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 initiated a nationwide program that aimed to be completed within 20 years. The bulk of the program was completed within this time period, although full implementation was not achieved until the early 1990s. 
   In the 1930s, the airline industry--much like today's Internet start-ups--was operating at a loss. Believing airline service to be both unique and necessary, the federal government stepped-in with an airmail subsidy in 1938, and this federal funding made the industry instantly profitable. The airline industry then flourished, and the subsidy was removed in the mid 1950s. 
   In a 1979 speech titled, ``Technology and Human Freedom,'' I stated, ``I believe that government can and should seek to advance technology--as a condition of social progress.'' I still believe that. In 1979, I went on to say, ``In my view, only a person of what St. Augustine would have termed `indomitable ignorance' could deny that technology has greatly enhanced human freedom. . . . Freedom is choice, and technology vastly enhances choice. . . . The relation between technology and democracy is intimate. . . . Experimentation, variety, optimism: these are the ingredients of both technology and democracy.'' 
   In 1978, the late Mancur Olson, an esteemed economist, cautioned that the very liberty of societies such as ours may be the source of developments that make innovation considerably more difficult. We should guard against the prospect of our government retarding technology as Professor Olson hypothesized. The bill I introduce today encourages technology, and extends its range to those residential and business areas it otherwise would not reach until much later. 
   We need this legislation now to maintain our technological leadership. As the press has recently reported, Sweden, Japan, Singapore, and Canada are deploying broadband at levels higher than those called for in this bill. We cannot afford to fall behind in this critical area. History indicates that, if we do not act aggressively, it will take a very long time to deploy broadband services on a widespread basis. The first regular, sustained commercial telephone services were offered in 1876, but it took more than 90 years to make the service available to 90 percent of residences in the United States. It would be deplorable if it takes even half as long to bring existing broadband technology to the same number of Americans. 
   If the Internet is the information superhighway, broadband communication is the information super sonic transport. I want to encourage the communications industry to accelerate deployment of the this super sonic transport to every community in the country. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for their support and collaboration on this bill. Senator JOHN KERRY and his staff have been involved in every aspect of this legislation, and we could not have formulated the bill without their detailed knowledge of the communications industry. And Senators ROCKEFELLER and SNOWE recently introduced a similar bill focusing on the deployment of broadband in rural areas, and the legislation we introduce today incorporates and expands upon their work. 
   This bill is meant to be a proposal. As we consider this measure, Congress may decide to modify it. Moreover, we have not yet received a revenue estimate on the bill, and if it proves to be too expensive, we will have to scale it back. It is time, however, to focus on this issue. Let us begin the discussion of how we can provide the stimulus necessary to ensure the availability of high-speed communication to every  American. I urge the Senate to support this important legislation.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a farmer, Army captain, Senator, and President of the United States who founded the United Nations, launched the Marshall plan, and forged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. As an original cosponsor of the bill to name the Federal building located at 2201 C Street, Northwest, in the District of Columbia, currently headquarters for the Department of State, as the ``Harry S Truman Federal Building.'' I am pleased that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and in both Houses have unanimously agreed to adopt this measure. 
   Fifty-five years ago, President Truman challenged Democrats and Republicans in his Four Point Speech to join together and lend their full support to international organizations; continue programs for world economic recovery; join with other free peoples in the defense of democracy; and draw on our country's vast storehouse of technical expertise to help people overseas help themselves in the fight against ignorance, illness, and despair. President Truman envisioned ``that what happens beyond our shores determines how we live in our own lives,'' and the American people agreed. He exemplified the very best of what we need in our elected officials. 
   The United States is extremely fortunate to have had such a man be its Chief Executive in a time of two wars, where he presided over the fall of Germany, the ultimate surrender of Japan, and the preservation of South Korea. It is only appropriate for us to honor a man who made the United States a major force in world affairs by working with all the world for freedom and democracy. I look forward to seeing this legislation adopted, and giving President Truman the recognition he deserves for his tireless efforts to bring peace.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to express great appreciation for the confirmation of Nicholas G. Garaufis to be United States District Court Judge for the Eastern District of New York. I want to thank my colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER, and Senator LEAHY, Chairman HATCH, Senator LOTT, Senator DASCHLE, and all Senators for confirming the nomination of Judge Garaufis. Hailing from Bayside, New York, he is a graduate of both Columbia College and Columbia School of Law and for the last five years has served as Chief Counsel for the Federal  Aviation Administration. He is superbly qualified and I have every confidence he will make an excellent addition to the Eastern District Court.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. How very generous of you, Mr. President. 
   How kind of my beloved colleague and friend. 
   I rise with a measure of animus, if I may do, sir, this afternoon. I was one of those who, with my colleague, introduced Mr. Lynch to the Committee on the Judiciary with such very considerable pride to have that opportunity. 
   My colleague remarked about the founders of the Constitution. I will speak in just a moment about the Columbia Law School, which precedes the Constitution, which Constitution was written in very large measure by a graduate of that law school, Alexander Hamilton, and whose first large treatise of explanation was written by  Chancellor Kent, as he is known, having been chancellor of New York State, with his commentaries on the laws of the United States. 
   It is not a small thing to become a member of that law faculty. It is a large honor carefully reserved for lawyers of successive generations who note history and demand its importance to this time. 
   We have before us, sir, the nomination of a great lawyer--I use that carefully--who will be a superb judge. 
   I think he might have been surprised--we would not have been surprised--that early in life and at another time he might not have chosen criminal law as his specialty. But he came of age in the bar when that was the first problem, singularly so, of the Southern District of New York. And he went to work at it. 
   He was a serious prosecutor, sir, a successful one--a relentless one and a successful one. I want to say that, sir-- a successful one. None came into his compass charged with a crime that he did not prosecute fairly, rigorously, 
   relentlessly, and, in the end, sir, with an extraordinary range of success--and I defer to my revered colleague--with an extraordinary range of success. 
   This is a man of whom criminals had never heard but, when they appeared in court with him, will never forget. This man understood that the principles of a free society require adherence to law with a reverence and respect and, if necessary, a measure of fear: Do not appear before this judge with the burden of guilt or you shall be found guilty. 
   He has a range of intellectual pursuits. Ought not a member of the school of law that taught Alexander Hamilton and graced by Chancellor Kent and his great success--ought not there be such a range? Ought he not be able to entertain alternative ideas, examine them, and consider the possibilities? 
   We have, sir, a wonderful symbol--I do not know in my ignorance whether it is from Greece or Rome--of Justice blindfolded, holding up a scale and weighing the evidence. He has done that in a great range of professional articles. He has done that in a long career of prosecution. And he has considered alternatives and made judgments because he is by nature a judge. He has been in the pits where judges have to make determinations from whatever is presented to them as evidence. And he knows the process. 
   He graduated summa cum laude from Columbia Law School. He clerked for Judge Feinberg on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals --the Second Circuit, sir, the mother court, we should say--and for Justice Brennan on the Supreme Court. Over the past 23 years, he has won award upon award, including the University-wide President's Award for Outstanding Teaching in 1997. He is nationally known as a criminal law expert, for his writings, and particularly his writings on racketeering law. 
   I come before the Senate to say there has not been a finer judge proposed by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. We are honored to have him before the Senate. I prayerfully hope none of us ever appear before him.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Library of Congress on the occasion of its Bicentennial. Since April 24, 1800, when President John Adams created the Library, it has stood as the foremost research library in the world. But more importantly it has been a symbol of the public's freedom of access to information, an idea which is the bedrock of our Republic. 
   The history of the Library of Congress is filled with some rather compelling stories. The early days of the Library were turbulent, to say the least. In 1813, in what may not have been our nation's proudest moment, American troops burned the Parliament House and the Library of Canada in present day Toronto. Seeking revenge, a year later British troops stormed into Washington, burned the White House and the Capitol, including the original Library of Congress. Recognizing that this national treasure must be restored, the then retired Thomas Jefferson offered his personal library at Monticello as a replacement. 
   Today the Library is the most comprehensive library in the country, and  is almost completely open to the public. It is more than just Congress' library, it is the nation's source of knowledge. 
   This year we have been marking the Library's 200th anniversary. It comes as no surprise that the centerpiece of this year's Bicentennial celebration is the Local Legacies Project, a volunteer project that celebrates America's history, culture, and folklore. With this exhibit the Library will showcase important events, places, and people from around the nation--things that help define who we are as Americans and what this country is all about. 
   I am proud that five projects from across New York State which I designated have been included as part of the Local Legacies Project. They are the Little Falls Canal Celebration, Winter Olympics at Lake Placid (Olympic Regional Development Authority), Summer at Jones Beach (New York State Parks), ``Immigrant Life in New York'' (Lower East Side Tenement Museum), and the Allentown Arts Festival. I believe that these events, along with those other projects nominated by my colleagues from the New York Congressional Delegation, represent the diversity and rich history that is New York State. 
   The Lower East Side Tenement museum shows how New York City's large and diverse immigrant culture lived upon beginning their new lives in America. Jones Beach represents the many recreation opportunities our state offers and how families spend time together. The Little Falls Canal Celebration is about the history of our State's industrial development and the pride a local community has taken in that history. Were it not for the Erie Canal, New York would not be the Empire State. Lake Placid, home of two Winter Olympics is about New York's rich sports history. It also is a showcase for the beauty and majesty of the Adirondack Mountains. Finally, the Allentown Arts Festival is about our commitment to the arts, something which can be seen across the State but especially in Allentown. 
   It was one of the great and inspired choices of our predecessors in the Congress to purchase Thomas Jefferson's personal library, and thereafter establish the Library of Congress. As New Yorkers, with our Public Library, we truly understand the eminence of the Library of Congress. It is the largest research library in this country, and indeed the world. The Local Legacies Project is a fitting way to celebrate this great treasure. The Library is about preserving and disseminating knowledge about many things, but especially about this great nation. The Local Legacies project is about commemorating and showcasing that knowledge.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable woman, Alice Fuller. At the age of 81, she has two adult daughters, six grandchildren, and nine great grandchildren. She manages a thirteen-acre farm and garden, and still spoils her family with homemade rolls and baked goods at every family dinner. Her stamina and good-nature should be an inspiration to all Americans. A native of Missouri, she moved with her family to California in 1936, and in 1941, she married and moved to Oregon. Irrespective of her southern and western roots, she is an enthusiastic and loyal fan of the New York Yankees. On Mother's Day, The Register-Guard of Eugene, Oregon included the following story on this, ``One Tough Mom.''

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to give praise and recognition to one of my fellow New Yorkers who has devoted his life to helping heal the wounds of crime. Thomas Alessandro recently received the Crime Victim Service Award from Attorney General Janet Reno. I rise today to echo that recognition and to briefly describe Mr. Alessandro's innovation and tireless work in this field. 
   The Crime Victim Service Award was given to Mr. Alessandro as part of the Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime's 20th annual observance of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, held this year from April 9 to April 15. This week of observance enables communities across the country to recognize the millions of Americans who have felt the burdens of crime and those who have enabled them to navigate the difficult and often complex path to justice. This highlights the efforts of Mr. Alessandro and other outstanding individuals by drawing attention to their cause, and praising all citizens of the Nation who work toward this laudable ideal. As part of this week of recognition the Attorney General awarded the Crime Victim Service award to Mr. Alessandro, four other individuals, four organizations and two families. Mr. Alessandro was selected from 110 nominees for the award because of his outstanding progress and innovation in the field of crime victim service, the highest federal award for service to victims of crime. Mr. Alessandro is a shining example of how our law enforcement officials should protect justice and help victims of injustice seek healing. 
   Mr. Alessandro has dedicated the last 22 years of his life to the service of crime victims. One of his most astounding innovations was the development of the Victims Aid Services into a comprehensive program addressing the needs of all crime victims who come to the New York County District Attorney's Office. Additionally, Mr. Alessandro forged many public and private sector partnerships to strive toward the goal of justice. Among these partnerships and organizational enhancements, he established a counseling department and created a child victim specialist division. These additional tools allow the New York District Attorney's Office to protect the rights of victims not only in the form of conviction of criminals, but also in the form of healing the emotional scars of the victim especially the young victim. This second step is essential to making this society healthier and safer. The counseling staff is now made up of certified clinical social workers who provide individual and group therapy for victims. It is my honor to rise in recognition of this great man who actualizes this ideal. 
   In addition to counseling services, Mr. Alessandro has directed the development of new technology to increase the efficiency and availability of victim services, including protection order tracing and victim notification systems. He has forged partnerships with private sector organizations, including the AT&T Cell Phone Project, which, along with additional services, provides crime victims with 911 programmed cell phones for use in emergencies. 
   Mr. Alessandro's commitment to the needs of crime victims does not stop when he leaves the office. His tireless efforts continue into volunteer service. Beyond his professional role, Mr. Alessandro has been actively involved with numerous other state and local initiatives, such as the development of the New York city Victim Information and Notification System. For these accomplishments and innovations in this heroic field I rise to thank Thomas Alessandro and to draw this institution's attention to his outstanding work in this field.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky and I rise today to submit, along with several of our distinguished colleagues, a resolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of free and fair elections in Burma. 
   On May 27, 1990, the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, won a majority of the parliamentary seats in the elections. This was a great victory for the champions of democracy and human rights in Burma. However, the Burmese military arbitrarily annulled the results and arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of NLD members. Others were forced to flee, and the people's freedoms of assembly, speech and the press were severely restricted. 
   Today, the steady erosion of human rights continues under the heavy hand of the military regime known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). This resolution calls upon the SPDC to guarantee basic freedoms to its people; accept a political dialogue with the NLD and other Burmese political leaders; and to comply with human rights agreements and resolutions emanating from such bodies as the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union, and the International Labor Organization. 
   The struggle in Burma is not over. The 1999 Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Burma identifies more than 1,300 people who continue to suffer as political prisoners. A recent study traced the distribution patterns of different HIV strains to paths of heroin traffic originating from the country. As a New York Times editorial wrote on March 16, 2000, ``The cruelty of *.*.* Burma is increasingly a regional problem that threatens to destabilize its Southeast Asian neighbors with refugees, narcotics and now AIDS.'' I urge my colleagues to pass this important resolution.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do thank my colleague, who will be speaking momentarily. I want to simply recapitulate some of the statements made yesterday, of which the first and the most important is to say this is the first trade bill to come to the floor of the Senate in 6 years. It is not simply that there have not been matters to attend to, it is rather that we have not been able to attend to them. 
   Most important, we have been unable to provide the President with negotiating authority for future trade agreements in the manner that developed over the last half century, following the epochal decision and action in the first term of President Roosevelt under Cordell Hull to begin the reciprocal trade agreements program. Under that program, the United States negotiated with individual countries, and then after World War II with a group of countries gathered together under the umbrella of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 gave the President the authority to negotiate and proclaim tariff reductions and that procedure evolved, in 1974, into the trade agreements negotiating authority, whereby the Congress gave the President the opportunity to reach a common agreement with other countries and then send it to the Congress to be approved up or down, not to be negotiated item by item as we had done in the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. We have never had a tariff bill as such on the Senate floor in 70 years. 
   The administration was hesitant about asking the Congress to renew this authority. When finally it did, we were hesitant about giving it, and it looked for a while as if an enormous, a momentous event in the world economy and the American economy and in the political stability of the world was being lost. The role of trade has become so important. Many of the principal actors in the Second World War were at war with each other in very much trade-related matters. It would now be thought inconceivable for any such conflict to take place. 
   I say this because not only was this the first bill in six years, but yesterday we began our debate on an auspicious note with a resounding vote of 90-6 in support of the motion to proceed to the conference report, and now we will vote to invoke cloture. I trust we will do so with the same resounding vote. 
   This is a good bill. It is not perfect, nor will it solve all the economic problems of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, but it will help, as Senator GRASSLEY and others said yesterday. My esteemed colleague, the Senator from Iowa, is here representing Senator ROTH, the chairman of our committee, who is recovering from surgery and who will be back with us next week when on next Wednesday we will take up in the Finance Committee the proposition of permanent normal trade relations with China, an epic decision we will have to make and which I think we will be able to make in the context of this legislation having succeeded. 
   I remind all who might be listening that 6 months ago, this legislation was dead. It was not going anywhere. The House had passed a measure limited to Africa and not very well received over here. They had not included anything for the Caribbean Basin and Central America, as we call it, a program begun under President Reagan, and the Finance Committee took it up. The Finance Committee worked for 6 months on this matter. 
   I know there are persons who feel it is unacceptable because it does not contain provisions that provide for assistance to sub-Saharan Africa with respect to HIV/AIDS. 
   I say to my friends, the Senate did have such a provision. We fought for it in conference. We were not able to succeed because on the House side it was thought the legislation was a trade measure and public health issues were not relevant. 
   But also, absent economic development, there will be no 
   controlling this epidemic in Africa, anymore than in the subcontinent of Asia, and we will not have anything in which to begin an engagement on these matters--nothing. Anyone who comes to this body thinking that legislation which is not perfect is unacceptable will often be disappointed. I was disappointed with the extent to which persons spoke yesterday about rejecting this legislation because it was not perfect. 
   I note that the Foreign Relations Committee has reported out a measure, S. 2382, the Technical Assistance, Trade Promotion and Anti-Corruption Act of 2000, which includes some important provisions addressing this public health crisis. Other suggestions are under review. These include proposed tax incentives to promote vaccine development. These tax incentives will come to the Finance Committee. 
   I am sure my friend from Iowa will agree that Senators who accept what we have done today, even if not perfect, will find a much more receptive Finance Committee. We have worked very hard on this. We know perfectly well the facts, and we propose to address them in a context where we will have a tax bill. We will try to get a tax bill on the House side, and we will enact something of much greater consequence than anything now contemplated. 
   I offer a further thought, which is that on May 3, the Wall Street Journal reported, and I was advised of this in advance, that the Pfizer pharmaceutical company--one of the oldest, the one which developed penicillin during World War II, the British having discovered it and not having the capacity to produce it; a great firm with great successes--had offered to provide one of its drug therapies for HIV infection, called Diflucan, at no cost to  South Africans. There is a press announcement from Geneva this morning that five pharmaceutical companies--Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Glaxo Wellcome, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Roche--are participating in a collaborative initiative with the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, which is termed UNAIDS 
   to ``explore ways to accelerate and improve the provision of HIV/AIDS-related care and treatment in developing countries.'' 
   Does the Presiding Officer wish me to cease and desist?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Fine. 
   I would simply close by saying, sir, as to the matter of worker rights, the amendment to the CBI legislation offered on this matter was offered by Senator LEVIN, which I cosponsored. It provided that the President must take into account the extent to which a prospective CBI beneficiary country protects internationally recognized worker rights. That is to say, the core labor standards established by the ILO. I report to the Senate that this was retained in the conference agreement, as were many other Senate amendments. 
   I thank the Chair and I regret having imposed upon my colleague's time.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this was a momentous moment for the Senate, for the Nation, and for the world. We have passed the first trade bill in 6 years, having rejected others and having come about in the aftermath of very dim expectations. From no chance whatever, we have come to the point where this bill passed by 77 votes. It could not have happened without the majority leader, who personally convened meetings in his office day after day. There were mind-numbing details about thread, yarn, square meter equivalents, hundreds, millions--but it came about. 
   Senator ROTH, our chairman, who could not be here today, will be back next week. He put this matter through the Finance Committee nearly unanimously. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff who not only did this, but did it until dawn, day after day--or should I say night after night. They are, on the majority staff: Frank Polk, Grant Aldonas, Faryar Shirzad, Tim Keeler, and Carrie Clark. On the majority leader's staff: Dave Hoppe and Jim Hecht. On our minority staff: David Podoff, Debbie Lamb, Linda Menghetti, and Timothy Hogan. Plus majority and minority tax staffs because tariffs are taxes, we had: Mark Prater, Ed McClellan, Russ Sullivan,  Cary Pugh, Anita Horn, and Mitchell Kent. And a very special word of thanks to Polly CRAIGhill, Senate Legislative Counsel, who labored with the committee staff long into the night. 
   Once again, I say to my dear colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, who carried the matter so brilliantly on the other side, not every day do we pass a trade bill 4-1. Thank you. And I again thank the majority leader. The Nation is in his debt.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in complete accord with the resounding statement of the Senator from Iowa. I know he would agree with me when I say we are both here speaking in the intellectual grasp of our chairman, Senator ROTH, who will return to the Senate next week after necessary surgery and who is so much responsible for our being here today. 
   The Senator from Iowa said the world is watching. The world is watching and has been watching with dismay for 6 years as we seem to have backed away from that tradition which Cordell Hull took up at the depths of the recession, which I will get to, and we have carried on, on a bipartisan basis, right into the nineties and then we seem to have stopped. 
   This is the first trade bill to come to the Senate floor in 6 years. More, we have defeated measures. We have denied the President the trade negotiating authority for trade agreements. It took the administration too long to ask for it. It responded to the same domestic pressures we saw in Seattle and we saw in front of the World Bank, baffling in some instances, but powerful. 
   Now we return to our tradition. The Senator from Iowa spoke of sending a resounding message. Can there be a more resounding message than our vote this morning of 90-6 to proceed to the consideration of this measure, following, perhaps, an equally, more astounding and equally resounding measure, a vote in the House of 309-110 to send us this conference report? 
   Senators will recall that the House had sent over to us the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This was a measure to give some measure of trade stimulation to sub-Saharan African countries in the area of apparel exports. The distinguished chairman, our revered Senator ROTH, saw to it, in a near to unanimous Finance Committee, that the Caribbean Basin Initiative, an initiative begun by President Reagan, that this, too, was included in the bill--it is a combined measure--with a number of other provisions of interest to the Senators. 
   The importance of the CBI, as we say for purposes of simplification, in this regard is very simple. Having created the North American free trade area, we created an incentive to develop trade ties with Mexico--in essence, Mexican production would enter the United States on a completely free basis, whereas its neighbors in Central America and nearby Caribbean islands were suddenly disadvantaged. We will call it an unanticipated consequence. It had to be dealt with. We do not completely deal with it here, but we acknowledge that it is an urgent matter, and we begin it. 
   Nearly all the Senate provisions--the bill passed the Senate 76-19--were retained, thanks to extraordinary exertions by our respective staffs who we will thank fulsomely in time. 
   We must particularly acknowledge that this 5 months of negotiation, and often going into 5 in the morning, would never have come to any conclusion absent the active participation of our majority leader who convened the meetings in his own office and listened to a lot of incomprehensible discord over tariffs. 
   I speak as a veteran, if I may, and ask the indulgence of the younger and more vital persons. I was one of the three persons who negotiated the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement of 1962 for President Kennedy, that having become a condition of passing the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 by the textile industry and the garment industry, which we successfully did, but it was not an easy effort with the French at the height of Gaullist recidivism. That 5-year Cotton Textile Agreement, which we negotiated nearly 40 years ago, is now in its eighth reincarnation and will continue well into the now new century. Still, we got it. And we got as well the series of trade rounds in the GATT about which Senator GRASSLEY has spoken. Finally, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which authorized our participation in the World Trade Organization, was enacted in 1994. 
   I make the point that in establishing the WTO, we were only getting back to where we were in the immediate aftermath of World War II when, at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, the British-American-Chinese-French negotiators thought of how to establish a world which would not have the profound instability of the 1930s, and they envisioned three institutions: 
   One, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which we call the World Bank, headquartered here; the International Monetary Fund, to deal with monetary fluctuations, which we established here; and an international trade organization, which was to be headquartered in Havana--I acknowledge that that died in the Senate Finance Committee. 
   So we established, on an ad hoc basis, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Eric Wyndham White, a British Treasury official, with three or four assistants, managed these negotiations in Geneva which would take place periodically. In time, we got back to the World Trade Organization. 
   This moved so well. But suddenly we find ourselves anxious about proceeding in a policy direction that has been so profoundly successful for two-thirds of a century--66 years, since Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program. 
   We recognize the extraordinary results of the Smoot-Hawley tariff. It is a point not often noted that there has not been a tariff bill on the Senate floor since 1930. We tried that and it did not work. I think it is fair to say that the dynamics of horse-trading--I will do this for your product; you do this for mine--are not suited to a world in which trade is so important today. 
   Indeed, also the 19th century tariff legislation was hugely acrimonious and at times divisive. I think the division between North and South had something to do with the tariffs imposed in the early part of the 19th century. 
   As the Senator from Iowa has said, if you would make a short list of five events that led to the Second World War, and the horror associated with that war, the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 would be one of them. 
   Tariffs were increased to unprecedented levels in the United States--by 60 percent. Incidentally, they are still the legal, official tariffs. It is only through trade agreements that we have negotiated reciprocal reductions. 
   As predicted, imports dropped by two-thirds, in value terms. And all the simple-minded persons who said, if we do not let any foreign products come in, then our producers will prosper, what they did not know is that exports  would drop by two-thirds, and the depression settled in. 
   The stock market crash of 1929 would have worked itself out. It was a matter of a crisis on paper. Factories did not close. Factories began to close when there was no market for their products, much of which had been going overseas. 
   The result was ruinous overseas. The British abandoned free trade, which had made them the principal economic power of the 19th century. They had to fight it a very long time, and much later than we think, when they abolished the so-called corn laws, which kept the price of wheat high enough to maintain the economic viability of the large land area of the state and not let that Iowa wheat get into Liverpool. The minute they did, they became an industrial power, and their farms did not disappear either. 
   As a matter of fact, Britain is self-sufficient in agriculture today. But it was free trade that gave them the advantage in the world. And they kept it right up until the Smoot-Hawley tariff, after which they adopted commonwealth preferences. 
   The Japanese began the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. And, sir, in 1933, with unemployment at 33 percent, Adolph Hitler was elected Chancellor of Germany. That is what you get when you do things like this. 
   The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934--Cordell Hull's innovation of President Roosevelt's initiative--got us back on track. For more than half a century, from one administration to another, without exception, there we have stayed. It had looked like we were going to stray. But here we are, moving again in the context--I daresay, the shadow--of the decision on China coming 
   within the next 2 or 3 weeks. 
   With the African trade bill--the African Growth and Opportunity Act--for the first time, the United States is, with this legislation, putting in place a trade policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa, a policy that is long overdue. 
   The economic challenges facing that region may be even greater than they were at the height of the cold war. There has been a decline of institutions on a massive scale. 
   Consider the differing paths of South Korea and Ghana. In 1958, the year after Ghana achieved independence, its per capita gross national product was $203; South Korea's was lower. South Korean per capita GNP at that time was $171. 
   Forty years later, in 1998, South Korea's per capita income has soared to $10,550--even after the financial crisis of Asia a few years back--while Ghana's has stood at a modest, an impoverished, $390. 
   According to the most recent World Bank data, the average per capita GNP for sub-Saharan Africa was $513 in 1998, or $316 if South Africa is excluded. These countries simply do not pose competitive threats to us. They are, if anything, a source of concern for economic aid, peacekeeping forces, and the like. 
   The legislation we have before us, which we will pass overwhelmingly after we hear some arguments that are all too familiar, is intended to assist sub-Saharan Africa to develop one of the basic building block industries of economic development, which is textile and apparel production. 
   It offers duty-free, quota-free treatment to certain categories of apparel--principally those that are made with American fabric that is itself made, indeed, with American yarn. 
   There is some allowance for so-called regional fabric; that is, fabric made in sub-Saharan Africa. But the benefits are subject to a very tight cap, beginning at 1.5 percent of total U.S. imports and growing over the life of the bill to only 3.5 percent of total imports. 
   For a transition period of 4 years, the less developed of the sub-Saharan African countries may use third country fabric as they ramp up their own production capacity. 
   But we should put this in some perspective. In 1999, domestic production of apparel and certain fabricated textile products such as home furnishings--but not fabrics and yarns--in the United States topped $81 billion. 
   That same year, U.S. imports of apparel from sub-Saharan Africa were valued at $584 million--that is to say, 0.7 percent of domestic production and just 1.1 percent of total apparel imports. 
   Should imports from sub-Saharan Africa grow to 3.5 percent of the total U.S. imports--the maximum quantity allowed for regional fabric under the bill--they will barely register in a market this size. 
   The African trade legislation in this package will not reverse years of neglect and decline, but it may provide a decent start. 
   Just a final word on the enhanced Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. As I mentioned, it was begun in 1983 under President Reagan, and which the Senate Finance Committee added to this bill, and the House accepted it. The House was very open in this matter. I remarked earlier how the North American free trade area has eroded the market positions of Central America and the Caribbean islands. 
   Senator ROTH and I met last fall, in September of 1999, with the Presidents and Vice Presidents and Foreign Ministers of a number of the Caribbean and Central American states--the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica. They made a simple request. They said: Look, we are here before you as democratically elected or appointed members of stable democratic governments. We are not here asking for aid. But the unanticipated effects of NAFTA have put us at a great disadvantage. All we want to do is trade with you. And that is what our provisions would allow. This is trade both ways, and again, in American textiles. 
   The provisions in the bill will help our producers structure their production in this hemisphere so that they will be in a position to compete with Asian producers when--as I mentioned earlier, after more than 40 years--textile and apparel quotas will be eliminated by January of 2005, as agreed in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. 
   If we don't have a trade infrastructure going with Central America and the Caribbean, we will all be overwhelmed by Asian production; and we can do it simply by passing this legislation--or we think we can do it, and we have not been wrong in our understanding of these matters. 
   I have a brief note about the problem of fine wool fabrics. After months of negotiation, and with great good faith on the part of all interested Senators and industry representatives, we have finally reached agreement on a measure that will begin to address this problem--again, the unanticipated consequence of free trade with Canada and the fact that we have exorbitant tariffs still in place. 
   Senators DURBIN, SCHUMER, GRAMM, HAGEL, MIKULSKI, SPECTER, NICKLES, FITZGERALD, SANTORUM, and THOMPSON joined me in sponsoring a very modest measure, and we are very happy with the outcome of the effort to provide some relief for our suitmakers. 
   The conference agreement begins to address this problem. It will also begin a data collection process that will give us a better database on this industry in the near future. It is not a perfect solution, and it does not permanently fix the problem, but it is a start. So I strongly support the conference agreement. I signed the papers. We had a long 5-month negotiation. These are exhausting efforts. They tend to exhaust our staffs more than we because we go home at midnight and they stay until daybreak. But we have done it. 
   Just to repeat what my friend from Iowa has said, this is important--if modest--legislation. A good debate, a strong vote on this conference report will surely set a positive tone for permanent normal trade relations with China. That debate will engage us in the very near future. We have a wonderful beginning. This morning, we voted 90-6 to take up this conference agreement, and I hope that reverberates into the other Chamber. I can speak for the Finance Committee. The China permanent normal trade relations--just normal trade relations--will pass the Senate Finance Committee and will pass the Senate floor, but we need to send a signal to the other Chamber that we are ready. We hope they are willing. Sixty-six years of American trade policy is in the balance. So let's begin this debate and conclude it on the same resounding support that we commenced this morning. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on February 22, my beloved colleague, the junior Senator from New York, introduced legislation to authorize the President to award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress to John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, in recognition of his accomplishments as  a priest, a chaplain, and a humanitarian. 
   Congress finds that His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor, was a man of deep compassion, great intellect, and tireless devotion to spiritual guidance and humanitarianism. 
   I think it is a special note that the Cardinal joined the Navy Chaplain's Corps in June of 1952 during the Korean conflict. He served with elements of both the Navy and the Marine Corps and saw combat action in Vietnam. 
   He later served as chaplain of the United States Naval Academy and was appointed Chief of Chaplains of the Navy with the grade of rear admiral, from which position he retired 4 years later. 
   In May 1979, he was ordained a bishop by Pope John Paul II. He then served as Victor General of Military Ordnance--now the Archdiocese for Military Services--until 1984. 
   This son of a working-class laborer, a union man from Pennsylvania, found himself, on the one extreme, in the jungles of Vietnam saying mass in foxholes and asking himself, as he saw the deaths on all sides of all the combatants, why? 
   He came back with that same courage to the Archdiocese of New York. There are 2.37 million of us, and we have been rancorous from the first, and continue so. He quickly adapted to that environment and adopted some of those characteristics. 
   But he was a wonderful priest. As my friend, Senator SCHUMER, said, he was a healer and a man who reached out to others. 
   He is in his heaven now. As we mourn his passing, we celebrate his life. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my distinguished colleague and fellow New Yorker, Senator SCHUMER,  to introduce the ``Governors Island Preservation Act of 2000.'' This bill will establish the Governors Island National Monument preserving two of New York Harbor's earliest fortifications, Fort Jay and Castle Williams. The balance of the property will be conveyed to the State of New York. New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New York State Governor George E. Pataki have developed a plan for the reuse of Governors Island. Their agreement has helped to make this bill possible, and both deserve much credit. 
   Congress stipulated in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that Governors Island be sold ``at fair market value'' no sooner than Fiscal Year 2002. Without the benefit of an appraisal, the Congressional Budget Office determined its value to be somewhere between $250 million and $1 billion. As Congress continued its work on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, $500 million of Federal revenue was identified in Fiscal Year 2002 through the sale of Governors Island. A fantasy perhaps, but no matter, the money had been found. 
   Governors Island has played a significant role in every major military conflict from the American Revolution through World War II. In April of 1776, General Israel Putnam and 1,000 officers arrived on Governors Island and began erecting fortifications. Three months later, the guns at Governors Island prevented Admiral Howe's 400 ships and Lord Cornwallis' army--32,000 men strong--from crushing General George Washington's badly overwhelmed forces during the Battle of Long Island. Outflanked in Brooklyn, Washington's men retreated to the island of Manhattan across the East River under the cover of the Governors Island's guns. At the risk of falling into what historians term a ``teleological trap,'' I would suggest that the Revolution could well have ended right then and there. 
   During the War of 1812, the guns at the ``cheese-box'' shaped Castle Williams--and those at the Southwest Battery--dissuaded the British from mounting a direct attack on New York City, then the Nation's principal seaport. 
   During the Civil War, Governors Island served as the primary Eastern Seaboard recruiting depot for Union soldiers. Nearly 5,000 Union draftees and volunteers were stationed there. Its inaccessibility proved useful for garrisoning the most recalcitrant of Confederate soldiers, who were confined both in Castle Williams and Fort Jay. Only one, Captain William Robert Webb, managed to escape. It will give my colleagues some measure of satisfaction to learn that this artful rebel was later appointed U.S. 
   Senator from Tennessee. 
   After the U.S. Congress declared war with Germany and Austria-Hungary on April 6, 1917, Governors Island became an embarkation point for the war effort. Several years earlier, the Island was expanded to its current 172-acre size by the excavation of the Lexington Avenue Subway line, which generated over 4.7 million tons of fill. The additional space permitted the construction of over 70 buildings providing a combined total of 30 million square feet of storage space. As the War escalated, estimates place the value of goods transported from Governors Island to the European theater at over $1 million per day--in 1917 dollars. 
   More than 20 years later, the famed General Hugh Drum commanded the First Army from Governors Island as the United States prepared for the Second World War. Once war was declared, Governors Island served as the headquarters for the Eastern Defense Command, which was tasked with protecting the Eastern Seaboard from Nazi attack. 
   In 1966, the Coast Guard assumed control of Governors Island, and remained there for 30 years. After lighting the refurbished Statue of Liberty from Governors Island on July 4, 1986, President Reagan grew fond of Governors Island. On December 7, 1988, he chose the Admiral's House on Governors Island to meet Soviet Premier Mikhail S. Gorbachev to present each other with the Articles of Ratification of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. 
   It is inconceivable that Congress would permit this site, so rich in history, to be recklessly sold to the highest bidder. 
   In January of this year, Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani announced an agreement on a preservation plan for Governors Island. The Governors Island Preservation Act is based upon that plan and calls for the establishment of the Governors Island National Monument to be comprised of Fort Jay and Castle Williams (so named after Lt. Col. Jonathan Williams, the first superintendent of West Point). Once the Monument is established, all of the historic New York Harbor forts--Fort Wood (the base of the Statue of Liberty), the Southwest Battery (now Castle Clinton National Monument), and Fort Gibson (partially demolished to provide for the construction of Ellis Island)--will be within the National Park Service inventory. 
   The remaining portions of the Island will be conveyed to the Empire State Development Corporation, as agreed to by Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki. Their plan will incorporate a public park, athletic fields, a museum dedicated to the history and ecology of the Hudson River and New York Harbor, a family center modeled after Colonial Williamsburg, a conference center, and a hotel. After 200 years of Federal occupation, Governors Island will at last be open to the public. 
   I thank the chair and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 
   I am pleased to introduce today, with Senator COCHRAN and Senator FRIST, legislation to authorize the construction of a base facility structure in Hilo, Hawaii, to house the staff and laboratory operations of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Submillimeter Array (SMA) atop the summit of the ancient volcano Mauna Kea. 
   The advanced SMA is an array of eight moveable radio telescope antennas. Its combined images can produce high-resolution detail 50 times sharper than those achieved by any telescopes currently making observations at these wavelengths. Ultimately, this telescope array will be used to study a host of astronomical objects and phenomena emitting images in the submillimeter  range, the narrow band of radiation between radio and infrared waves, a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum largely unexplored from the ground. Using the latest technology, the array will be able to probe the murky clouds of the Milky Way where stars are born, peer into the hearts of exploding galaxies, study cool faint objects of our own Solar System, and explore other great questions in astronomy, gaining insight into the processes and cataclysmic forces involved in the ultimate formation and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies. 
   Like the innovative Chandra X-ray Observatory, which is now sending back stunning images from space, essentially all of the Submillimeter Array's equipment was designed and prototyped at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And, just as the Smithsonian collaborates with NASA on the groundbreaking Chandra project, it collaborates with the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics of the Academia Sinica of Taiwan on the advanced SMA. 
   On September 29, 1999, by tracking and observing 230 gigahertz (230 billion cycles per second) of radiation from Mars, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter, SMA scientists made their first test observation--thereby achieving the submillimeter equivalent of ``first light''--and took a critical step in the ultimate success of this project. This is but yet another milestone in the history of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). Founded in 1890 by Secretary Samuel Langley as a center for ``the new astronomy,'' where one might study the physical nature of astronomical bodies as well as their positions and motions, SAO pioneered studies of the relationship between the solar and terrestrial phenomena. In the earliest days of the Space Age, SAO established and operated a worldwide network of satellite-tracking stations, including one on the island of Maui, and developed experiments for some of the first orbiting space observatories. Today, SAO, the Smithsonian unit with the largest budget, is headquartered--in a partnership with Harvard University--in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At that facility more than 300 scientists are engaged in a broad program of astronomy, astrophysics, and earth and space sciences supported by Federal appropriations, Smithsonian trust funds, Harvard University funds, and contracts and grants. In addition to the Submillimeter Array in Hawaii, SAO maintains a major data-gathering facility at the Whipple Observatory near Tucson, Arizona and operates the Oak Ridge Observatory in Massachusetts. 
   The legislation I am introducing today authorizes the Smithsonian to plan, design, construct, and equip approximately 16,000 square feet of laboratory, administrative, and support space at the base of Mauna Kea, replacing inadequate, temporary leased space. It further authorizes an appropriation of $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 and $2,500,000 in fiscal year 2002. This is a very modest investment to ensure the continuation of the scientific achievement and research excellence that have been a tradition at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for 110 years.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Sunday, the anniversary of the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam conflict, the Washington Post carried on its Op-Ed page a thoughtful, healing reflection on those events by Senator KERREY entitled, ``Was It Worth It?'' A hero--and casualty--of that conflict, the only Member of Congress ever to have received the Congressional Medal of Honor, he might understandably have turned his attention to those who did not think so and did not serve. Instead he allowed that for a period he had shared the same doubts, but had overcome them. As he contemplates the human destruction done by the dictatorship that followed, he concludes: ``I believe the cause was just and the sacrifice not in vain.'' He is now, as he was then, a person of limitless courage.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Illinois for saying, but taking one exception, we ought to think twice about this matter. Dare I hope we might think once. It comes wholly unexpected to us, a massive departure from two centuries of constitutional practice, a measure--one amendment which was longer than the whole of the Bill of Rights, and there is not a single Member on the other side of the aisle listening, wishing to speak, present. There are three of us on the Senate floor with the Constitution in our hands in a matter of 27 hours--the casualness. 
   George Will said on Sunday that we were cluttering the Constitution. We do things palpably ill advised. In the House, they put us on a 1-year balanced budget back into an agricultural cycle, long since gone. There was no mention whatever of the rights of the accused, about which we were very concerned. A people should be concerned when Government accuses someone, and 
   that is why we have the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth amendments. Then to have this endless, tedious, complex amendment about victims' rights and, as the Senator says, no definition whatever of what a victim is. 
   I say to those not present on the opposite side--and there are, of course, supporters on this side--the capacity of American culture in this stage to think of new forms of victimhood is unprecedented. It has been a characteristic of the culture for a generation now to find victims and to declare oneself a victim and demand compensation and consideration therefore. It may become a permanent feature of American culture. I do not know. I doubt it. But it is at high moment now and would this amendment--oh, my goodness. And for the law schools, yes, and for those who design and build courthouses, oh, sure, and judges--there will be no more judges held up in this Senate. We will need double the Federal judiciary in no time at all. 
   How could we have come to the point where we have so little sense of our history, as the Senator from Illinois so rightly said. James Madison did not think a bill of rights was necessary since the Constitution only gave powers, specifically enumerated powers, to the Federal Government. What it was not given, it could not do. Still, George Mason and others persuaded him and prudence--a hugely important aspect of good government--prudence said: Well, why not have a bill of rights? And we have learned to be glad that we did. 
   Do my colleagues recall the impeachment trial we went through a year ago? I was struck by the managers--fine persons all--but how little reference they gave to the Constitution which provides for impeachment. I may be mistaken--I hope I am--but I did not hear one reference to Madison's notes which he kept during the Convention in Philadelphia, or the notes of the one day in which the impeachment clause was settled. 
   On that day, it was stated, for example, the most important impeachment of the age then was the impeachment of Warren Hastings going on in London. Edmund Burke, well known here as a supporter of the colony's rights, managed the case by the House of Commons in the House of Lords. The point was made by Mason that Hastings was not accused of a crime. That was not why he was being impeached. It was abuse of office. Hence, we have the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' High crimes. 
   Now. Do my colleagues know what the references were in that debate? They were to Hollywood movies. And do my colleagues remember Marlene Dietrich in ``Witness for the Prosecution''? Are we trivializing our oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic? It is scarcely to be believed. 
   Why are the seats empty on the other side? I cannot be certain, but I offer a thought, and I would be happy to hear differently. The administration is negotiating with the sponsors because the administration has indicated a willingness to support this atrocity, this abomination, this violation of all we have treasured in two centuries and more. 
   That the administration should do this is something I could not imagine I would ever see. Yet we have it in writing that they are prepared to do it. I only hope the negotiations break down. 
   I shall have more to say at another time. But I just wanted to make this comment. Now I leave the floor. Our revered senior Senator from Vermont will be the only one remaining. I do not doubt he will have thoughts to disclose. But even he will eventually find himself somewhat distracted by the fact that no one is listening. The distinguished Presiding Officer is here. But there will not be another soul present with such attention and energy as we take up a matter of the greatest possible importance, which is amending the Constitution of the United States.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just make a closing remark. 
   Not meaning to be disrespectful, but there is a joke, a witticism, if you like, that says libraries file the French Constitution under the heading of periodicals: It comes; it goes; it comes; it goes. 
   We have a treasure here, the oldest written Constitution on Earth. It has preserved a republic which is without equal. There are two nations, the United States and Britain, that both existed in 1800 and have not had their form of government changed by violence since then. We live in a world where a century ago there were approximately, as I count, 8 nations on Earth that both existed then and have not had their form of government changed by violence since. 
   If we are to trivialize the Constitution because of passing enthusiasms about this economic theory, that economic theory, we risk the stability of this institution. 
   I make just one reference to the fact that several years ago we passed a law providing for a Presidential line item veto on legislation. It was elementally unconstitutional. The Senate passed it. The House passed it. The President signed it. 
   Three of us--our revered senior Democratic Member, Senator BYRD, Senator LEVIN, and I--brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which in good time held that the line item veto was indeed unconstitutional. The government appealed to the Supreme Court that as members of Congress we did not have the requisite standing. 
   Then in the following term, the veto had been exercised. We clearly did have standing. We went there as amici. And, bang, the Court said: This is unconstitutional. 
   Does the President not have lawyers? Are there no counsel on the Judiciary Committee here and in the House? It is something that elemental. 
   Sir, we are approaching a dangerous moment in the history of the Republic. As I leave the floor, as I am required elsewhere, I leave the Senator from Vermont who is alone defending the Constitution of the United States. He is alone on the Senate floor. There is not a single person here who supports this monstrosity, this abomination, willing to come forward and say why. 
   Does that not say something? 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. President, as the Senate once again considers an amendment to the United States Constitution, this time to protect the  rights of crime victims, I ask that George Will's column from Sunday's Washington Post be printed in the RECORD in its entirety. He offers a well-reasoned analysis of the concerns the proposed amendment raises.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues--Senators ASHCROFT, WARNER, BOND, and DEWINE--in this effort to name the State Department building after our 33rd President, Harry S. Truman. It could be named for none other. 
   Harry S. Truman was, perhaps, the most unlikely of the Presidents. A failed haberdasher, as he would say, without a college degree. It seems somewhat paradoxical that this common man, who modeled himself along the lines of the fabled Cincinnatus--returning to the field after rising to meet his country's needs--would leave so much behind. 
   Put simply, President Truman's foreign affairs accomplishments saved the world from the chaos that followed the destruction of Europe in the Second World War, and enabled the ultimate defeat of totalitarianism. To list a few: the Berlin Airlift, the Marshall Plan, aid to Greece and Turkey, NATO, and the establishment of the United Nations--the vision of his only rival President Woodrow Wilson. 
   His greatness was not readily accepted while he served, or shortly thereafter. But over time, Harry S. Truman has been reevaluated through such scholarly biographies as those by David McCullough and Alonzo L. Hamby. This son of Independence, Missouri, would surely have rejected the high praise that his name now generates, but he would certainly concur in the appreciation of the enduring success of the policies and institutions he created. McCullough's ``Truman'' contains this reflection:  
   I suppose that history will remember my term in office as the years when the Cold War began to overshadow our lives. 
   I have had hardly a day in office that has not been dominated by this all-embracing struggle. ..... And always in the background there has been the atomic bomb. But when history says that my term of office saw the beginning of the Cold War, it will also say that in those eight years we have set the course that can win it. .....  
   Mr. President, few could dispute those sentiments.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill--The Teaching Hospital Preservation Act of 2000--that would provide much needed financial support for America's 144 accredited medical and osteopathic schools and 1,250 graduate medical education (GME) teaching institutions. Teaching hospitals are national treasures; these institutions are the very best in the world. Yet, today they find themselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces reshape the health care delivery system in the United States. 
   Markets do not provide for public goods such as teaching hospitals. Everyone benefits from public goods but no one has any incentive to pay. It follows, therefore that for the most part teaching hospitals have to be paid for by the public either indirectly through tax exemption or directly through expenditure. 
   The legislation I am introducing is similar to S. 1023--The Graduate Medical Education Payment Restoration Act of 1999--a bill I introduced during the first session. Congressman RANGEL is introducing an identical bill in the House today. 
   My particular interest in this subject began in 1994, when the Finance Committee took up the President's Health Security Act. I was Chairman of the Committee at the time. In January of that year, I asked Dr. Paul Marks, M.D., President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, if he would arrange a ``seminar'' for me on health care issues. He agreed, and gathered a number of medical school deans together one morning in New York. 
   Early on in the meeting, one of the seminarians remarked that the University of Minnesota might have to close its medical school. In an instant I realized I had heard something new. Minnesota is a place where they open medical schools, not close them. How, then, could this be? The answer was that Minnesota, being Minnesota, was a leading state in the growth of competitive health care markets, in which managed care organizations try to deliver services at lower costs. In this environment, HMOs and the like do not send patients to teaching hospitals, absent which you cannot have a medical school. 
   We are, my friends, in the midst of a great era of discovery in medical science--an era which might end prematurely if we are not careful with our finances. It is certainly not a time to close medical schools. This great era of medical discovery is occurring right here in the United States, not in Europe like past ages of scientific discovery. And it is centered in New York City. Progress over the past 60 years has been remarkable: images of the inside of the human body based on the magnetic resonance of bodily tissues; laser surgery; micro surgery for reattaching limbs; and organ transplantation, among other wonders. Physicians are now working on a gene therapy that might eventually replace bypass surgery. I can hardly imagine what might be next. 
   The growth of managed for-profit care, which does not fund public goods, combined with reductions in Medicare support for GME, is having a deleterious effect on the financial position of teaching hospitals. The Medicare program is the nation's largest explicit financier of GME, with annual payments of about $5.4 billion in 1999. However, because of payment reductions set forth by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, Medicare support is eroding as well--down from $6.3 billion in 1997. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, between 1997 and 1998, the margins for major teaching hospital have been slashed by more than half, and are at their lowest point of the century. And this is an average; individual hospitals have fared far worse. 
   With declining margins and many hospitals operating in the red, the mission of these fine institutions is in jeopardy. The teaching hospitals that we know and depend on today--including those in my state of New York-- may not be able to continue their work, or even to survive. If this is to happen, we could face what Walter Reich has called ``the dumbing down of American medicine.'' 
   Last year, we forestalled some cuts enacted in the BBA by passing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) of 1999, however, this legislation provided only short-term relief and does not go for enough. To ensure that this precious public resource is maintained and the United States continues to lead the world in quality health care, my bill, the Teaching Hospital Preservation Act of 2000 would maintain critically required funding. 
   The Teaching Hospital Preservation Act of 2000, with a total of 23 cosponsors, would freeze the scheduled reductions to the indirect portion of GME funding. Under the BBA, the indirect payment adjustor was scheduled to be reduced from 7.7 percent to 5.5 percent by FY 2001. Last year, the BBRA slowed the cuts by holding the indirect payment adjuster at 6.5 percent in FY 2000, 6.25 percent in FY 2001 and 5.5 percent in FY 2002 and thereafter. BBRA restored about $500 million--over 5 years--in funding for teaching hospitals. The bill I introduce today would maintain the indirect payment adjuster at 6.5 percent. In total, this bill restores about another $2 billion over 5 years in GME funding for teaching hospitals. 
   This bill would protect our nation's teaching hospitals and ensure that the United States will continue to be in the forefront of developing new cures, new medical technology, and training of the worlds finest medical professionals. Without this bill, the state of our nation's teaching hospitals and the delivery of health care will remain in jeopardy.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of Charles ``Charlie'' Joseph Mohr, the University of Wisconsin's last 165-pound collegiate boxing champion. In April 1960, Charlie was badly beaten in a NCAA championship bout against San Jose State's Stuart Bartell. Minutes later he began convulsing in the locker room and lost consciousness. A week afterward, Charlie died without regaining consciousness. 
   Charlie grew up in Merrick, NY, and learned to box in nearby Long Beach. At age 18, he reached the semifinals of the prestigious New York City Golden Gloves amateur boxing tournament. In 1955, Charlie wrote a letter to Wisconsin's boxing Coach John Walsh asking about the possibility of receiving a scholarship. Coach Walsh eagerly obliged. 
   At the university, he excelled in all aspects of campus life. He was a good student who helped other's study for their exams. Charlie was very involved with the local parish St. Paul's Church and even thought about becoming a priest. 
   However, it was in the ring where he gained his notoriety. In his freshman  year, he won two university tournaments despite not being able to compete on the varsity team. The next year he won seven of his nine fights. As a junior, he captured the NCAA's 165-pound championship after defeating Jesse Klinkenberg. 
   The cause of Charlie's death is still in question. Doctors dispute whether the brain hemorrhaging that led to his untimely passing was caused by a blow at the hands of Bartell or an aneurysm. No one can dispute the profound impact his death had on the University and the intercollegiate sport. A couple of weeks after Charlie's death the faculty decided to disband the school's boxing program. Soon after, the NCAA followed suit, abolishing boxing as a sanctioned sport. 
   On January 19, 1999, I proposed S. 143, the Professional Boxing Safety Act Amendments of 1999 in order to try to protect fighters from lasting and debilitating head injuries in the ring. The bill passed, as an amendment to S. 305, the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, on July 27 of last year. The bill will require fighters to undergo a computer axial tomography (CAT) scan before a fighter can renew their professional license. Hopefully, the lesson taught to us by Charlie Mohr will not be forgotten.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my condolences to the family of Aaron ``Ari'' Halberstam on the sixth Hebrew calendar anniversary of his death. On March 1, 1994, the 15 year old was shot and fatally wounded, while driving in a van with fifteen other students, on the on-ramp of the Brooklyn Bridge returning home from visiting the late Lubavitcher spiritual leader Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. 
   Although the shooter, Rashid Baz, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, there remains a question of what motivated the attack. Many New Yorkers have joined Ari's mother, Mrs. Devorah Halberstam, in calling on the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, to reclassify this hateful attack as an act of urban terrorism. Last May, at the request of the New York Congressional Delegation, the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office agreed to review the case for possible evidence of Federal crimes such as terrorism, civil rights violations, and firearms violations. This investigation is ongoing. 
   We look forward to the swift conclusion of the FBI and US Attorney's review in the hope it will bring peace of mind to the family who has suffered so greatly. Then, we shall hopefully, once and for all, learn what motivated Rashid Baz to commit such a senseless act of violence.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am joined with Senator REID and Senator BOXER to introduce the Genetically Engineered Food Safety Act (S. 2315), a bill to require food safety testing for genetically engineered foods. 
   The ability to alter an organism by specifically transferring genetic codes between plants and animals is a new realm of science that we have only begun investigating. This technology has the promise to deliver real public goods: increased crop yields and products which combat disease and improve nutrition. But the technology also has the potential to pose a number of threats to the nation's public health, environment, and economy, and U.S. consumers are understandably concerned. 
   The Federal Government has a duty to ensure that genetically engineered foods (GEFs) are safe to eat. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently requires rigorous pre-market review for pharmaceutical drugs, biological products, and medical devices introduced in the U.S. market. For GEFs, however, FDA only asks the industry to submit safety data voluntarily. Even if industry fully complies, our concern is that a conflict of interest exists when an industry determines its own level of safety review for products it wants to promote.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak in this debate. This is the fourth time this amendment has come to the floor since I have been present. But the speeches, statements, the addresses by the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Virginia compel me simply to bear witness to them. There are 10 Members in the Senate today, 10 remaining persons, who were in uniform in World War II. 
   I was in the Navy--not heroically; and I was called up again briefly in Korea. I was part of that generation in which service to the Nation was so deeply honored, and lived with horror to see the disrespect shown those who answered the country's service in Vietnam, as they were asked to do. They were commanded to do so and they had taken an oath to obey. 
   What a thrilling thing it is to see, two such exemplars, men of heroism, achievement and spotless honor, come to this floor and speak as they have done. We take one oath which binds us today. Those who have been in the military have taken earlier oaths. Our oath is to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic--not ``foreign or,'' not just ``foreign.'' This was added over the course of the 19th century. 
   Surely, there would be no one, however unintentionally--and I say this as a member of the American Legion--who would propose that to debase the First Amendment to the Constitution meets the criteria of upholding and defending it. 
   Those two men have defended their nation in battle--one in the Navy, one in the Marines. I speak as one who was involved. I was in 20 years, altogether, before being discharged. I have to grant, I was not aware that I was discharged, but it turned up later in the file somewhere. 
   Our oath is solemn, and it is binding, and they--Senators ROBB and KERREY--stand there as witness to what it requires of us. If we cannot do this on this floor, what can we expect Americans to do on battlefields, in the skies, under the seas, and on the land in the years ahead? 
   Please, I say to all Senators, heed them and walk away from this trivializing of our most sacred trust. Defeat this amendment. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues, Senators GRAHAM and FEINSTEIN, in introducing legislation to ensure that our safety net hospitals continue to be able to care for the poor and the uninsured. 
   The Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program provides vital funding to safety net hospitals that primarily serve Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 placed declining state-specified ceilings on federal Medicaid DSH spending from 1998-2002. In 2003, the limits will begin to be adjusted upwards for inflation. The Medicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000 would freeze the state-specific caps at this year's limits (thereby preventing further declines in the limits) and adjust them for inflation beginning in 2002. 
   It is essential to provide much-needed support to our safety net hospitals. The number of uninsured in the United States increases every year, in part because of declining Medicaid enrollment as a result of welfare reform. There are now 44 million Americans without health insurance who have no choice but to turn to the emergency rooms of safety net hospitals for care. Yet, even as demands on safety net hospitals increase, DSH spending per State is being further reduced. The Medicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000 would maintain significant savings achieved by prior reductions but would protect safety net hospitals from further DSH cuts. As a result, hospitals would have access to the financing they need for achieving their social mission. 
   Mr. President, Congress should act now to preserve the financial ability of our safety net hospitals to provide health care to the poor and uninsured/

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with enthusiasm to join our chairman in introducing this measure which is word for word as the President sent to us on March 8. In doing so, he put the matter clearly enough. He said:  
   The Agreement will dramatically cut import barriers currently imposed on American products and services. It is enforceable and will lock in and expand access to virtually all sectors of China's economy. The Agreement meets the high standards we set in all areas, from creating export opportunities for our businesses, farmers, and working people, to strengthening our guarantees of fair trade.  
   I point out, sir, that the negotiations that have led us to this point have taken 13 years. They began prior to the creation of the World Trade Organization, under its predecessor, the GATT. It has been hard slogging, painful, detailed work, but it has come to a conclusion. 
   China wants into the WTO, the World Trade Organization. The price is to give us access to her markets. She has access to ours; hence, the imbalance of our trade, which is enormous just now. 
   I say, sir--and I think it would be agreed to--this will be very likely the most important legislative decision we have made in a decade or will make for a decade. At issue is the opening of American and world markets, which followed the calamitous conditions brought about by the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930. The opening began by Cordell Hull, in the form of the reciprocal trade agreements. 
   Every President since has expanded and continued this process. You see it all around you in unprecedented prosperity in those countries which first participated. 
   Now China wishes to do so. The condition is that we share in the Chinese market. It could not be more simple. We are not giving them anything they do not now have. They are giving us the treatment that is required by a member of the World Trade Organization. 
   Just this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported, in a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, that a solid majority of Democrats--almost 2 to 1--is in favor of this legislation. I am hesitant to tell my revered chairman that Republicans do not do as well. But on balance, the American people sense this. They have had the experience of it for three generations now. 
   Let's do it. 
   We had a fine hearing today. We had wonderful testimony from respected scholars on the subject--Merle Goldman from the Fairbanks institution--well, from Boston University--Nelson Graham, East Gates Ministries International, who is the son of the Rev. Billy Graham, and Michael A. Santoro, a professor from Rutgers. 
   The case is so clear, it should not be obscured or delayed. It is up to us. I think there is going to be another hearing, at least. I believe it is the intention of the chairman to have a legislative markup and, as we say, actually reporting out a bill in about a month's time.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Exactly so. It should. I do not think we can name it for you, but it certainly will be one of the great measures you have achieved in a long career, not yet concluded. I would observe that it took some prodding to get the legislation sent up to us. In his State of the Union Address on January 27, 2000, the President called upon Congress to pass legislation authorizing PNTR for China ``as soon as possible this year.'' It took almost two 
   months to get the Administration to produce a draft of the legislation, which the President formally transmitted to Congress on March 8. 
   But we have it now, and the President is fully committed to this, and we ought to move swiftly. 
   I want to clarify one important point: passage of this legislation will not determine whether China enters the WTO. China will enter the WTO regardless of Congress' action with respect to PNTR. But until we grant China PNTR, we cannot enter in to a full WTO relationship with China, which means that we cannot reap the full benefits of the trade agreement. 
   This is because the WTO--under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights--requires that WTO members grant each other immediate and unconditional normal trading  relations status. We do not do so now with respect to China. 
   China's trade status is conditioned on an annual review of China's compliance with the so-called Jackson-Vanik freedom-of-emigration provisions of the Trade Act of 1974. The President makes a determination by the third of June each year, which is then subject to review by the Congress. Because of this conditionality, the trade treatment that we currently accord China is insufficient under WTO rules. Until we grant China PNTR, we must invoke the WTO's so-called ``non-application'' provision--that is, Article XIII of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization--meaning that WTO benefits will not apply. 
   Simply put, we must grant China permanent normal trade relations status in order to reap the benefits that the United States, its workers and its companies will gain from China's entry into the WTO. And we ought to do so promptly.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it has been agreed that I will begin these brief remarks in order that our chairman might conclude the debate and proceed to the vote which I think has every prospect of being prodigious in its majority. 
   We have heard the compelling arguments to eliminate the so-called earnings penalty for persons 65 years and older. There is a short-term cost that is followed by a long-term payback, if you like, such that in a 20- to 30-year period the Social Security trust funds will not in any way be affected. The present practice is to decrease benefits to persons who continue working after their technical retirement age is reached, and then to compensate them after they reach age 70 or stop working. It is a complicated calculation. It is a cause of much distress, if you like, within the Social Security Administration--about $100 million a year just in sorting out the claims. It is not understood. There is the elemental fact that, although at 65 if you continue to work you know you will get back your benefits, that is in actuarial terms. For the cohort of several million persons, it will all be evened out. You may not be. So why not get rid of this archaic complexity? It is a remnant of Depression legislation of the 1930s. 
   In that regard, however, we do have the question attending the long-term deficit of the Social Security system. Yesterday our friend from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, spoke eloquently  about that matter, having raised it during his primary campaign on his side of the aisle. Senator KERREY spoke with equal eloquence. Senator MCCAIN was kind enough to note legislation that Senator KERREY and I have introduced in this matter. 
   In very short order, I would simply like to recapitulate the four simple steps which put Social Security on an actuarially sound basis for the next 75 years. They are: 
   No. 1, provide for an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. In 1996, the Boskin Commission originally estimated that the CPI overstates changes in the cost-of-living by 1.1 percentage points; now they say it is 0.8 of a percentage point. 
   No. 2, normal taxation of benefits. 
   No. 3, extend coverage to all newly hired State and local workers. 
   I might interject, if ever there was a holdover from the 1930s, it was this. It was not clear at that time whether the Federal Government could tax a State entity, so they were left untaxed. A great many workers in civil service positions pay no taxes on their principal jobs, but qualify for benefits from ``side'' jobs, and it is just not fair. We are not taking away anything, but just covering newly hired workers like everyone else. 
   No. 4, increase the length of the computation period from 35 to 38 years. 
   We now have a 75-year, long-term actuarial deficit of 2.07 percent. This would bring that down by 2.05 percent, leaving an inconsequential .02 percent over the 75-year period. 
   These are data based on actuarial calculations and they are clearly within our capacity. Let us hope one day we do it before it becomes too late. That time will come sooner than you may think.

   When the President gets back, I am sure the first thing he will do is sign it, or we can put it on a plane and send it to meet him halfway in Geneva. 
   But congratulations.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I could detain the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for just a moment to say how very much I agree, and I am sure this side agrees, with the points he has made, as the chairman has indicated. 
   In August of 1994, legislation reestablished the Social Security Administration as an independent agency. It had all but got lost in the Department of Health and Human Services. In the Congressional Directory there were more than 200 names between the name of the Secretary and the name of the Social Security Commissioner. It was very much an agency far down and with no real independence. It is now an independent agency. It has a trustees' report that comes out every year--the trustees being the Secretaries of the Treasury, of Labor, of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Social Security and two public trustees. It has the Social Security Advisory Board. 
   Now, after many years, we are sending out each year to every citizen over 25 a statement of how much they have paid into the system and what they could expect to receive as a benefit at the age of retirement and such like--information nobody ever had before. You could get it, but you had to know where to look for it. The kind of openness Senator GREGG speaks of continues this disposition. I hope we will reinforce it. I certainly think we could have language in our report commenting in this regard. I congratulate the Senator for what he has said.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is a special joy for this Senator, in his last months of his last term, to rise on this subject in perfect unity with the chairman. I will make remarks out of habit and custom perhaps, but I could not say anything better than has been said. I endorse it completely. 
   The House has done us a service in sending us a bill which we have been working on for years. Just 4 years ago, we increased the earnings limit to where it would be $30,000 by the year 2002. But now this gets rid of it. It is an anachronism. As the chairman said, when we enacted Social Security, unemployment was 25 percent. Sir, it is now 4 percent. The range of skills in our economy was wholly different then. Coal mines were no place for 70-year-olds; computer terminals are. It is as simple as that. 
   An absolutely important, central point to make is, the repeal of the earnings test has no long-run cost. All of the foregone benefits of continued work were made up later when retirement came, or at age 70. As the chairman has accurately said, calculating that makeup can be fantastically complex and has been costly. 
   It is the one complaint citizens have with Social Security. They believe they are not getting what is theirs. The adjudication and so forth is a needless waste and an expensive one. With this legislation, the problem will be behind us. 
   Repealing the earnings test, for those reaching normal retirement, will increase outlays by $19.4 billion over 6 years and $20.3 billion over 11 years, but this is simply the up-front costs of a long-term absolute even outcome. Extra benefits will not be paid because over time it will be, as you can say, a wash. The advantages are so much greater to pass this now when we have some comfort in our budgetary surplus in the Social Security trust fund. It is the right thing to do. 
   I say, and I think so would my revered chairman, that we would prefer to abolish all earnings tests for all retired workers. Right now, people can retire at age 62 and receive benefits, and there is a corresponding diminishment thereafter. We could get rid of all that very readily. But it is not before us today. Sufficient unto this day is the work we will have done. 
   I will leave it there, sir. I have some comments, but I will not go much further. 
   There are those who say: If you let people retire early at a lower level of benefit, they will do so. Then, later on their spouses will be deprived, and so forth. That is an argument I am not sure is appropriate to social insurance. 
   It is a fact that three-quarters of all persons now retire before age 65, which argues, I think--and I don't know why we can't learn more about this; we can if we would try--that Americans are pretty well off. They are in a position to do so, and they opt for it. We must keep in mind we are talking about social insurance. It is not for us to judge the behavior of the citizens who have paid into a system and are being paid back by it. 
   I think the finest summation of this was made by Winston Churchill in 1911. He was then a member of Parliament from the Liberal Party, and it fell to him to manage, as we are managing here, a system of unemployment insurance which we would get to in 1935 as a title in the Social Security Act. It took us another generation. 
   Churchill at that time was met with the argument that if you gave unemployed workers a benefit, an insurance benefit--they would pay into the system, the employer and the workers--that they would spend the money on drink. He said: ``Well, yes, perhaps; it's their money.'' He was not one much given to the ``nanny state,'' as I think the term was in these years. 
   It is not for us to judge how wisely people will exercise their options. They are their options. Today we have freed up the system, making it more comprehensible and saving a lot of administrative effort that is really, again, not productive. 
   I look forward to a good debate. I see my friend from Nebraska on the floor. He has been hugely influential in the discussion and debate about these matters in years past. I know he will be now. I look forward to listening with close attention to his comments. 
   With that, I thank the chairman once again and yield the floor.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Justice John J. Callahan, New York's longest serving Judge on the Supreme Court Appellate Division, Fourth Department. For 21 years he epitomized the honor and dignity to which all of us engaged in the political life of our nation should aspire. 
   What an exemplary alumni Saint Bonaventure University has chosen on which to bestow this prestigious tribute. The Gaudete Medal is awarded to leaders who have exemplified the philosophy of St. Francis of Assisi in their professional and personal lives. This spirit has been evident in Justice Callahan's dedication to his court, community, family, and his inspiring courage in spite of personal suffering. 
   To begin, one must know that Jack is a fellow Irish-American and the great and indispensable achievement of the Irish is that they made it American to be ethnic. He has contributed significantly to the Irish-American community in Buffalo. On the contribution of the Irish I have written:  
   What did the Irish do? First, they stayed in the cities, remaining highly visible. Next, they kept to their faith. Thus the Roman Catholic Church became a major American institution. Then they went into politics.  
   St. Bonaventure University has seen fit to honor a gentleman and a patriot. I knew of Jack's dedication to the Navy or should I say the Silent Service from working with him on numerous projects for the City of Buffalo, his cherished home. As a result of his tireless efforts all were successes. 
   It was back in 1978, at Jack's request, that I wrote to W. Graham Clayton who was the Secretary of the Navy at the time, to urge the Navy to name a submarine in honor of the Queen City of the Lakes. A nuclear powered attack submarine, the SSN 715 was christened the Buffalo in 1983 with the Judge, his wife Lillian, and their son Thomas, then a Midshipman at Annapolis, looking on. There hadn't been a ship named for Buffalo since 1922. 
   As a submarine veteran of World War II, the Judge felt that it was imperative that a decommissioned World War II type submarine be an integral part of the Buffalo & Erie County Naval & Servicemen's Park. A park that he himself helped make a reality. The USS Croaker is docked on the Buffalo River at the foot of Main Street in no small part to Judge Callahan's efforts. Some 20 of Jack's shipmates from the USS Sterlet SS 392 joined together to reminisce about their combat days in the Pacific theater aboard the USS Croaker 1996. As one who served in the Pacific theater, I can attest to the existence of a special camaraderie that unites those at sea for months at a time. 
   After returning from the war, Jack continued his education with the help of the G.I. Bill, as did I. Jack earned his undergraduate degree in Business Administration from St. Bonaventure University in 1951 and a Judicial Doctorate from the University of Buffalo Law School in 1954. Jack was honored by his alma mater, the University of Buffalo, with the Distinguished Alumni Award for the Judiciary in 1989. 
   The son of Irish immigrants from County Kerry, Judge Callahan possesses an exemplary work ethic and ability to endure any trial. Jack and Lillian Hart Callahan will be married for 40 years this July and from their union has come eight children and soon to be nine grandchildren. They have been truly blessed. 
   Thomas and Mary Bridget Callahan, Jack's parents, saw that their six children received a Catholic education through the Great Depression. Jack and Lillian made the opportunity for Catholic education available to their children and were sure to stress the value of such a privilege. Those efforts were not in vain. Their sons John Joseph Jr. and Patrick Francis are physicians. Appropriately, Patrick Francis, named in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, graduated from Saint Bonaventure University. Thomas, Timothy, and Michael all graduated from the United States Naval Academy. Not to be outdone--their three daughters; Mary Catherine Malley is a corporate attorney with Hodgson Russ Andrews Woods & Goodyear in Buffalo, Maureen Gallagher is a dentist, and Kathleen is my Deputy Press Secretary. I should thank Jack and Lillian for loaning her to me. 
   His legal background is both extensive and impressive. Judge Callahan practiced law as a trial lawyer in Buffalo for 20 years and served as a confidential clerk to New York State Supreme Court Justice Ann Mikol. He was elected to the New York State Supreme Court in 1975 and appointed to the Appellate Division by my good friend Governor Hugh Carey in 1979. 
   In his exceptional judicial career he has sat on approximately 20,000 cases. This past fall the Judge was honored by the Catholic Lawyers Guild as the recipient of the St. Thomas More Award which was given for his outstanding service to the legal community and the community at large. 
   It is with great pleasure that I join his family and many friends from Saint Bonaventure University and Buffalo to applaud this truly remarkable man.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that temporarily suspend duties on certain imports of goods not produced in the United States and five bills to reliquidate specific entries of vanadium and tomato sauce preparations. 
   The first bill will temporarily suspend the duty on imports of silica substrate. Silica substrates are produced only in Japan and imported for use in the domestic production of semiconductors. Currently, semiconductors enter the United States duty-free while imports of silica substrate are subject to a 4.9 per cent duty. As a result of this tariff inversion, there is a competitive imbalance which favors foreign production of semiconductors. My bill would extend the current suspension on duties of silica substrates until 2004. 
   The second bill will temporarily suspend the duty on imports of an environmentally friendly chemical paint additive. The product safely replaces mercury-based chemicals (which were banned a number of years ago) used in ``anti-fouling'' boat paint, intended to prevent fouling of underwater structures. It is also the only EPA-registered algicide for use in the architectural paint market. There is no known production of this chemical in the United States. 
   The third bill reliquidates thirty-seven entries of vanadium carbide and vanadium carbonitride. Vanadium is used primarily as a strengthening agent in steel and can only be imported from South Africa. The bill seeks to recover duties paid since July 1, 1998, the original date of a competitive need limit waiver by USTR, through December 23, 1999, when the waiver actually took effect. 
   The final four bills seek to reliquidate entries of canned tomatoes, used to prepare tomato sauce, by four separate companies. The imports were incorrectly subjected to 100 percent ad valorem retaliatory duties beginning in 1989 due to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule misclassification; the retaliation stemmed from a GATT case against the European Union. Treliquidation covers entries not originally included in a decision by the Court of International Trade, which ruled the products had been incorrectly classified and were, therefore, not subject to the retaliatory duties.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations to the community of Fillmore, New York on the occasion of its sesquicentennial, and to wish them great success with their May 27 to 29 celebration of this milestone. 
   What is now Fillmore was originally a small settlement nestled into the corner where Cold Creek joins the Genesee River. The land was once part of the Caneadea Indian Reservation. By 1826, the Seneca Indians, who owned the land, had sold off all of the reservation. In 1850, during the Presidency of Millard Fillmore, the second New York State native to hold that distinguished office, a post office was established. Local lore has it that the citizens decided to name the settlement Fillmore in order to convince the government to establish the post office. 
   The first settlers were attracted to the area by timber, but the building of the Genesee Valley Canal Line connecting the Erie Canal to the Allegany River brought an economic boom to all the areas along the line, including Fillmore. With its fertile soil, the Community eventually also became a farming area. 
   The citizens of Fillmore are proud of their backgrounds, their community, their State and their country. It is a community with a strong work ethic. It places a high priority on education and for years has supported a superior school system that is the envy of many larger communities. It is proud of the success of its young people, both those who leave and those who stay and believes that the values instilled by the citizens of the community is one of the reasons their young people are successful in their careers, be they farmers or educators in Fillmore, government workers in Washington, business leaders in Fillmore or across the country, or professors in America's great colleges and universities. 
   Fillmore has contributed many of its finest young men and women to serve this country in war and peace. All of them have served their country and their community with distinction and honor. During the Memorial Day weekend sesquicentennial celebration, Fillmore will remember with pride all of those service men and women who have served and are serving. It will pay special homage to those whose service required the ultimate sacrifice. 
   The community is planning for its future. It is hopeful of attracting new and modern businesses to the community. It is developing community projects to improve key services and improve the environment. It intends to continue to improve its already outstanding public school by adding any needed facilities and continuing to attract outstanding teachers. 
   It is anticipating with excitement its next 150 years.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President and my revered mentor, the Senior Senator from West Virginia, in his life, George Washington did two things without equal in the history of Government. 
   The American Colonies having revolted against the rule of King George III, Washington assumed command of a makeshift army and in 6 years fought his way to victory, whereupon he resigned as Commander in Chief and turned over the army to the civil authorities, such as they were. Fourteen years later, having served two terms as President of a new Government, he announced he would retire, although his reelection was not in doubt. These two actions, said George III, ``placed him in a light the most distinguished of any man living, the greatest character of the age''--looking back, we might say ``the greatest character of the ages''--for these two actions laid the foundations of republicanism which in his Farewell Address he presciently foresaw and fervently predicted would strengthen and grow across the world. 
   And now to the address proper. 
   Mr. MOYNIHAN, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows: To the people of the United States:

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000, which Senator ROBB introduced today. I am proud to join Senators SCHUMER, LAUTENBERG, LIEBERMAN, DODD, CHAFEE, MIKULSKI, WARNER, KERRY, and SARBANES as a cosponsor of this legislation, which will provide substantial tax savings to American workers and move commuters out of their cars, off our congested highways, and onto mass transportation systems.  
   The Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000 represents the latest in a decade-long series of Federal surface transportation policy reforms that began with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Instead of building highways irrespective of need or economic justification, we have, since ISTEA, turned our focus to improving the mobility of Americans while reversing some of the environmental degradation caused by highway congestion. We have made great progress and built formidable constituencies for balanced transportation investments, but arguments over Federal transportation priorities extend back to Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. In short, we must remain vigilant. 
   Under current law, employers may permit employees to set aside up to $65 of their monthly pre-tax salary to pay for commuting costs. This benefit, known as the transit/vanpool ``qualified transportation fringe,'' excludes up to $780 of a worker's annual salary from Federal income taxes and reduces employer payroll taxes while encouraging mass transit usage. If employers prefer, they may choose to offer the benefit in addition to an employee's salary. Under this system, workers receive a Federal tax-free benefit of up to $780 per year, which employers may provide at a far lower cost than a commensurate salary increase. 
   These are sensible measures that promote environmentally sound commuting practices, and reward working Americans. However, a similar benefit exists for employer-provided parking spaces with a monthly cap of $175 per month. For many commuters whose companies offer both the transit/vanpool and parking benefits, driving to work can be significantly cheaper. With this bill, my colleagues and I are stating that the Federal government should, at minimum, treat transit commuters and those who drive to work equally. Our proposal is to raise the cap on the transit/vanpool benefit to $175. 
   A second feature of the bill expands the availability of the transit/vanpool benefit to many Federal employees who are precluded from using it because of Federal employee compensation law. Specifically, under current law Federal employees may not ``cash-out'' their parking space benefit in exchange for either taxable income or the tax-free transit and vanpool benefit. This section of the bill permits Federal employees to enjoy the same benefits as their private sector counterparts. 
   I believe that this bill is long overdue. Federal tax policy should not encourage people to drive to work, and Federal employees should not be prohibited from enjoying the same tax benefits as other working Americans. In passing this bill, we can institute a measure of fairness into both Federal tax policy and Federal employee compensation. In addition, we can reduce automobile congestion and air pollution from our highways.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, along with my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, the Mother-to-child HIV Prevention Act, a bill that seeks to address mother-to-child transmission of HIV in developing regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  
   According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), nearly 4.5 million children below the age of 15 years have been infected with HIV since the AIDS epidemic began. More than 3 million have already died of AIDS. Children are becoming infected at the rate of nearly one child every minute, and the overwhelming majority of these children acquired the infection from their mothers. 
   In July 1999, the National Institutes of Health released a report on the effectiveness of a drug called nevirapine (NVP) in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. NVP is given just once to the mother during labor and once to the baby within three days after birth. It costs $4 per tablet. The discovery of this relatively simple and inexpensive drug regimen--along with others like it--has created an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight against the vertical transmission of HIV. 
   USAID is currently engaged in four of the eleven vertical transmission pilot projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These studies will be completed within the year, at which point the intervention programs can undergo a significant increase in scale. But additional funding is needed. 
   The cost-effectiveness of these programs is clear. New antiretroviral drug strategies can be a force for social change, providing the opportunity and impetus needed to address long-standing problems in the health care system and the profound stigma associated with HIV-infection and the AIDS disease. 
   Naturally, primary prevention strategies should remain the top priority in the fight against AIDS, which is why I am requesting these funds in addition to our current efforts. This legislation would give the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) an additional $25 million every year--for the next five years--to address the growing international dilemma of child victims of the AIDS epidemic. 
   Mr. President, this bill has the potential to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of children whose lives are marred by this disease. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I urge its swift passage into law.

He is a national treasure. He has served our Nation with principle and wisdom, and I shall attempt to show in these brief remarks, unprecedented success. 
   Let me cite four principal reasons--updated from four years ago--why he should again be confirmed by the Senate. 
   The economy is now in its 107th month of an expansion--the longest in American history--which shows no sign of ending. 
   The unemployment rate for December was 4.1 percent and has been below 5 percent for almost three years. Not too long ago, economists estimated that the NAIRU, as the acronym was for the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment--what we might call full employment--was about 6 percent. 
   Next, inflation is in check. Measured by the CPI--which economists believe overstates inflation--consumer prices have increased by less than 3 percent per year for the past three years. 
   Finally, the misery index--the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate--is about 7 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. 
   These outcomes are a tribute to Alan Greenspan's stewardship of our Nation's monetary policy for the past 13 years. But his wisdom and influence extend far beyond mere stewardship of monetary policy. 
   Last Wednesday, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs he had this to say in response to a question about the use of budget surpluses from Senator PHIL GRAMM, the Committee's Chairman, Dr. Greenspan said:  
   ..... my first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. ..... From an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.  
   And last month, in remarks before the Economic Club of New York, Chairman Greenspan demonstrated why he has been so successful. He understands--as perhaps few others in high level economic policy positions--how the economy works. One can only marvel at the clarity and insights he brought to bear as he explained to his audience the impact on productivity of just-in-time inventories, and reasons why the wealth effect from the increase in the stock market has sustained the current expansion, while at the same time containing ``the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that could undermine the current expansion.'' Ever vigilant to these potential dangers explains why the FED, under Chairman Greenspan, today increased interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point. 
   Based on his performance, Chairman Greenspan deserves to be reconfirmed. I have no doubt that the Senate will, in a near unanimous vote, concur.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to point out a concern I have with a seemingly innocuous, seemingly beneficial, provision contained in the Domenici amendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999--``Section X68. MODIFICATION OF EXCLUSION FOR EMPLOYER PROVIDED TRANSIT PASSES.'' The goal of the provision--to expand the use of the Federal transit benefit, a ``qualified transportation fringe'' in the vernacular--is admirable, but I fear that the way in which the provision pursues that goal may, in fact, unintentionally undermine the transit benefit. 
   The employer-provided Federal transit benefit has evolved since its creation within the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 as a $15 per month ``de minimis'' benefit. After fourteen years of gradual change, 1998's Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) codified the benefit as a ``pre-tax'' benefit of up to $65 per month. The cap will increase to $100 in 2002. The ``pre-tax'' aspect was a major reform because it provided an economic incentive--payroll tax savings--for employers to offer the program. Companies would save money by offering a benefit of great utility to their workers while simultaneously removing automobiles from our choked and congested urban streets and highways. It is effective public policy. (As an aside, I should note that a similar pre-tax benefit of $175 per month exists for parking, and so despite all we know about air pollution and the intractable problems of automobile congestion, Congress continues to encourage people to drive. Discouraging perhaps, but we're closing the gap. If one doesn't have thirty years to devote to social policy, one should not get involved!) 
   Quite consciously, and conscientiously, Congress established a bias in the statute toward the use of vouchers--which employers can distribute to employees--over bona fide cash reimbursement arrangements. We permitted employers to use cash reimbursement arrangements only when a voucher program was not ``readily available.'' We reasoned that because the vouchers could only be used for transit, we would eliminate the need for employees to prove that they were using the tax benefit for the intended purpose. Furthermore, by stipulating that voucher programs are the clear preference of Congress, we are compelling transit authorities to offer better services--monthly farecards, unlimited ride passes, smartcards, et al.--to the multitudes of working Americans who must presently endure all manner of frustrations and indignities during their daily work commute. 
   While the new law has only been in effect for less than two years, the program is catching on in our large metropolitan areas and should continue to expand. We have been alerted, however, to a legitimate concern of large multistate employers. Several of these companies have noted that establishing voucher programs can be arduous and unwieldy when the companies must craft separate programs in multiple jurisdictions with different transportation authorities. These difficulties, coupled with an expertise in administering cash reimbursement programs, have convinced the companies that bona fide cash reimbursement programs are more practical. Fair enough. 
   We should, therefore, make it easier for such companies to offer the benefit through cash reimbursement arrangements. While I am committed to that end, I have serious reservations about the repeal of the voucher preference contained in the Domenici amendment. 
   My main objection is that the U.S. Treasury is currently developing substantiation regulations for the administration of this benefit through cash reimbursement arrangements. These regulations will provide companies with a clear understanding of their obligations in the verification of their employees' transit usage, an understanding which does not exist today. Until these regulations are promulgated, voucher programs offer the only true mechanism of verification--vouchers, unlike cash, are useless unless enjoyed for their intended purpose. The Congress should not take an action that might rapidly increase the use of a tax benefit without the existence of accompanying safeguards to ensue the program's integrity. 
   I will work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, with my revered Chairman, and any Senator interested in this issue, to improve the ease with which companies can offer this important benefit to their employees. It is, after all, in our national interest. But I must strongly oppose efforts to repeal the voucher preference until the Treasury establishes a regulatory framework for cash reimbursement. We have been told to expect proposed regulations from the Treasury within the week. We anxiously await their arrival.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important event which occurred yesterday, January 25th--the 50th birthday of The Reverend Alphonse Stephenson. Father Stephenson was recently feted by over a hundred family members and friends and his 50th birthday warrants a few moments of the Senate's attention. 
   Father Alphonse is a native son of New Jersey, but he has shared his varied talents with people of New York City. Priest at the Catholic Actor's Chapel in New York City, musical conductor of ``A Chorus Line'' on Broadway, and founder and conductor of St. Peter's Orchestra by the Sea, are just a few of the ``hats'' worn by Father Alphonse. 
   But Father Alphonse also assists in providing for those less fortunate. The Orchestra of St. Peter's by the Sea, under the baton of Father Alphonse, has raised over two million dollars for various hospitals, such as our own St. Vincent's in New York City; educational facilities, such as Mount Saint Michael in the Bronx; and churches that assist the homeless, such as St. John's near Pennsylvania Station. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, he has created the Cecilia Foundation which allows young school children to experience the classics and even get a chance to conduct. The Cecilia Foundation provides musical instruments to children who would not get such an opportunity without the generosity of Father Alphonse. 
   Somehow, Father Alphonse has also found time to create the ``Festival of the Atlantic,'' a series of free concerts at Point Pleasant Beach and the largest outdoor musical endeavor in the State of New Jersey. Crowds of 10,000 and more are not uncommon. 
   He is also a Major and the Chief Chaplain of the 108th Refueling Wing at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey with another change in rank soon to occur! 
   An amazing list of accomplishments for one so young. As the Senate begins the 2nd Session of the 106th Congress, I join family and friends in wishing Father Alphonse a healthy and happy 50th Birthday--one wonders what the next 50 years will bring!

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senate for unanimously passing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 (S. 324), as Title II, Subsection B, of the DEFEAT Meth Act of 1999 (S. 486). The Senate's action today marks a milestone in the treatment of opiate dependence. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act increases access to new medications, such as buprenorphine, to treat opiate addiction. I thank my colleagues Senator  LEVIN (whose long-term vision inspired this legislation), Senator HATCH, and Senator BIDEN for their leadership and dedication in developing this Act, and I look forward to seeing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 become law. 
   Determining how to deal with the problem of addiction is not a new topic. Just over a decade ago when we passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, I was assigned by our then-Leader ROBERT BYRD, with Sam Nunn, to co-chair a working group to develop a proposal for drug control legislation. We worked together with a similar Republican task force. We agreed, at least for a while, to divide funding under our bill between demand reduction activities (60 percent) and supply reduction activities (40 percent). And we created the Director of National Drug Control Policy (section 1002); next, ``There shall be in the Office of National Drug Control Policy a Deputy Director for Demand Reduction and a Deputy Director for Supply Reduction.'' 
   We put demand first. To think that you can ever end the problem by interdicting the supply of drugs, well, it's an illusion. There's no possibility. 
   I have been intimately involved with trying to eradicate the supply of drugs into this country. It fell upon me, as a member of the Nixon Cabinet, to negotiate shutting down the heroin traffic that went from central Turkey to Marseilles to New York--``the French Connection''--but we knew the minute that happened, another route would spring up. That was a given. The success was short-lived. What we needed was demand reduction, a focus on the user. And we still do. 
   Demand reduction requires science and it requires doctors. I see the science continues to develop, and The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 will allow doctors and patients to make use of it. 
   Congress and the public continue to fixate on supply interdiction and harsher sentences (without treatment) as the ``solution'' to our drug problems, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge what various experts now know and are telling us: that addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease; that is, the brain undergoes molecular, cellular, and physiological changes which may not be reversible. 
   What we are talking about is not simply a law enforcement problem, to cut the supply; it is a public health problem, and we need to treat it as such. We need to stop filling our jails under the misguided notion that such actions will stop the problem of drug addiction. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 is a step in the right direction.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do wish there were more Members present that we might rise in a general applause to the Senator from Delaware, chairman of the Finance Committee. I refer to him as our revered colleague. This legislation could not be here, most of it would not have been conceived, without him. It is a triumph against what has become our procedures that it is here today and will shortly be approved. 
   Millions of Americans who will not know that he has done this will benefit from what he has done, and that, for him, will be sufficient knowledge and reward. I want to say that. 
   I don't want to speak at length because other Senators wish to join in this matter. I simply make two points. One is how very much I appreciate the chairman's mention of the importance of providing employer education assistance for graduate students. Go to any major metropolis in this country, any area where there is a college, and find night schools where young America and not so young come to acquire further skills and greater economic capacity. 
   Nothing could be more clearly in our national interests. It will go on whether we have a tax credit or not, but on the margins, it is important, first, recognizing the need for new skills, recognizing the need for developing new areas. Send our own employees to graduate school. Let them get this further degree while they are on the job, come back, be promoted, earn more, and be more valuable. 
   I spoke with our friend, the House majority leader, Mr. ARMEY. Of course he is a distinguished economist. He noted the last 5 years he was teaching, he was teaching at night school and teaching people who wanted to be there. They didn't have to be there to play soccer--put it that way. 
   I would secondly like to note, and I know the chairman would agree, absent from our measure today are two matters reported from the Committee on Finance: The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act of 1999 and the Caribbean Basin Initiative. They came out of the Finance Committee as near matter unanimous as can be--under our chairman, things come out of our committee unanimous. We did not suceed given the complexities of these negotiations this time. We will be back. I hope these matters will be addressed. I know on our side of the aisle, if you will, in the House, Representative Rangel, the ranking member in Ways and Means, my counterpart, very much hopes this will happen, and so do I. 
   Mr. President, I would briefly note, for the RECORD, some important provision in this legislation. 
   With regard to tax extenders, this bill extends the research and experimentation credit for five years and it extends all other provisions through December 31, 2001. Extending these provisions as long as possible was simply the right thing to do--providing certainty to employers and workers. 
   Might I add that some of these provisions are vitally important to working families. If we do not, for instance, pass the alternative minimum tax provision, approximately 1.1 million Americans will lose part or all of the $500 child credit, the HOPE scholarship credit, or other non-refundable credits. We also, rightfully so, extend the Welfare-to-work and the Work opportunity credits. 
   I would also like to clarify two matters with respect to a provision based on S. 213, which I introduced on January 19, 1999--and which is known as the rum cover-over provision. I am very pleased that we were able to increase from $10.50 to $13.25 the amount of excise taxes on rum that is transferred to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Unfortunately, procedural obstacles required a delay in most of the transfer from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001. Instead, up to $20 million will be transferred 15 days after enactment. The remainder of the amount will not, however, be transferred until after September 30, 2000. However, our distinguished Finance Committee Chairman, Senator ROTH, and Chairman ARCHER from the House Ways and Means Committee have made a commitment that, to the extend possible, the delayed payments will be accelerated, or interest on the delayed amounts will be provided for in the Africa and CBI legislation next year. 
   With respect to the second matter, the rum cover-over provision, as passed by this body on October 29, 1999, included an additional transfer of 50 cents from the government of Puerto Rico to the National Historic Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico--the purpose of which is the protection and enhancement of the natural resources of Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, the 50 cent transfer is not included in the legislation before us today. However, it is my understanding that the Governor of Puerto Rico, the Honorable Pedro Rossello, has made the commitment to transfer one-sixth (45 cents), of the increase provided by this legislation, to the Trust. I applaud the Governor for his commitment. 
   I am also very pleased that this legislation would remedy some of the barriers and disincentives that individuals enrolled in Federal disability programs face in returning to work. Many disabled Americans do not return to work because they must lose their health care coverage and because they have inadequate access to employment and rehabilitation services. 
   In 1986, we took our first step to remove obstacles facing disabled Americans who want to work. Our former Finance Committee Chairman and Majority Leader--Senator DOLE--introduced the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act to make permanent a demonstration project that enabled Supplemental Security Income--or ``SSI'' recipients to maintain Medicaid benefits during a transition to work. I was an original co-sponsor of the bill which was enacted on November 11, 1986. Building on that first step and other subsequent initiatives, Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, ROTH and I introduced this work incentives bill in the Senate on January 28th of this year. The legislation has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support, passing the Senate 99-0 on June 16th and the House 412-9 on October 19. 
   The bill addresses an issue of paramount concern: how to encourage disabled individuals to return to work. Currently, less than one-half of one percent of individuals receiving disability benefits now leave the rolls and return to work. A survey by the National Organization on Disability found that only 29 percent of all disabled adults are employed full-time or part-time, compared to 79 percent of the non-disabled adult population. The disabled find it difficult to work because if they earn income above a certain level, they lose their disability benefits and their health care coverage. In fact, witnesses testifying before the Finance Committee cited the potential loss of health care coverage as the primary obstacle between the disabled and their ability to work. 
   This legislation tries to remove this barrier by guaranteeing that working individuals with disabilities can maintain their Medicare and Medicaid coverage for a longer period of time. Under  current law, Social Security disability beneficiaries, who go back to work and earn a modest income, may only continue their Medicare coverage for four years. This legislation would permit disabled workers to retain their Medicare coverage for an additional four and a half years. 
   Two important Medicaid provisions are included in this bill. The first would permit more lower-income disabled workers to pay premiums and buy into the Medicaid program. The second establishes a demonstration project that would provide Medicaid coverage to persons likely to become disabled without medical treatment. This is good common-sense policy: providing preventive health coverage to working individuals with serious medical conditions before such conditions worsen to a disabling level. 
   This legislation does more than just extend greater health care coverage to the disabled. Through a program called ``Ticket to Work,'' it would make it easier for disabled workers to access coordinated vocational rehabilitation and employment assistance services. It provides grants to States to develop the program infrastructure and to perform the outreach necessary to help disabled individuals to work. The legislation would also ensure that a mere return to work does not automatically trigger eligibility reviews that could result in being removed form the disability rolls. In addition, it would streamline the process for individuals to be reinstated for disability benefits, if they are unable to continue working. 
   Lastly, the bill funds Social Security demonstration projects on how best to encourage disabled individuals to return to work. For example, one innovative project will determine whether a sliding-scale reduction of disability benefits by $1 for every $2 earned would make it easier to go back to work. Such a result seems far more reasonable than the current situation where workers who earn income above a statutory limit lose their disability benefits entirely. 
   The overwhelming support for his legislation is not surprising given its simple and universal goal: providing disabled Americans the opportunity they deserve to work and contribute to the fullest of their ability. For Americans with disabilities, enacting this legislation would take a great step forward in removing the many barriers they face in returning to work. 
   Before I conclude, Mr. President, I did want to mention that regrettably, this bill includes an extraneous provision delaying implementation of a new regulation to improve the Nation's system of allocating human organs for transplant. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his commitment to this tax extenders and work incentive legislation. I would also like to thank the staffs of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Way and Means and Commerce Committees. Now, let's go home.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 2 years ago, as part of the effort to balance the Federal budget, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--which we have come to know as the ``BBA.'' Among other provisions, the BBA enacted major changes in the way Medicare pays for medical services. As implementation of these changes proceeds, concerns have been raised that some of them are having unintended consequences that threaten the viability of health care providers--and consequently the overall availability of health care to our constituents. 
   In order to alleviate some of these unintended consequences of the BBA, the appropriations conference report before the Senate today incorporates by reference H.R. 3426, the ``Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.'' This legislation will restore some $17 billion over 10 years to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and other Medicare and Medicaid providers. The bill will also facilitate administrative actions that will provide an additional $10 billion of relief to hospital outpatient departments. 
   H.R. 3426 has many important provisions; here are some of the highlights: 
   Teaching hospitals will receive $600 million in additional Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments over fiscal years 2000 and 2001. They will also benefit from other provisions that add money back to hospital outpatient departments, and which scale back cuts in Medicare disproportionate share payments to hospitals serving low-income patients. I will have more to say about teaching hospitals in a moment. 
   Rural hospitals will be assisted by: an exemption from the new payment system for hospital outpatient departments; improvements in the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) program; a 5-year extension of the Medicare Dependent Hospital program; and an update in payments for Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs). 
   Skilled Nursing Facilities--usually referred to as SNFs--would receive $2.1 billion of assistance over 10 years by: increasing payments for certain medically complex patients; permitting SNFs to switch immediately to a more favorable payment system; and excluding certain high cost items from consolidated billing. 
   The caps on payments for rehabilitation therapy would be suspended for two years pending development of a better payment system; and hospice facilities, which are covered under Medicare part A, would receive temporary payment increases in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. 
   Other provisions of the bill would: stabilize the formula used to calculate payment for physician services; lift time limits for state use of a fund for delinking of welfare and Medicaid eligibility; slow the phase-down of a Medicaid cost reimbursement to community health centers and rural health clinics; and provide adjustments to the State Children's Health Insurance Program--known as CHIP--which was enacted by the BBA of 1997

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for the past twelve and one-half years, I have served as the Democratic co-chairman of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition. John Heinz was the Republican co-chairman until his tragic death in 1991; since then, I have been pleased to work with the junior Senator from Vermont, Jim JEFFORDS. We and other Coalition Members have worked closely with the Northeast-Midwest Institute, the premier non-partisan, not-for-profit regional policy research center. A superb board of directors guides the Institute. I rise this afternoon to commend three New Yorkers who are ending their terms on the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors. They have provided distinguished service and have helped to advance the region's economic vitality and environmental quality. 
   Former Representative Frank Horton has been involved with the Northeast-Midwest organizations for almost 25 years. Indeed, he was one of the founders of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition, our House counterpart, and served as its Republican co-chairman until he retired from the House in 1992. Frank had a distinguished career spanning 30 years, representing Rochester and serving for many years as ranking member on the Government Operations Committee. We--I speak now on behalf of the New York Congressional delegation--revered Frank and were grateful for his counsel. He was our dean. Frank recently has been with the DC-based law firm of Venable, Baetjer, Howard & Civiletti. 
   Gerald Benjamin, another Northeast-Midwest Institute Board Member whose six-year term is ending, is dean of Liberal Arts & Sciences at the State University of New York at New Paltz. Jerry is a respected scholar, who has focused on Federalism--a subject near and dear to my heart--and public policy development. He has been active in New York politics, having served as county legislator and chairman in Ulster County. Jerry also was appointed as a member of the New York State Equalization and Assessment Panel and the Lower Hudson Study Commission on School District Reorganization and Sharing.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some 4 months ago I was proud to cosponsor  this legislation when it was introduced by the late Senator John Chafee. I am prouder today that we are passing it. I am saddened, though, that he is not here with us to see it happen. 
   This legislation is typical of the work of Senator Chafee. It helps disadvantaged, often forgotten, children--those who are victims of abuse and neglect and have to be taken into foster care. It is practical. The bill is targeted and will help expand small-scale efforts already on the ground. And it is bipartisan, representing a consensus on how to move forward now. 
   In particular, this bill will help a group of our children in dire circumstances--foster children who leave foster care because they ``age out,'' not because they are reunified with their birth families or are adopted. About 20,000 children a year ``age out'' of the foster care system. They reach 18 and we, in large part, abandon them to the world. Many make their way successfully. But far too many, alas, do not, and these children are more likely to become homeless or end up on public assistance. 
   More than a decade ago, we recognized that these children needed additional help in preparing for life on their own. I am proud to have helped create the Independent Living program, which provided Federal support for efforts that prepare teenagers for the transition from foster care to independence. The bill will double funding for the Independent Living program and increase the use of the funds to assist former foster care children until they reach 21, including, for the first time, help with room and board. As any parent knows, many 19- and 20-year-olds remain in need of family support from time to time. For children who have ``aged out'' of foster care by turning 18, the government is, in effect, their parent and we should do more to help them become independent and self-sufficient, just as other parents do. 
   This legislation has widespread support, including from the administration and key members of both parties. I would like to particularly thank the First Lady for her leadership in working on behalf of these children. Senator ROCKEFELLER and Chairman ROTH have been important as well. But, above all, I thank the late Senator Chafee.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this amendment retains existing bankruptcy law for low-income persons. A feature of the law as it now exists and which is perfectly sensible is the presumption that people who incur debt shortly before declaring bankruptcy have acted fraudulently. Clearly, this can be the case, is often the case, and is proven so. 
   However, the bill presently before the Senate extends the time (from 60 days to 90 days for consumer debts, for instance) in which this presumption of fraudulent activity takes place, and it changes the dollar amounts. We propose to keep the law as it is for low-income persons--people below the median income level, who already live hand-to-mouth, who often find themselves in a bind, with no intent to defraud, and keep borrowing until they are in bankruptcy situations. They won't have lawyers and can't defend against presumptions. 
   We simply keep the existing law. Deal with true fraud and important bankruptcies as the bill proposes to do but leave the small and hapless folk to their small and hapless fortunes. 
   The administration supports this measure, as does my friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, and his associate in these matters, Ms. LANDRIEU of Louisiana.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the amendment is a small matter in the larger context of the legislation we are dealing with, but a very large matter to the people we are talking about who are low-income debtors. This addresses two aspects of the bill that have disproportionate negative impacts on low-income debtors. 
   The first aspect concerns consumer debt and cash advances. The second relates to debt incurred to pay nondischargeable debt. By nondischargeable debt, we mean the debt a consumer has to repay even if they declare bankruptcy. There are very common-sense provisions in our bankruptcy laws that say if you acquire a large debt in a short period before declaring bankruptcy, there is some presumption that you knew where you were heading and you were taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws. 
   Under current law, consumer debts owed to a single creditor--excluding ``goods or services reasonably necessary''--of more than $1,075 obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy and cash advances of more than $1,075 obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy are presumed to be fraudulent and thus nondischargeable.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on November 6, Nat Hentoff devoted his ever insightful column to the Kafka-like use of secret evidence by our Federal government in deportation proceedings. Once again, Mr. Hentoff has highlighted yet another distressing aspect of the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. I ask that Mr. Hentoff's column be printed in the RECORD. 
   The column follows.  
   Prosecution in Darkness  
   Around the country, 24 immigrants, most of them Muslim or of Arab descent, are being detained--that is, imprisoned--by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which intends to deport them. 
   None of them, nor any of their lawyers, has been allowed to see the evidence against them or to confront their accusers. This denial of fundamental due process is justified on the grounds of national security. 
   In 1996, the president signed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which authorized secret evidence. A federal district judge in Newark, N.J., William Walls, has now described this as ``government processes initiated and prosecuted in darkness.'' (The use of secret evidence, however, goes back to the 1950s). 
   Although many active lawsuits, in various stages, are attacking this use of secret evidence, Judge Walls is the first jurist to flatly declare the use of such evidence unconstitutional. 
   His decision was in the case of Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen, a Palestinian who has been in this country for nine years, managed an electronics store in New Jersey and is married to an American citizen. 
   First arrested for having an expired student visa, he later was accused of meeting in his New Jersey home, a week before the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, with one of the men convicted in that attack. He also was accused of threatening to kill Attorney General Janet Reno. 
   The source of this classified evidence is the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. But, as Judge Walls has noted, the INS failed to produce any witnesses--either from the FBI or from the INS--or ``original source material'' in support of these charges. Therefore no witnesses could be cross-examined at the hearings. 
   At the hearings, Kiareldeen produced witnesses and other evidence that he was not living in the town where he is supposed to have met with bombing conspirators. And an expert witness, Dr. Laurie Myleroie, appeared for him. She is described by James Fox, former head of the FBI's New York office, as ``one of the world-class experts regarding Islam and the World Trade Center bombing.'' She testified that no evidence showed that the accused had any connection with that bombing. 
   The government's evidence, said the judge, failed ``to satisfy the constitutional standard of fundamental fairness.'' The INS--part of the Justice Department--denied Kiareldeen's ``due process right to confront his accusers ..... even one person during his extended tour through the INS's administrative procedures.'' 
   These due process protections, declared the judge, ``must be extended to all persons within the United States, citizens and resident aliens alike. ..... Aliens, once legally admitted into the United States are entitled to the shelter of the Constitution.'' The judge went even farther. Even if the government's reliance on secret evidence has been provably based on a claim of national security, Judge Walls--quoting from a District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision, Rafeedie v. INS--asked ``whether that government interest is so all-encompassing that it requires that the petitioner be denied virtually every fundamental feature of due process.'' 
   In Rafeedie, Judge David Ginsburg noted in 1989 that the permanent resident alien in That case, in this country for 14 years, was ``like Joseph K. in Kafka's `The Trial' in that he could only prevail if he ware able to rebut evidence that he was not permitted to see.'' 
   Kiareldeen is now free after 19 months, but Judge Walls's decision that secret evidence is unconstitutional applied only to the state of New Jersey. The INS did not pursue its appeal because it wants to avoid a Supreme Court decision. The INS continues to insist it will keep on using secret evidence. 
   One of the victims of these prosecutions in darkness still in prison is Nasser Ahmed, who has been in INS detention for 3 1/2 years. 
   Congress has the power to bring in the sunlight by passing the Secret Evidence Repeal Act of 1999 (H.R. 2121)--introduced in June by Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.). It would ``abolish the use of secret evidence in American courts and reaffirm the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process.'' 
   Will a bipartisan congress vote in favor of the Constitution? And then, will the president allow the removal of the secret evidence provisions of his cherished 1996 Anti-Terrorism Act?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise now to echo the sentiment of my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, that the passage of the Republican drug amendment marks a bittersweet moment. I, too, regret that I had to vote against the Republican drug amendment today, because it contains a provision that is very important to me, which I will address in a moment. I voted against the Republican drug amendment as a whole because of the provision that would expand the number of people who would come within the reach of mandatory minimum sentences for certain offenses involving cocaine. I feel very strongly that the correct way to address the problem of addiction is not by increasing the reach of mandatory minimum sentences, but rather to increase access to treatment. And that is why passage of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of  1999 (S. 324), in Subtitle B, Chapter 2, of the Republican drug amendment, marks a milestone in the treatment of opiate dependence. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act increases access to new medications, such as buprenorphine, to treat addiction to certain narcotic drugs, such as heroin. I thank my colleagues Senator LEVIN, Senator HATCH, and Senator BIDEN for their leadership and dedication in developing this Act, and regardless of the outcome of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, one way or another, I look forward to seeing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 become law. 
   Determining how to deal with the problem of addiction is not a new topic. Just over a decade ago when we passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, I was assigned by our then-Leader ROBERT BYRD, with Sam Nunn, to co-chair a working group to develop a proposal for drug control legislation. We worked together with a similar Republican task force. We agreed, at least for a while, to divide funding under our bill between demand reduction activities (60 percent) and supply reduction activities (40 percent). And we created the Director of National Drug Control Policy (section 1002); next, ``There shall be in the Office of National Drug Control Policy a Deputy Director for Demand Reduction and a Deputy Director for Supply Reduction.'' 
   We put demand first. To think that you can ever end the problem by interdicting the supply of drugs, well, it's an illusion. There's no possibility. 
   I have been intimately involved with trying to eradicate the supply of drugs into this country. It fell upon me, as a member of the Nixon Cabinet, to negotiate shutting down the heroin traffic that went from central Turkey to Marseilles to New York--``the French Connection''--but we knew the minute that happened, another route would spring up. That was a given. The success was short-lived. What we needed was demand reduction, a focus on the user. And we still do. 
   Demand reduction requires science and it requires doctors. I see the science continues to develop, and The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 will allow doctors and patients to make use of it. 
   Congress and the public continue to fixate on supply interdiction and harsher sentences (without treatment) as the ``solution'' to our drug problems, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge what various experts now know and are telling us: that addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease; that is, the brain undergoes molecular, cellular, and physiological changes which may not be reversible. 
   What we are talking about is not simply a law enforcement problem, to cut the supply; it is a public health problem, and we need to treat it as such. We need to stop filling our jails under the misguided notion that such actions will stop the problem of drug addiction. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 is a step in the right direction.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote to reappoint Surface Transportation Board, STB, Chairman Linda J. Morgan to serve another term on that panel even though I am troubled by some STB decisions concerning the CSX and Norfolk Southern acquisition of Conrail properties in New York State. I am encouraged, however, by Chairman Morgan's responsiveness to my requests, and those of my colleagues, to monitor the freight rail problems that have plagued New Yorkers since the June 1, 1999 implementation of the CSX/Norfolk Southern acquisition. Just last month, Chairman Morgan came to Buffalo to hear the concerns of local shippers. 
   As she begins her second term as Chairman of the STB, Linda Morgan has presided over the largest rail mergers in this Nation's history. Now the hard part begins. If service failures persist, Chairman Morgan must exercise her statutory authority to impose conditions upon the railroads. This will be no easy task. Revising one's work in the face of significant opposition requires courage. But I am confident that should the public interest so require, Chairman Morgan will respond boldly. Nothing short of the future of freight rail in the United States is at stake. 
   One additional thought is the role of organized labor in the freight rail industry. I would note that I do not find it fair that an interpretation of current Federal law permits the STB to revisit collective bargaining agreements dozens of years after a merger has been completed. There is a certain logic to providing the STB with the authority to abrogate local, State, and Federal laws to ensure the success of a merger. But the prospect that collective bargaining agreements--private contracts--can be the subject of renegotiation and mediation years after a merger has been consummated is troubling. In the 2nd session of the 106th Congress I will seek legislation to constrict the window of time following the  approval of a merger in which unions can be compelled to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements. 
   In closing, Mr. President, the Surface Transportation Board faces extraordinarily difficult decisions in the next few years. I believe that Linda Morgan's experience as a trusted advisor and counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee and her chairmanship of the STB have prepared her well for the challenges that lie ahead. I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for voicing their justified concerns on this important issue. I understand that there is the potential for language to be added to one of the remaining appropriations bills that would interfere with the efforts of a number of states to seek relief from dangerous air pollution they receive from a number of large coal-burning facilities which may have violated the Clean Air Act. 
   As Senator LIEBERMAN has explained, a number of coal-burning facilities were ``grandfathered,'' exempting them from pollution control requirements. Congress believed that utilities would soon retire these older plants. The grandfathered facilities were given permission to proceed with routine maintenance, but any major modifications would be subject to review. It now appears that a number of these facilities did circumvent the law by increasing generating capacity without installing the appropriate pollution control technologies. 
   Now, it appears these same facilities--after receiving notification that New York and potentially other states intend to sue for these violations of the Clean Air Act--may, once again, circumvent the law by encouraging the adoption of a rider which would interfere with these lawsuits. Any effort by implicated utilities to thwart efforts of States to obtain injunctive relief, which States could use to mitigate damage which has already occurred, is inappropriate. 
   Throughout my career, I have been a strong proponent of allowing the Courts to do their work without interference of politics--indeed, that was the intent of the Framers of the Constitution. Madison and Hamilton eloquently explained the importance of a balance of powers in The Federalist Papers. The Framers of the Constitution presumed conflict. The Constitution assumes self-interest. It carefully balances the power by which one interest will offset another interest, and the  outcome will be, in that wonderful phrase of Madison, `the defect of better motives.' 
   The States must be allowed to protect their rights. I should think that any Member of this body ought to defer to the courts before which this issue is now being placed.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my fellow New Yorker George Gabriel on the occasion of his 90th birthday. George has been a war veteran, tennis instructor, lawyer, and vice president of Broadcast Music, Incorporated (B.M.I.). His family will always know him for his love of classical music, quick wit, and pertinent advice. 
   During World War II, George was stationed in Australia and the Philippines. He distinguished himself as a member of the Army's code-breaking operations, reading enciphered cables intercepted from Japan. This might explain his affinity for the always challenging New York Times crossword puzzles! 
   After the war, he graduated from Brooklyn Law School and went to work for B.M.I. His work in the field of music copyright prompted a quick rise up the corporate ladder. He was eventually promoted to the position of vice president, where he remained until the time of his retirement. 
   Yet, for all his professional achievements, it is his personal life that gives him the most fulfillment. This epochal moment marks a grand achievement for a man who is a mentor to grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. I offer my prayers to George for continued good health and cheer, and close with a particularly apt Irish blessing: 
 May joy and peace surround you, Contentment latch your door, And happiness be with you now, And bless you evermore.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a milestone will occur on Wednesday, December 15th, while the Senate is in recess, which I do not want to go unacknowledged. Dr. John O. Lusins of Oneonta, New York will celebrate his sixtieth birthday. In his five decades, this New Yorker has grown from a childhood war refugee into a beloved husband, devoted physician, respected oenophile, and caring father of five children. Suffice to say, Dr. Lusins has accomplished the American dream. I wish him hearty congratulations on this achievement. 
   Named after his physician father, John O. Lusins was born December 15th, 1939 in the Baltic country of Latvia. At age twelve, John and his mother, Elza, immigrated to the United States after being displaced for several years as a result of World War II. Seeking a better life after witnessing the atrocities in Europe, the two lived briefly in Greensboro, North Carolina before settling in Yonkers, New York. 
   John entered the Andrus Home for Children at age fifteen, and proved himself to be an anomaly among his peers by graduating from Charles E. GORTON High School in 1958. With continued perseverance, Lusins, under the aegis of a SURDNA scholarship, went on to graduate from Columbia University in 1963 and the Albany School of Medicine in 1967. 
   During these years, John not only excelled academically but proved himself as an athlete, leader, and a patriot. Throughout his collegiate career, John powered Columbia's varsity crew down the Harlem River and was named captain for his senior year in 1962. Following his junior year, however, Lusins was called to military duty in Germany as the Soviets erected the Berlin Wall. After fulfilling his military obligations, he returned to New York and subsequently finished college. 
   Before leaving for Berlin, John met a dashing young lady by the name of Anna Marie Dahlgard Bistany. Upon his return, the two promptly fell in love and were married on the 17th of August, 1963. Their first children were two daughters: Gillian, born in 1964, and Noelle in 1966. Three boys followed: Carl in 1968, John in 1973, and, finally, Matthew in 1976. 
   The family moved over the years, from Yonkers to Bronxville, finally making Oneonta their home in 1982. Filling a needed void, John established his neurology practice at Oneonta's A.O. Fox Hospital in the same year. Since then, Lusins and his practice, now the multi-partner Catskill Neurodiagnostics and MRI, has become one of Central New York's finest and most respected medical centers. 
   Revered not only for his medical capabilities, Dr. Lusins has also established himself as a prominent American asset to the world of fine wine. Equipped with erudition and a discerning palate, this afficionado is not only a member of the prestigious New York Commandeire de Bordeaux but has proficiently ascended the ranks of the Confr&#233;rie des Chevaliers du Tastevin to become their distinguished D&#233;l&#233;gu&#233; G&#233;n&#233;ral of the Northeast. Dedicated to these roles, Dr. Lusins educates family, colleagues, and all constituents about the intricacies and appreciation of wine. This significant task should not be taken lightly, as our Founding Framer and President Thomas Jefferson once noted:  
   By making this wine vine known to the public, I have rendered my country as great a service as if I had enabled it to pay back the national debt..... Its extended use will carry health and comfort to a much enlarged circle.  
   With the gathering of all his friends and family, I wish Dr. Lusins a splendid sixtieth birthday and continued success in all his endeavors.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senate has just confirmed Daniel French as the new United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York and may I say I could not be more pleased. 
   Dan French is a native of the District having been born and brought up in Jefferson County, graduated cum laude from the University of the State of New York College at Oswego and is a cum laude graduate of the Syracuse University Law School where he served as an editor of the Law Review. Following law school Mr. French clerked for Judge Rosemary Pooler. Judge Pooler was then a United States District Court Judge and not sits on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. French then joined the U.S. Attorney's office where he served until being named interim United States Attorney by Attorney General Janet Reno. 
   Like all of the District Court and U.S. Attorney Candidates I have recommended to the President, Mr. French was sent to me by my Screening Panel after he and other candidates were seen and their credentials reviewed. 
   But I must say I was particularly pleased to send Dan's name to the President. And pleased that the President, after reviewing his record, agreed that he should be nominated. For Dan French was with me for several years as a professional staff member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Committee on Finance and on my personal staff. I know him well. And I know that he has the kind of intelligence, learning, judgment and integrity that will make him an outstanding U.S. Attorney. 
   Mr. President, the Northern District of New York, in which our family home at Pindars Corners is located is vast. It services 3.5 million citizens and encompasses 32 of New York's 62 counties, covering 60% of the State's geographical area. By comparison, the district is larger than the combined land areas of Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. This large area with a diverse population is fortunate to have a native son, who understands its ways, enforcing the laws of the United States. 
   Years ago, another upstater, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote that ``the citizen's safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with humility.'' I know that Dan French will be guided by Justice Jackson's words. 
   Dan French will be a splendid U.S. Attorney and I congratulate him on his confirmation and salute his wife, television broadcaster Kelly French and their two children Margaret Anne and Gavin Mitchell.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to point out a concern I have with a seemingly innocuous, seemingly beneficial, provision contained in the Domenici amendment to S. 625, the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999''--Section 68. Modification of Exclusion for Employer Provided Transit Passes. The goal of the provision--to expand the use of the Federal transit benefit, a ``qualified transportation fringe'' in the vernacular--is admirable, but I fear that the way in which the provision pursues that goal may, in fact, unintentionally undermine the transit benefit. 
   The employer-provided Federal transit benefit has evolved since its creation within the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 as a $15 per month ``de minimis'' benefit. After fourteen years of gradual change, last year's Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) codified the benefit as a ``pre-tax'' benefit of up to $65 per month. The cap will increase to $100 in 2002. The ``pre-tax'' aspect was a major reform because it provided an economic incentive--payroll tax savings--for employers to offer the program. Companies would save money by offering a benefit of great utility to their workers while simultaneously removing automobiles from our choked and congested urban streets and highways. It is effective public policy. (As an aside, I should note that a similar pre-tax benefit of $175 per month exists for parking, and so despite all we know about air pollution and the intractable problems of automobile congestion, Congress continues to encourage people to drive. Discouraging perhaps, but we're closing the gap. If one doesn't have thirty years to devote to social policy, one should not get involved!) 
   Quite consciously, and conscientiously, Congress established a bias in the statute toward the use of vouchers--which employers can distribute to employees--over bona fide cash reimbursement arrangements. We permitted employers to use cash reimbursement arrangements only when a voucher program was not readily available. We reasoned that because the vouchers could only be used for transit, we would eliminate the need for employees to prove that they were using the tax benefit for the intended purpose. Furthermore, by stipulating that voucher programs are the clear preference of Congress, we are compelling transit authorities to offer better services--monthly farecards, unlimited ride passes, smartcards, et al.--to the multitudes of working Americans who must presently endure all manner of frustrations and indignities during their daily work commute. 
   While the new law has only been in effect for little more than a year, the program is catching on in our large metropolitan areas and should continue to expand. We have been alerted, however, to a legitimate concern of large multistate employers. Several of these companies have noted that establishing voucher programs can be arduous and unwieldy when the companies must craft separate programs in various jurisdictions with different transportation authorities. These difficulties, coupled with an expertise in administering cash reimbursement programs, have convinced the companies that bona fide cash reimbursement programs are more practical. Fair enough. 
   We should, therefore, make it easier for such companies to offer the benefit through cash reimbursement arrangements. While I am committed to that end, I have serious reservations about the repeal of the voucher preference contained in the Domenici amendment. 
   My main objection is that the U.S. Treasury is currently developing substantiation regulations for the administration of this benefit through cash reimbursement arrangements. These  regulations will provide companies with a clear understanding of their obligations in the verification of their employees' transit usage, an understanding which does not exist today. Until these regulations are promulgated, voucher programs offer the only true mechanism of verification, as vouchers, unlike cash, are useless unless enjoyed for their intended purpose. The Congress should not take an action that might rapidly increase the use of a tax benefit without the existence of accompanying safeguards to ensue the program's integrity. 
   I will work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, with my revered Chairman, and any Senator interested in this issue, to improve the ease with which companies can offer this important benefit to their employees. It is, after all, in our national interest. But I must strongly oppose efforts to repeal the voucher preference until the Treasury establishes a regulatory framework for cash reimbursement. We have been told to expect the regulations by mid-January. We anxiously await their arrival. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have been debating the subject of banking in the Senate since the 18th century. We began to ask ourselves a question, could we have a national bank,  which Mr. Hamilton, of New York, thought we could do and should do. We created one. It had a very brief tenure. It went out of existence just in time that the Federal Government had no financial resources for the War of 1812. So it was reinstituted, in 1816 for 20 years, and went out of existence just in time for the panic of 1837. We went through greenbacks. There must have been a wampum period. We went to gold coinage. Then a free coinage of silver dominated our politics for almost two decades, as farmers sought liquidity and availability of credit. Finally, at the end of the century of exhaustive debate, we more or less gave up and adopted what we now call the Federal Reserve System. 
   To say we debated this matter for a century is certainly true. For the last quarter century, we have turned our focus to the nonbank bank. You are really reaching for obscurity when you define an issue as we have done, and yet that seems to be the term with which we have to deal. 
   The issue of the nonbank banks, were banks will be allowed to expand into newly authorized businesses such as securities and insurance underwriting, could finally be resolved in the Senate today. As we consider the conference report on financial modernization and prepare to pass the most significant piece of banking legislation since the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, I would like to make two points, followed by a coda. The first being that we need financial modernization, that Depression-era banking laws need to be repealed. A May 4, 1999, Washington Post editorial reads:  
   Since the Depression, Federal law has sought to keep banking, insurance and securities industries separate. The idea, in part, was to make sure that Federally insured bank deposits didn't wind up somewhere risky and unregulated. But in recent years, even without a change in the law, that separation has eroded. Banks have found ways to offer mutual funds to their customers; investment firms function like deposit institutions; etc. It makes sense now to bring legislation--and regulation--in line with reality.  
   It strikes me as odd that most corporations are free to engage in any lawful business. Banks, by contrast, are limited to the business of banking. It is generally agreed that the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 need to be amended. Banks, security firms, and insurance companies should be allowed to offer each other's services. They already do by finding loopholes in the law. Congress must catch up, and pass a law that condones this activity. London does it. Tokyo too. Why not New York, which, if I may say, is one of the world's banking capitals? 
   This is a real problem for existing banks, who find themselves under the serious constraints of Depression-era banking laws. Suddenly, they find that their activities are encroached upon and they are not able to do things that they ought to do--that they are going to need to do--in order to survive in a competitive world economy. 
   With this bill, we have the opportunity to modernize our financial institutions and allow banks to do the things they ought to do, that they are going to need to do, to survive and grow. We must seize this opportunity, pass this bill, and give our banks the opportunity to compete in the world economy. 
   Now to the second point. When this bill came up for a vote last May, I could not support it because the provisions concerning the Community Reinvestment Act were unacceptable. The CRA, enacted in 1977, has played a critical role in revitalizing low-and-medium-income communities. New York has benefitted from this. A March 17, 1999 New York Times editorial states:  
   In New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and a new middle class. The banks earn less on community-based loans than on corporate business. But the most civic-minded banks have accepted this reduced revenue as a cost of doing business--and as a reasonable sacrifice for keeping the surrounding communities strong.  
   I am told that an acceptable--albeit not perfect--compromise has been worked out on this matter. With this agreement in hand, I can now support the bill. However, I urge the regulators to keep a close eye on the CRA provision and make sure that banks make loans where they are required to and keep investing in those communities that need it most. 
   I conclude on the question of privacy. No small matter. Consumers, rightly so, are concerned that their personal information will be shared among the newly affiliated companies. The bill places no restrictions on the kinds of detailed personal information--such as customer bank balances, credit card account numbers, income and investments, insurance records, purchases made by check or credit card--that can be swapped among them. A November 3, 1999, Times editorial addresses this matter:  
   In an electronic world where businesses can effortlessly collect, compile, and mine personal data for marketing and other purposes, consumers should have the right to control the spread of their financial information. Under current Federal law, consumers have almost no rights in this area. The bill adds some limited protections, but it does not go far enough, particularly since conglomeration will greatly accelerate the sharing of private information in the financial sector.  
   As we move ahead with this bill and make substantial changes to the banking laws, we must make sure that privacy laws keep pace. this is much too important of an issue to be overlooked.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Today is the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. On October 25, 1995, ten days before his assassination, Prime Minister Rabin spoke in the Rotunda of the capitol at a ceremony celebrating the passage of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. The honor of introducing him fell to me. I said, ``History will honor him as the magnanimous leader of a brave people--brave enough to fight daunting odds--perhaps even braver still to make peace.'' Four years later as Israel and the Palestinians prepare to begin final status negotiations, I think it appropriate to remember the man who helped lead his people down this road to peace. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD my remarks on that occasion.

There is no wide agreement on what the next round of negotiations will address. However, there is no doubt that agriculture will be one of the matters addressed in the next round. There is much disagreement in other areas. 
   The idea of our setting some negotiating objectives is a good idea, in my view, and I think the chairman agrees.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am sure the chairman will agree, and I cannot doubt that my friend from North Dakota will agree, it would be much better if the President were to go to Seattle with the traditional trade negotiating authority other Presidents have had. 
   This President does not. It is not for the lack of the Finance Committee trying to give it to him. There has been a real breakdown at both ends of the avenue, as it were. The White House has let small political considerations enter into their calculations. We are not unknown to such failings ourselves. 
   But the fact is, at the end of the 20th century the President of the United States does not have the negotiating authority he has had, in essence, for 65 years--since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. The more, then, ought we try to speak to the coming negotiations in the manner suggested; the more, then, should we get this legislation passed else the President might decide not to go at all.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is an elemental fact in international relations that most countries have a unitary legislative/executive branch, such that if the Prime Minister of Great Britain sends his Foreign Secretary to negotiate, that Foreign Secretary represents a majority in the House of Commons. Any agreement they reach will be ratified. 
   That is not the case with us. The world discovered this in 1919 when the Treaty of Versailles, negotiated by President Wilson, was not ratified in this Chamber. That sank in over the next 20 years. So we have been giving the President this authority so his representatives can say: If I make an agreement, we will keep the agreement. 
   Absent that, I do not know what will come. I think I am correct--I take the liberty of asking my able assistant, Dr. Podoff--we have never had a multilateral GATT or WTO negotiation without the President having traditional negotiating authority, have we, to complete the negotiations? No. 
   This, sir, would be the first time--the first time. That is not an experiment I think we should be running, but perhaps we can make up for it in time. In the meantime, I welcome the thoughts of my friend, our colleague on the Committee on Finance.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for 
   his remarks and tell him that he finds no difference of view among the managers of this legislation. We have a managers' amendment to address it. 
   The large issue, sir, that has emerged in the context of the World Trade Organization is the relevance of the international labor conventions negotiated under the auspices of the International Labor Organization, which began here in Washington in 1919. The first were adopted at the Pan-American Union Building. The Offices of the ILO itself were provided by then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
   The problem is, at the time, these trade treaties--they were trade treaties--were designed to say, just as the Senator has said: If you, country X, have a minimum wage, and country Y does not, country Y will have trade advantages which will end up with employment in the original country. So do it together--improve labor standards together by means of international labor treaties. It is a principle. 
   We did not, until now, have any transparency. There was no inspection--a new idea, a post-World War II idea--an important key idea. There was no ranking, no reporting. We are getting there. The International Labor Organization, in 1998, issued this wonderful document: ``ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.'' And there they are, the four basic principles. We have a lot to do in this regard, but we have begun. 
   So I congratulate the Senator. He is going to speak later and longer. 
   I know the Senator from Montana, under some pressure of time, would like to speak now, as I understand it, on the most agreeable subject of why this is an important bill and why he voted for it in the Finance Committee.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I join in the Chairman's request and also in his very proper remarks about the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. I believe it has been since 1982 that the Senator began offering amendments to this effect. The antidumping laws themselves have a much longer history and have been through several major revisions, most recently in the Uruguay Round, which we implemented in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in 1994. 
   I think the idea of looking into this, as the Chairman suggests, is a very good one. But for the moment, sir, it is ineluctably the case that the amendment, as drafted, is inconsistent with the World Trade Organization's antidumping agreement in a number of significant ways. It does not say that we are wrong, but that we would be up against the agreed-upon international trading rules. 
   We have an international meeting of the World Trade Organization at the end of this month in Seattle. I do not think we should arrive there this way, particularly as other countries are seeking to reopen negotiations once again on these issues, arguing that they are an antiquated idea. 
   So I join in expressing the hope that the amendment might be withdrawn. We can take the idea with us to Seattle as something for other countries to consider when they approach our Government about modifying our existing laws.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the managers' amendment which has just been adopted at the behest of Senator LEVIN, myself, and others, requires that core labor standards are necessary matters that the President must consider in granting these trade privileges. Of course, the Generalized System of Preferences incorporates substantially the same measures. The President is authorized to consider countries' compliance with these standards. Indeed, the President has already endorsed the  core labor standards through the ILO Declaration adopted in 1998. There is no need to micromanage his handling of foreign affairs. 
   In the interest of moving this measure along, with full agreement with the purposes of the Senator from Minnesota, I move to table the amendment.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, regretfully, but once again, I rise in opposition to this measure. It would add overly restrictive African content and citizenship requirements, and the transshipment penalties are extraordinary. On the matter of citizenship, sir, I would not doubt that there are 30 garment shops, factories, if you like, floors or lofts, in New York City, in Manhattan, where a majority of the employees are not American citizens. They are legal immigrants, they have rights of American workers, they are paid, and they pay taxes. But in the course of the last three centuries, we have seen enormous movements of labor from one place to another, a lot of recycling. 
   If I could take one moment, since it is quiet and we have some distinguished Senators here, recently there was a study of illegal immigration from Mexico by some very fine sociologists, American and Mexican. The question is, Under what circumstances would illegal immigration increase? The answer is that immigration would increase if you sealed the borders because it is circular. People come up north to work. They raise money, and they go back and they can buy a car. Then they return. If there was a real wall, they would not go back. The world economy has been such since the 18th century. Exceedingly, these are good intentions of the Senator who offered essentially the same amendment yesterday. 
   I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have stepped back from the brink. A week ago it appeared that we would reject this essential trade legislation. The first in five years. Weeks before the opening of the Third Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, which will launch a new round of trade negotiations. Here in the United States, in Seattle. 
   As a tribute to the patience of our esteemed chairman, Senator ROTH, and our leaders Senators LOTT and DASCHLE, we somehow agreed to revive the bill. We now move one step closer to providing the President with legislation that will confirm, when he arrives in Seattle, that the United States Senate remains committed to open trade policies. 
   I join the chairman of the Finance Committee in urging the Senate's support for this package of trade measures which includes the Finance Committee's sub-Saharan African and CBI trade bills, as well as the reauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs. Each of these measures was approved by the Finance Committee with near unanimous support. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan noted, in a speech he delivered in Boston on June 2, the ``recent evident weakening of support for free trade in this country.'' We appear to be turning against trade policies that we have pursued for 65 years. It is hard to understand this in a period when, as the New York Times reported last Friday:  
   The American economy turned in its best quarterly performance of the year this summer, virtually guaranteeing enough momentum to carry the nation to its longest economic expansion in history early next year.  
   Let me repeat that last phrase--``its longest economic expansion in history. .....'' Not just peacetime, or just wartime, but ``in history.'' 
   And what are the benefits of this unprecedented economic expansion--an expansion that started in April 1991, is now in its eighth year, will break the record of 107 months in February 2000, and shows no sign of ending? The answer is clear: an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent--a level not seen in almost 30 years; and near zero inflation. 
   To what can we attribute this remarkable performance of the American economy? 
   I dare say that if the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930 was one of the causes of World War II, then trade liberalization is one of the reasons for the unprecedented expansion. 
   Other factors I would cite are just-in-time inventories--made possible by the information age, the 1993 deficit reduction act, Alan Greenspan, and perhaps some ``good luck.'' 
   Given the tremendous transformation of the American economy--between 1960 and 1998 manufacturing employment dropped from 30 to 15 percent of total employment--there inevitably were and will be dislocations. Since 1962 we have eased the cost of  dislocation to workers by providing Trade Adjustment Assistance--assistance which will expire at the end of this week. More than 200,000 workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. The bill before us would continue Trade Adjustment Assistance, something we ought to do as we enact trade liberalization policies. 
   I would also note that this legislation reflects our commitment to honor the ILO's core labor standards, a commitment made by all 174 members of the ILO. The Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, adopted at the 86th International Labor Conference, declares that ``all members, even if they have not ratified the Convention in question, have an obligation, arising from the very fact of membership in the Organization, to respect, to promote, and to realize, in good faith'' these core labor standards; (1) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; (2) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; (3) the effective abolition of child labor; and (4) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
   Under the managers' substitute the President must assess the compliance of the CBI and sub-Saharan African countries with these core labor standards--these ``internationally recognized worker rights.'' 
   The Generalized System of Preferences--which we put in place a quarter century ago--was the United States' response to the plea of developing countries that the industrial world ought to give them an opportunity--and a bit of an incentive--to compete in world markets. The theme then--as today--was that ``trade, not aid'' would ultimately wean countries from their dependence on foreign aid and help diversify their economies. This legislation will continue this important program. 
   The bill puts in place--at long last--a trade policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa, a policy that is long overdue. The economic challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa today may be even greater than they were at the height of the cold war. Consider the differing paths of South Korea and Ghana: in 1958, the year after Ghana achieved independence, its per capita GDP, at $203, exceeded that of South Korea ($171 at the time). Forty years later, in 1998, South Korea's per capita income had soared to $10,550, even after the Asian financial crisis, while Ghana's stood at a modest $390. 
   The Africa trade legislation in this package will not reverse years of neglect and decline, but it may provide a decent start. 
   And we endorse with this legislation President Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative--begun in 1983--updating the program to enable the CBI countries to remain competitive even as the NAFTA has eroded their market positions. The chairman and I met 6 weeks ago with the Presidents and Vice Presidents and Foreign Ministers of a number of the CBI states--the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica. They made a simple request--that we allow our trade to grow. And so this legislation will do. 
   This is legislation which deserves strong support here in the Senate, so that we can quickly move to a conference with the House and send the President to Seattle negotiations with the bipartisan backing of trade liberalization.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a moment on a matter that is not included in the trade legislation that has just been approved by the Senate--the near-exorbitant tariff on fine wool fabrics. This modest proposal appears to have generated an inordinate amount of controversy, all the more baffling because the facts are so persuasive. 
   We have just a few suit manufacturers left in the United States, including Hickey-Freeman, which has produced fine tailored suits in Rochester, New York since 1899. Our tariffs are stacked against them. 
   There is only a limited supply in the United States of fine wool fabric. The suit makers must import significant quantities of this fabric, at a current tariff rate of 30.6%. But importers can bring in completely finished wool suits duty free from Canada and Mexico, and subject to a 19.8% duty when imported from other sources. This anomaly in our tariff schedule--this tariff ``inversion''--puts domestic manufacturers of wool suits at a significant disadvantage. 
   Senators SCHUMER, DURBIN, HAGEL, MIKULSKI, SPECTER, NICKLES, FITZGERALD, SANTORUM, GRAMM, and THOMPSON have joined me in sponsoring a very modest measure that would provide temporary relief to the suit-makers. We have proposed that the tariff on the very finest wool fabric--produced in only limited quantities in the United States--be suspended for a short period, and that the tariff on other classes of fine wool fabric be reduced to 19.8%--hardly a negligible tariff. This was an effort to provide some relief to our suit makers. 
   Through the good offices of the Chairman of the Finance Committee, we undertook to address the concerns that has been raised when our bill was first introduced. After a series of meetings with all of the interested parties--and there are many--we modified our proposal to address, in a constructive way, the concerns that were raised. 
   Our first compromise proposal was rejected out of hand. No counterproposal was forthcoming. The objection stems chiefly from two sources: a fabric manufacturer that is not currently producing the fine wool fabric at issue--but promises to do so in the future, principally from a plant it is building in Mexico; and from the American Sheep Industry Association--this despite the fact that wool of the quality required for suit fabric is sourced overwhelmingly from Australia. 
   I am at a loss to explain the vehemence of the opposition. The fabric producer that so strongly opposes this legislation--Burlington Industries--is positioning itself to compete in the global market. As it ought to do. 
   On January 26, 1999, the company announced a major reorganization. To quote, ``operations will be streamlined and U.S. capacity will be reduced by 25%.'' Let me repeat: ``U.S. capacity will be reduced by 25%.'' The company announced that 2900 jobs would be eliminated, an announcement made just one month after the company reported to its shareholders--on December 2, 1998, that ``we have launched a major growth initiative in Mexico.'' 
   There followed an announcement to its customers that the fine wool fabric used to manufacture men's suits--so called ``fancies''--would not be available for a time. 
   Even so, we cannot get agreement on tariff relief for our suit makers, who have greater need than ever for imported fabric. They must still pay a 31% tariff on imported fine wool fabric. We ought to enable them to remain competitive, just as Burlington has taken steps to remain competitive. 
   We have kept at it. In recent days, our efforts have intensified. With a great deal of good will on the part of all interested parties, it appears that we may be inching toward an agreement that would, in fact, benefit all parties in some measure. 
   We have included a place-holder in the trade legislation--not a solution to the wool tariffs problem, but a provision that will allow our discussions to continue over the next several days. 
   I do thank the chairman and his staff--particularly Grant Aldonas--for their efforts, as well as the considerable interest and attention of Senators DURBIN, SCHUMER, and BAUCUS, all of whom are eager, as am I, to work this out. I intend to continue to work with our chairman and with others to resolve this matter.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Reverend Monsignor Andrew P. Landi, a son of New York and internationally known humanitarian, who was taken from us this past September. He was 92. 
   Monsignor Landi was the retired assistant executive director and of Catholic Relief Services in New York City from 1966 to 1979. Upon of his retirement he was named assistant treasurer, a position he held until the time of his death. Monsignor devoted himself to the service of the poor and disposed throughout the world regardless of race, creed, or nationality. 
   Catholic Relief Services was founded in 1943 by the Catholic Bishops of the United States to alleviate suffering by removing its causes and promoting social justice beyond our boarders. Their mission is to aid in the development of people by fostering charity and justice throughout the world. Monsignor Landi's devotion to this mission was ceaseless. 
   At a time when we are increasingly egocentric, we would do well to remember a man whose ministry to the disadvantaged was distinguished as a no other for faithful and untiring service. I wish to highlight the central role he played as a petitioner for overseas relief activities to numerous Federal agencies and Congress. He met with nearly every Pope since Pope Pius XII and counted Mother Teresa among his friends. 
   This champion of the downtrodden was sent to Rome in 1944 to minister to the victims of World War II. He spent the next two decades providing haven to refuges of civil strife and natural disasters. He was named the Regional Director of the Catholic Relief Services for Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa in 1962. 
   Monsignor Landi began his vocation as a parish priest at Our Lady of the Scapular and St. Stephen's Church in Manhattan in 1934. St. Stephens was at one time the largest Catholic parish in New York City. It is a special New York treasure as it contains several works by 19th century Italian Painter Constantino Brumidi who is best know for having done much of the artwork on display in the United States Capitol. 
   In 1939, Monsignor Landi became the associate director of Catholic Charities in Brooklyn, NY. As I recently noted, Catholic Charities of the Brooklyn-Queens Diocese is the largest Roman Catholic human services agency in the nation. Perhaps on earth. 
   One of seven children orphaned after the death of their mother in 1913, he focused his mission toward young people. His benevolence toward the troubled youth of Brooklyn was exceptional. 
   During Monsignor Landi's 65 years in the priesthood he received numerous honors from several governments and organizations. He was honored by our own New York State Assembly which issued a citation on the his 90th birthday in recognition his humanitarian efforts. 
   In closing I would like to express my deep gratitude to Monsignor Landi for his life long commitment to ending social injustice especially toward children living in poverty. His distinguished devotion to God and his fellow man is a model to us all.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to join most emphatically with my revered chairman in congratulating the Senate today, in thanking the majority and minority leaders. We have risen to a moment which was ominously in doubt. 
   Last week, as the week progressed, two things took place: One, on the Senate floor, as we now have established, we had 74 votes just to proceed with the bill--we will have more when this is done. Even so, we found ourselves in a procedural tangle not unknown to the body which was thwarting the will of an emphatic majority--and not just a majority for this legislation but a majority for a tradition of openness in trade that began 65 years ago with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 at the depths of the Depression, the aftermath of the Smoot-Hawley legislation, with our system of government very much under challenge. That challenge would grow more fierce and would end in the great World War. 
   We were then, even so, confident enough of the promise of trade that we could go forward in this matter. We have been going forward for 60 years. However, 5 years ago we stopped. The President did obtain the approval of the Congress for the World Trade Organization. I shouldn't put it that the President ``obtained'' the approval of the Congress; Congress approved what Congress had sent our negotiators to obtain. There was a little side ripple there. An international trade organization was to have been one of the main institutions of the Bretton Woods system created in 1944. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development--we call it the World Bank--the International Monetary Fund were created; the International Trade Organization didn't happen. 
   Finally, we caught up with ourselves and we created the World Trade Organization which I believe now has 134 members with 30 observers currently applying for membership. I said there were two ominous, even menacing moments. The second was that there was almost no attention paid in the press and media to this week-long frustrating, seemingly unavailing effort. We have been on this a week and we got nowhere. No one noticed. It is as if no one cared. 
   We woke up. Yesterday, the Washington Post in a lead editorial on this subject noted neither the administration nor the Congress had done anything they needed to do, 
   and that at the end of this month the World Trade Organization will meet in Seattle. Our Ambassador, our Trade Representative, Ambassador Barshefsky, will open the meeting. Our President will be there, along with heads of state. We will be talking about the next round of global trade negotiations. They can take 9, 10 years. They are fundamentally important. 
   But our President will not have the authority to enter these negotiations--or rather to send the resulting agreements to the Congress for expedited consideration. If he were to have had the sub-Saharan African legislation fail and the Caribbean initiative of President Reagan fail; if we were to have, in effect, allowed the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, President Kennedy's measure that led to the Kennedy Round, like the Uruguay Round, expire and say to the 200,000 American families who are displaced by trade, as others are, that we should let economic forces work their way and tell them, that's too bad; if we allowed the Generalized System of Preferences to expire and say, no matter, how would our representatives look? What would they say? What could they undertake? Very little. 
   It would be a moment in trade that would be shameful, after 65 years of bringing the world out of the depths of the Great Depression, now, in the longest economic expansion in the United States, the longest economic expansion in history. 
   For so many years we talked about ``the longest peacetime expansion.'' No, no, this expansion is greater even than that from World War II. This is what trade has brought us. Not just trade, but without trade expansion we could not have had this economic expansion. Now, at least, we can go to Seattle and say: Here are our bona fides. We are still players. We still want to go forward. 
   So, Mr. President, let the games begin. We have a long debate before us. It will be a bipartisan debate. The Senator from Delaware, the chairman of our committee, will be leading the debate. His deputy, if I may so deputize myself, will be at his side across the aisle. Let us now proceed, being of good heart and great expectations. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I certainly could attempt to do so. I would not risk overstatement. There would be a setting in which, having given the President negotiating authority for a new round of international trade talks, having arranged for Trade Adjustment Assistance to be continued as it has been for 37 years, we could say: The particular matters before us will be part of the trade negotiations--and so forth. We could say we will get to it next year. 
   But we don't have that negotiating authority. The President goes to Seattle emptyhanded. The only thing he can bring with him is the trade legislation we have before us--which we still have to take to the House. But this is all the United States can show the world, the world which has been following us for all these years. 
   So I hope, at a very minimum, the sense of tradition--even, if I may say, of honor--will drive us forward in this matter.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Not a small intellectual feat, equal to my understanding of some of the amendments themselves. 
   Sir, I am going to make two quick comments. One is anecdotal. I was 
   involved with the negotiation of the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement under President Kennedy in 1962. This was a major effort. It was done at the behest of the Southern mill owners and operators, the producers of cotton textiles, and also of the trade unions that represented the garment trades, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, now formed with another union into UNITE. It was a precondition of getting the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the one major piece of legislation of President Kennedy's first term. 
   It came and went on to produce what we know as the Kennedy Round. That sequence of long negotiations, most recently was the Uruguay Round, which produced the World Trade Organization. There is another round coming up, we hope, in the aftermath of the Seattle meeting. 
   Years went by, and I found I was Ambassador to India. On an occasion, in meeting with the Foreign Minister, I said to him, just curiously: Do you find that the quota which India received in the American market of cotton textiles is onerous? It had now been a decade since it was in place. I asked: Is it a trade restriction that is particularly of concern to you? Because if it was, I was required to report it back to Washington. 
   The Foreign Minister said: Oh, no. That quota guarantees us that much access to the American market which we would otherwise not have, because American textile manufacturers are the low-cost producers. We do not hand loom cotton textiles in this country or wool for that matter. We have the most advanced machinery in the world.  
   Not to know that, to depict us as the potential victims of the Chinese, with their child labor, does not show any understanding of why nations have child labor. They do so because they do not have machines. They do not have the infrastructure of a modern economy. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act requires that the President certify basically the openness of the trading system, as much as it is going to be open, of the respective countries. The African Growth Act, for example, requires that he determine the country involved has established or is making continual progress towards establishing an open trading system for the elimination of barriers to U.S. trade and investment and the resolution of bilateral trade and investment disputes. 
   Sir, does anyone wish to name me a nation in the world that would not be open to American investment today? I would ask my friend, the chairman of the committee, is he aware of any country in the world that would refuse American investment?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. There may have been a time--yes, there was, in the era of a planned economy, in the era of the Soviet Union, in another era. Are we debating another era? 
   We are going to ask the President, under one of these amendments--I have lost track which one--to negotiate 147 reciprocal trade treaties--147--and then, sir, in one of them--I will not say which, because I do not think it would be quite fair--but in one of them, for the third act of imported children's wear, that somehow involves textiles made in the Far 
   East or wherever, the violation is punishable by a fine of $1 million and 5 years in prison. 
   Do we send people to prison for the mislabeling of cotton goods? I mean, heavens, a little balance, a little perspective. We are talking about marginal producers on the margin of the world economy, trying to give them a hand. In the case of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, we are trying to do what President Reagan said was only fair and balanced: If we were going to have the North American Free Trade Agreement, it should not close out Central America and the Caribbean. 
   I hope we will proceed as long as we have to with such amendments, but I hope some perspective will be in order.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I don't wish to suggest there is anything but good intentions behind all these measures. But to introduce the idea of--is it citizenship we are talking about, ancestry, or what? What is an African, sir? South Africa would be part of the arrangements in this African Growth Act. 
   Suppose there was a plant in Johannesburg that was owned by the descendants of Dutch settlers who arrived in the 17th century; some of the managers were Indian persons who had emigrated in the 19th century under the British Empire--under the British Empire, people moved all over the world. We recently had the great honor of meeting, just off the Senate Chamber, with heads of state from the Caribbean area, and the President of Trinidad and Tobago is of Indian ancestry. That is very normal. Indians moved to California, having gone to the British Empire and gone to Canada and were coming down. And suppose there were Zulu workers there--African, obviously, but they are more recent arrivals than most.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am aware of that, and I recognize that is a very reasonable thought. But I do know, from some experience in that part of the world, that citizenship is not a standard statutory entitlement of the individual, as it would be--well, even in our country, if you come here, you have to go through a great deal to become a citizen. If you are born here, you already are. That can be a very ambiguous situation, sir. I don't know. 
   May I ask my friend, are Mauritians Africans or Indians? One of the big issues, I can say to the Presiding Officer, is that in Mauritius a considerable textile trade has developed with Mauritian sponsors and Chinese migrant workers. Are Mauritians Africans?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I get to the point, and I don't make it in any hostile manner. I just say the complexities of the world, just that part of it, are very considerable. I am reluctant to see such categories enter trade law. No one has ever asked whether the products of the American clothing workshops in New York City were made by American citizens. There surely would have been a time when the majority--or many of them--were not American citizens at all. They would have come from what would become Poland, and there was no concept of citizenship for 
   the occupants of the shtetls. I just suggest there is considerable ambiguity. I don't wish to press the matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I say that will teach me to ask for order when the Senator from South Carolina is speaking. 
   But we are required, as managers, to make the same point on this measure, this amendment, that we made on the earlier Hollings amendment. This would require us to negotiate 147 environmental agreements around the world before any of the provisions of the African bill or the Caribbean Basin Initiative or the tariff preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences can be extended. 
   NAFTA was a relatively simple three-party negotiation. We have very few differences with Canada, and such as we had with Mexico were worked out. In so many of the countries we are talking about in sub-Saharan Africa, the nation, the area, is an environmental disaster. That is why we are trying to develop some trade, some economic influx--trade not aid. We would not do it. What would be your standard for the Sudan? What would be your standard for parts of the Congo? What would you know about the country with which you are negotiating? 
   These are terribly distressed regions. We have had three decades of declining income, of rising chaos. The best hopes are the countries that want this agreement. We are not going to leave environment behind, but we should move ahead on this measure. I think my chairman agrees with me in this matter. I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this technical, yet necessary, legislation, the Child Support Miscellaneous Amendments of 1999. We live in a nation with an ever-increasing number of single mothers. About one-third (32.8%) of all children born in the United States last year were born outside of marriage. At a minimum, we need a comprehensive and effective child support system to see to it that non-custodial parents--often fathers--provide for these children. 
   Maintaining a central unit for disbursing and collecting child support payments in each state is essential. This eases the burden on the business community, whose cooperation we need. Unfortunately, a handful of states appear to have missed the statutory deadline for having such a central unit in operation. Under current law, all Federal funding for the child support programs in these states will be withdrawn. 
   This is too harsh of a penalty. States are missing the deadline because they are simply behind schedule in their procurement effort or because of a broader failing in the computer systems undergirding their child support programs. This legislation would provide an alternative, more modest, financial penalty for those states which are late in meeting the deadline. For those states suffering a general failure of their child support computer systems it would not impose a penalty because those states have already been penalized. 
   I thank the Chairman for his work on this matter, simple one of reasonable program administration.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there are more than just prospective benefits for American workers in this legislation, on this Trade and Development Act of 1999. We now have 7 days before the Trade Adjustment Assistance program is ended, a program that goes back 37 years to the Trade Expansion Act that President Kennedy obtained in his first term--the only real measure he did in his first term--37 years and as many Presidents as you can count, with 200,000 persons and their families eligible for benefits. The funding ends on Friday. 
   More than that, we have put in jeopardy this morning--and it remains in jeopardy--trade policies of the last two-thirds of a century. In that two-thirds of a century, we have seen America rise to unknown and previously inconceivable levels of economic growth and stability. 
   This very morning the press reports, I will read from the New York Times:  
   Headline: ``Strong summer is likely to propel the economic boom to a record.'' The story: ``The American economy turned in its best quarterly performance of the year this summer, virtually guaranteeing enough momentum to carry the nation to its longest economic expansion in history early next year.''  
   By February--that is not very long--we shall have had the longest expansion in the history of the Nation. 
   Sir, I want to stand alongside my chairman and say this is not over. It cannot be over. 
   Do we have any idea what is at stake? Can you imagine going to Seattle having denied the President--not this President, whoever, the next President--having denied the Executive the power to negotiate trade agreements at the Seattle Round--as it could be commonly called--and the fast track is not in the President's court? 
   And then the matter that we took up today. It is a great effort on sub-Saharan Africa. We had the President of Nigeria here yesterday. We have had ambassadors from all over sub-Saharan Africa. The Caribbean Basin Initiative, President Reagan's initiative, sir--the new benefits that we ought to put in place--are gone. The representatives of at last democratic regimes in Central America came up, sir, at your invitation--gone. Trade 
   Adjustment Assistance is gone. The Generalized System of Preferences--how old is that? A quarter of a century of the Generalized System of Preferences is gone, emptyhanded. 
   The chairman and I were planning to spend a few days in Seattle just meeting with people. We were not going to speak. Dare we go? I suppose Ambassador Barshefsky is required to go. I don't want to show my face. But that need not be. We are still in session. The bill is still on the calendar. 
   Let us hope what we have done this weekend we can move to change it, and move on as we were moving. 
   I thank you, sir. No one could lead it better than the chairman did--events over which he has no control. The tangle we can get into with people who sometimes think one issue is more important than others. 
   We have to rise to this, sir. I hope we will. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have just a couple of points to make about this extender bill. First, my congratulations to our revered chairman  of the Finance Committee, who brought all sides together in a consensus bill that accomplishes our objective--extend expiring provisions that command support from all Senators. This was not a simple task. 
   Tax extenders were part of the large tax bill that began working its way through the Congress in July--a bill that in my view needed to be and was vetoed. This fall, Senator ROTH returned to the task and presented a chairman's mark focused on extenders. He built bipartisan support for the bill, and that is why we are here on the Senate floor so soon, ready to pass the legislation by unanimous consent. 
   This bill is a paid-for extenders package. As such, it meets the standards of Members on both sides of the aisle. It is a bill that can pass this Congress and can be signed by the President. 
   And it is important that we pass legislation that can be signed. If we do not, approximately 1.1 million Americans will find out that they will lose part or all of the $500 child credit or the HOPE scholarship credit when they sit down to complete their 1999 tax return. That is because these credits have not yet been permanently exempted from what we call the alternative minimum tax. This legislation will exempt these credits from the alternative minimum tax for 1999 and 2000. 
   The American people ask us to be responsible in managing our tax laws. To not pass this bill would be irresponsible and contribute to a perception that Members of Congress who agree on what should be done cannot sit down and figure out a way to do them. 
   Again, my congratulations to the chairman, and let's move expeditiously to a conference with the House of Representatives as soon as they pass similar legislation.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. We will have broken our word to them, that by accepting open trade policies in the aftermath of which there would be dislocations, the economy at large and the society would make arrangements for them to transfer to other work with other skills. There is no reason to think that won't happen, but without assistance it won't, and we will have broken our word which we gave 37 years ago. President after President after President has reaffirmed this, as the Senator has in this bill.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, I go back to Cordell Hull and the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 which put in place the present system. As the Senator knows--I know our friend from South Carolina doesn't agree--the Smoot-Hawley tariff was a catastrophe. We have not had a tariff bill on the Senate floor since. 
   We now are in a difficult situation with every President, Republican or Democrat, reaffirming. A legitimate point is made that President Clinton didn't send up a request for fast-track authority in 1995; it has been delayed and we haven't gotten it. If we haven't gotten the CBI, which President Reagan promised, if we haven't gotten the African agreements, we haven't gotten trade adjustment assistance, what do we take to Seattle for the conference of the World Trade Organization? 
   We go as if we had thought there never should have been such an organization and didn't want it around. Why is it meeting in the United States? 
   Ten years ago one would not have imagined this moment.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. The floor not being exactly teeming with Senators wishing to join, Mr. President, this is the point: We are at a critical moment; where is the Senate? 
   In the absence of the Senate, let me offer some statistics about the centrality of trade. The crash of 1929 is part of American myth, tradition, history. One does not know much about American history if one does not know about that. In the aftermath, in 1930--the crash of 1929 came in October--our GDP dropped 9 percent. That is a pretty hefty drop, but stock markets go up and then they go down. When they are up, there are bargains made by selling; when they are down, there are bargains made by buying. It tends to be cyclical and does not necessarily change that much in the real world. I say again, in 1930, GDP dropped 9 percent; in 1931, it dropped another 6.4 percent. Again, that is a drop, but it is leveling off. 
   It was before we understood the business cycle very well, before just-in-time delivery, before countercyclical financing. The American world had never heard of John Maynard Keynes. There was learning going on, but it hadn't gotten to us. The Federal Reserve Board responded to the crash by tightening credit. They would never do that today, and they know why; they will show why in numbers. 
   Then came the impact of Smoot-Hawley in 1932 and the gross domestic product dropped another staggering  13.3 percent. 
   That is when it really hit. At the same time the British had created the idea of free trade by long argumentation, good argument--reeling from Smoot-Hawley, went onto Empire Preference. They drew in and they would deal with Canada and India and New Zealand but not with Europe, not with Germany. Recall it was the Economist magazine, which I understand now has a larger circulation in the United States than it does in Britain but comparably the same readership, was founded to advocate free trade as an economic principle that worked. It did work. Great theorists such as Albert Imlah demonstrated that in the aftermath. 
   The Japanese, having the market here closed to them, they went to a Greater Far Eastern Coprosperity Sphere, which is a long way of saying a Japanese empire; and they invaded Manchuria, which is another way of saying China, and they began that process which ended in Hiroshima. 
   In 1933, the same 1933 the year after GDP here dropped 13.3 percent, unemployment was so high and social stability so weakened that a frightened German middle class elected Adolph Hitler to be Chancellor. He was chosen in the Reichstag. The rest is history. 
   I joined the Navy in 1943, at age 17, and a lot of other people around here did. Maybe not enough people around here did. They don't remember.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Chairman, we have now reached the point where you and I are alone on the Senate floor as one of the epic decisions of this decade is about to be made. One asks Senators who might be listening: Where are you? 
   But the answer to your question, sir, is our learning has truly expanded. We know more about this. I mentioned 1933. In that year, John Maynard Keynes published a book in the United 
   States called ``Essays In Persuasion.'' It appeared the previous year in Britain. He already had a pretty good record. He wrote that great essay, ``The Economic Consequences of the Peace''--of Versailles. He was on the British delegation as an adviser, and he said: It is going to be awful. Germany is not going to get over this. 
   That is a very famous essay--and it is sort of a joke. Winston Churchill became Chancellor of the Exchequer around 1926 and went back, took Britain back on the gold standard. He wrote an essay called ``The Economic Consequences Of Mr. Churchill,'' which he thought were pretty grim. And they were. 
   But, in 1933, in this book, ``Essays In Persuasion,'' he had an introduction. It is really essays over the years. He said: The economic problem is just a giant muddle. He said: We will figure it out. We will get through it. He said: I estimate by about the year 2030, we will have it pretty well under control and we can go on to other issues in life. 
   The Senator mentioned the existing expansion, the period of expansion. In February of the coming year, that will be in about 4 months, we will completed a period of sustained growth of 107 months, the longest in history--unless we start killing it, which is what we seem intent on doing. Of course there are dislocations brought about by trade. Joseph Schumpeter--had it not been for the Great Depression it is generally thought Schumpeter would be regarded as the greatest economist of the 20th century. He is an Austrian, ended up a professor at Harvard. In his book ``Capitalism, Socialism & Democracy,'' he speaks a phrase now in wide use, of the ``creative destruction of capitalism.'' Sure, there comes a time when shipping the cotton to mills in New England no longer makes sense. They want to have mills in South Carolina. ``Bring the mills to the cotton,'' as the phrase was. It did make sense. The next thing you know you had empty mills all up and down the river in Lowell, MA, and, I might say, in Gloversville, NY, and such like. 
   Yes, but did that put an end to life in Massachusetts? No. The next thing you know, Route 128 is creating enormous economic growth spurred on by computer companies. That destruction is creative because it brings better uses of resources into play. You get more than you had. Trying to keep just what you had is a formula for ruin--well, not for ruin, but for stagnation. I speak with some temerity. I was once our Ambassador to India, and I saw it happen. Tariffs you could not get through, government purchasing. The Soviet Union----

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Soviet Union, sir, what was that? Oh, yes, that was the place that was going to take over the world. 
   I remember a meeting in Bucharest of world trade advocates at the time. It was an international conference about the developing world. The Soviet delegate absolutely swept the conference with an announcement that, as of this moment, as a gesture of solidarity with our friends in Africa, in Latin America, in Southeast Asia, the Soviet Union is abolishing all tariffs of imports from those countries. 
   The conference went wild, but no one stopped to think: But, wait a minute, the Soviet Union doesn't have tariffs. Everything is bought by the government and put through collective enterprises, all of which were in ruins and eventually collapsed. This was 20 years before the whole system imploded. 
   We are talking for democracy, talking for vitality, talking for expansion, talking for a tradition. As Jerry Ford said yesterday in the Rotunda, he came to Congress as a social moderate, a fiscal conservative, and a determined internationalist. He was right. Can it be we have forgotten all that? 
   I say, again, before I yield the floor, at a critical moment in our economic history--a critical moment--we are hours away from ruinous indecision. There are three Senators on the floor. It happens we are all friends, perhaps have gotten to be more friends because we have been on the floor together for 2 days now. It is hard to understand.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the chairman is doing this for the American worker. If you think otherwise, think back to opposite policies and what they brought the American worker in the 1930s. Don't think we cannot make those mistakes again. We knew enough not to do it then. We did not know exactly why. But 1,000 economists wrote President Hoover, who was a sensitive and an intelligent man. Nothing quite like that happened before; nowadays we get 1,000 a day. They said: Don't sign that tariff bill, Smoot-Hawley. Don't sign it, they said. Well, he did. It cost him the Presidency, but that is the least of it. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. In terms of how we are progressing and what we are learning, the Senator mentioned we have the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years, and for the longest time we also have had the lowest inflation rates.

<DOCNO>106-moynihan-ny-17-19991028</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Twenty years ago, statistics proved that was not possible. There were something called the ``Phillips Curve'' that said: There is a tradeoff; the lower your unemployment rate goes, the higher your inflation rate goes. And everyone said, oh, God, we can't get the unemployment rate down too much because that will spark inflation. 
   If I can just be reminiscent and tell war stories in this crowded Chamber, where I see we are back to three Members--well, the distinguished Senator from Illinois is presiding; and it is an honor to have him in the Chair--in 1963, the Council of Economic Advisers, then chaired by Dr. Walter Heller of the Kennedy administration, was putting together the economic report. This report was created by the Employment Act of 1946 which gave us the institutionalized, countercyclical economic notions. 
   They said: We should have a goal; we should set as a goal for the country an unemployment rate of 4 percent. Now, it won't be easy, but we should be bold. 
   In the Labor Department we were sort of distressed because we had dreams of unemployment below 4 percent. So we got them to change the text and make it an interim goal of 4 percent--again, a dream. 
   Sir, we now are routinely close to 4 percent, have been for almost a year. Thirty years ago, it was something you could not imagine. In a rousing economic report--if there is such a thing--you could say, let's do things that are unimaginable. Now we do not even notice when they are reported every month. It is working. Why put it in jeopardy?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the New York Yankees on the occasion of their victory in Major League Baseball's World Series last night. In front of 56,752 fans, the Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves 4-1 and clinched a series sweep in this best of seven series. Fittingly, ``The Team of the Millennium'' has staked its claim as the best franchise in the 1990's.  
   As the season began, few seers in the sports world could have foretold the indelible mark this team would leave behind. The adversity these young men faced would have folded a team of lesser character. Their stalwart manager Joe Torre began the year in a hospital room rather than in the dugout as he battled prostate cancer. Teammates Paul O'Neill, Luis Sojo, and Scott Brosius all lost their fathers during the past season. In addition, the Yankee family was struck by the passing of baseball legends, Joe DiMaggio and Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter. Yet this team endured and reached its goal, giving New York an unfathomable 25th World Championship. 
   For the past two seasons--and three of the last four--we have seen the Yankees go to the World Series. They emerged victorious after the minimum of four straight wins on both occasions. Starting pitchers David Cone, Orlando Hernandez, and Roger Clemens held the Braves to a meager six hits and two runs in 21 2/3 innings. Reliever Mariano Rivera had saves in Games One and Two and won Game Three on his way to becoming the Series Most Valuable Player. Offensively, the team had Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch getting on base, and Chad Curtis came off the bench to hit two home runs in Game Three, with the second coming in the bottom of the 10th, sealing the victory for the Bronx Bombers. 
   All in all, this team put forth admirable effort coupled with unmatched talent. This victory is a truly epochal moment that brings joy to the hearts of Yankee fans everywhere. An editorial appearing in today's New York Times puts it best, ``We are all fans now.'' In closing I would like to offer a possible slogan for next year's team: Thrice would be nice.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate our revered chairman for his achievement in a partisan setting. I think it is generally agreed that this Congress has not been one governed from the center. Here we have major legislation brought to the floor by near unanimous vote of the Committee on Finance and with extraordinary support across the country. 
   I wish to make two points, the first to the question of Trade Adjustment Assistance. It goes back 37 years as an integral measure in our trade policy. As Dean Acheson might say, I was present at the creation. I was an Assistant Secretary of Labor, one of three delegates who negotiated the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement which was necessary to win the votes in the Senate for authorizing what became the Kennedy Round. When we came back with that agreement, the issue arose, if we were to open up trade, there would inevitably be persons displaced--just as jobs were created, jobs would be lost. There is nothing complex in the calculation nor very complex in identifying just whom you are talking about. 
   We started Trade Adjustment Assistance. It has worked. We included a comparable provision in the NAFTA implementing legislation. In Fiscal Year 1998, we had 150,000 workers eligible to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance; last year, we had 200,000 eligible workers. Those are rounded numbers. 
   This is an active program. There are families who are displaced in the world economy, and they are living off this transitional benefit--200,000 eligible workers. That is not a small number. The authorization for this program, that has been integral to our trade policy for 37 years, expired on June 30. The appropriation expires on Friday; on Saturday, it is no more. And when it can come back, how it comes back--have we seen many things started of late in this Congress or the previous ones? No. 
   Now, those are lives of American workers we are talking about, just as President Kennedy talked about them. John Pastore of Rhode Island was very vigorous on this matter, and many Members of the Senate who are marked in history by their capacity to see the large national interest. 
   One other matter: The chairman noted the meeting which the Committee on Finance had with the group of presidents, vice presidents, and foreign ministers from Central America, ranging from Trinidad and Tobago all the way up to Honduras. It took place just off the Senate floor in the LBJ Room. It was a special occasion. 
   They came here as representatives of elected governments asking to trade. They weren't asking for foreign aid. They weren't asking for military assistance. They were simply asking to become part of the trading system of the western hemisphere in that Monroe Doctrine context about which the chairman spoke. 
   It already seems to have happened long ago. In the 1980s, we spent $8 billion sending arms to Central America, with precious little to show for it. A good enough outcome in the end, but the weaponry was everywhere, on all sides--a fantastic miscalculation, in my view, in my view at the time. 
   I will give my colleagues a moment's recollection. It was 1983. I was in El Salvador in the capital of San Salvador having breakfast with the president and provost of the University of Central America, a Jesuit institution. At that time, the United States was going through enormous efforts to prevent the Sandinistas in Nicaragua from smuggling arms to their rebel counterparts in El Salvador. 
   I asked the President and the provost, with whom I had a relationship through a professor at the University of Chicago, ``Father, are the Sandinistas sending weapons to El Salvador?'' He said, ``No.'' I said, ``No? Well, surely they had been.'' He said, ``Yes.'' I asked, ``And they don't any longer?'' He said, ``No. You do.'' 
   Every day, the skies over Salvador were filled with American planes bringing in weaponry, which was promptly divided--half for the government, a quarter for the rebels, and a quarter for  the international arms market. And what a better thing now to be talking about trade. And we have stability. If we want to ensure it, there has to be an economic basis. This legislation does so and, again, and finally, there are 200,000 American families entitled to trade adjustment assistance, which expires on Friday after a 37-year run as part of the American safety net as a condition of expanding trade. Let's not let them down. We can do this if only we will do it together, as we did in the Finance Committee. I only hope the same can be repeated on the Senate floor. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my friend from South Carolina who is seeking recognition.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am aware there are other Senators who wish to speak. I will only take a moment to thank our chairman, our revered chairman, for his comments, with which I wholly agree, with which the Finance Committee entirely agrees. This bill comes to you, as he has said, from a near unanimous committee. Ninety Senators voted, just yesterday, to move forward. 
   I would just say, sir, I wish we could have all been present this afternoon when the Congressional Gold Medal was presented to President Ford and Mrs. Ford in the Rotunda. The President gave a wonderful speech, describing the Congress he came into, just as the Cold War commenced; the extraordinary efforts that the 80th Congress made to pass the Marshall Plan, for which they were not entirely rewarded by President Truman, who kept talking about the ``do-nothing'' 80th Congress. But there you are. Then came President Eisenhower and the movement to establish NATO and to fund NATO, in which Speaker Rayburn, Majority Leader Johnson, and great Republicans joined in that matter. 
   Of his life in politics, in government, he said: I came in and I remained a moderate on social issues, a fiscal conservative on fiscal issues, and a convinced internationalist. 
   That is the America that fought in the dark, that long struggle about which John F. Kennedy talked. And we prevailed. 
   The totalitarian 20th century is behind us. Freedoms open up. Are we now to close down at just the moment when everything we have stood for as a nation, from the time of Cordell Hull and the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934--every measure we are talking about in this bill, no, it is not the final end-all effort; it is a part of a continuing effort that goes back to Trade Adjustment Assistance. It was established in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. I was involved in writing that legislation. It said, if you have trade, there will be winners, there will be losers. We will look after the people who are temporarily, as it turns out, disrupted, as economic patterns, trade patterns change. 
   In 48 hours, or 52 hours, the appropriation for the program, supported by every President since President Kennedy, expires. The authorization in fact ended on June 30. Can we let that happen? Can we believe that we would do this? Surely not. 
   But unless we are urgently attentive to the matters before us, and work out what are technical differences, it will go down; and we will be remembered  for ending an era of enormous expansion and example to the rest of the world, which the Western World is just beginning to follow on. It is hard to believe. 
   But listen to what the chairman said and hope in the next 24 hours we can do this, because we can. And, sir, we must. 
   Under the rules, President Ford, I believe, has free access to the floor. I wish he would come on here and talk to each of us one on one.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Public Information Disclosure Act, a bill that seeks to add to our citizens' knowledge of how and why our country made many of its key national security decisions since the end of World War II. This bill creates a mechanism for comprehensively reviewing and declassifying, whenever possible, records of extraordinary public interest that demonstrate and record this country's most significant and important national security policies, actions, and decisions. 
   As James Madison once wrote, ``A people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' Acquiring this knowledge has become increasingly difficult since World War II's end, when we witnessed the rise of a vast national security apparatus that encompasses thousands of employees and over 1.5 billion classified documents that are 25 years or older. Secrecy, in the end, is a form of regulation. And I concede that regulation of state secrets is often necessary to protect national security. But how much needs to be regulated after having aged 25 years or more? 
   The warehousing and withholding of these documents and materials not only impoverish our country's historical record but retard our collective understanding of how and why the United States acted as it did. This means that we have less chance to learn from what has gone before; both mistakes and triumphs fall through the cracks of our collective history, making it much harder to resolve key questions about our past and to chart our future actions. 
   On the other hand, greater openness makes it more possible for the government to explain itself and to defend its actions, a not so unimportant thing when one recalls Richard Hofstader's warning in his classic 1964 essay The Paranoid Style in American Politics: ``The distinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents see conspiracies here and there in history, but they regard a `vast' or `gigantic' conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost transcendent power as the motive force in historical events.'' A poll taken in 1993 found that three-quarters of those surveyed believed that President Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiracy involving the CIA, renegade elements of our military, and organized crime. The Grassy Knoll continues to cut a wide path across our national consciousness. The classified materials withheld from the Warren Commission, several of our actions in Vietnam, and Watergate have only added to the American people's distrust of the Federal government. 
   Occasionally, though, the government has drawn back its cloak of secrecy and made substantial contributions to our national understanding. In 1995, the CIA and the NSA agreed to declassify the Venona intercepts, our highly secretive effort that ranged over four decades to decode the Soviet Union's diplomatic traffic. Much of this traffic centered on identifying Soviet spies, one of the cardinal preoccupations of that hateful era we call ``McCarthyism.'' These releases made at least one thing crystal clear: Their timely release decades ago would have dimmed the klieg lights on many who were innocent and shown them more brightly on those who truly were guilty. It would have been an important contribution during a time when the innocent and the guilty were ensnared in the same net. 
   Today, Congress plays a pivotal role in declassification through so-called ``special searches.'' Generally, these involve a member of Congress or the White House asking the intelligence community to search its records on specific subjects. These have ranged from Pinochet to murdered American church women to President Kennedy's assassination. However, these good intentions often produce neither good results nor good history. Sadly, most of these searches have been done poorly, costing millions of dollars and consuming untold hours of labor. Several have been performed repeatedly. Special searches on murdered American church women, for example, have been done nine separate times. Yet there are still several important questions that have yet to be answered. The CIA alone has been asked to do 33 ``special searches'' since 1998. 
   Part of the problem is that Congress lacks a centralized, rational way of addressing these requests. This bill establishes a nine-member board composed of outside experts who can filter and steer these searches, all the while seeking maximum efficiency and disclosure. 
   The other part of the problem lies in how the intelligence community has conducted these searches. It is imperative that searches are carried out in a comprehensive manner. This is not only cheaper in the long run but produces a much more accurate record of our history. One cannot do Pinochet, for example, and not do Chile under his rule at the same time. To do otherwise skews history too much and creates too many blind spots, all leading to more questions and more searches. This does a disservice not only to those asking for these searches but to the American people who have to pay for ad hoc, poorly done declassification. If we do it right the first time, then we can forgo much inefficiency. 
   Many of these special searches ask vital questions about this nation's role in many disturbing events. We must see, therefore, that they are done correctly and responsibly. This legislation, if passed, would improve Congress' role in declassification, making it an instrumental arm in the de-cloaking and re-democratization of our national history. Indeed, anything less would cheat our citizens, undermine their trust in our institutions, and erode our democratic values. 
   By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mrs. BOXER, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. KERRY, Mr. LEAHY, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. REID, Mr. SARBANES and Mr. LIEBERMAN.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise once more to thank our dear colleague, the Senator from Oregon, for his remarks and his typically self-effacing mode. He said we may not have the last word. Indeed, we may not. But we have the first word. We have to do this together; that is, both sides of the aisle. We can. He and the Senator from Maine have the votes. But we need a vehicle. 
   His most important point is that medication is now making that great move from treatment of disease to prevention. That is always the great advance in health for everyone. The single most important health measures that we have done in the last century have been to clean up our water supplies so that we don't get ill. These drugs do the same. 
   He is right. I am with him. 
   I yield the floor, sir.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as have so many of our colleagues today, I rise to speak in memory of and in praise of John Chafee. He was my dearest friend for nigh onto a quarter century. 
   We came to the Senate together in 1977. As it happens, we were both appointed to the same committees. As we all know, the life of a Senator very much depends on the committees he or she is appointed to and the amount of time that they remain on those committees. 
   We were appointed to the Committee on Finance with its enormous range of jurisdiction, and to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Only recently at that point had the ``environment'' come up and made its way onto the title of what had previously been a Public Works Committee. We worked together on both committees from the very first. 
   These are exceptional committees. Possibly because of the great common interests that are dealt with, they have been exceptionally bipartisan committees. 
   I point out at this point we have three measures before the Senate: The trade legislation which we will go to tomorrow morning, the tax extender legislation which we must get to, and the Medicare and Medicaid amendments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. All three of these measures come to the floor with practically unanimous agreement. Two cases were unanimous; on another, just a voice vote with two dissents. 
   John Chafee, ranking Republican, as Senator ROTH, the chairman, would agree, was part of this consensus development from the first. He was instinctively a man of this body, and the national interests always came first. I can recall an occasion on the Committee on Environment and Public Works when we took a vote and afterwards John said: Hold it, hold it, did we just have a vote along party lines? We haven't had one of those in 15 years on this committee. 
   It happened we had one, and that moment passed. 
   He was deeply involved in environmental matters--the world environment as well as our own. I tended to emphasize public works, and we had a remarkably reinforcing and effective time, or so we like to think. Everyone has commented on his work. 
   On the Finance Committee--which not everyone understands is, in fact, also the health committee of the Senate--we deal with Medicare and Medicaid. John did a great many things. The one that was so typical and wonderful was to transmute gradually --over a quarter century--the Medicaid program from a program of health insurance for persons on welfare under title IV(a) of the Social Security Act such that we confined the population who could benefit to those persons who were dependent on welfare and added another incentive to dependency. He slowly moved this program to a health insurance program for low-income Americans. It was brilliantly done, not least of all because he never said he was instituting it; it just happened at his insistent and consistent behest. 
   The last great matter we addressed together was the effort to postpone, so as not to reject, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He was deeply involved with that. It is perhaps not easily accessible to others now that he was of a generation--I suppose I was of that generation--who can very arguably be said to owe their lives to the atom bomb. He was with marines already in the Solomon Islands. I was in the Navy; I would soon be on a landing craft. We were all headed for Honshu. The war would go on but then stopped because of that terrible, difficult, necessary decision President Truman made. 
   It was the most natural thing in the world for someone such as John Chafee to spend the rest of his life, in effect, trying to ensure that such a terrible act never was repeated. He was deeply attached to maintaining the essentials of the antiballistic missile program and believed that a rejection of the test ban treaty would then lead to our insisting on that. He did not prevail, but he was witnessed, as he was all of his life, as a man of valor, a man of courage, and such a decent man. 
   He was chairman of the Republican Conference. Around 1990, I believe, he was challenged, and openly--legitimately, in politics of our type--as too  liberal. It was a very close contest, decided by a single vote. Another colleague of his from that side of the aisle, of course, thought the honorable thing to do was to tell him in advance that he would be voting against Senator Chafee's role as party conference chairman and came over to John on the floor and told him this. It was, in effect, devastating news. John's reaction was, ``Oh, dear.'' Never a word of acrimony. He told me about it smiling the next day. He was hurting a bit, but he smiled even then. 
   He was so wide in his concerns and his empathy and his sympathy. I can only say all of us deal with special interests; we 
   all have special interests. But the only one I can identify with him was the Rhode Island Jewelry Manufacturers. Never did a trade bill pass through our committee without a little essay by him on the subject of the necessity to protect this important sector of the American economy; and he did, and without difficulty. If he wanted it, we wanted him to have it. 
   I close with the lines of W.B. Yeats, a wonderful poem, ``The Municipal Gallery Revisited,'' which concludes: 
 Think where man's glory most begins and ends. And say my glory was I had such friends.  
   We, all of us, share in that as we contemplate our loss, a loss which is more than made up by the great glory of his friendship. Liz and I send our deepest love to Ginny and to his family. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. He was relating back to when he was on the Kennedy team negotiating the trade policy, which was an outstanding policy at the time. It was outstanding in that it was realistic. 
   President Kennedy knew the situation. I went and showed how we brought the witnesses, and everything else, and found that textiles was second only to steel as the most important to our national security. And with that authority under the law, President Kennedy enunciated his seven-point textile program, from which came the Kennedy Round, the Multi fiber Arrangement, One Price Cotton; and it gave a chance--yes, to sort of an archaic industry--to really refurbish, retool, modernize, and compete. 
   Until the recent years, like NAFTA, they had been putting in $2 billion a year, at least $2 billion a year, in the State of Delaware, the State of South Carolina, and the several other States to modernize and compete. 
   I went to a plant there in Clinton, for example--I went to numerous ones last year--but this was an old plant, over 100 years old, that looked to me as if it was going to fall down. But I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. They had the most modern machinery and the highest productivity you could possibly imagine. 
   There isn't any question that the industry has been brought into the world of reality of so-called global competition. The only trouble is that our competitors are fancy-free and footloose with their protections, with their nontariff trade barriers, and other measures to protect their economic strength, and we are blindly pell-mell down the road with this so-called free trade, free trade, when, of course, it is obviously not free. 
   That goes back now to the standard of living we talked about. And more than the standard of living--if this passes because it will change what we said with the Multi fiber Arrangement just 5 years ago after GATT/WTO: That we were going to have a phaseout of any kind of quotas. 
   I know the distinguished Chair knows about subsidies. We have done all the research, just about, for the aircraft industry. We give them Export-Import Bank financing. We do not do that for textiles. We do not do that for textiles. 
   But I see all of these people come out for the farmer. Yes, I had to talk to a farmer friend yesterday. I support the farmers. I support that aircraft industry. The farmers, they get subsidized water, subsidized telephones, subsidized electricity. They get export subsidies. If it rains, they get protection; if it dries up, they get protection. 
   And Oracle. The Senator from Delaware says: Oracle is with us. That is that crowd with whom we started the Internet. You would think, by gosh, they invented it. 
   The politicians, the Pentagon, we did all of that back in 1967, 1968, 1969. We put in, at the University of Illinois and Stanford, the training programs for which ultimately benefited Mr. Yang of Yahoo and other Internet start-ups. And so fine, our friend Gates, he has 22,000 employees, and there are approximately 22,000 millionaires. There was nothing wrong with that. But don't talk about the engine of this prosperity and economy as this crowd. No, sir. 
   We go back to Henry Ford when he said, in order to sell his car: I want to make sure the person producing it is making enough to buy it. He started generating, more than anyone, just with Ford automobiles, the middle class in America. General Motors, compared to those 22,000, has 250,000. We had that machine tool industry, and we had all the rest of these good manufacturing establishments, but we have gone to software, which doesn't help us in our exports nearly as much as the heavy manufacturers. And it is not the engine. It is the hard industries that are the engine of our economy. 
   When you give me Oracle and Exxon and the rest of them on this particular bill, and foreign policy, obviously they are trying to explore oil in the sub-Sahara. They are trying to sell their goods anywhere else in the world and, of course, in Central America. But right to the point, this is the sort of last chance we have for a formative industry, second-most in importance to our national security. It is the last chance in the sense that after 5 years of the 10-year phaseout, the textile manufacturers all invested in that 10-year policy. So if we cut it off in October of 1999, cut it off at least 5 years short, they begin to lose the investment. They don't get the return. They don't increase their productivity. 
   I never heard such an outrageous statement, that this is going to increase their productivity. They immediately freeze in their tracks and say, no, we can't get our money back out of trying to, even again, buy a better spindle and get even a higher production. They begin to lose their money as well as the workers lose their jobs. It is a lose-lose situation because, bottom line, look what happens. 
   Like I say, all these other countries invest down there in the various Central American countries. Honduras, seven Taiwan firms, including the leading Chung hsing Textile have invested $24 million. Again, the Republic of China will provide $15 million in low-interest loans for Honduras to build an export processing zone, an EPZ. Then the Taiwan manufacturers in the upper and lower streams of the textile industry are planning to form integrated textile production in San Pedro Sula down in Honduras and Central America. The South Koreans, Kim and Arzu, have agreed on the need to diversify South Korean investment in Guatemala and their particular textile investments down there. 
   Looking at the Caribbean as a potential staging ground and production base, the Malaysian textile industry uses Caribbean plants as the gateway to the United States. Then again some 18 Taiwanese companies are down there. South Korea, 180 small South Korean companies, mostly textile and garment makers, have invested $130 million in five Central American nations. You can go right on down the list. 
   I am going to get in the RECORD on Monday the 100,000-acre tract the People's Republic of China, Beijing, developed--that industrial tract--down in Mexico. So it isn't somehow that we are opening it up for American fabric. Yes, temporarily that ATMI crowd, they thought they could just hold on to American fabric, but Burlington has found differently. They have moved down and other fabric manufacturers are moving. Why? Because it is cheaper in Mexico. 
   When it comes right down to it, it might be a good aim but it is a bad recoil. We learned that with the artillery in World War II. No matter how well the gun was aimed, if the recoil is going to kill the guncrew, don't fire. That is why we object to 
   proceeding to this particular bill--because the recoil here is going to kill this important industry. 
   I will be glad to get into it in depth when we have all the Members back here the first part of the week. Of course, the President, yes, he is building a library now, and he is looking to see what he did down in Central America and what he did in Africa and traveling around building a library. But he is absolutely draining, so to speak, the industrial strength in the United States of America. It is a sad thing to see that more people are not exercised about it. This has been going on for years on end. President Kennedy was worried, and that is why he put in his seven-point program when only 10 percent of the textile apparel consumed in the United States were represented in imports. 
   Now I am looking at at least two-thirds--nearly 70 percent of the clothing I am looking at in this Chamber is manufactured outside the United States; and, of course, the shoes, 86 percent of the shoes on the floor. But it has gone on to cameras and hand tools and everything else. 
   Just earlier this year we found out about steel. The World Bank runs around and says, wait a minute, in order to become a nation state, you have to have the steel for the tools of agriculture and the weapons of war. So the World Bank gives these 2-percent loans, all over the entire world, down through Africa, into the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran, now to the People's Republic of China. So they get an  overproductivity of steel, and they come dumping it here. And we are telling them, let us get more competitive. You have to look at these broad policies. You have to look at this broad foreign policy that the Senator from Delaware now enunciates and how wonderful it is that we are going to make friends in the sub-Sahara and down in Central America. 
   I think the Koreans, the Malaysians, the Taiwanese, the Japanese, and everyone else will be making the friends. They are quicker, faster; their countries subsidize, finance. They have followed the MITI form, not the American capitalistic form, but the controlled capitalism of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in the country of Japan. 
   That said, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Oregon leaves, I express my own personal gratitude to him and to Senator SNOWE for bringing this issue in the congenial, collegial way they do. It must be addressed. I feel presumptuous to speak on such matters in the presence of the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Tennessee, but since the advent of sulfa and penicillin, the great medical revolution has been the development of the array of prescription drugs that prevent disease as against cured, in the case of penicillin. We will one day go this way, and we will have Senator WYDEN and Senator SNOWE to thank and the Senator from Tennessee.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those of millions of New Yorkers to thank two treasured teams for a most memorable baseball season in the Empire State. We seldom enjoy such sweet success from both our major league teams, and in this regard our season has been unique. Our revered Bronx Bombers competed in typical Yankee fashion and have earned yet another World Series berth: their third in four years, 36th of the century. Meanwhile, our equally cherished Mets brought us an emotionally-lifting season and for a remarkable month faithfully lived up to their moniker ``The Amazin's.'' Each team achieved its success with character and class, and I would like to speak on these attributes. 
   This year's Mets provided us with a look into the gloried past as they continually conjured up wins worthy of the fabled '69 Miracle Mets. The last month of the season was a window into the Mets heart and soul, the view enthralling. Each time their prospects dimmed the gentlemen from Queens rose to the challenge. From a one-game playoff to enter the Division Series, to the final 26 roller-coaster innings of games five and six of the National League Championship Series, the Amazin's captivated New York with their relentless play. 
   These victories were earned by a collection of individuals epitomizing all that makes New York great. Al Leiter's pivotal shutout of the Reds advanced New York to the Division Series. Todd Pratt, substituting for the mighty Mike Piazza, won the Division Series with a storybook home run. Rookie Melvin Mora led the Mets in hitting in the NLCS. Perhaps the ultimate New York moment was Robin Ventura's ``Grand Single'' in the bottom of the 15th inning of Game 5 to win. Together, these players captivated us for a month of remarkable baseball. No game was out of reach and we watched in awed appreciation. Unfortunately, even these Miracle Mets reached the end of the road, a mere two wins shy of the World Series. But there is great pride in New York today for these Mets have soared. 
   We are blessed with another baseball team in New York. The Yankees are the greatest franchise in the history of sports and this season they have continued to meet their own lofty standards. Their quiet confidence and unassailable professionalism have powered them to a rematch with their 1996 World Series opponents, the Atlanta Braves. This matchup will determine who is the best team of the '90's and there is little doubt that the Yankees will bring their best to this pursuit. 
   The character of the Yankee team is unassailable. Joe Torre has fashioned a team in his own typically modest image. When an early season bout with cancer stole Torre from the team the Yanks rallied around their manager and maintained the unity that he created. This toughness of character was displayed throughout the season and into the playoffs. Paul O'Neill's gritty play with a broken rib best exemplifies the type of play the Yankees have given for Torre. With the dominance of ``El Duque'' Orlando Hernandez and Mariano Rivera the Yankees intimidated the Rangers and defeated the Red Sox. And of course the perpetually unflappable Ramiro Mendoza was pivotal in carrying us in times of trouble. With this team effort the Yankees have given Torre their best. It is with great anticipation that we look forward to the Yankees picking up the banner for the honor of New York. 
   Near the end of the regular season, as the Mets prospects looked bleak, one Atlanta player uncharitably suggested that New York fans shed their loyalty for the Mets and give their allegiance to the Yankees. The Mets very nearly proved this player wrong. 
   With great charity a united New York responds; Chipper, we'll see you in the Bronx.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I must say how delighted I am that the Senate has just confirmed Richard K. Eaton to be a Judge of the United States Court of International Trade. I have known Dick for nearly a quarter-century: he volunteered to work on my first campaign for the United States Senate in 1976. I was so impressed with his abilities, I asked him to run my Oneonta office. Later, he ran my New York City office. Then he moved to Washington to serve as my legislative director and--on two separate occasions--as my chief of staff. 
   Dick Eaton lives in Georgetown with his wife Susan Henshaw Jones and their two delightful daughters, Alice  and Liza. He is a partner in the New York law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, LLP. He was also a partner in Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon. His practice has been varied, but includes work on some of the largest offerings of municipal securities in American history and appearances on behalf of clients in civil lawsuits in both State and Federal Courts. 
   I suppose I have always thought of Dick as a judge. Before he joined my staff he was--at the tender age of 26--the Village Justice of Cooperstown, New York. I know I have always benefitted from his wise counsel with regard to matters large and small, professional and personal. I can tell you that he has the requisite qualities to make a fine judge: a respect for all points of view, extraordinarily good sense, an evenness of temperament, patience, intellectual agility, and absolute integrity. 
   Mr. President, Richard Eaton's greatest contribution to the administration of Justice may be that, since 1977, he has been the anchor of my committee that screens candidates for recommendation for Federal District Court and United States Attorney nominations. Dick now serves as chairman of the committee which--in our view at least--serves as a model for other States. Ours was the first such committee to proceed on a non-partisan basis. New York University Law School Professor Stephen Gillers put it this way:  
   In most places, lawyers who count, who want to be judges, become politically active. In New York, lawyers who want to be Federal trial judges complete a twelve-page questionnaire containing thirty-seven questions. An eleven-member panel screens applicants and recommends nominees. . . . Who have been Moynihan's nominees? . . . They are a first-rate group, as might be expected from the process that produced them.  
   No one deserves more credit for the committee's work than Dick. I know that a great number of Federal judges in New York can attest to the value of his counsel, so indispensable during the nomination and confirmation process, which often can be quite torturous. I daresay it is only fitting that Dick should himself join the Federal bench. 
   International trade litigation is a subject requiring intelligence and energy. The issues facing the Court of International Trade are hugely complex. As Congress prescribed in the Customs Court Act of 1980, the Court of International Trade has broadened its powers and is now far more capable of providing uniformity in the judicial decision-making process for import transactions as required under Article I, section 8, of the Constitution. It will require the dedication and surpassing intellect of someone meeting Dick Eaton's high standard to see this job through. The President has shown great wisdom in proposing Dick for this Court. 
   It would be remiss of me not to thank the Majority and Minority Leaders for shepherding this nomination, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senators HATCH and LEAHY, for their generous support. We have confirmed a man of great talent and unwavering integrity who will distinguish himself on the bench as he has in every other endeavor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa has been generous enough to let me speak a very short while on this measure, to tell you at the time we get on the bill the chairman of the Finance Committee, who cannot be here at this moment, will offer a manager's amendment which includes the sub-Saharan Africa bill which we are now technically on, with the Caribbean Basin Initiative bill, as well as the reauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences and the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. These measures have been reported by the Committee on Finance by an all but unanimous vote, voice vote, in all these cases. We very much hope we will bring this to a successful conclusion. 
   At stake is two-thirds of a century of American trade policy going back to the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 for which there is a history. Cordell Hull began the policy, under President Roosevelt. 
   In 1930, the Senate and the House passed what became known as the Smoot-Hawley tariff. If you were to make a short list of five events that led to the Second World War, that would be one of them. The tariffs went to unprecedented heights here. As predicted, imports dropped by two-thirds, but as was not predicted so did exports. What had been a market correction--more than that, the stock market collapse in 1929--moved into a long depression from which we never emerged until the Second World War. 
   The British went off free trade to Commonwealth preferences, the Japanese began the Greater East Asian Coprosperity Sphere, and in 1933, with unemployment at 25 percent, Adolph Hitler came into power as Chancellor of Germany. That sort of misses our memory. In 1934, Cordell Hull, Secretary of State, began the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program which was designed to bring down, by bilateral negotiations, the levels of tariffs. This has continued through administration after administration without exception since that time. 
   I would like to note in the bill we have before us that there are two measures of very large importance, both of which have expired. Unless we move now, we will again lose immeasurably important trade provisions for us. 
   The first of these is the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which is now in its 37th year. I can stand here as one of the few persons--I suppose the only--who served in the administration of John F. Kennedy. I was an Assistant Secretary of Labor. President Kennedy had sent up a very ambitious bill, the Trade Expansion Act. It was really the only major legislation of his first term. It required, in order to meet the legitimate concerns of southern textile manufacturers and northern clothing unions--needle trades, let's say--that we get a long-term cotton textile agreement which Secretary Blumenthal, Secretary Hickman Price, Jr., and I negotiated in Geneva successfully. True to their word, the Southern Senators came right up to this measure and voted for it. But we added something special, which was trade adjustment assistance.  
   We agreed in a free trading situation, or freer trade situation, the economy at large and the population at large would be better off, but some would lose. Trade adjustment assistance was to deal with that situation. It had been first proposed, oddly, by a fine labor leader, David MacDonald, of the United Steel Workers, in 1954, saying if we are going to have lower barriers to trade, we are going to lose some jobs; gain others. It was based on a modest and fair request from American labor: If some workers are to lose their jobs as a result of freer trade that benefits the country as a whole, a program should be established to help those workers find new employment. 
   It was Luther Hodges, Secretary of Commerce under President Kennedy, who came before the Finance Committee to propose this measure. Secretary Hodges was the Governor of North Carolina, was he not? A wonderful man; I recall working with him. I know the 
   Senator from South Carolina would. He said to the Finance Committee that ``the Federal Government has a special responsibility in this case. When the Government has contributed to economic injuries, it should also contribute to the economic adjustments required to repair them.'' 
   This has been in law, and we added a special program for NAFTA, and for firms as well. It has been there for 37 years. The program has now expired. The continuing resolution keeps it going for 3 weeks or whatever, but if we lose this we lose a central feature of social legislation that has allowed us to become the world's greatest trading nation with the most extraordinary prosperity in the course of a generation. 
   There is also the matter of the Generalized System of Preferences for the developing world. It was a response to a plea by developing countries that the industrial world ought to give them an opportunity and a bit of incentive to compete in world markets; not to beg for aid, just to buy and sell. It has been in our legislation since the Trade Act of 1974, which makes it a quarter century in place. It was renewed in 1984. It is now on life support. We got a 15-month extension in 1993; a 10-month extension in 1994; 10 months in early 1996; 13 months in early 1997; 12 months in 1998. 
   We have responsibility in both of these matters. The Finance Committee has met that responsibility. In due course, we will bring this measure to the floor for what we hope will be a successful vote on renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance and a 5-year reauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences. 
   I do not want to keep the Senate any longer. I see my distinguished colleague is on the floor. I thank my friend from Iowa, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have now set aside--until the next time!--the McCain-Feingold legislation on campaign finance reform. I did not speak during this most recent debate. The third in three years, and for certain not the last as Senator FEINGOLD made clear last evening on the ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.'' I supported the reform with only a faint sense of familiarity. Here we are, reforming the results of the last reform. A not infrequent task of Congress. But now it might be useful to offer a few related observations. 
   The first is to state that raising money for political campaigns has never been a great burden for this Senator, and for the simple reason that I  hardly do any. One dinner a term, perhaps two. Some receptions. Lots of mail. Not surprisingly the results are not exactly spectacular. In 1994, my last campaign, and which will be my last campaign, the Federal Elections Commission records our having raised $6,100,147. This is for the State of New York, the third most populous in the nation. But it sufficed. For practical purposes, all the money went to television, with the incomparable Doug Schoen keeping an eye on the numbers lest trouble appear unexpectedly. Our campaign staff never had ten persons, which may sound small to some, but I believe was our largest ever. Even so, we have done well. In 1988, I received some 4,000,000 votes and won by more than 2,000,000 votes, the largest numerical margin of victory in any legislative election in history. I say all this simply to note that just possibly money isn't everything. But if we think it is, it might as well be. And so we must persevere. 
   This July, in his celebrated Wall Street Journal column, Paul Gigot referred to me as an ``old pol'' and an ``ever loyal Democrat.'' I wrote to thank him, for this is pretty close to the truth. If I have spent time in universities it was usually seeking sanctuary after a failed election, my own or others. I go back before polling, and before television. (Although in 1953 I did write a 15-minute television speech for the Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York City, Robert F. Wagner, Jr. It might have been seen by 10,000 people.) But of course polling caught on, as the mathematics got better, and television has never stopped. And these, of course, are the technologies that seemingly confound us today. But this subject has been with us the longest while. 
   Congress first placed restrictions on political spending with the Naval Appropriations Bill of 1867 which prohibited Navy officers and Federal employees from soliciting campaign funds from navy yard workers. 
   Faced with allegations that corporations had bought influence with contributions to his campaign, President Theodore Roosevelt called for campaign finance reform in his 1905 and 1906 State of the Union addresses. In response, Congress passed the Tillman Act of 1907, banning corporate gifts to Federal candidates. And during World War II, the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, known as the Smith-Connally Act, temporarily prohibited unions from making contributions in Federal elections. In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act made this wartime measure permanent. As my colleagues well know, these bans have been made virtually irrelevant with the advent of so-called ``soft money.'' 
   Requirements for the disclosure of donors originated in the so-called Publicity Act of 1910 which required the treasurer of political committees to reveal the names of all contributors of $100 or more. Congress expanded the disclosure rules with the 1925 Federal Corrupt Practices Act, requiring political committees to report total contributions and expenditures. The Court upheld this Act in Burroughs v. United States, declaring that Congress has the prerogative to ``pass appropriate legislation to safeguard (a Presidential) election from the 
   improper use of money to influence the result.'' We continue to debate how to exercise that prerogative today. 
   But may I focus on one particular aspect of campaign funding, which is relatively new? Money for television. Ease this by providing free television time--those are public airways--and as much about the problem goes away as will ever be managed in this vale of toil and sin. 
   Max Frankel, the long-time and venerable editor of the New York Times and a wise and seasoned observer of American politics, addressed this issue in the October 26, 1997 New York Times Magazine:  
   The movement to clean up campaign financing is going nowhere for the simple reason that the reformers are aiming at the wrong target. They are laboring to limit the flow of money into politics when they should be looking to limit the candidates' need for money to pay for television time. It is the staggering price of addressing the voters that drives the unseemly money chase.  
   To run effectively for major office nowadays one needs to spend millions for television commercials that spread your fame, shout your slogans, denounce your opponents, and counteract television attacks. A campaign costing $10 million for a governorship or seat in the Senate is a bargain in many states. The President, even with all the advantages of the White House at his command, appears to have spent more than $250 million on television ads promoting his reelection in 1996. $250 million! 
   The problem of so-called ``issue advocacy'' is only fueling the amount of money going into television ads and further distorting our electoral system. On February 10, 1998, Tim Russert delivered the fifth annual Marver H. Bernstein Symposium on Governmental Reform at Georgetown University. In his address, he asserted that ``television ads paid for by the candidates themselves are (not) going to be the problem in future election cycles. That distinction will be earned by so-called `issue advocacy' advertising by ideological and single issue groups.'' He made the point that, unlike candidates, these groups are not subject to campaign contribution limits or disclosure requirements. 
   In Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme court held that these ads are protected speech under the First Amendment. We are told that requiring such groups to disclose their list of contributors might be a violation of the First Amendment under NAACP v. Alabama. Mr. Russert contends that ``unless the Fourth Estate is able to identify these groups and ferret out their funding, and explain their agenda, many elections could very well be taken hostage by a select band of anonymous donors and political hit men.'' There must be a better way. 
   Might I suggest that the way to reduce the influence of these ``select band of anonymous donors and political hit men'' and to reduce the ungodly amount of money being used in campaigns is free television time for candidates. Frankel writes:  
   It would be cheaper by far if Federal and State treasuries paid directly for the television time that candidates need to define themselves to the public--provided they purchased no commercial time of their own. Democracy would be further enhanced if television stations that sold time to special interest groups in election years were required, in return for the use of the public spectrum, to give equal time to opposing views. But so long as expensive television commercials are our society's main campaign weapons, politicians will not abandon the demeaning and often corrupt quest for ever more money from ever more suspect sources.  
   The version of the McCain-Feingold bill we have been considering restricts so-called ``soft money''--contributions that national, state, county, and local party organizations may collect and spend freely provided only that the television messages they produce with the funds are disguised to appear ``uncoordinated'' with any candidate's campaign. This is a good first step. But it is not enough. Even if soft money and slimy variants were prohibited, political money would reappear in liquid or vaporous form. If we want to make significant changes with regard to how we conduct campaigns, we must--to repeat Frankel--look beyond limiting the flow of money into politics and rather look to limiting the candidates' need for money to pay for television time. Frankel concludes his piece on campaign finance reform by stating that ``there is no point dreaming of a law that says `you may not' so long as the political system daily teaches the participants `you must.' Until candidates for office in America are relieved of the costly burden of buying television time, the scandals will grow.'' He could not be more right.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to correct the RECORD by noting that Senator BARBARA BOXER was erroneously listed as having signed the letter Senator WARNER and I wrote on October 12, 1999, regarding the Senate's need to postpone voting on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Her name should therefore be excised from this letter.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S.-Turkey Free Trade Agreement Act of 1999. This bill provides traditional trade negotiating authority--we once called it ``fast track authority''--for a free trade agreement (FTA) with the Republic of Turkey. It would authorize the President to negotiate and conclude a free trade agreement with one of America's most important allies and bring that agreement and any necessary implementing legislation back to the Congress for an up-or-down vote, within a time certain. 
   I would begin by noting that Turkey has played a singular role at the crossroads of East and West since 1923, when the legendary Mustafa Kemal ``Ataturk'' built a western-oriented, secular state out of the ashes of the collapsed 600-year old Ottoman Empire. Its constitution establishes a democratic, parliamentary form of government with an independent judiciary. Indeed, it is the only Muslim country with a secular democracy. 
   Turkish-American friendship is longstanding: it was first consecrated in the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and the Ottoman Empire in 1830. The 1929 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation cemented our commercial ties with the new republic, while the July 12, 1947 agreement on aid to Turkey, implementing the Truman Doctrine, inaugurated the very close relationship that continues today. Our friendship has since been reinforced by more than 60 agreements, treaties and memoranda of understanding. 
   It is time to take that relationship a step farther, and begin negotiations toward a free trade agreement with Turkey. Not only do our strategic and political interests dictate closer economic integration, but our commercial interests do so as well. 
   Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey has played a central role in safeguarding the United States' security interests in the region since it first entered World War II on the side of the allies at the end of the war. Turkey was a charter member of the United Nations and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. It currently has the largest military force in the Middle East, and the second largest military force in NATO. 
   Its geography, history, and relative economic success put Turkey in a position of potential influence in Central Asia, which is, of course, populated mainly by Turkic peoples. To the west, Turkey plays an important role in Europe, both because of its NATO membership and the situation on Cyprus. We applaud the recent improvements in Turkey's relations with Greece, and hope for more. This past summer the two countries held bilateral talks on a range of issues, talks which continued in early September. The tragedy of the recent earthquakes further reinforced this burgeoning relationship as Greece and then Turkey promptly dispatched emergency rescue crews and supplies to assist the other in dealing with these disasters. 
   And to the south, Turkey is, without question, one of our two most important allies in the Middle East. The other is its neighbor, Israel, with whom the United States negotiated a free trade agreement that went into effect in 1985. Less well known is the fact that Turkey and Israel negotiated a free trade agreement in 1996, which was ratified in 1997 and is in force today. A U.S.-Turkey FTA would simply complete the triangle. 
   Writing in the September 28, 1999 edition of The Washington Post, Dr. Isaiah Frank, the very distinguished William L. Clayton Professor of International Economics at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, argued persuasively on political grounds for a free trade agreement with Turkey.  
   The EU's equivocation [over Turkey's proposed membership in the European Union] has bred Turkish disaffection from Europe and plays into the political hands of the Islamists who as recently as 1996 were at the helm of the government. Clearly, the enormous U.S. stake in a secular, Western-oriented Turkey warrants action by the United States to offset the EU's arm's length treatment and to strengthen and solidify the country's Western political and economic integration.  
   But Dr. Frank was correct to point out as well that a free trade agreement with Turkey would also be in the United States' economic interest. Turkey is an industrial country, underpinned by strong free market principles and a vibrant private sector. It was in 1961 a founding member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the exclusive club--there are today only 29 OECD member countries--that serves as the principal economic forum for the industrialized world. 
   In the 1980's, Turkey took major steps to liberalize its economy. Progress continues to be made: earlier this year, Turkey's parliament passed a significant banking reform bill, landmark social security reform and constitutional amendments removing obstacles to foreign investment and promoting the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Turkey's increasingly open economy has produced rewards: during most of the 1990's, it has been one of the fastest growing of the OECD countries and, for the past eight years, it has had the fourth highest annual growth rate, after Ireland, Korea and Luxembourg, recording a 4.4% average annual rate of growth in GNP between 1990 and 1998. 
   Turkey has opened itself to the global economy in significant ways. It became a Contracting Party to the General Agreement on Tariffs in Trade in 1951 and joined the World Trade Organization as a charter member in 1995. Turkey signed a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association in 1991 and established a customs union with the European Union in 1996. As Dr. Frank noted, it has sought full membership in the EU, thus far without success. There has been, of late,  some limited progress in that regard: on October 13, 1999, the European Commission suggested that Turkey be made a candidate for possible EU membership, but proposed that negotiations be deferred for some unspecified time. The matter is to be discussed at the EU summit this December. In 1992, Turkey joined ten other countries (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia and Ukraine) to form the Black Sea Economic Cooperation group, which aims at promoting multilateral cooperation and trade in that region. 
   Our own economic ties with Turkey have strengthened over the years as well. In 1986, we concluded a bilateral investment treaty and in 1998 a bilateral tax treaty. And on September 29, 1999, President Clinton and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, which establishes a bilateral Council on Trade and Investment that will serve as a forum for regular discussions on commercial matters. Helpful steps all, but, I would argue, not bold enough. I agree with Dr. Frank that a free trade agreement with Turkey ought to be our goal. 
   Yes, our trade with Turkey is still on a small scale. In 1998, U.S. merchandise exports to Turkey reached $3.5 billion, making Turkey our 34th largest export market. Our imports from Turkey were even smaller--$2.5 billion, or less than 0.3 percent of total imports--making Turkey our 39th largest source of imports. 
   Certainly Turkey compares favorably with Chile, the only country with whom the United States has begun free trade agreement negotiations since the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into force. In 1998, U.S. merchandise exports to Chile totaled $3.9 billion, only slightly higher than our $3.5 billion in exports to Turkey that year, while our imports from Chile in 1998 were the same as our imports from Turkey--$2.5 billion. And both countries fall within the World Bank's grouping of ``upper middle income'' countries based on per capita GNP: in 1998's Turkey's stood at $3,160, compared with $4,810 for Chile. 
   Turkey's market potential is certainly greater than Chile's: Turkey's population is four times the size of Chile's population (62 million vs. 15 million) and Turkey's total imports in 1998--about $42 billion--were double Chile's total imports that year--$19 billion. 
   To be sure, more than 50 percent of Turkey's trade--both exports and imports--is conducted with the European Union, but the United States is Turkey's second largest single-country trading partner, after Germany. And in 1993, the Department of Commerce designated Turkey one of 10 ``Big Emerging Markets''--a focal point for U.S. export and investment promotion efforts--because of its ``outstanding growth prospects'' and growing market of 62 million consumers. 
   I am convinced that there are strong economic arguments for a free trade agreement with Turkey. Our negotiators will have to take care, of course, that the benefits of the FTA are restricted to the United States and Turkey. But this is a matter that will be addressed when the negotiators write the rules of origin that will apply to the FTA. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today would set us on the course of negotiating and implementing an FTA with Turkey, much as we negotiated an FTA over a decade ago with Turkey's neighbor, and our dear friend, Israel. And much as Turkey and Israel have seen it in their mutual interest to negotiate a free trade agreement. 
   Dr. Frank made the case persuasively and succinctly in his op-ed piece in The Washington Post:  
   In light of Turkey's strategic role as a U.S. ally in a rough neighborhood, a U.S.-Turkey free-trade agreement would help consolidate Turkey's Western orientation and contribute to stability in a highly volatile region of the world.  
   I am hopeful that this bill will start us down that path. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill and Dr. Frank's op-ed article be inserted into the RECORD.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, This year marks the centennial of Catholic Charities of the Brooklyn-Queens Diocese, the largest Roman Catholic human services agency in the nation. Perhaps on earth. The New York Times had the happy thought to mark the occasion with a profile of Bishop Joseph M. Sullivan, the vicar of the diocese, who heads Catholic Charities. The warmth and wisdom of this great churchman comes through so clearly, so forcefully. As Yeats once wrote of such a man, ``he was blessed and had the power to bless.'' I have treasured his friendship, and share his fears as to the fate of New York's poor when they begin to fall off the five-year cliff created by the so-called Welfare Reform Act of 1996. We would do well to contemplate the fact that the only major social legislation of the 1990s was the abolition of Aid to Families of Dependent Children, a provision of the great Social Security Act of 1935. We could care for children in the midst of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but somehow not in the midst of the great prosperity of the 1990s. I spoke at length about the gamble we were taking when the legislation was before us. I hope I was wrong. But if Joe Sullivan is worried I think we all should be. I know we all should be.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Edward C. Banfield has died. This had to come. He was 83. Yet little were those who loved him prepared. Or ready, you might say. 
   He held, of course, Henry Lee Shattuck Chair in Government at Harvard and, as Richard Bernstein notes in his fine obituary in The Times, was most active in the Joint Center for Urban Studies of M.I.T. and Harvard in the 1960s and 1970s. For part of that time I was chairman of the Joint Center and so came to know him at the peak of his long, comparably brilliant and yet understated career. In 1970, he published The Unheavenly City, which stands to this day as the most salient and, well, heart-wrenching exposition of the intractable nature of so many urban problems. He had been there before. As early as 1955 he wrote, with Martin Meyerson, Politics, Planning and the Public Interest which argued that the near religious zeal for high-rise public housing then current in Chicago, and across the land, would be a disaster. One notes it has taken Chicago the better part of thirty-five years to realize this, and start dynamiting the projects, as they came to be known. Just so was the seminal, The Moral Basis of a Backward Society, a study of a small village in Southern Italy, which he wrote with Laura Fasano-Banfield, his radiantly intelligent wife and companion of sixty-odd years. 
   Now of course, none of this work was welcome, especially in academe. Not least because it made too much sense to be rejected. James Q. Wilson, once his student, now his heir, got this just right in a memorial that appeared in last week's Weekly Standard entitled ``The Man Who Knew Too Much, Edward C. Banfield, 1916-1999.'' He was onto The Mob, inside The Agency, privy to The Plan. And yet they never got him. He was, as he would say, a ``swamp Yankee,'' a tough breed. 
   He was also a great teacher, something Robert J. Samuelson writes about so wonderfully well in The Washington Post. Above all he taught his students to pursue the truth, ``no matter how inconvenient, unpopular, unfashionable or discomforting.'' The greatest gift a great teacher can give. 
   He could be indulgent if the case seemed hopeless. I went to see him at the time I was thinking of running for the Senate. What would he advise? ``Well,'' he said, ``you could do that. Who knows, you might make a good Senator.'' Those words are with me to this moment.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank, above all Members in this body, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, who is opposed to this treaty, as I am in support. 
   Together we have addressed a letter to our distinguished leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, asking that the matter be put off until the next Congress, as the President has requested be done. 
   Sir, this morning I don't think we had a handful of signatures on that letter. At this moment, we have more than half the Members of this body--as the day has gone by, the realization of what an enormous decision we are making with so very little consideration has sunk in. 
   Sir, we spent in my time in this body 38 days debating the Panama Canal Treaty. The Treaty of Versailles--equally important--was debated 31 days in 1919 and 24 days in 1920. 
   Note that it was passed over, because a treaty does not die once it has simply been voted down; it remains on the calendar. 
   But I would like to express the hope that before the debate is over, the distinguished Senator from Virginia might place in the RECORD the letter  which we addressed to the leaders and perhaps, if he wishes, the signatures we have so far received. 
   He indicates he would be willing to do that. I thank him and I thank my leader, Senator BIDEN.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, to continue on the point made by our distinguished ranking member that the leaders of Britain, France, and Germany are appealing to the Senate this very day to sign this treaty, I make a point to the Senate which I don't know has ever been made. That is that in the aftermath of the Cold War we find ourselves the one nation on Earth that has the power to shape events all over the Earth. 
   Coral Bell, of the Australian National University, wrote about this in an article in the recent issue of ``The National Interest,'' called ``American Ascendancy.'' There is a striking passage. She writes:  
   During the 1990s, the United States has mostly tiptoed through the current unipolar structure of the society of states with a sort of ponderous tact, like a benign Ferdinand-type bull making its way delicately around a china shop of unknown value. That prudence has been well justified: the situation is still quite new and of uncertain import to all the world's policymakers. History is not much help, for no equal degree of unipolarity has existed since the high point of the Roman world, almost two millennia ago.  
   I repeat, there has been no such unipolarity since the high point of the Roman world, two millennia ago.  
   The central balance of power had seen the main agenda of world politics for more than five centuries.  
   We think of the Congress of Vienna of 1815, of the British role in the balance of power in Europe, and such the like.  
   Bell continues, ``......this `intermission,' even for a time whose length remains a matter of speculation, is a truly transformatory event.''  
   A truly transformatory event. Nothing such has happened in two millenia. 
   As if evidence were required, in this morning's New York Times, Jacques Chirac, the President of France, and Tony Blair, Prime Minister of Britain, and Gerhard Schroeder, Chancellor of Germany, wrote an op-ed article pleading with the Senate to ratify this treaty. I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed after my remarks.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. At any time in our history, can anyone imagine the effective heads of the Governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany pleading with the Senate in our own press to do what we had led the world to do in the first place. 
   The point has been made that the idea of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was first proposed by President Eisenhower in 1958. I note that when we finally got around to drafting one, the United States was the first signatory on that same day in New York. The other four of the five declared nuclear powers also signed. However, we were the first to propose it, as we were the first to develop nuclear power as a weapon; the first to propose ending tests to continue expanding our arsenals; and now the first to sign such a treaty, almost a generation after Eisenhower proposed it. 
   There were increments along the way. I was in the Kennedy administration at the time the Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty was signed. It seemed such a large event, and it was. 
   Governor Harriman was a negotiator in Moscow and made the point--I had served him in Albany, and we talked about this--he said that when he arrived, the Soviets had already decided to sign this treaty, but of course we had to have days of intense negotiations to reach the point where they would agree to do what they had already decided to do. The Soviets had said yes, there is too much danger to mankind. 
   That was something they had not previously concerned themselves over much with, save as a revolutionary state. 
   Just a line from the article by the three heads of government:  
   The decisions we take now will help determine, for generations to come, the safety of the world we bequeath to our children. As we look to the next century, our greatest concern is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and chiefly nuclear proliferation. We have to face the stark truth that nuclear proliferation remains the major threat to world safety.  
   They are speaking to us in this near-empty Chamber. Some of our most distinguished authorities in these matters are here. Most Senators are not. The powers that dominated the last 500 years of politics: England, France, Germany--Spain somehow not there for the moment--pleading with us. 
   May I be specific, if I can, on the matter of particular interest? You may be sure it was on the minds of the leaders who have written to us today, and that is the situation in the subcontinent, which is to say India and Pakistan. I was Ambassador to India in 1974 when the Indians set off what they called a ``peaceful nuclear explosion.'' They intended it as such. In conversations with Prime Minister Gandhi, she was persuasive that they were not going to build a bomb; they simply wanted to establish that they had the capacity to do so. It was a matter of prestige. It was a matter of reminding Westerners that Indian physicists, such as Satyendranath Bose, had been as much a part of the great era of discovery early in the century as the Europeans, and more than Americans. 
   A quarter century goes by. The Congress Party with its universalist tendencies and professions has gone into a minority. A new party, a Hindu party, as it calls itself, the BJP, came to power in March of 1998. Two months later, India set off a series of five nuclear explosions. That was followed almost instantly with Pakistan doing the same. At the same time, they demonstrated a missile, probably of North Korean origin, which they named the Ghauri, in honor of the first Islamic invader of Hindu India. 
   Here you have all those things that conspire to destruction. This spring there was a Pakistan offensive in the Kargil mountains of Kashmir. The Indian Government quite successfully held it back and repulsed it, I believe, but not before Pakistani military officers had said: Keep this up and there are other options available to us. 
   Those other options of course include the nuclear option. 
   Here an important distinction is to be made. In India, to its great credit, nuclear development is a matter directly under the control of the Prime Minister and is not under the control of the military. The Indian military have been very apolitical, kept out of politics, and have followed civilian command from the beginning. Not so Pakistan. The Pakistan bomb is in the armamentarium of the Pakistan military. 
   Here, if I can make a point on which I do have total confidence, but I believe is a shared judgment: It is not clear that the Indian tests last year were all  that successful. They probably did not achieve a hydrogen bomb as they proclaimed. Even the 1974 test was exaggerated in its volume. The Indians have kept the military out of nuclear matters, but their scientists know they have not sufficiently succeeded, and they want to test more. 
   In the report from India in this morning's press announcing the BJ Party has been returned to office with a very solid coalition, it was noted that the outgoing government, which will now be coming back in, had committed itself to further testing. They need to do that because they are, obviously, at a disadvantage as regards their adversary, the Pakistanis. They need, as it were, to show the Pakistanis they have the weapons that they have claimed to have. In turn, the Pakistanis will respond. 
   Pakistan is not a stable country, not a country with civil authority very secure, and an impoverished country, a country that will be selling nuclear weapons. They will be selling them to the Middle East. A Saudi prince has recently visited Pakistan and was shown nuclear facilities. We have to expect this migration. It is ineluctable, unless we get this treaty. 
   The point I finally make is we dare not reject the treaty but we need not instantly ratify it. The treaty, very carefully drawn, provides that 44 states must have ratified this treaty before it goes into effect--44. As of today, of the 44 states required, 41 have signed the treaty but only 26 have ratified it, which is to say another 18 countries, including the United States, have to do so before it goes into effect. Of these countries, the most significant clearly are India and Pakistan. I assure you--well, I withdraw that remark--I prophesy that, should we turn this treaty down, the forces in New Delhi and in Islamabad will say: ``You see, there are the Western imperialists demanding their own liberties to do anything they wish--tests, they have already the 1,030 tests--and they want now to deny them to us? No. That day is over.'' 
   Can we not listen to our closest friends and allies? We cannot ratify today. Someday we will, but we must not reject this treaty. It would be sending a ruinous signal. The complexities of our procedures in the Senate are not understood abroad, and they need not be in that sense. The word will be we said no, just as in 1919 we said no to the Treaty of Versailles, we would not become involved in the affairs of Europe. And how many years was it until D-Day when we had to land our forces there?

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by Senators JEFFORDS, LEAHY, GRAMS, KERREY, ROBB, ROCKEFELLER, and SARBANES, to introduce legislation to provide greater disclosure of the impact of pension plan conversions. 
   This is the second bill I have sponsored this session aimed at achieving transparency of the effects of traditional pension plan conversions to ``cash balance'' plans, which have become extremely controversial in recent months. At least 300 large U.S. companies have converted to cash balance plans in the last few years. 
   Cash balance plans combine certain features of ``defined benefit'' and ``defined contribution'' plans. Like defined contribution plans, cash balance plans provide each employee with an individual account representing a lump-sum benefit. Like traditional defined benefit plans, cash balance plan contributions are made primarily by the employer and are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
   The calculation of benefits under cash balance plans, however, differs from other defined benefit plans. Whereas a traditional defined benefit plan grows slowly in the early years and more rapidly as one approaches retirement, cash balance plans de-accelerate this later-year growth and increase the early-year growth. Consequently, younger employees tend to do better under cash balance plans than under traditional plans, while older employees typically do worse. In some cases, an older worker's starting account balance may remain static for years--typically referred to as the ``wear away'' period. 
   The controversy over cash balance plans arises in part because present disclosure requirements are inadequate. Under present law, when an employer amends a defined benefit pension plan in a manner which significantly reduces the rate of future benefit accrual, the employer must provide participants with an advance written notice of the amendment. The law does not, however, require employers to disclose the effect the amendment will have on participants. In fact, it does not even require employers to disclose that benefits will be reduced. All that present law requires is that employers provide participants with a summary or copy of the plan amendment. Consequently, current law can be satisfied with a summary buried in an obscure document. In some cases, workers have complained that their employers purposefully obscured benefit reductions. As a result, employee anger over cash balance plans has grown, resulting in several class action lawsuits being filed in just the last three years. 
   The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act will strengthen existing law by requiring disclosure of information which will enable employees to determine the effects of benefit reductions. Specifically, before the plan is changed, each adversely-affected employee must receive illustrative examples showing the effects of the change on various employee groups. Moreover, each employee must have the opportunity to receive the benefit formulas for the old and new versions of the plan so that he or she can make specific comparisons of both plans. Then, 90 days after the plan is changed, each adversely-affected employee must have, upon request, the opportunity to receive an individual benefit comparison prepared by the employer. This information will provide employees with the knowledge they need regarding pension benefit reductions, while imposing minimal burden on employers. 
   The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act, is a modified version of legislation I introduced in March entitled The Pension Right to Know Act (S. 
   659). The new measure attempts to address concerns raised by employers concerning S. 659. For example, the new measure requires disclosure only for adversely-affected employees, not all employees, in order to meet employer concerns that S. 659 was too broad in its reach. Moreover, the new bill addresses employer concerns that it would be difficult to provide individual benefit comparisons before the amendment effective date due to a lack of individual data. Under the bill introduced today, individual benefit comparisons would be required no earlier than 90 days after the effective date, and then only upon request. (To enable employees to compare the old and new plans before the effective date, this bill provides illustrative examples and, upon request, the benefit formulas for the old and new plans.) Another change is that the new bill allows the Secretary of Treasury to develop alternative and simplified compliance methods where appropriate, as in cases where there is no fundamental change in the manner in which benefits are determined. Moreover, the Secretary may reduce the advance notice period from 45 days to 15 days in cases in which the 45-day requirement would be unduly burdensome because the amendment is contingent on a merger, acquisition, disposition or other similar transaction. 
   I believe that such disclosure not only is in the best interest of employees, but also of the employer. Several class action lawsuits have been filed in the last three years challenging conversions to cash balance plans. These suits will likely cost millions of dollars in attorneys' fees, but with proper disclosure they might not have occurred. 
   I want to acknowledge the work of the Clinton Administration in helping to craft this measure. The bill largely follows the outline of a proposal suggested by the Administration in July which was developed in collaboration with my staff. The Departments of Treasury and Labor have provided great insight and creativity in developing this bill, and I thank them for their assistance. Two of our distinguished House colleagues, Congressman ROBERT MATSUI of California and Congressman JERRY WELLER of Illinois, are introducing this legislation in the other chamber, so hopefully it will become law this year. 
   In closing, let me repeat what I have said in the past. I take no position on the underlying merit of cash balance plans. Ours is a voluntary pension system, and companies must do what is right for them and their employees. But I feel strongly that companies must fully and comprehensibly inform their employees regarding whatever pension benefits the company offers. Companies have no right to misrepresent or obfuscate the projected benefit employees will receive under a cash balance plan or any other pension arrangement, notwithstanding the fact that some pension consultants have advocated cash balance plans for that very purpose. 
   As I said upon introduction of my earlier legislation on this topic, it is time to let the sun shine on pension plan conversions. I urge the Senate to support this important measure.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to amend the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCPIA). This legislation improves the procedures for restricting imports of archaeological and ethnological materials. I am pleased that the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, joins me, as well as my distinguished colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER. 
   This legislation provides a necessary clarification of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. The CCPIA was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and passed in the waning days of the 97th Congress. The CCPIA implements the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. It sets forth our national policy concerning the importation of cultural property. As the last of the authors of the CCPIA remaining in the Senate, it falls to me to keep a close eye on its implementation. 
   Central to our intention in drafting the CCPIA was the principle that the United States will act to bar the importation of particular antiquities, but only as part of a concerted international response to a specific, severe problem of pillage. The CCPIA established an elaborate process to ensure that the views of experts--archaeologists, ethnologists, art dealers, museums--and the public, are taken fully into account when foreign governments ask us to bar imports of antiquities. The Congress put these safeguards in place with the specific intent to provide due process. 
   The need for this bill arises from the recent proliferation of import restrictions imposed on archaeological and ethnological artifacts from a number of countries, including Canada and Peru. Restrictions may soon be imposed on imports from Cambodia, and I am told that the Government of Italy has now requested that the United States impose a sweeping embargo on archaeological material dating from the 8th century B.C. to the 5th century A.D. 
   My understanding is that the standards and procedures the Congress meant to introduce in the CCPIA are not being followed. The chief concerns are two-fold: (1) the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, which reviews all requests for import restrictions, remains essentially closed to non-members despite the provisions of the 1983 Cultural Property Act--which I co-authored with Senators Dole and Matsunaga--that call for open meetings and transparent procedures; and (2) the Committee lacks a knowledgeable art  dealer--in large part because the Executive Branch has interpreted the statute--incorrectly, in my view--to require that Committee members serve as ``special government employees'' rather than--as was intended--``representatives''--of dealers. Candidates have thus been subjected to insurmountable conflict-of-interest rules that have effectively prevented experts from serving on the Committee--the very individuals whose advice ought to be sought. 
   The amendments I offer today would open up the proceedings of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee and the administering agency (formerly USIA, now an agency under the Department of State) to allow for meaningful public participation in the fact-finding phase of an investigation, i.e., the stage at which the Committee and the agency review the factual basis for a country's request for import restrictions. The bill would require that notice of such a request be published in the Federal Register, that interested parties be provided an opportunity to comment, and that the Committee issue a public report of its findings in each case. Once the evidence is gathered, the Committee would, as under current law, be permitted to conduct its deliberations behind closed doors so as not to jeopardize the government's negotiating objectives or disclose its bargaining position. 
   The amendments would also clarify that Cultural Property Advisory Committee members are to serve only in a ``representative'' capacity--as is the 
   case with members of the President's trade advisory committees--and not as ``special government employees.'' It was my clear understanding, as one of the chief drafters of the law, that members of the Advisory Committee would be acting in a representative capacity. The CCPIA sought to ensure that there would be a ``fair representation of the various interests of the public sectors and the private sectors in the international exchange of archaeological and ethnological materials,'' by designating members to represent those various perspectives. The CCPIA reserves specific slots on the Advisory Committee for representatives of the affected interest groups, including as I mentioned earlier, art dealers. The special conflict-of-interest provisions applicable to ``special government employees'' would probably prevent any active art dealer knowledgeable in the affected areas of trade from serving on the Committee, depriving the Committee of invaluable expertise. 
   This bill, clarifying Congressional intent, is essential to successful implementation of the CCPIA. If I may ask the Senate's indulgence, I would like to summarize the key provisions of the bill: 
   Procedural requirements.--The bill amends Section 303(f)(2) of the CCPIA to provide that a foreign nation's request for relief shall include a detailed description of the archaeological or ethnological material that a party to the 1970 Cultural Property Convention seeks to protect and a comprehensive description of the evidence submitted in support of the request. This information is to be included in the Federal Register notice required to initiate proceedings under the CCPIA. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to provide interested parties with adequate notice of the nature of a foreign nation's request and the evidence in support of an allegedly serious condition of pillage, which is evidence essential to any response under CCPIA. In the past, proceedings before the CPAC and the administering agency (formerly USIA, now an agency under the Department of State) have been conducted almost in total secrecy, thus denying interested parties the opportunity to prepare rebuttal and response to the evidence presented by a foreign nation on alleged pillage and with respect to the other statutory requirements that must be satisfied. The result is that the Committee is denied a full, unbiased record upon which to make its decisions. 
   The bill also amends Section 303(f)(1)(C) of the CCPIA to provide that interested parties shall have an opportunity to provide comments to Executive Branch decision-makers on the findings and recommendations of the CPAC, which are to be made public under a separate provision of the bill. To date, interested parties have not had an effective opportunity to bring their perspectives to the attention of the statutory decision-maker. 
   Proceedings before the committee.--The bill amends Section 306(f)(1) of the CCPIA to provide that the procedures before the Advisory Committee shall be conducted to afford full participation by interested parties in the fact-finding phase of the CPAC review. 
   This provision draws a clear line between the fact-finding investigation and the deliberative review phases of the Committee's proceedings and provide for full public participation in the fact-finding phase. It also responds to concerns that, under current procedures, the Committee is denied full information from interested parties relating to the foreign nation's request because there is no public information about the specific nature of a request nor of the data supporting it. 
   Also, in an amendment to Section 306(f)(1) of the CCPIA, the Committee is directed to prepare, and then publish in the Federal Register, a report which includes, inter alia, its findings with respect to each of the criteria described in Section 301(a)(1) of the Act, which sets forth the requirements that must be met before import restrictions may be imposed. This amendment is essential to ensure that the Committee faithfully responds to each of the statutory criteria. 
   Import restrictions.--Our bill amends Section 303(a)(1)(A) of the CCPIA, dealing with the authority to impose restrictions, to make clear that there must be evidence of pillage which supports the full range of any import restrictions under the CCPIA and that such evidence must reflect contemporary pillage. Evidence of contemporary pillage is essential to the working of the Act, which is based on the concept that a U.S. import restriction will have a meaningful effect on an ongoing situation of pillage. 
   There is striking evidence that the Committee and the administering agency are now promulgating broad-scale import restrictions where there is no evidence of contemporary pillage that would justify the scope of those restrictions. Recent examples include omnibus import restrictions involving cultural property from Canada and Peru, extending over thousands of years. Vast portions of the Canadian restrictions were supported by no evidence whatsoever of contemporary pillage. Likewise, the Peruvian restrictions extend far beyond any evidence of current pillage contained in the administrative record. I am told that the Government of Italy has now requested that the United States impose a sweeping embargo on Italian archaeological materials dating from the 8th century B.C. to the 5th century A.D. 
   This provision also makes clear that an import embargo cannot be 
   based on historical evidence of pillage; rather, there must be contemporary pillage. This amendment responds to recent instances where the committee has made recommendations, which the agency has accepted, based upon evidence of pillage that is many years old, and indeed, evidence of pillage that occurred hundreds of years previously. It is quite obvious that an import restriction in 1999 cannot deter pillage that took place decades or even centuries ago. This provision is imperative to ensure that the administrative process under the act is faithful to the statutory goals of CCPIA. 
   Continuing review.--Our bill amends section 306(g) of the act to make more specific the obligation of the committee to conduct reviews, on an annual basis, of existing agreements providing for import restrictions; to publish in the Federal Register the conclusions of such reviews; and to report on those agreements not reviewed during the preceding year and the reasons why such agreements were not reviewed. The amendment provides for full public participation in the fact-finding phase of the annual reviews. It is prompted by the committee's failure to undertake, with full public participation, a prompt review of existing import restrictions, particularly those relating to Canada, for which serious questions have been raised as to the claims of pillage made in support of the omnibus U.S. import restrictions. 
   Multinational response.--These provisions deal with the action required by other art-importing nations in connection with non-emergency import restrictions imposed under the act. The  act requires that any import restriction under Section 303 of the act be accomplished by corresponding import restrictions by other nations having a significant trade in the cultural properties barred by the U.S. import restriction. The rationale for this requirement is that one cannot effectively deter a serious situation of pillage of cultural properties if the U.S. unilaterally closes its borders to the import of those properties, and they find their way, in an undiminished stream of commerce, to markets in London, Paris, Munich, Tokyo, or other air-importing centers. 
   Congress imposed a specific requirement of an actual multinational response. There is a concern that the committee is simply disregarding these requirements in its recent actions imposing far-reaching restrictions on cultural properties. Therefore, this subsection amends section 303(g)(2) of the act to require the administering agency to set forth in detail the reasons for its determination under this provision. 
   Consultation by committee members.--These provisions relate to the appropriate activities of committee members. In order to provide that maximum information and insight be brought to bear upon the committee's fact-finding and deliberations, all members of the Committee will be free to consult with others in connection with non-confidential information in an effort to secure expert advice and information on the justification for a particular request, and to share non-confidential information received from a requesting country in support of its request. Any such consultation must be reported in the committee's records. In the past, committee members have been advised that they would face severe sanctions if they were to consult with experts on the extent of pillage or other pertinent facts in connection with a foreign nation's request. 
   Cultural Property Advisory Committee membership.--Our bill clarifies that members of the CPAC serve in a representative capacity and not as officers or employees of the government or as special government employees (``SGEs''). This additional language is necessary because officials at the administering agency and elsewhere in the executive branch appear to have misconstrued congressional intent in this regard. 
   Because CPAC members are expected to bring their particular institutional perspectives to CPAC deliberations, the CCPIA seeks to ensure a ``fair representation of the various interests of the public sectors and the private sectors in the international exchange of archaeological and ethnological material,'' by designating members to represent various perspectives. To accomplish this purpose, Congress reserved specific slots on the CPAC for representatives of the affected interest groups. 
   Despite this language, the administering agency has asserted that CPAC members serve as SGE rather than in a representative capacity. As a result, certain experts have been prevented from serving on the CPAC. The proposed amendment would restate and clarify that all members of the CPAC serve in a representative capacity. 
   Federal Advisory Committee Act.--Finally, the bill makes clear that the transparency provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (e.g., open meetings, public notice, public participation, and public availability of documents) apply to the fact-finding phase of the committee's actions. Those provisions shall not apply to the deliberative phase of the committee's action if there is an appropriate determination that open procedures would compromise the Government's negotiating objectives or bargaining position. 
   This provision would open to the public the fact-gathering phase of the CPAC's work, while retaining discretion, consistent with section 206(h) of the CCPIA, to close the deliberative phase where the government's negotiating objectives or bargaining positions may be compromised.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my displeasure at the severe reduction this year's Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill includes for the Social Services Block Grant. This program was established under Title XX of the Social Security Act to help people who are least able to help themselves; the elderly, the disabled, and children of low income families. The money is put to good use in some two dozen areas such as foster care services, day care, intervention and prevention for at-risk families, and special services for the disabled. The Labor-HHS Subcommittee has produced a bill that cuts SSBG funds from $1.9 billion to $1 billion. Just short of cutting it in half. The committee report cites tight budget constraints and suggests that states can make up the difference with proceeds from the tobacco settlement. Mr. President, money from the tobacco settlement should be used for anti-smoking programs and other health programs. The basis of that litigation was that smoking caused health problems which the states had paid for. So health care programs that were deprived of funds in the past should be the beneficiaries of the tobacco money, as should anti-smoking programs. We should not tell the states that we're pulling the rug out from under the SSBG and it is up to them to make up the difference if they choose to. Some states have already passed legislation that allocates the tobacco money. 
   The Social Services Block Grant program is an entirely egalitarian program. The formula could scarcely be simpler. The proportion of the money each state gets is the proportion of the national population it has. New York has seven percent of the population. It gets seven percent of the funds. So this draconian cut affects states evenly. Everyone should be concerned about it. 
   One further point. This is a block grant. It allows the states to decide how best to spend money on a range of similar needs. The alternative would be a handful of categorical programs to which the states would apply individually. From time to time Senate debate centers on the merits of block grants versus categorical programs. Education comes to mind, for example. The opponents of block grants frequently say that once you block grant a group of existing programs, it becomes significantly easier to cut their funding. If this $900 million reduction is allowed to stand, the opponents of block grants will have a shining new example of the damage that can be done to a block grant and the proponents of block grants will have a more difficult time gaining their objectives in the future.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to the most urgent of matters about which I can be succinct. There has arisen in New York City the question of the propriety of a museum exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. The city government has contested this, and the museums of the city have, in turn, raised objections. 
   Floyd Abrams, who is perhaps the most significant first amendment lawyer of our age--I should correct myself to say he is the most significant first amendment lawyer of our age--is taking this case to a Federal district court, urging that a first amendment issue is involved and that the proposed measures of the City of New York are in violation of the first amendment and cannot be allowed to stand. 
   In that circumstance, I should think any Member of this body ought to defer to the courts before which this issue is now being placed. Clearly this amendment by Senator SMITH will not become law.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished managers of the bill if they would consider a request I have concerning the conference. Knowing the great difficulty they faced in reporting a bill that would not exceed this year's stringent budget caps, I was not too surprised to see that they were not able to provide funding for New York University's Center for Cognition, Learning, Emotion, and Memory, or CLEM, in the bill. However, I do hope that funding for CLEM can be found in conference. CLEM can help educators, physicians and other health care givers, policymakers, and the general public by enhancing our understanding of normal brain development as well as the many disabilities, disorders, and diseases that erode our ability to learn and think, to remember, and to emote appropriately. 
   CLEM focuses on research and training in the fundamental neurobiological mechanisms that underlie learning and memory--the acquisition and storage of information in the nervous system. Current studies by the faculty at NYU are determining why fear can facilitate memory; how memory can be enhanced; what conditions facilitate long-term and short-term memory; and where in the brain all these memories are processed and stored. The Center for Cognition, Learning, Emotion and Memory will draw on the University's strengths in the fields of neural science, biology, chemistry, psychology, computer science, and linguistics to push the frontiers of our understanding of how the brain develops, functions, malfunctions, matures, and ages. NYU researchers bring substantial strength in psychological testing, computational sophistication, advanced tissues staining and electrical problems, and humane animal conditions. These core facilities are well regarded by their peers and together have been awarded a total of $7 million from federal agencies and private foundations for their research. Also, the University is presently recruiting additional faculty in other areas of memory and learning specialization. As a major training institute, the Center will help prepare the next generation of interdisciplinary brain scientists. 
   I believe that the work of this Center is an appropriate focus for the Department of Veterans Affairs because research into how cognition and emotion interact can have applicability to other diverse areas of interest. For example, in understanding maladaptive responses and emotional disorders, researchers are better able to understand and treat phobias, panic attacks, and post-traumatic stress disorders. In addition, research into the learning process as it relates to attention and retention will lead to insights on mental losses and the decay of memory. Similarly, research at the center could prove most valuable to the EPA in its efforts to learn about and prevent the effects of toxic substances on man and animals. 
   Mr. President, funding for New York University in this bill would be entirely appropriate under VA, EPW, or as an item in the EDI account. It would be money well spent. I ask the distinguished managers if they will consider providing $1 million for NYU.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished managers of the bill would consider a request of mine? As they are aware, in previous years NASA has provided funds to the American Museum of Natural History to support the National Center for Science Literacy Education and Technology. The Museum reaches literally millions of children and families, schools and community groups each year through science education and exhibition, curriculum development and innovative educational technology. Now the Museum is unveiling a unique new resource for educating the nation about the wonders of the universe and our own planet Earth, the Rose Center. It will include a new state-of-the-art Hayden Planetarium, the Colman Hall of the Universe, and the Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth. The centerpiece of the new Center is a 90-foot-in-diameter sphere situated in a cubic glass-walled enclosure; and in the upper half of this sphere the Museum will be housing the most technologically advanced sky theater in the world with a map of the universe created by the Museum's National Center for Science Literacy and Technology in partnership with NASA: The Digital Galaxy Mapping Project. 
   While the National Center has received strong NASA-based support, the Museum has raised the funds, almost $100 million, for the Rose Center and these cutting-edge Halls of the Universe and Planet Earth through non-federal State, City, private and foundation support. 
   The Center is already working with innumerable schools in New York and beyond to develop more effective science education curriculum materials, as well as partnering with leading colleges and universities on critical research, education and training initiatives. They are now proposing to further expand the role of NASA and the Center with the goal of educating an ever broader segment of the American public. Through the Center's Education Materials Lab Project the Museum and NASA will develop additional curriculum modules from the prototypes created in the first phase of the NASA-Center agreement, based on and utilizing the unique investments and facilities of the Museum. There will be a major investment in a science visualization project that will highlight NASA developments and activities, from progress in the space station to new astronomical discoveries. 
   As you can see, Mr. President, the potential of the National Center at the Museum is boundless. However, a continuing and expanded federal partnership for science education and educational technology is important and appropriate there, given the role they play and the millions they reach. 
   I realize the constraints the subcommittee was under in writing a bill that would meet budget requirements. I simply ask that when the bill goes to conference the managers remember my original request that the NASA budget include a FY2000 appropriation of $5 million to further expand the reach of this important National Center, develop and improve educational materials and educational technology for schools, children and families, and to enhance the Museum's instrumentation and laboratory facilities that will contribute to these education, training and research objectives. The House Bill contains $3 million. I hope that sum can be increased to $5 million.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senate for its good judgment in confirming Judge Naomi Buchwald for Appointment to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
   After working in private practice and in the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Judge Buchwald became a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District. She has served with distinction in that position for nearly two decades. Her extensive experience in the court's rules and procedures will make her a splendid United States District Court Judge in the Southern District. 
   I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and the distinguished Ranking Member, Senator LEAHY; I also thank our leaders, Mr. LOTT and Mr. DASCHLE, and my colleague, Senator SCHUMER. Judge Buchwald's confirmation is a fine result for the State of New York and for the judiciary.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senate for its fine judgment in confirming Judge David Hurd for Appointment to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. I thank Senator HATCH, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, the Ranking Member; I also thank Mr. LOTT, Mr. DASCHLE, and my colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER. This is a great result for New York and for the judiciary. 
   A veteran and skilled private practitioner, who tried both civil and criminal cases for more than twenty-five years, Judge Hurd became a Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of New York in 1991. He has served with distinction for the past eight years in that position. His experience on the bench and in private practice before that has provided him with a complete familiarity with the practices and rules of the Northern District. 
   Judge Hurd will be a superb United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of New York.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life of Frederick P. Rose who died last week at the fine age of seventy-five, after a life that enhanced the lives of so many others. He was, of course, a member of the celebrated Rose family which rose, if you like (and he would have done!) with New York City itself, ever upwards and onwards. His craft was building--he was a graduate engineer--his art was friendship, but his genius lay in the way he would use his own wealth and epic energies to engage the support of legions of friends in the widest range of  civic enterprise. The range was exceptional, from the New York Public Library, to the American Museum of Natural History, to Yale University. As his richly-detailed obituary in The New York Times records, most often his gifts were anonymous, although eventually most were known, for how could we not notice how things changed around him. 
   He was for all this rather a private person, devoted to family, his wife Sandra, their children and grandchildren, his brothers Daniel and Elihu. These and also the musicians and chess players and plain fun-loving folk with whom he cavorted through three-quarter's century of the life of New York with a grace rarely imagined and yet more rarely attained. 
   We whom he leaves behind take consolation in Yeats' lines: 
 Think where man's glory most begins and ends, And say my glory was I had such friends.

On this Saturday past, following a nine-year courtship begun at their alma mater, Saint Louis University, the couple were wed in resplendent fashion among friends and family in New Orleans. 
   Mr. President, over my twenty-three years in the United States Senate, it has become increasingly acceptable to decry the loss of virtue in our young--to suggest that television, popular culture, et al., have conspired and, indeed, triumphed over American values. Anyone who knows Patrick and Jennifer and their loving families or fortunate enough to attend their beautiful ceremony would surely dispute such a view.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. This is wonderful news indeed. The Institute of Museum and Library Services provides essential support to our nation's 8,000 non-Federal museums and, through a different appropriation, 120,000 libraries. It goes about its business quietly and professionally, with scant attention paid here, but the thriving condition of our museums provides ample evidence of its competence and importance. 
   I think, perhaps, we have turned the corner on Federal support for the arts  and humanities, for culture. The chairman deserves much of the credit and an enormous debt of gratitude for his unwavering support for the NEA, NEH, and IMLS and for steadily shepherding their appropriations during these past few, difficult years.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Murray B. Light will end his career in journalism on September 19th, the 50th anniversary of his first day at The Buffalo News. Throughout his long and outstanding tenure at The News, he has had a profound influence on Buffalo and Western New York. He will be greatly missed.  
   Murray and I have been friends for many years. On one occasion, during my first term, Murray was kind enough to loan me his typewriter. I have a photo using it. They have long since switched to computers at The News, but I have yet to abandon my typewriter. 
   As The Buffalo News Editor, Murray B. Light has had an honored career. Stanford Lipsey, The News President and Publisher, said ``The responsibility of editing a daily metropolitan newspaper is enormous. It involves critical and complex decisions made against stressful deadlines. Murray Light never faltered in his courage, principles or judgment. He has left his mark on this newspaper and the entire community. It has been both stimulating and satisfying to have worked with him these past 20 years.'' 
   I have long admired Murray's aggressive editorial style. Nearly 20 years ago, I said that The Buffalo News and The Courier Express ``succeeded in making a not so simple point to the Congress of the United States: The leaking of hazardous chemicals at the Love Canal in Niagara Falls was not an isolated event but indeed the ominous warning of a national epidemic.'' This couldn't have been more right. They made the case for immediate passage of the Superfund Bill in 1980 and many more since then. 
   As I was often a guest of The Buffalo News at the annual Gridiron dinner, I had many opportunities to speak with Murray about our common concern of  preserving Buffalo's architecture and historic buildings. Murray made efforts to secure funding for the Darwin Martin House. He also made outstanding contributions to save Louis Sullivan's marvelous Guaranty Building, surely the world's first skyscraper, and to the renovation of Kleinhans Music Hall. My Buffalo office is in the Guaranty Building. Saving it from destruction is one of my greatest achievements as a senator. 
   Murray is a patriot having served in the Army in World War II as part of the Pacific force. Thanks to the assistance of the GI Bill of Rights, he did graduate work at Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and earned a master's degree in 1949. He also was a member of the State Judicial Screening Committee for the Fourth Department and the State Fair Trial Free Press Conference. At the request of Gov. Mario Cuomo, he served on the New York State Temporary Commission on Constitutional Revision in 1994. 
   A native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Brooklyn college, Murray came to Buffalo in 1949 as a reporter. While at The Buffalo News, he worked as a copy editor, assistant city editor, assistant news editor, swing editor, makeup editor and news editor, and managing editor. Thirty years after he began working for The News, Warren E. Buffett named him editor and vice president. He became senior vice president in 1983. Murray and his wife of 45 years, Joan, have three children. 
   In a letter to Murray, Warren Buffett wrote: ``From both a professional and a personal standpoint, you are the perfect person to be editor of The Buffalo News. I've always considered myself very lucky in having you there when I arrived in 1977.''

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I begin on a general point with which our revered chairman has just concluded, which is the reservation of the Social Security surpluses of the next decade for purposes of retiring the debt. This is a fact easily unobserved because we are not arguing about it. There is agreement here. What we will do, we will cut the national debt by more than half, the publicly held debt, and the interest costs accordingly. 
   Just a few years ago interest costs had become the third highest item in our budget. It is not noticed because we don't debate it. We don't decide how much we will pay in interest costs; it is automatic. But this has now happened. There has been a great recovery of American Government finances from a grim moment in 1992 when we had a fiscal year with a $290 billion deficit. 
   I will point simply to this morning's New York Times and the lead story, sir. I will just read the headline, ``Government Plans to Buy Back Bonds and Save Interest: Would retire some debt using the surplus to replace high-interest securities at lower rates''--a complex proposal being worked out in Treasury under Secretary Summers. Also, in the business section of this morning's New York Times, there is another story, ``The Dwindling Market in U.S. Treasury BONDs,'' discussing how the market is going to respond to the bond buy back. And there is this:  
   ``This is a sea change,'' said James M. Keller, senior vice president and portfolio manager for Treasury securities at Pimco Advisors, an asset management firm. ``I was struck by the Treasury's observation that the last time there were two back-to-back years of budget surpluses was in 1956 and 1957. I wasn't alive then, so this is a new thing for me.''  
   Indeed, it is a new thing and hugely to be welcomed. 
   I might also say that the chairman stated that this bill, which we will vote on at 7:06 this evening, is a clean bill; there is no provision in it that was not in either the House or the Senate proposals. But now I have to say to the Senate, with the utmost deference to my friend--I say to the Senators from Nebraska, Florida, Minnesota, Senator BINGAMAN--we have the word of the chairman, and his word is absolutely bondable in this body. If he says it, it is so. But that is the only way you would know it is so because we just received a copy of the bill this morning, and certainly have not been able to review all 589 pages. 
   This is not the way to handle the second largest tax decrease in history. There was no conference on this matter. We met formally for 20 minutes, and the negotiation was entirely between party leaders of the majority. It is an age-old practice of the Congress to, at the end of a conference, distribute the signature papers that the conferees sign or do not sign. I was the conferee for this side of the aisle; no signature paper came to me. 
   There was no participation of any kind from this side of the aisle. I think that would be true in the House as well as in the Senate. That is something we have to watch in terms of our procedures. It was not the way the Senate conducted itself in such a matter when I first came here and became a member of the Finance Committee. 
   During the debate last week on the Senate version of the reconciliation bill, I attempted to put the debate in a ``doctrinal perspective,'' as I put it. I traced the development from the 1960s of an intellectual movement which holds that the only way to restrain the  growth of Government is to deliberately create a protracted fiscal crisis. This was disarmingly put by then President-elect Reagan. It was just 16 days before his inauguration in 1981. He said:  
   There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance.  
   So in 1981 to 1983, the allowance of the Federal Government was reduced. While other intervening events--a sharp recession in 1981-82--impacted on revenues, nonetheless, there was a precipitous drop in revenues from 19.0 percent of GDP in 1980 to 17.5 percent of GDP in 1983. Simultaneously, the recession and defense buildup conspired to increase outlays from 20.2 percent of GDP in 1979 to 23.6 in 1983. The result, a huge gap--6 percent of GDP--between revenues and outlays, and deficits of $200 billion or more ``as far as the eye could see,'' to quote the former Director of OMB, David Stockman, and with this huge gap, the national debt quadrupled from under $1 trillion to $4 trillion between 1980 and 1992. 
   In August of 1993, with a deficit of $290 billion, we chose to confront that, to raise taxes and reduce outlays by a little more than a half trillion dollars. More recently, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that ``the total deficit reduction has been more than twice this--$1.2 trillion.'' In 1997, a bipartisan measure was passed. We are now in a situation of reasonable surplus, reasonable expectation. But there is no reason to act on a surplus that does not yet exist. 
   Here we are, with unemployment at 4.3 percent, near zero inflation, real economic growth at 4 percent, and an economy in the ninth year of an expansion. All the economists--the ones we care much about--are saying: Not now. Alan Greenspan suggested, speaking before the Senate and House Banking Committees just last month, the most effective means that we can have to regenerate the economy and keep the long-term growth path moving higher is if we hold tax cuts until we need a stimulus. Contrariwise, to stimulate when you don't need it is to invite inflation--inflation, which is a tax on anyone when interest rates go up. Anybody who pays a car loan and has a credit card or a mortgage pays it. 
   Dale Jorgenson described this persistent interest in cutting down the size of Government by reducing revenue ``fiscal disaster'' in his 1995 testimony before the Finance Committee. Yet it persists as a conviction. There is very little testing of the proposition. 
   I won't go on too long in this doctrinal discourse, but back in 1973, Herbert Kaufman of the Brookings Institution published a small book called ``Are Government Organizations Immortal?'' He reported that of 175 organizations he could identify in the Federal Government in 1923, no less than 148 were still there a half century later, and of the others, most of their functions had just been moved to different organizations. 
   Recently, the Cato Institute, a conservative group here in Washington, looked at the half dozen organizations which the 1995 House Contract With America targeted for extinction--$75 billion worth of programs, out. Sir, not one of them is out. Indeed, the appropriations for them have gone up by $2 billion.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Somehow we have to come to terms with this whole assumption. Perhaps something like the Hoover Commission on the organization of the executive branch needs to be done. Some of us have the assumption that we really aren't that serious. As that brief ceremonial meeting of our conferees this week opened, our respected friend--and we have known each other for a quarter century--BILL ARCHER said in his opening remarks:  
   We don't need full-time Government and part-time families; we need part-time Government and full-time families.  
   In no way to cast any suggestion that he is anything but absolutely sincere, I don't think the proposition would survive close inquiry. I asked him: Sir, do you think we could settle for ``a part-time Marine Corps, or a part-time Federal Bureau of Investigation?'' No, you don't mean that. 
   I, for one, very much share the view that the Federal Government has taken on too many matters and needs to be cleared out a very great deal. Our Federal system makes that possible, and the world situation in which we now find ourselves makes it necessary but not through the illusion that it will happen simply by reducing revenues. 
   I wish to make the point that we can't afford this tax cut. We may want one in 5 years time or in 3 years, but not at this time. That is why the fate of this measure has already been settled. 
   According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, tax expenditures are projected to cost about $672 billion in 2003. While we have not yet had time to adequately scour the conference report for all of its provisions, a cursory review indicates that, the bill we are asked to vote on today would increase annual tax expenditures by about $19 billion in 2003. 
   Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a tax expenditure is a revenue loss:  
   ..... attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption or deduction from gross income or which provide a special tax credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.  
   The problem is that we continue to use tax expenditures as a way of funding programs that we do not seem to have the will to finance with outlays--a problem made all the more severe by the caps on discretionary spending alluded to earlier. 
   On a more global scale, 40 years ago Walter Heller, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Kennedy-Johnson Administration spelled out the criteria for evaluating tax expenditures--criteria which most tax expenditures fail to meet. In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee Heller stated that Federal fiscal policy relies on income taxes for three central roles: (1) Placing resources at the Government's disposal in a non-inflationary way; (2) Offsetting fluctuations in the private economy; and (3) Bringing the distribution of income more closely into line with public preferences.

Of four historic buildings in Seneca Falls that should be part of the Women's Rights National Historical Park, the Hunt House is the only one that is not. It was the site of the gathering of five women (the founding mothers, you might say) who decided to hold the nation's first women's rights convention. That convention took place in Seneca Falls in July, 1848. The Women's Rights Park is a monument to the idea they espoused that summer, that women should have equal right with men; one of the most influential ideas of the last 150 years.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield myself 3 minutes. I want to comment on the history that our distinguished friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, makes about the origins of the Medicare program. 
   He was the Senator at the time. I was a member of the administration at the time and was involved. A basic decision was made, and thank goodness it was, that Medicare, medical assistance to the aging, would not be a poverty program. It would not be dependent upon income. The idea was that programs for the poor inevitably become poor programs. I think this has been the case over the years. 
   The second point I make deals with 1965 and the years that led up to it. The pharmaceutical revolution in ways began with the discovery of penicillin in London in the 1920s, and medications of the kind we know today have become a whole new phenomenon in medical care. There was a time when hospitals were about all you could do for ill people. Now so much more can be done, principally through pharmaceuticals. 
   Indeed, if you had to make some bizarre choice between providing hospital care and providing the full range of pharmaceuticals, one could very well choose the latter. 
   The Senator spoke of five lifesaving medications which are unavailable to people who instead go to hospitals where they can receive consolation, but no true treatment. 
   This is a very wise and necessary motion. This Senator, for sure, will support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is not a matter of one side of the aisle or the other on Senator GRAMM's amendment. Now for the first time, we find  ourselves in complete agreement with the chairman of the Finance Committee, that the amendment is a disaster. We don't have to characterize the existing proposal, but it is not everything we would hope for. That is something even the chairman would dread, and he is right to do so. I think we are 
   right in a situation such as this to overcome partisanship. It would be wicked, indeed, to join the Senator from Texas, and then where would we be? But we won't. I hope on our side we will support the chairman of the Finance Committee and show him that we share his view of the unacceptable extravagance of the proposal, the amendment of the Senator from Texas, which will soon be voted on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MOYNIHAN. First, I congratulate our revered chairman, Senator ROTH, for the manner in which he has presented the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, for the manner in which he brought our committee together in consultation and deliberation, and who, indeed, produced a measure which was bipartisan. It has many elements which would commend our support across the aisle--certainly mine. But it is not to that issue that I will speak today, but to the question of the doctrine. 
   I would like to put this debate in a doctrinal perspective, which is to say, the development in the 1960s which holds that the only way to restrain the growth of Government is to deliberately create a protracted fiscal crisis. 
   This begins, of course, with a view of Government that is so very different from what traditional conservatism would hold. It is a new and radical idea. I will discuss how it emerged. 
   But first I will cite an article from this morning's New York Times op-ed page by Gertrude Himmelfarb, one of our preeminent historians and an avowed conservative. She writes so much of what goes on. She says:  
   In their eagerness to do away with the nanny state, some conservatives risk belittling, even delegitimizing, the state itself. A delicate balancing act is required: to dismantle or diminish the welfare state while retaining a healthy respect for the state itself. For good government is the precondition of civil society, providing a safe space within which individuals, families, communities, churches and voluntary associations can effectively function.  
   But, as I say, the debate on this tax bill is not just a debate about tax policy; for it is far less a debate on taxes than a debate on economic and budget policy and the large understanding of the role of Government in our society, the role of Government in an advanced market economy. 
   At the outset of this debate, we should be mindful of some painful mistakes we have made in the not too distant past and which we evidently mean to repeat. 
   In August of 1993, just 6 years ago, we began to correct a colossal budget mistake. The President signed into law a deficit reduction act without precedent in size that dramatically changed the budget outlook--turning deficits of $290 billion a year, as far as the eye could see--to anticipate my friend David Stockman--into the surpluses we now project of $200 billion and more--surpluses on budget--leaving aside the Social Security revenue stream. 
   At the time of its passage, it was estimated that the 1993 legislation, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, would reduce the deficit by $505 billion over the 5 years, 1994 through 1998. 
   The Office of Management and Budget, in its fiscal year 2000 edition of ``Analytical Perspectives,'' estimated that the total deficit reduction has been more than twice this. I quote: ``The total deficit reduction has been more than twice this--$1.2 trillion.'' 
   That suggests the extraordinary quality of that moment when we stood on this floor and waited for the final vote that would allow the Vice President to cast the determining vote, 51-50. The act was passed without one Member of the Republican Party of either House of the Congress. 
   In 1997, we had a more bipartisan effort in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Again, we see larger revenue benefits than were originally anticipated. 
   As for the fiscal year that ends this September, the OMB projects a budget surplus of $99 billion and the Congressional Budget Office projects a surplus of $120 billion. With the end of the fiscal year just 2 months away, we can expect, with great confidence, a budget surplus for the second consecutive year. 
   What explains this huge gap, this pleasant surprise between budget expectations and outcomes in recent years? 
   As is often the case in economic analysis, there are interrelated factors which cannot always easily be disentangled but which provide clues. 
   To begin with, we appear to be in what has been described by our now-Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Summers, at his confirmation hearing as a ``virtuous cycle.'' I put a question to him, and he responded:  
   Senator, I think it very important that, as you suggest, we do reduce the national debt by the full amount of the Social Security surpluses, which would continue this virtuous cycle by reducing interest rates, which makes possible more growth, which makes more tax collections, which makes larger surpluses, which makes lower debt, which reduces interest rates, which starts the cycle going again. That is an enormously important process.  
   The Honorable Robert Rubin, who was Mr. Summers' distinguished predecessor, often spoke of a term which is not in ordinary usage, but it is a term  known by Secretaries of State and by persons who deal in securities, in markets. Mr. Rubin would use the term the ``risk premium on interest rates.'' That is to say, the extra charge if a person is lending money, if they are not certain of the fiscal stability of the Federal Government, in this case, and, thence, of the economy at large. 
   It was, first of all, this risk premium that we broke in 1993, the fear that down the line, if these deficits of $290 billion in the previous year went on and on--the debt had quadrupled over the previous twelve years--that the day would come, again, to use an economist's term, when we would ``monetize'' the debt through inflation. We would get rid of it by wiping out the value of the dollar. That is that premium, that risk premium on interest rates. 
   We began to see this effect. I was here on the Senate floor on February 10, 1995. I remarked:  
   ..... the economy performed better than expected, in part, because Congress adopted a credible deficit reduction plan. In part, also, because, as Secretary of the Treasury Rubin remarked to the Finance Committee this Wednesday [that is, Wednesday, February 8, 1995], the deficit reduction program squeezed the risk premium on interest rates out of real long-term interest rates. If financial markets do not believe the deficit is under control, they will levy a risk premium on capital lending. In 1993 and 1994, we clearly persuaded the markets that we were finally serious.  
   From a slightly different perspective, the Congressional Budget Office also took note of the importance of reducing interest costs. For most of the post-World War II period, interest costs have been the second or third largest item in the budget, behind Social Security and national defense. 
   In commenting on this, the CBO said, of the effects of that 1993 legislation:  
   Remarkably, the biggest single change lies in ..... interest--now projected at 3.3 percent of GDP in 2003 compared with 4.5 in the earlier report, a testimonial to the efforts to rein-in the debt's growth [which had taken place].  
   For the record, CBO, in its latest budget update issued earlier this month, now projects interest costs at just 1.7 percent of GDP in the year 2003, a reduction by half from its September 1993 projection when we had just passed that legislation of that year. 
   Outlays for net interest peaked at $251 billion 2 fiscal years ago. They are now projected to decrease to $222 billion, and if we can just keep from squandering the surplus, we will repay the debt incurred in those years and that interest cost will again go down, almost to disappear. 
   Now, I do not mean to suggest that the budget outlook is solely due to changes in budget policies. Factors other than deficit reduction are at work, making for a strong, sustained economic expansion. The economy brings higher receipts and lower outlays for unemployment and other such programs that automatically 
    expand in a recession. 
   Last week, in testimony before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Alan Greenspan, our world-renowned Chairman of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, provided some insights into what is sustaining this period of remarkable growth. Observing the absence of production bottlenecks, shortages, and price pressures that inevitably occur in an expanding economy, he noted a number of the possible explanations for the good fortunes involved; notably, just-in-time inventories and such like; but they have come about fortuitously at a time when the deficit was under control, deficits were declining, and the prospects were much better all around. 
   The question is, Can we not keep this? Can we not sustain the extraordinary economic expansion on which we have embarked? 
   Unemployment is now at 4.3 percent. May I say, as someone who in the Kennedy administration was Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy Planning, we would have said, sir, that a 4.3-percent unemployment rate was unsustainable. It would lead to an outbreak of inflation. Yet here we have it, 4.3 percent, real economic growth at 4 percent. We are in the ninth year of an expansion, and we have no inflation. This is something that is going to require that the economic textbooks be rewritten. But we have done it, and a lot of it comes about from what we did on the Senate floor in August of 1993 and which our great hope on this side of the aisle is that we not undo in this short time that has passed. 
   Alan Greenspan, in that testimony, was very clear. He said tax cuts are to be reserved for recessions. That will be the most effective means we can have to regenerate the economy and keep the long-term growth path moving high. 
   The New York Times editorialized this past Sunday, on the Oracle of the Fed:  
   Mr. Greenspan is treated reverently on Capitol Hill, but it appears that the Republicans do not want to heed his advice to run a surplus and pay down the national debt, while saving a tax cut for when it is needed.  
   How come this sudden resurgence just now, when it would seem so clear that a quite opposite policy has had such very desirable effects? Well, sir, I go back, as I said I would earlier, to matters of political doctrine. 
   We don't talk much of doctrine on the Senate floor, but there are times for it. In 1995, for example, we debated a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. I presented a series of papers in which I tried to describe the idea of ``starving the beast,'' as the term was; that is to say, depriving the Federal Government of the revenues needed, putting it simply, to govern. 
   The argument is quite simple. It goes back to the 1970s when a number of theorists on the conservative wing of the Republican Party determined that it was not going to be possible for the Federal Government ever to be controlled in its size as long as it had the revenues to sustain, or even to increase, that size. And so it came about that a policy doctrine developed which argued that deficits, if sizable enough, had acquired a new utility--deficits that had presumably been the horror of conservative financial thought now became something attractive because they could be used to reduce the size of Government itself. 
   E.J. Dionne, Jr., in an op-ed article in yesterday's Washington Post, clearly recognizes this idea is still afoot. He writes:  
   The long-term goal, about which Republican leaders are candid, is to put Government in a fiscal straitjacket for years to come.  
   In fairness, I think this is more to be encountered on the House side than in this body, but it still would be the cumulative effect, in fact, of the tax cuts that have been proposed in both bodies. 
   I can remember the onset of this. In the late 1970s, it was clear. One could write about it, and one did. Then came the administration of President Reagan in which, in effect, the policies were carried out--or they began to be carried out. In a television address, 16 days before his inauguration, President Reagan said:  
   There will always be those who tell us that taxes could not be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice or breath, or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance.  
   There you have President Reagan in his most agreeable and heart-warming quality. He thought this could be done because he thought there would, in fact, be reductions in Government. There were none. Moreover, very shortly, his economic advisers realized the economic analysis they had used to project revenue increases from tax reductions weren't going to work, and they faced a prospect of deficits of, as David Stockman once said, ``$200 billion as far as the eye can see.'' 
   Haynes Johnson, in his superb book, ``Sleepwalking Through History: America Through the Reagan Years,'' writes:  
   The Reagan team [not the President] saw the implicit failure of supply side theory as an opportunity, not a problem.  
   Now, this we have to absorb. They saw the failure of supply side theory--which said that the more you cut taxes, the higher the revenues will be--as an opportunity, not a problem. The secret solution was to let the Federal budget deficits rise, thus leaving Congress no alternative but to cut domestic programs. But in the end, they were not cut. Some grew. There was a view, and certainly a respectable one, that defense had to be increased. We now, incidentally, suggest there be a 20-percent reduction in defense spending over the next 10 years. 
   The Reagan administration increased defense spending, and they had a perfectly good argument for doing that--  but not simultaneously with huge tax cuts. There, very shortly thereafter, had to be tax increases. But the course was set for the 1980s and the deficit doubled, from under a trillion dollars to about $3.7 trillion now in publicly held debt. So I rise again to say, as I have done before, that what we did in 1981 with that tax cut--for 
   which I voted because the Office of Management and Budget, seeing our huge inflation continuing, projected surpluses in the future--was so ruinously wrong. We now have a debt that will level off at about $6 trillion, while the debt held by the public will fall by $2 trillion, or more, depending on the size of this tax cut. 
   The other important reason, which I will close on, is that the 1997 balanced budget amendment left us with what the Washington Post this morning calls an ``accounting illusion,'' that we can reduce the spending on domestic programs by 20 percent in real terms over the next 10 years. The illusion is coming apart already. Just the other day, the House of Representatives determined that the money to pay for the decennial census in the year 2000 required an emergency appropriation outside of those limits. We have had that census for many years. That census is provided in the Constitution. It has taken place every decade since 1790. All of a sudden, we have made it into an emergency. 
   In this morning's Washington Post, our former majority leader, our beloved colleague, ROBERT C. BYRD, has an article called ``Time for Truth In Spending.'' He said:  
   What we need to jettison is the political rhetoric. What we need to impose is truth in spending.  
   And he set down a few principles. He said:  
   First, watch our investments carefully and manage them prudently. We should continue our best efforts to manage the economy and watch out for inflation. 
   Second, do not spend our money before we make it. Before the surplus is spent, whether on tax cuts or continuing important priority programs, wait for the money to be in the bank.  
   We are proposing to spend a surplus, sir, that does not exist.  
   Third, pay our debts. The United States should take advantage of this opportunity to retire the national debt. 
   Fourth, cover the necessities. Congress should not shortchange the Nation's core programs, such as education, health care, veterans, and the like. 
   Fifth, put aside what we need for a rainy day. Congress should take steps to reserve the Social Security and Medicare surpluses exclusively for future costs of those programs. 
   Sixth, don't go on a spending spree. Resist the temptation to create costly new government programs. 
   Finally, take prosperity in measured doses. Congress should reduce taxes without pulling the rug out from under projected surpluses.  
   I can think of no wiser counsel. 
   In that regard, and with great respect for the chairman of the committee, I would suggest that the budget reconciliation process was devised to expedite consideration of deficit reduction measures. 
   The bill before us uses those same expedited procedures to secure enactment of a deficit-increasing measure. 
   Section 313(b)(E) of the Byrd rule provides that any provision in any reconciliation bill which would decrease revenues used beyond the budget window--in this case beyond the year 2009--may be automatically stricken from the bill upon a point of order being raised. 
   Section 1502 of the bill before us provides for permanent continuation of tax cuts in the years beyond 2009, causing revenue losses of hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   Accordingly, sir, at the appropriate time, I intend to raise the Byrd rule point of order against section 1502 of the bill. 
   I thank the Chair for his cordial consideration of my remarks. 
   I see my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is on the floor. I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. As my good friend knows, at the end of my statement this morning I indicated I would raise this point of order against section 1502 of the bill, which takes the 10-year provisions of the bill before the Senate and extends them for an additional 10 years. That is clearly a violation of the Byrd rule which deals with increasing the deficit on a reconciliation bill. 
   I am surprised to find my friend refer to that provision as ``antiquated'' or ``arcane.'' We have spent 20 years trying to control this deficit. We quadrupled the national debt in 12 years, from 1980 to 1992. We have now reversed that. We have made the point on this floor that we are providing tax reductions from a projected surplus that has not occurred and may not occur. It certainly does not exist. 
   A few days ago, in a letter to the Democratic Members on our side, our dear friend, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, with respect to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, used the word ``floccinaucinihilipilification,'' and it was reported in the press this morning. He got that word from the Senator from New York. Floccinaucinihilipilification is now the second longest word in the Oxford Dictionary. It is from a debate in the House of Commons in the 18th century meaning the futility of budgets. They never come out straight. 
   I had the opportunity to review an autobiography of John Kenneth Galbraith years back in the New Yorker magazine. I added ``ism'' to refer to the institutional nature of this, so it became floccinaucinihilipilificationism. It is no joke. One never gets it right. It is not because one cannot, one does not try. 
   ``Exogenous'': Come in from the outside. Drought, hurricane, Asia goes to pieces. We don't know what will happen. We have this surplus that would match a $792 billion tax cut. However, does anybody believe we know enough about the decade beyond this one to continue these tax cuts, many of which take hold later in the first decade, such that the Treasury Department holds that in the second decade the revenue costs will be $1.9 trillion and the interest and consequence will be $1.1 trillion. So the total costs would be $3 trillion, which is almost four times the cost of the first decade. 
   Surely we cannot be so irresponsible. It speaks of hubris to suggest we know what is going to happen that far out. It speaks calamity, as well. 
   I see my friend from North Dakota. I yield to the Senator 5 minutes.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I could not more agree with my friend from Minnesota, who has taught political science superbly well. Earlier today, in opening remarks, I commented on a theory that developed on the conservative side of politics in the 1970s which held that the way to control the size of the Federal Government was to starve it of revenue--``starve the beast'' was the rather graphic term. 
   It was indeed. That was the effort in the early 1980s until they realized it was not working. Just yesterday, E.J. Dionne wrote:  
   The long-time goal about which Republican leaders are candid, is to put Government in a fiscal straitjacket for years to come.  
   This is an idea with which we are dealing, not a bunch of numbers, a grand strategy, and it will work if, in the second decade, we see a cost of this measure. The Treasury estimate is $3 trillion, an incalculable sum, which will paralyze, which will put the Government in a straitjacket. We have no right to do that to another generation of Americans. If they wish to do it, that is their right, but it is not surely our option.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is our view that the roughly $900 billion in projected surpluses for the coming decade can prudently be allocated in thirds: the first to be reserved for Medicare. We are going to have to get to Medicare. If we do not do it in this session, we may do it in the next or the next Congress, but that time is coming. It will require money. It will require general revenues, there is no mistaking that any longer. We think that keeping a third of a billion dollars for that purpose is prudent. In the meantime, it will retire some debt and there will be some interest savings and we will have that money generally understood to be available. 
   We think another third has to be used to restore what we have come to call discretionary spending. I wish I knew for sure from where that word came. I think Senator ROTH would not have produced so devious a term. Is the Marine Corps discretionary? Is the Coast Guard? Do we regard the Bureau of the Census as something we can do without? We did for a while, letting the States do it, but since 1860 we have had one. 
   This is our general Government, and it is not discretionary, save on the margins. Most of these functions have been with us a long time, and we need them. 
   The present arrangement is for drastic reductions in real dollars for these programs over the next decade. It cannot go on. We have just seen the painful scene of the House of Representatives providing an emergency appropriations for the year 2000 census, as if the census came up like a hurricane or a flood. We have had one every 10 years since 1790. It is not an emergency. It is just that it cannot be met under these caps. So we think a third should be preserved for that purpose. 
   Finally, a third for tax relief, targeted to generally accepted principles that are widely based. We would have $189 billion in broad-based tax relief. That would, most importantly, increase the standard deduction by 60 percent. This would remove more than 3 million taxpayers from the tax rolls and would provide an estimated 9 million more to simply take the standard deduction. It is good tax policy. We believe it certainly is simplification. 
   We would like to have $27 billion for health care initiatives, including a $1,000 long-term care credit and a 50-percent deduction for long-term health insurance to make health insurance affordable. 
   We look forward to $17 billion in education initiatives. That would include a large bond program for public school modernization and permanently extending employer-provided tuition assistance for higher education. 
   If the Senate would indulge me, this latter provision is so important. I have now 23 years in the Finance Committee, and it seems every other year we recommend extending it instead of making it permanent. 
   But if ever there was a palpable, demonstrably useful program, it is when employers send employees to receive education at various levels, commonly graduate levels, because they want to acquire new skills for which they will be put to work at higher wages, and for which they will pay more taxes, and that virtuous cycle I was talking about this morning will continue. It is unreal we continue to keep it on a short lifespan. But this gives it a much longer period. 
   Finally, $31 billion in technological and economic development incentives, including an extension of the research credit. These seem, to us, to be widely based. They are equitable, and I hope they will amend themselves to the Senate. 
   I see my friend from North Dakota is on the floor, is ready, and I yield him 15 minutes.

Mr. President, on January 3, 1999, Jerry Quarry, a perennial heavyweight boxing champion contender in the 1960's and 1970's, died of pneumonia brought on by an advanced state of dementia pugilistica. He was 53. The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 was an excellent step toward making professional boxing safer for its participants. Nevertheless, it contains several gaps. 
   The amendment I proposed here today is aimed at protecting professional fighters by requiring more rigorous prefight physical examinations and by requiring a brain catscan before a boxer can renew his or her professional license.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is a special pleasure to rise on this important subject on this fateful day 
   in the aftermath of the Senator from Nevada, whose vigilance, if I may say, as minority whip, led him to see a clear violation of rule XVI, the rule against legislation on appropriations bills, and so he made the point of order. In a casual way, having to do with the seeming inconsequence of the measure that had been proposed, the Senate overruled that point of order, and a century and more of fixed senatorial practice crashed and burned and has been burning all around us ever since. 
   There is a larger context, I suggest, in which to consider this matter. I am now in my last term in the Senate. I have been here almost a quarter of a century. I am frequently asked what has changed in the Senate in my time here. Without hesitation, the one thing I say is the procedures by which we work. 
   When I arrived, there was a recognizable symmetry and balance to the distribution of responsibilities, duties, and powers in the body. We had evolved over the 19th century a two-layer pattern of committees--committees being very special and distinct to our Government. 
   We are one of the few governments in the world that has them. The House of Commons has none. Recently they have been appointing committees of inquiry but no legislative committees of any kind. All authority rests with the Prime Minister. On those used-to-be celebrated occasions when the Chancellor of Exchequer at No. 11 Downing Street would come out, and he would hold up a briefcase called the budget, that, sir, was, in fact, the budget. There was not going to be a chance of change in the government's proposal. It has been that way for more than two centuries. 
   It is not the government that the founders put in place. They put in place a government of checks and balances of the assumption of opposed interests, of the resolution by debate, and by the recognition that there were, in fact, opposed interests. We were not all happily subject to the Queen, under her rule--or his if it were a King--and a harmony in the realm. Our founders thought no such thing. They did not depend on virtue. They depended on self-interest and being equally opposed in a mode of negotiation to resolve matters. 
   We had a series of authorizing committees, and they had jurisdiction over principal areas of government service. There were four--well, the principal committees were Foreign Relations, Finance, Armed Services, and then Interior, Commerce, Labor and Public Welfare, as it then was, Environment and Public Works, having previously been just Public Works. 
   Their jurisdictions changed. New issues came along. Public Works became Environment. Public Works, under the tutelage of Senator Muskie of Maine, brought the issue of the environment to our body. They would make laws which more often than not required expenditure. That expenditure would be provided by the Appropriations Committee in terms of the laws that had been passed by the authorizing committees. There was a parallel. 
   The Finance Committee, in the earliest years, from 1816 I believe, was principally concerned with raising the revenue of the Federal Government. In the early years, up until the beginning of this century, those were tariffs. That is why the tariff legislation, the ``tariff of abominations,'' things similar to that are so prominent in American 19th century history. 
   We moved to the income tax as our principal source of revenue. Tariffs are still not insignificant. In the Finance Committee, of which I am a member--for a period I was the chairman; now ranking member--we looked after the revenues of the Federal Government. Then Social Security came along; it was a tax. Whether it ought to have been a tax, sir, is an issue you could debate.  
   But 54, 55 years ago, at a garden party here in Washington, Frances Perkins, the Secretary of Labor who was responsible for developing a Social Security plan--a Justice of the Supreme Court kindly asked her about her work, and she said she had this great plan, but she was very concerned because the great Justices always 
   said it was unconstitutional, whatever the New Deal was then going through that period. The Justice asked her to tell him more. She did, and he leaned down and whispered: The taxing power, my dear; all you need is the taxing power. 
   So in that famous photograph of President Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act, the person to his right is the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, a gentleman from North Carolina named Robert Doughton--little noted in history but enormous in his impact. 
   So the Finance Committee has taken over these other areas as well. Still our basic task is to raise revenue that the Appropriations Committee will spend in accordance with the laws passed by the authorizing committees. A workable system--rational, understandable, comprehensible and functioning. 
   Then in 1974 came the Budget Act and the creation of the Congressional Budget Office, the creation of the budget resolution. In part, this was a reaction to events in the Nixon administration--political and contemporary. But just as important, if I may be allowed a certain excursion into political science, if that is the term, it is a pattern that one observes in governments the world over, and you can see in ours. It was with the proposition, sir, that organizations in conflict become like one another.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. We are heading for this situation. There is even talk that the tax bills, which we will bring to the floor tomorrow or Wednesday, need not be resolved in this period of time. They can lay over until September. Well, that means they will lay over until the last day of the Congress, the last moment of the session. In the meantime, we can expect over half the appropriation bills to have passed. 
   I wonder if I might address a question to my friend from Nevada, if I might interrupt. How many appropriation bills have passed this year? Would he happen to know? No reason to know.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. We begin to come to our senses; that has brought us to this point. We passed seven. I don't think we will pass 13. I think our tax legislation has every prospect of being an abomination. The Senate cannot pass legislation which it has never read and does not understand. That is what has been the consequence of this new situation. 
   In addition to which, the distinguished minority leader is proposing an amendment to the fine initiative of the majority leader that says: No more writing legislation in conference committees. That is against all of our rules, too, but has crept into our practices. Again, the authorizing committees are gradually being marginalized and have no role. Power is centralized.

   I will close, sir, by simply saying this is a subject that is said to be arcane, to be incomprehensible, to be something on the margin. The Constitution of the United States is a bit arcane. It was not something immediately obvious to everyone, what its principles were. But they were powerful, and they have persisted. So, indeed, have the rules of the Senate, developed in the early 19th century, and then later, starting in 1868, with regard to germaneness and the like. Language very similar to our Rule XVI dates to 1884. We have here the question of whether we are going to be able to govern ourselves in the future. If we should fail in that regard, what else, sir, will there be said of us when the history of the decline of the American Congress is written? 
   I thank the Chair for its courtesy in allowing me to extend my time. I thank my friend, the minority whip, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I was chairman of the Finance Committee in 1993 when that deficit reduction act passed. It was a risk. We risked that what we understood of markets and of the economy was right. We could have been wrong. But it was not a casual affair. Day after day and evening after evening in the Finance Committee we debated it. We voted on it. It came to the floor, admittedly under a time limit from the Budget Act, but it was adequate to the purpose. 
   We legislated, and it was done in the open. The consequences are here to see. The $500 billion deficit reduction package contained in the 1993 reconciliation bill has been re-estimated by the Office of Management and Budget as having saved a total of $1.2 trillion. We had a $290 billion deficit that year. The 10-year projection was $3 trillion, and more, of cumulative deficits. Now we are dealing with a $3 trillion surplus. But that is because the process worked--and in the open. The oldest principle of our Government is openness and responsibility. We have been abandoning both, and the consequences show.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to introduce the Thomas Jefferson Researcher's Privilege Act. This bill protects the rights of researchers in their work. This is an issue that Professor Robert O'Neil of the University of Virginia Law School has done much to advance, and I am extremely grateful for all his assistance. 
   Two points, followed by a coda, if I may. The first point is that the Thomas Jefferson Act gets to the heart of the first amendment and the principles that our nation was founded on. This Act would protect researchers from the compelled disclosure of their research, studies, data, surveys, etc. Too often researchers are forced to turn over this information in open courts. This interrupts their research and makes it nearly impossible for them to finish and publish their research. If researchers are unable to publish their findings, then the flow and dissemination of information are choked off. This runs counter to the essence of the first amendment. 
   We need a uniform standard that protects the work of researchers. Some courts have ruled in favor of researchers while others have ruled against them. We need consistency in this field, where researchers feel comfortable to produce their research and do not have to fear that it will be taken from them. This bill will provide that consistency and comfort. 
   To the second point. We have reached a time in our society where we have to decide between what should be shared and what should be protected. In this case, it is very important to society as a whole to protect a researcher's notes and data before they are ready to be released. It is from these data and research that ideas and thoughts are formed, ideas that will eventually help man and society progress. If a researcher's data are released prematurely, then their ideas may never bear fruit. In the long run, protecting a researcher's data will only lead to more information and ideas in the future. This is what the first amendment is all about. 
   No one describes the utility of free speech and the dissemination of original ideas better than John Stuart Mill. In On Liberty, he argues that neither government nor a public acting informally may legitimately use coercion to stifle free expression, and the reason he gives is a utilitarian, or at least a consequentialist one. If the opinion is right, the human race is deprived of it; if wrong, they are deprived of the opportunity to reinforce--through surviving a challenge--their understanding of what is right. The quashing of opinion is therefore, a much more far-reaching evil than the mere loss of something valuable to the individual, for it deprived society at large of something of benefit. This is exactly what happens when researchers are forced to turn over their work prematurely and prevented from developing and sharing their thoughts. The Thomas Jefferson Bill would help rectify just this situation. 
   I conclude by saying that I could think of no better namesake for this bill than Thomas Jefferson, our third president and author of the Declaration of Independence. A philosophical statesman rather than a political philosopher, he contributed to democracy and liberalism a faith rather than a body of doctrine. By his works alone he must be adjudged one the greatest of all Americans, while the influence of this energizing faith cannot be measured. 
   One of Jefferson's greatest contributions to our nation was his protection and advocacy of free speech. From the Declaration of Independence to the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom to the founding of the University of Virginia, he was a passionate proponent of education, human liberty, and free thought. He wrote: ``If nature has made any one thing exclusive property, it is the idea, which an individual may exclusively possess .....; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone .....'' Jefferson, always a step or several steps ahead of his age, understood the importance of the freedom of speech in the development of an individual and a nation. 
   It is only appropriate that the Thomas Jefferson Researcher's Privilege Act be introduced in the month of July, when our nation declared its independence, and be named after Thomas Jefferson, one of our greatest political thinkers and one of our greatest advocates of the free mind.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it happens I was in the White House, in what was then Ralph Dungan's southwest office just down the hall from the Oval Office--where they were cleaning the carpet, the President's furniture having been moved to the outside corridor with his rocking chair atop the clutter--when word came from Dallas that the President was dead. A few moments later Hubert H. Humphrey burst in, embraced Dungan and let out: ``My God, what have they done to us.'' By ``they'' of course he meant the political right wing in Texas. Later we learned that the Dallas police had arrested a man associated with Fair Play for Cuba. What indeed had been done to us, what were we doing to ourselves? 
   That evening a group of us who lived on Macomb Street, out Connecticut Avenue, drifted over to Mary McGrory's. We sat about, saying little. At length Mary, with the feeling only she can put into words, announced: ``We'll never laugh again.'' ``Heavens, Mary,'' I replied, ``we'll laugh again. It's just that we will never be young again.'' 
   In this morning's Washington Post, her column ``A Death in the Family'' describes in poignant detail the history from then to now, now being of course the death of John F. KENNEDY, Jr., so much on our minds in those slow-paced days of mourning so many years ago, now himself gone, along with his wife Carolyn and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I believe the distinguished chairman is prepared to accept en bloc, as is the ranking member, as I understand. 
   They are, first of all, a sense of the Senate, which says:  
   It is the sense of Congress that the systematic declassification of records of permanent historic value is in the public interest and that the management of classification and declassification by the Executive Branch agencies requires comprehensive reform and additional resources.  
   The second measure, in regard to that last phrase, the Information Security Oversight Office, which is charged with administering this Nation's intelligence classification and declassification, would receive an additional $1.5 million to hire more staff so it can more efficiently manage the program. They are in the National Archives. The Archives asked for $5 million. They did not get it. This is a small agency. It does indispensable work. It gives you a continuous series of the amount of classification we do and the degree of classification and the agencies that do it.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Small Business Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999, a bill to set aside a portion of the Small business Administration's (SBA) resources for use by small businesses for brownfields prevention and redevelopment. 
   I am pleased to co-sponsor this measure with Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont. Together, we co-chair the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition. We recognize that our area of the country has its share of brownfields and the need for this important legislation. 
   Many smaller banks, including those represented by the SBA, are hesitant to lend to projects involving brownfields which they perceive to be risky. Our bill will encourage and provide the legitimacy to brownfields investment and lending that is long overdue. 
   This bill designates a portion of the funding of two of SBA's programs, Section 504, Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), for brownfields activities. This will ensure that small businesses receive the support they need to promote the redevelopment of valuable land. 
   Companies across the nation have recognized the financial and social advantages of Smart Growth and brownfields redevelopment. Communities call on us to preserve and promote open space. This bill unites the goals of businesses and residents in a common purpose: more efficient, economical and ecological use of our nation's lands.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the minority of the Finance Committee, I want to associate myself wholly with the remarks of our chairman. 
   This is not the time to engage in protracted debate on the Senate floor over our economic relations with China and Vietnam. The Finance Committee has not yet had an opportunity to consider the disapproval resolutions that the Senator from New Hampshire seeks to discharge. Nor has the House acted on the companion measures. It will do so later this month. If the motions to discharge the Finance Committee are approved, the Senate will be committing itself, as the Trade Act of 1974 provides, to 20 hours of debate on Vietnam and 20 hours of debate on China. The Senate's time is better spent on other matters. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire has moved to discharge the Finance Committee from further consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 27 and Senate Joint Resolution 28. Let us be clear what is at issue here. S.J. Res. 27 and S.J. Res. 28 disapprove of the President's decision of June 3, 1999 to extend for another year his waiver of the so-called ``Jackson-Vanik'' amendment as  it applies to China and Vietnam, respectively. 
   A bit of history is in order. The Jackson-Vanik amendment was the vision of Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, who, in 1972, first proposed:  
   . . . an unprecedented measure to bring the blessings of liberty to these brave men and women who have asked only for the chance to find freedom in a new land.  
   ``Scoop'' Jackson's amendment was precipitated by the decision of the Soviet Union, in August 1972, to assess exorbitant fees on persons wishing to emigrate. Cloaked as ``education reimbursement fees'' or ``diploma taxes,'' the Soviet authorities argued that emigrants owed an obligation to reimburse the Government for their free education, since, by reason of their departure, the emigrants would no longer put their education to use for the benefit of Soviet society. 
   The exit taxes applied to all emigrants, but affected primarily Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate to Israel or the United States. Thus was born the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Representative Charles Vanik of Ohio was the chief sponsor in the House. The amendment--Section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974--provides that no country shall be eligible to receive Normal Trade Relations tariff treatment or to participate in any United States Government programs that extend credit or credit guarantees or investment guarantees if that country:

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to continue the remarks so forcefully made by our beloved chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Senator from Virginia, and the Senator from Nebraska, as regards the nomination before us on the calendar for the position of permanent representative to the United Nations. 
   I would like to make the point--and I have served in that role--that this is a Cabinet position. It has been from the time of President Eisenhower when Henry Cabot Lodge was in the Cabinet. It is one of the oldest traditions of this body that a President is entitled to and must have his own counselors. Be they right-minded or wrong-minded, they are the President's judgment and they are his responsibility. 
   This office is a Cabinet office of the highest importance, as the Senator from Virginia has said, in mediating urgent international issues. But there is an awesome principle. Once, almost a half century ago, the Senate did reject a Cabinet nomination of President Eisenhower. It was not a proud moment for the Senate. We have not done it since, for the good reason that we ought not to do it ever. 
   I plead with the Senate to respect this prerogative of the other branch. I hope I will not seem mischievous if I repeat the remarks of my friend from Nebraska who said the day may come when there is a President of the other party. And indeed that could come very shortly. I do not predict it, but that is the way we work here. That President would want to choose his 
   Cabinet members and would be entitled to do so, for all the errors they may make or not. That is the constitutional form of government in which we live. Let us, sir, support that regime of two centuries, unparalleled in the history of democratic government, based upon this principle of the separation of powers and the President's right to choose. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to thank Rae Liu, a brilliant young intern from Columbia University where she is a National Merit Scholar and a debater. Rae came to my office this May. When an opening appeared on my personal staff in June, Rae was our unanimous choice to fill it until we could hire someone permanently. At 18, she took on the task of being a full-fledged member of my staff. 
   From the outset, Rae displayed judgment, maturity, initiative, and a work ethic way beyond her years. She worked tirelessly overhauling and drafting legislation, attending policy reviews, and meeting with constituents. She quickly made herself indispensable to my foreign policy, intelligence, and defense legislative assistant, and distinguished herself with her quick mind, sharp wit and devastating competence. It is rare to see so much ability and professionalism in one so young.  
   Rae is exactly the sort of young person we need to attract to public service. This is not going to be easy as we compete with the best law and business schools for talented young Americans who can earn much more than taking the Queen's shilling. We must try, however, for if we do not, we risk losing a new generation of bright ideas and insights. This would be not only tragic but shortsighted. 
   I wish this young lady from Texas godspeed in her studies and thank her again for her contributions.

I am very much indebted to Senator HATCH, the chairman of the committee. I thank the acting majority leader, the Senator from Wyoming. 
   On a brief personal note, this is a very special moment for the Senator from New York. Judge Katzmann was a graduate student of mine. I was a member of the orals examining committee when he received his Ph.D. He has been a remarkable student, a professor of law at Georgetown University at this point, and an author of important articles and books on the relationship between the Congress and the judiciary, a subject little attended and important. It attracted the attention of Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY. 
   I thank the Senator for his indulgence. I thank the Senate for its great good judgment in this important confirmation which I do believe history will one day record.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will protect the natural beauty and resources of the Long Island Sound from current dredging policies that allow large amounts of material to be dumped into the estuary without stringent environmental review. The Long Island Sound Protection Act of 1999 would require all large dredging projects in the Sound to comply with sediment testing provisions of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act, commonly known as the Ocean Dumping Act. 
   Under the Ocean Dumping Act, any Long Island Sound dredging project that disposes of more than 25,000 tons of dredged material must undergo toxicity and bioaccumulation tests before it is safe to dump. However, smaller nonfederal projects need only comply with the Clean Water Act, which does not require testing. In recent years, the Army Corps of Engineers has begun an unfortunate practice of avoiding the more rigorous requirements of the Ocean Dumping Act by individually permitting smaller projects that are clearly a part of larger dredging operations. Individually permitted, these projects need only comply with the Clean Water Act, even though they are dumped together in the Long Island Sound and have the same cumulative effect as one large project would to the local ecosystem. The Long Island Sound Protection Act would end this practice of stacking permits and would ensure that at least one environmentally acceptable disposal site is designated by the Environmental Protection Agency within a two-year period. 
   Dredging projects are critical to the people and businesses who rely extensively on the Sound to transport goods, services, and people every day. However, the health of the Long Island Sound ecosystem is also important to the 8 million people living within the boundaries of the Long Island Sound watershed, with more than $5 billion generated annually from boating, commercial and sport fishing, swimming, and beachgoing. The Long Island Sound is also an estuary of national significance that my State, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency, has worked diligently to restore under the 1992 Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan. This bill would remove one of the barriers to achieving the laudable goals of this Plan. 
   A clean and safe Sound is important to us all. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to Meredith Gardner, long unsung contributor to the identification of spies. Described by the FBI's Robert Joseph Lamphere as ``the greatest counter-intelligence tool this country has ever known,'' Gardner was the National Security Agency's leading enabler of the reading of thousands of enciphered cables intercepted from Soviet foreign intelligence in the 1940's. The NSA, under its various names, spent four decades deciphering what Moscow intended to be an unbreakable Soviet cipher. Gardner and his team painstakingly worked on these messages in a project which came to be known eventually as ``VENONA.'' The resulting VENONA decrypts, which were finally revealed publicly in 1995, detail the Soviet's espionage efforts in the United States during and after World War II. 
   Gardner has a genius for learning languages, and is fluent in German, Spanish, French and Russian and has had courses in Old High and Middle High German, Old Norse, Gothic, Lithuanian, and Sanskrit. He taught languages at the Universities of Texas and Wisconsin before being recruited by the U.S. Army's Signals Intelligence Service (the precursor to the National Security Agency) shortly after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The Army wanted people fluent in many languages to work on breaking German and Japanese codes. Until 1955 Gardner worked at Arlington Hall, a former girl's school located 10 miles outside Washington, which served as the Army's headquarters for code-breaking operations. Gardner soon added Japanese to his repertoire of languages. By chance, he became the first American to read in an intercepted message the Japanese word for atom bomb, ``genshi-bakudan.'' 
   When the war with Japan ended, the NSA phased out its Japanese section. Gardner learned that there was a section working on Soviet Union messages (its existence was kept secret) and he transferred into it. Gardner insists that the most arduous efforts to make the messages readable had already been done before he came along. First, the messages had to be sorted into at least four varieties, each used by representatives of separate Soviet government departments. It had also been discovered that some messages could be paired as having been ``randomized'' by the same pad and page carrying random additive digits (and hence were solvable). 
   Such mixed pairs were worked on by a small group of women led by Katurah ``Katie'' McDonald. This group had already produced a remarkable amount of code text, and the code-groups that had appeared so far had even been indexed in context by a card machine. The material was just awaiting the appointment of a linguist, and Gardner ``appointed himself'' to be it. It was the easy stage, but without it all the preparatory work would have been for nothing. 
   Gardner's reconstruction of the foreign intelligence (VENONA) code book was slow at first, but gained momentum. Because some recruits were named in the messages and given cover names, it became obvious that the FBI ought to receive translations of the cables. Special agent Robert Joseph Lamphere was assigned to be the (very efficient) link between the NSA and FBI. The next is history. 
   Gardner spent 27 years working on the ``Russian problem'' before retiring in 1972. He and his wife of 56 years, Blanche, who also worked for the Army Security Agency, now spend part of their time teaching Latin to a small group of students. I commend Mr. Gardner for the invaluable assistance he has given to our country, which we are only now beginning to realize and understand. I salute Mr. Gardner for his dedicated and important service.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Friday (July 9, 1999), the Washington Post carried an excellent op-ed piece, ``Deinstitutionalization Hasn't Worked,'' by E. Fuller Torrey and Mary T. Zdanowicz. The authors are the president and executive director, respectively, of the Treatment Advocacy Center. They write about the continued stigma attached to mental illness. They write about barriers to treatment. Most important, they write about the aftermaths of deinstitutionalization, and the seemingly horrific effects this policy has had. 
   In this morning's New York Times (July 12, 1999), Fox Butterfield writes about a Department of Justice report released yesterday which states that some 283,800 inmates in the nation's jails and prisons suffer from mental illness. (This is a conservative estimate.) As Butterfield puts it, ``. . . jails and prisons have become the nation's new mental hospitals.'' 
   Over the past 45 years, we have emptied state mental hospitals, but we have not provided commensurate outpatient treatment. Increasingly, individuals with mental illnesses are left to fend for themselves on the streets, where they victimize others or, more frequently, are victimized themselves. Eventually, many wind up in prison, where the likelihood of treatment is nearly as remote. 
   This is a cautionary tale, instructive of what is possible and also what we ought to be aware of. I was in the Harriman administration in New York in the 1950s. Early in 1955, Harriman met with his new Commissioner of Mental Hygiene, Paul Hoch, who described the development of a tranquilizer derived from rauwolfia by Dr. Nathan S. Kline at what was then known as Rockland State Hospital (it is now the Rockland Psychiatric Center) in Orangeburg. The medication had been clinically tested and appeared to be an effective treatment of many patients. Dr. Hoch recommended that it be used system wide; Harriman found the money. 
   That same year Congress created a Joint Commission on Mental Health and Illness with a view to formulating ``comprehensive and realistic recommendations'' in this area which was then a matter of considerable public concern. Year after year the population of mental institutions grew; year after year new facilities had to be built. Ballot measures to approve the issuance of general obligation bonds for building the facilities appeared just about every election. Or so it seemed. 
   The discovery of tranquilizers was adventitious. Physicians were seeking cures for disorders they were just beginning to understand. Even a limited success made it possible to believe that the incidence of this particular range of disorders, which had seemingly required persons to be confined against their will or even awareness, could be greatly reduced. The Congressional Commission submitted its report in 1961; it was seen to propose a nationwide program of deinstitutionalization. 
   Late in 1961 President Kennedy appointed an interagency committee to prepare legislative recommendations based on the report. I represented Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg on this committee and drafted its final submission. This included the recommendation of the National Institute of Mental Health that 2,000 ``community mental health centers'' (one for every 100,000 people) be built by 1980. A buoyant Presidential Message to Congress followed early in 1963. ``If we apply our medical knowledge and social insights fully,'' President Kennedy stated, ``all but a small portion of the mentally ill can eventually achieve a wholesome and a constructive social adjustment.'' A ``concerted national attack on mental disorders [was] now possible and practical.'' The President signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act on October 31, 1963--his last public bill signing ceremony. He gave me a pen. 
   The mental hospitals emptied out. The number of patients in state and county mental hospitals peaked in 1955 at 558,922 and has declined every year since then, to 61,722 in 1996. But we never came near to building the 2,000 community mental health centers. Only some 482 received Federal construction funds from 1963 to 1980. The next year, 1981, the program was folded into the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health block grant program, where it disappeared from view. 
   Even when centers were built, the results were hardly as hoped for. David Musto has noted that the planners had bet on improving national mental health ``by improving the quality of general community life through expert knowledge [my emphasis], not merely by more effective treatment of the already ill.'' The problem was: there is no such knowledge. Nor is there. But the belief there was such knowledge took hold within sectors of the profession, which saw institutions as an unacceptable mode of social control. These activists subscribed to a redefining mode of their own, which they considered altruistic: mental patients were said to have been ``labeled,'' and were not to be drugged. So as the Federal government turned to other matters, the mental institutions continued to release patients, essentially to fend for themselves. There was no connection made: we're quite capable of that  in the public sphere. Professor Frederick F. Siegel of Cooper Union observed: ``in the great wave of moral deregulation that began in the mid-1960s, the poor and the insane were freed from the fetters of middle-class mores.'' Soon, the homeless appeared. Only to be defined as victims of an insufficient supply of affordable housing. No argument, no amount of evidence has yet affected that fixed ideological view.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to co-sponsor the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, introduced by my good friend and colleague Senator CHAFEE. We are joined by a group of our colleagues, including Senator ROCKEFELLER, BOND, REED. 
   This legislation will help a group of our children in dire circumstances--foster children who reach age 18 still in the custody of the state. They were victims of abuse and neglect and their families proved to be beyond repair. About 20,000 children a year ``age out'' of the foster care system. They reach 18 and we, in large part, abandon them to the world. Many make their way successfully. But far too many, alas, do not, and these children are more likely to become homeless or end up on public assistance. 
   More than a decade ago, we recognized that these children needed additional help in preparing for life on their own. I am proud to have helped create the Independent Living program, which provided Federal support for efforts that prepare teenager for the transition from foster care to independence. 
   Today we are working on a bipartisan basis to build on this program. The bill we are introducing will double funding for the Independent Living program and increase the use of the funds to assist former foster care children until they reach 21, including, for the first time, help with room and board. As any parent knows, many 19 and 20-year olds remain in need of family support from time to time. For children who have ``aged out'' of foster care by turning 18, the government is, in effect, their parent and we should do more to help them become independent and self-sufficient, just as other parents do. The legislation also contains important provisions encouraging states to continue Medicaid coverage for these children so that health care remains available to them. 
   Mr. President, this legislation has widespread support, including from the Administration and key members of both parties. I would like to particularly thank the First Lady for her leadership in working on behalf of these children. I thank Senator CHAFEE for offering it and look forward to working with him and many others to see that it becomes law.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this Saturday, a most blessed event will occur on Shelter Island: the wedding of two of my constituents, Lisa Maxwell and George Newall. Martin Luther remarked, ``There is no more lovely, friendly and charming relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.'' I must say that I agree, having just celebrated my 45th wedding anniversary a few weeks ago. Marriage--as the Book of Common Prayer tells us--is intended by God for ``mutual joy; for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity.'' A wonderful institution, to be treated reverently. 
   My hope for Lisa and George is that their love for each other--so obvious to anyone who knows them--is, and will always remain, a seal upon their hearts, 
 For stern as death is love, relentless as the nether world is devotion; its flames are a blazing fire. Deep waters cannot quench love, nor floods sweep it away. Were one to offer all he owns to purchase love, he would be roundly mocked.--Song of Solomon, 8:6-7  
   I wish them all the best as they begin their life together.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank and applaud Ron Kavulick, the Chief Reporter of Debates, for the tremendous work that he did for the U.S. Senate. Being in charge of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD is a very demanding and important responsibility. For it is the historical document of the Senate--the bills we introduce, the statements that we make, and all of our debates are printed in the RECORD. I am often amazed how the RECORD is compiled and printed in such a short amount of time. 
   Ron was to have ended his Senate career at the close of the 105th Congress, but remained in his position as the Senate conducted the impeachment trial of the President. His experience was greatly appreciated throughout this historical proceeding. 
   Ron's reporting background is both extensive and impressive. He became an Official Reporter of the RECORD of Senate Debates in 1979 and served in that capacity until he was elevated to the position of Chief Reporter in 1995. Before that, he was an official court reporter in the Air Force's Judge Advocate General Corp, and while employed with Alderson Reporting Company, Ron had the opportunity to work at the White House. He traveled extensively both with President Johnson and President Nixon. 
   My staff and I personally cannot thank Ron enough for his service. He was always available, day or night, for any help that my staff or I needed. I once wrote that the single most exciting thing you encounter in government is competence, because it's so rare. In that case, Ron Kavulick is a rarity in government, and we are blessed to have had him in the Senate.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the majority leader for his fine, perceptive remarks and for making this occasion possible. 
   It is a little over a year since the passing of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, one of American Jewry's most distinguished communal leaders. Rabbi Sherer was the president of Agudath Israel of America for over 30 years and served as a reasoned, wise voice whose counsel was widely respected in the Yeshivot of his beloved Brooklyn and the halls of government in lower Manhattan, Albany, Jerusalem, and here in Washington. 
   I first met Rabbi Sherer in the early days of the Kennedy administration when he came to Washington on behalf of Agudath Israel. I quickly learned to admire his sagacity and rely on his insightful counsel and abiding integrity. For over 35 years he was a treasured mentor and a trusted friend. 
   Rabbi Sherer's earliest work on behalf of the Jewish community was the grassroots, and largely illegal, organization and transport of food shipments to starving Jews in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe in 1941. His efforts also produced affidavits for European Jewish refugees that helped them immigrate to the United States. 
   After the end of World War II, he and Agudath Israel continued to assist European Jews--survivors interned in displaced person camps--with foodstuffs and religious items, and helped facilitate the immigration and resettlement of Jewish refugees on these shores. In ensuring decades, Rabbi Sherer spearheaded Agudath Israel's efforts on behalf of endangered Jews behind the Iron Curtain and in places like Syria and Iran. In 1991, years of clandestine activity on behalf of 
   Soviet Jews culminated in his establishment of an office in Moscow to coordinate Agudath Israel's activities in Russia. Under his leadership, Agudath Israel also played an important role in providing social welfare and educational assistance to Israel Jews, and in advocating for Israel's security needs. 
   Ignoring the pessimistic predictions about Orthodox Jewry made by sociologists and demographic experts in the 40s and 50s, Rabbi Sherer went on to help engineer a remarkable change in the scope, image and influence of the American Orthodox Jewish world. A staunch advocate of Jewish religious education as a early as the 1960s, he helped establish the principle in numerous federal laws--like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965--and State laws that, to the full extent constitutionally permissible, children in non-public schools were entitled to governmental benefits and services on an equitable basis with the public school counterparts. In 1972, his efforts on behalf of education led to his being named national chairman of a multi-faith coalition of leaders representing the 5 million non-public school children in the United States. 
   On the day of his funeral last year I took the Senate floor to declare that:  
   World Jewry has lost one of its wisest statesman. America Orthodoxy has lost a primary architect of its remarkable postwar resurgence. All New Yorkers have lost a man of rare spiritual gifts and exceptional creative vision.  
   Rabbi Sherer passed away only hours before the President of the Senate, Vice President AL GORE, addressed Agudath Israel's 76th anniversary dinner in New York. He spoke for the Senate and for all Americans when he eulogized the Rabbi as ``a remarkable force for the understanding and respect and growth of Orthodox Jewry over the past fifty years,'' whose ``contributions to spreading religious freedom and understanding have been truly indispensable in defending and expanding those same rights for all Americans in all faiths.'' 
   I know I speak for the entire Senate when I express my condolences to his widow Deborah, his loving children Rachel Langer and Elky Goldschmidt, who join us today in the visitor's gallery, and his son Rabbi Shimshon Sherer whose inspiring prayer opened this morning's Senate session. 
   ``There were giants in the Earth in those days,'' the book of Genesis teaches. Rabbi Noshe Sherer was a giant in our midst, whose counsel and wisdom will be missed by all of us who were privileged to enjoy his friendship.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the growing chorus of people congratulating the Buffalo Sabres for their outstanding performance in the Stanley Cup Finals. Led by team captain Michael Peca, and their indefatigable goalie, Dominik Hasek, the entire team accomplished what was thought by many to be the impossible. Their heartfelt play brought a level of excitement to the Stanley Cup finals not seen in years. I am proud to stand with the City of Buffalo and Western New York to honor our team. 
   Considered underdogs in all of their playoff series, the Sabres played with pure heart and soul to sweep the Ottawa Senators in the first round, defeated the Boston Bruins and then the Toronto Maple Leafs to win the Eastern Conference and the Prince of Wales Trophy for the first time in 24 years. The triple overtime loss in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals showed the hockey community what a team with determination and true grit is. The controversial goal that ended the dreams of the Sabres will not dampen the spirits of the most devoted fans in the world--Buffalo Sabres fans. 
   As the Stanley Cup Finals end, I extend my deep appreciation to the Knox Family for bringing the Sabres to Buffalo 29 years ago, John J. Rigas, owner and Chairman of the Board, Darcy Regier, General Manager, Lindy Ruff, Head Coach, and the entire Buffalo Sabres team, their coaching staff, their families and their fans for their great  efforts and support. I know next season will bring even more to celebrate.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with a measure of respect for all the parties to this question before us but with one absolute conviction, which is that what is proposed with this legislation, what has passed the House of Representatives, is illegal under international law. That, sir, is a law we created as the one party that emerged from World War II with its economy intact and the lesson of the protectionism that began on this floor, sir, in 1930 with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. It spread throughout the world. If you want a short list of the causes of the Second World War, that was one. The American leaders, during the 1930s, with Cordell Hull, began the trade agreements program; and then we had hoped to have an international trade organization as part of a triad with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Again, it failed in the Finance Committee. But in Geneva, a temporary ad hoc arrangement was put together, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; it was temporary for about 45 years. But we acquired great respect for the rules, and 51 years ago, sir, article 11 of the General Agreement stated:  
   No prohibitions or restrictions, other than duties or other charges, can be made through import quotas, export licenses, or other measures. None shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the importation of any product.  
   Now, sir, if we were to do this, there would be immediate retaliation. And it would be illegal. It is uncalled for. The law says you may not do what is being proposed, and other parties, as former Senator Baker would say, ``having no dog in this fight,'' would find themselves retaliated against, as would the agricultural industry. I plead, let's abide by the laws we helped to create. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

He suggested that we have just taken what will likely be the most important vote of this session of the Congress. It was the first such vote we have had, I know, in my 23 years on the Committee on Finance--a solid affirmation of a half century, and more, of American trade policy.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment to the State Department authorization bill would have the effect of diminishing the standing enjoyed by the four principal grantees--and partners--of the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   When the Endowment was established in 1983, the Congress envisioned that four core grantees would be established along with the NED to carry out its mission--the National Democratic Institute (NDI), the International Republican Institute (IRI), the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center. The reason for this decentralized approach was a belief--shared by leading Democrats and Republicans alike--that the promotion of democracy is an enduring American interest and that representatives of American civil society would be better able than government officials to help their counterparts--political parties, labor movements, business associations and civic groups--that are struggling to build democratic systems in their own countries. Private organizations doing private work in the public interest ought to be supported and expanded by federal funding. 
   The National Endowment for Democracy has been debated on this floor on numerous occasions, most recently at some length in 1997, after which the Senate voted 72 to 27 to reaffirm its support for the Endowment and its programs. Along with successive Administrations--including those of Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton alike--this body has consistently voiced its support for the mission and unique contribution to the spread of democracy by this organization. 
   The Feingold amendment would eliminate the concept of the ``core grantees'' of the Endowment which is the heart of the operational premise that the NED embodies. While the amendment purports to make the Endowment more efficient and effective by making all NED grants competitive, it would actually have the opposite effect. If passed, the amendment's unintended consequence would be to create a centralized, bureaucratic structure that would severely weaken the NED, and slow the responsiveness of the core grantees. It would also oblige the Republican and Democratic institutes to compete with one another for the same funding, so instead of working in tandem to promote American ideals abroad, they would be set at odds with each other. The same would happen with the institutes for business and labor: conflict, rather then comity. The harmonious package of programs would be dissolved--for no apparent reason. 
   The Endowment is a cost effective initiative that works. Anyone who has taken the time to examine the activities of the Endowment's core grantees or talked with the beneficiaries of their work in places like Northern Ireland, Nigeria, Indonesia, Cuba and Bosnia, would agree. 
   The NED should be encouraged to continue this mission, which reflects the noblest American political tradition and serves the strategic interests of the United States. It should not be hamstrung by the new and unwarranted restrictions that are proposed in this amendment. 
   It was the decision by the Congress that there should be four principal grantees of the Endowment because they each have a unique contribution to make in promoting democracy. This was a correct decision, and the core grantees should continue to be seen as different from other grantees and an integral part of the Endowment. If we should now change the Endowment's fundamental premise, the ability of these core grantees to respond quickly to democratic openings will be undermined. 
   It has been suggested that under the current arrangement the work of the core grantees is not subject to adequate scrutiny because the Endowment each year sets aside a modest allocation of funding for each of their programs. This allocation--of 4.1 million for each institute's global array of programs--does not mean that they get a free ride or a blank check. It is important to note that every single one of the over 200 grants awarded annually by the Endowment is strictly reviewed by program and financial staff and by a distinguished bipartisan Board of Directors currently chaired by the distinguished former congressman from Indiana, Dr. John Brademas. This is true regardless of whether the grantee is one of the four core grantees or not. The core grantees are covered by the same reporting and evaluation requirements that effect all grantees. Let us leave the decision-making for the allocation of funding in the very able hands of the Endowment's Board of Directors, which includes some of the most accomplished international affairs strategists and democrats in the United States. 
   This body frequently earmarks organizations that it believes should receive public support. There is nothing wrong nor nefarious in this approach. I hope the Senate will take this opportunity to reaffirm its strong support for the work of the four institutes associated with the Endowment--the republican and democratic party institutes, and those associated with the labor movement and the business community--by voting No on the Feingold amendment. 
   This amendment seeks to fix something that is not broken. The amendment will not improve the Endowment, but to weaken its unique capacity to be flexible, responsive and effective. The last thing we should do is to hastily tinker with the internal workings of this important institution without any serious examination of the supposed problems this amendment is meant to address.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment to the State Department authorization bill. For 75 years academic freedom was squelched in the Soviet Union and the tools to build a democratic society were lost to its successor states. Thankfully, that is now passed. The Russians have the right to claim that they freed their own country from the horrors of a decayed Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. The Russian people and their leaders have something about which to be proud. 
   I rise in that spirit to discuss an amendment that is simple in both premise and purpose: build democratic leaders of the NIS for the future through education. This modest amendment will partially fund doctoral graduate study in the social sciences for students from the NIS during the next two years. The benefits of education and exposure to the United States will be long lasting. 
   We want to give these students from the NIS a chance to see American democracy and learn the tools to improve their own society. Indeed, for many it will be their first chance to visit the world's oldest democracy; to see the promise that democracy offers; and to judge its fruits for themselves. As one of our most famous visitors, Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote:  
   Let us look to America, not in order to make a servile copy of the institutions that she has established, but to gain a clearer view of the polity that will be the best for us; let us look there less to find examples than instruction; let us borrow from her the principles, rather than the details, of her laws ..... the principles on which the American constitutions rest, those principles of order, of the balance of powers, of true liberty, of deep and sincere respect for right, are indispensable to all republics .....  
   In 1948 the United States instituted the now famous Marshall Plan which included among its many provisions a fund for technical assistance. Part of this fund included the ``productivity campaign'' which was designed to bring European businessmen and labor representatives here to learn American methods of production. During the Plan's three years, over 6,000 Europeans came to the United States to study U.S. production. Though the funding for this part of the plan was less than one-half of one percent of all the Marshall Plan aid, its impact was far greater. The impact of this amendment may also be great. 
   We must note here the current state of Russia's affairs: it is deplorable. Despite this situation, last spring the United States Senate voted to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Throughout the elements of the Russian political system NATO expansion was viewed as a hostile act they will have to defend against; and they have said if they have to defend their territory, they will do so with nuclear weapons; that is all they have left. 
   The distrust born from NATO expansion will not fade quickly. Let us hope that this amendment will provide individuals from Russia and the other NIS the opportunity to see that we Americans do not hope for Russia's demise and isolation. Perhaps we can dispel the betrayal they may feel as a result of NATO enlargement, and give them the tools to further develop their own democracies. 
   Beyond that, the importance of training the next generation of social scientists in the NIS is immeasurable. It is this generation that will revitalize the universities, teaching the next generation economics, political science, sociology and other disciplines. It is this generation of social scientists who will be prepared to enter their Governments armed with new ideas and new ways of thinking different from the status quo; they will bring their new knowledge and standards, their linkages to the United States back to their own countries, and they will have the best opportunity to influence change there.

This article on the  tax treatment of Internet Commerce is by my nephew, a former Treasury official, Michael Moynihan. Last October Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which placed a three year moratorium on any new taxes on the Internet. But as Michael Moynihan points out, ``..... we have yet to address the long-term tax consequences of the movement of trade on line.''

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention an excellent article written by Alan Emory, the Senior Washington Correspondent for the Watertown Daily Times, entitled ``WWII Seaplane Crew Still Battling With Navy Red Tape Over Medals.'' Mr. Emory tells the incredible story of the rescue of a U.S. Airman by the crew of the Patrol Bomber Martin from the waters off Japan in World War II. Remarkably, the crew was denied the proper recognition for this act, and they have battled over the years to right that wrong. 
   At the time the rescue took place, the Navy, according to those involved, promised the pilot the Navy Cross and his crew the Silver Star. When the medals were actually awarded, however, all were awarded lesser medals. The disappointed crew accepted the medals without complaint. Years later when an appeal was filed, the Navy rejected the claim on the grounds that the deadline for such appeals had passed. But, a 1997 law waived the time limitation on appeals for such heroic acts. 
   The Navy has denied that any promise was made to the pilot or the crew. However, a newly declassified document from six months after the rescue showed that in fact the Navy had promised the pilot, Robert H. Macgill, the Navy Cross. The crew had signed affidavits that they were promised the  Silver Star. Unfortunately no document has been found to back up their claim, but this in no way decreases the gravity of this oversight. 
   To date, the Department of the Navy has refused to upgrade the medal status of those involved, though the case is still under review. I thank Mr. Emory for bringing this important act of bravery and incredible oversight to our attention. 
   I ask that the article be printed into the RECORD.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, our revered chairman of the Finance Committee has been characteristically generous in thanking the associates who have joined him in this matter. 
   I will take just a moment--I know he would wish me to do so--to call attention to the fact that it is our former colleague, our beloved former colleague, Bob Dole, who first proposed this matter. It was 1986. He introduced the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act to allow supplementary security income beneficiaries to continue to receive Medicaid when they return to work. 
   As the chairman of our committee said, this has enabled people to go to work who are disabled but not unwilling. 
   In a hearing before our committee on this bill, Senator Dole said:  
   This is about people going to work. It is about dignity and opportunity and all the things we talk about when we talk about being an American.  
   I think this accounts, sir, for the overwhelming support in this body. 
   With that thought, and again my thanks to the chairman, I yield the floor. 
   I have a snippet of time that Senator KENNEDY may wish to use.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to cosponsor the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act of 1999, introduced by my good friend and colleague Senator CHAFEE. We are joined by our colleagues Senators MCCAIN, JEFFORDS, and MACK, and by Senator GRAHAM, who has long been a leader on this issue. 
   This bill includes three provisions which are part of the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 (S. 792), which I introduced, along with Senator GRAHAM, on April 14th of this year. They would restore health coverage to legal immigrants--mostly children--whose eligibility for benefits is denied to them by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. It is a crucial step we should take. I will continue to work to move forward the broader Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act as well because it contains important provisions to prevent hunger and help the elderly and disabled. 
   The Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act would: Permit states to provide Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant children; permit states to provide Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women; and permit states to provide coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to all eligible legal immigrant children. 
   Note that these provisions are optional. There are no mandates in this bill. It would merely allow states to take common sense steps to aid legal immigrant children. 
   The problem is that under current law, states are not allowed to extend such health care coverage--which is so important for the development of healthy children--to families who have come to the U.S. after August 22, 1996, until the families have been here for five years. Five years is a very long time in the life of a child. Such a bar makes little sense for them, and is nonsensical for pregnant women. It is common knowledge that access to health care is essential for early childhood development. We should, at a minimum, permit states to extend coverage to all poor legal immigrant children, no matter when they have arrived here. Let me emphasize that under the 1996 law, states cannot use federal funds for this--and we are restoring this option to them. This builds upon our recent achievements in promoting health care for children--legal immigrant children should not be neglected in these efforts. 
   The provisions of that 1996 law concerning legal immigrants were based on the false premise that immigrants are a financial burden to American taxpayers. On the contrary. A recent comprehensive study by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that immigration actually benefits the U.S. economy. In fact, the study found that the average legal immigrant contributes $1,800 more in taxes than he or she receives in government benefits. 
   Many Americans may not realize this, but legal immigrants pay income and payroll taxes. And without continued legal immigration, the long-term financial condition of Social Security and Medicare would be worsened. According to the most recent Social Security trustees report, a decline in net immigration of 150,000 per year will reduce payroll tax revenues and require a 0.1% payroll tax increase to replace. 
   It is in our interest to see that these immigrant families have healthy children. And it is not merely wise, it is just. These immigrants have come here under the rules we have established and they have abided by those rules. 
   The 1996 law did grevious harm to the safety net for immigrants. Some states have begun their own efforts--without federal funding--to assist immigrants to make up the difference. Yet a new Urban Institute study concluded that ``[d]espite the federal benefit restorations and the many states that have chosen to assist immigrants, the social safety net for immigrants remains weaker than before welfare reform and noncitizens generally have less access to assistance than citizens.'' The Urban study also notes that ``[b]y barring many immigrants from federal assistance, the federal government shifted costs to states, many of which already bore a fiscal burden for providing assistance to immigrants.'' We in Washington should do our fair share. 
   Mr. President, simple decency requires us to continue to provide a measure of a safety net to legal immigrant families. I urge the enactment of this legislation to ensure that we do so.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senators MCCAIN, DODD, BENNETT, and HATCH for all the work they have done on S. 96, the Y2K Act. The bill will help protect against frivolous Y2K lawsuits. With just 199 days until 2000, the focus must remain on fixing the computer problem, not on litigating it. 
   The Y2K computer problem has been with us for some while, and it would be derelict of me not to mention that it was brought to my attention by a dear friend from New York, a financial analyst, John Westergaard, who began talking to me about the matter in 1995. On February 13, 1996, I wrote to the Congressional Research Service to say: Well, now, what about this? Richard Nunno authored a report which the CRS sent to me on June 7, 1996, saying that, ``the Y2K problem is indeed serious and that fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the Federal Government, as well as the private sector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, 2000.'' 
   I wrote the President, on July 31 of that year, to relay the findings of the CRS report and raise the issue generally. In time, a Presidential appointment was made to deal with this in the executive branch. And last spring--less than 1 year ago--the majority and minority leaders had the perception to appoint the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. 
   We have done a fine job preparing for the Year 2000. It took some cajoling, but people finally began to listen. The Federal Government should make it. The securities industry has been out on front on this. Their tests went very well this past March and April. When Senator BENNETT and I held a field hearing last summer--July 6--in the ceremonial chamber of the U.S. Federal Court House for the Southern District of New York, we found the big, large international banks in the City advanced in their preparations regarding this matter. 
   But much work still remains to be done. Testing and contingency plans are still being addressed. Last year, Senators BENNETT, DODD, and I introduced the Y2K Disclosure Act. This act, which the President signed on October 19, 1999, has been very successful in getting businesses to work together and share information on Y2K. S. 96 builds on the Disclosure Act and encourages remediation and information sharing. It is a good short-term fix for a once-in-a-modern-civilization problem, and I encourage the Senate to pass it forthwith.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is particularly appropriate with the recent celebration of Memorial Day that we pay homage to truly courageous individuals like Mike Berman, whose faith in democracy and freedom for mankind have helped make our nation as great as it is today. 
   The worst of times often best reveals the character of an individual. In the worst of times, Mike Berman proved his charity and love for his fellow man. He went beyond the call of duty when no one else dared to. 
   Having come from an immigrant family, Mr. Berman's achievements illustrate the enormous passion and desire America's immigrants have to create a better future in their newly adopted country. Our recognition of Mr. Berman reminds us of the tremendous contribution that immigrants have made in the shaping of our Nation. This diverse group of extraordinary, enterprising, and self-sufficient individuals have continuously served to strengthen the United States.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to tell the story of the Dushaj family. Several years ago Pranvera and Zenun Dushaj left their native Albania and were granted political asylum in the United States. They settled in the Bronx, New York where they found a place to live and both found jobs. Unfortunately, at the time they left Albania they could not bring their two young daughters, Edrina and Lisela, with them. They had to stay behind with their grandmother. 
   As soon as they were eligible, the Dushaj family applied for permission to bring their children to the United States. The family came to my office last year seeking assistance in getting the I-730 petitions approved. Last fall, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted the petitions for both daughters. 
   All was set. The Dushaj children could now join their parents in this country. All they needed were immigrant visas, but therein lay the problem. Because of recent fighting and the threat of terrorist activity, consular services at our Embassy in Albania were all but shut down, providing only emergency services to American citizens. The embassy was no longer able to process the needed visas. 
   I note that this was occurring this March just as the conflict with Serbia was coming to a head. The Dushaj children were stuck in Albania and their  parents were quite concerned. To make matters worse, they lived in Bijram-Curri, a city in the Tropoja region which is less than half an hour from the Kosovo border. 
   Albanians were being instructed to contact the American Embassy in Italy or Greece to obtain visas. This presented a problem for the Dushaj family. With the start of the NATO bombing campaign, it became nearly impossible to get from Albania to Italy, either by sea or air, and anti-American demonstrations outside our embassy in Athens made the Dushaj family reluctant to send their four and six year old daughters to Greece. 
   Fortunately, Zenun Dushaj has a cousin in Turkey and my office was able to work with the Dushaj family to have our embassy in Ankara accept jurisdiction in this matter. In April, Edrina and Lisela left Albania. Soon thereafter, they arrived at our embassy in Ankara where they applied for immigrant visas. They filled out the proper forms, underwent the necessary medical exams, provided the necessary documentation, and shortly thereafter their visa applications were processed. 
   I am very happy to report that on May 21, the Dushaj children landed in New York and were reunited with their parents. Pranvera and Zenun could not be more thrilled as their family starts a new life together in America. I am also proud that like so many immigrants before them, they will start that life in New York. 
   Many thanks are owed to Marisa Lino, our Ambassador in Albania, who I know is working under very trying conditions, and especially to Jacqueline Ratner, our Consul in Turkey. Ms. Ratner not only recognized that this was a situation where she could make something good happened, she followed up and sheparded the Dushaj children through the application process. I have no doubt that it was her fine work that made this happy outcome possible. 
   I also note the courage, ingenuity, and tenacity of the Dushaj parents and all their relatives in Albania and Turkey. They fought to bring these children to this country and no matter how desperate things looked, they never gave up hope. Most of all Mr. President, I would just like to say to Edrina and Lisela, welcome to America.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, David Ignatius has written a charming brief essay for The Washington Post on his former teacher Daniel Bell, ``the dean of American sociology.'' Professor Bell, who is now Scholar in Residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was a colleague and neighbor of mine for many years and a friend for even longer. He has no equal, and as he turns 80 he is indeed, as Mr. Ignatius writes, ``a kind of national treasure--a strategic intellectual reserve.'' The nation is hugely in his debt. (A thought which I fear would horrify him!)

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just days ago Ida Klaus, properly described as a ``labor law pioneer,'' died at the age of 94. I had the great privilege of working with her in the Kennedy Administration in 1961 when she advised us on the development of Executive Order 10988, ``Employee-Management Cooperation in the Federal Service,'' a defining event in the history of federal employment. She was a brilliant person, warm and concerned for others in a way that made possible her great achievements.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Rear Admiral James W. Nance, a gentleman and a patriot. I will leave it to others to talk about Bud's accomplishments in the Navy, at the White House, in the private sector and in academia, and here in the Senate. They are legion. I wish to highlight the central role he played in assisting the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which I chaired. Senator HELMS was a Commission Member. Bud understood the importance of keeping some secrets. But he also understood that excessive secrecy is a mode of regulation. The most pernicious mode, really, since we don't know what we don't know. It is a fitting tribute to Bud, his wisdom, and his talents that the Commission unanimously issued its report containing recommendations for protecting and reducing government secrecy. 
   Bud battled his illness gallantly, which is no surprise. His death from that illness is no surprise, either, but it hurts nonetheless. We who were privileged to know Bud will miss him. The country will miss him. 
   He and I were frequent correspondents. His last letter to me, from last October, is characteristics. He wrote,  
   As I mentioned in a discussion we had several months ago, I have myelodysplasia, or smoldering leukemia. I have had all the experimental treatments they do out at NIH without success. At present, I am living on transfusions. This problem does not worry me in the slightest because I have had 77 wonderful years and have had the privilege of knowing some of the great people of my time.  
   Not the slightest tinge of self-pity, remorse, regret, or bitterness. He was confident in his faith and comfortable in his accomplishments. Rather, he was concerned about the imminent dangers our country faced in the Balkans and elsewhere:  
   What does bother me, Senator, is I am extremely worried about our country. In 1939, I did not register for the draft for World War II. The reason I did not register was because they already had me ..... Everywhere we look around the world things are bad--Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, India/Pakistan (nuclear testing), North Korea, Latin America is stewing in drugs, et. al. We should remember what Charles DeGaulle said, ``There are no friends in international politics.'' We have countries that respect us; countries that fear us; and countries that hold us in contempt. I see too many cases where we are held in contempt. We have to do better internationally.  
   Bud wrote to me, with his characteristic modesty, ``In the roughly 60 years that I have been with the government in both the executive and legislative branches I have always tried to make our country a little safer and a little better.'' This, rhetoricians will tell you, is understatement. If I may paraphrase General Robert E. Lee, Bud did his duty in all things. He could not do more. And it's obvious he never wished to do less.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President: I commend the efforts of my respected colleagues from Florida, Senator MACK and Senator GRAHAM, as they work to modernize the tax rules that apply to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). I have worked with the REIT industry over the years and have seen it grow to be a major contributor to the strength of the real estate sector in New York and nationally. 
   Congress first authorized REITs in 1960 so that investors of modest means could invest in income producing real estate assets. During the last four decades, REITs have provided not only real estate ownership opportunities for individual investors, but also an important source of capital for real estate investment. 
   As tax policy makers we have the responsibility to make sure that tax laws governing REITs are updated to reflect the realities of a dynamic market and to maintain a proper competitive balance between real estate owned through the REIT structure and through more traditional corporate and partnership structures. But because REITs are pass-through entities, we also have a responsibility to ensure that they are not used as vehicles for sheltering corporate taxes in a manner inconsistent with Congressional intent. In fact, twice in the last Congress the Finance Committee crafted legislation, later signed into law, to stop inappropriate use of the REIT structure in the case of so-called ``stapled entities'' and liquidating subsidiaries. 
   The Administration has included a proposal in its FY 2000 budget that would, among other things, allow REITs to own a taxable REIT subsidiary. The legislation introduced by Senators MACK and GRAHAM builds on the Administration proposal, and would expand the permissible business activities of REITs. 
   The approach taken in the proposals advanced by the Administration and by Senators MACK and GRAHAM warrant consideration. I have asked my staff to review the legislation and work with the authors of the bill. It is my hope that Congress can enact REIT modernization legislation this year.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing three bills that will provide much needed financial support for America's 144 accredited medical schools and 1,250 graduate medical education (GME) teaching institutions. These institutions are national treasures; they are the very best in the world. Yet today they find themselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces reshape the health care delivery system in the United States. 
   The growth of managed for-profit care combined with GME payment reductions under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) have put these hospitals in dire financial straits. Hospitals are losing money--millions of dollars every year. And these losses are projected to increase, as additional scheduled Medicare payment reductions are phased in. Many of the teaching hospitals that we know and depend on today may not survive--including those in my state of New York--if these additional GME payment reductions are not repealed. 
   To ensure that this precious public resource is maintained and the United States continues to lead the world in the quality of its health care system, the three bills I am introducing today --the Graduate Medical Education Payment Restoration Act of 1999, the Managed Care Fair Payment Act of 1999, and the Nursing and Allied Health Payment Improvement Act of 1999--will provide critically required funding for teaching hospitals. 
   Everyone in America benefits from the research and medical education conducted in our medical schools and affiliated teaching hospitals. They are what economists call public goods --something that benefits everyone but which is not provided for by market forces alone. Think of an army. Or a dam. 
   The Medicare program is the nation's largest explicit financier of GME, with annual payments of about $7 billion. In the past, other payers of health care have also contributed to the costs of GME. However, in an increasingly competitive managed care health care system, these payments are being squeezed out. 
   Earlier this year, I reintroduced the Medical Education Trust Fund Act of 1999. This legislation requires the public sector, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector, through an assessment on health insurance premiums, to contribute broad-based and equitable financial support for graduate medical education. I hope that one day Congress will see the wisdom of enacting such a measure. However, our teaching hospitals need help now. 
   We are in the midst of a great era of discovery in medical science. It is certainly no time to close medical schools. This great era of medical discovery is occurring right here in the United States, not in Europe like past ages of scientific discovery. And it is centered in New York City. 
   It started in the late 1930s. Before then, the average patient was probably as well off, perhaps better, out of a hospital as in one. Progress since that point sixty years ago has been remarkable. The last few decades have brought us images of the inside of the human body based on the magnetic resonance of bodily tissues; laser surgery; micro surgery for reattaching limbs; and organ transplantation, among other wonders. Physicians are now working on a gene therapy that might eventually replace bypass surgery. One can hardly imagine what might be next--but we do know that much of it will be discovered in the course of ongoing research activities in our teaching hospitals and medical schools. That is a process which is of necessity unplanned, even random--but which regularly produces medical breakthroughs. To cite just a few examples: 
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the world renowned teaching hospital in New York City, researchers in 1998 discovered among many other things a surgical biopsy technique that can predict whether breast cancer has spread to surrounding lymph node tissue. This technique will spare 60,000 to 80,000 patients each year from having to undergo surgical removal of their lymph nodes. 
   In 1997, at Mount Sinai-NYU Medical Center, it was discovered that malignant brain tumors in young children can be eradicated through the use of high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplants. 
   And in May of last year, a doctor at Children's Hospital in Boston created a global media sensation with his discovery that a combination of the drugs endostatin and angiostatin appeared to cure cancer in mice by cutting off the supply of blood to tumors. Although the efficacy of this therapy in humans is not yet known, the research holds great promise that a cure for cancer may actually be within reach. And it was discovered in a teaching hospital. 
   The Graduate Medical Education Payment Restoration Act, with a total of 15 cosponsors, will freeze the current schedule of BBA reductions to the indirect portion of GME funding. Congressman RANGEL today is introducing a similar bill in the House. Under the BBA, the indirect payment adjustor is scheduled to be reduced from 7.7 percent to 5.5 percent by FY 2001. This bill will maintain the current payment adjustor at its current level of 6.5 percent, thereby rolling back about half of the indirect GME funding cuts in the BBA. In total, this provision restores about $3 billion over 5 years and $8 billion over 10 years in indirect GME funding for teaching hospitals. 
   The Managed Care Fair Payment Act, with nine cosponsors, will redirect more than $2.5 billion over 5 years of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funds from the Medicare managed care payment rates to the more than 1,900 hospitals that qualify for DSH funding. Congressman RANGEL introduced a similar bill in the House this past March. More than two-thirds of teaching hospitals also qualify for DSH funds. Under the current payment method, payments to managed care plans include these DSH funds, but unfortunately, these funds are not necessarily passed-on to DSH hospitals. Managed care plans often do not contract with DSH hospitals, and when they do the negotiated payment rates often do not include these DSH payments. Like GME funding under current law, this bill would carve out DSH funds from the managed care rates and require the Health Care Financing Administration to pass them on directly to qualifying hospitals. 
   The third bill I am introducing today, which has 13 cosponsors, is the Nursing and Allied Health Payment Improvement Act. This bill was introduced by Congressmen CRANE and BENTSEN on April 20 of this year. While Congress in the BBA of 1997 recognized the need to carve-out GME funding from managed care rates, it unintentionally did not carve out the funding for the training of nurses and allied health professionals. Like DSH funds, without the carve-out, funding for these education programs is unlikely to reach the more than 700 hospitals that provide training to these vitally important health professionals. This bill seeks to correct this problem by carving out the funding for the training of nurses and other allied health professionals and directing them to the hospitals that provide these training programs. 
   Combined, these three bills will strengthen our nation's teaching hospitals and ensure that the United States will continue to be in the forefront of developing new cures, new medical technology, and training of the worlds finest medical professionals. Without these bills, the state of our nation's teaching hospitals and the delivery of health care will remain in jeopardy.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join today with Senators ROTH, KENNEDY, and JEFFORDS in announcing that we have a total of 75 cosponsors supporting the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill would address some of the barriers and disincentives that individuals enrolled in Federal disability programs face in returning to work. We rise today to make the case that this measure deserves consideration in the Senate as soon as possible. We are committed to passing this bill promptly and without amendment. 
   The great enthusiasm and broad support for this legislation has created its impressive momentum. Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, ROTH, and I introduced the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (S..331) on January 28 of this year. On February 4, the Finance Committee held a hearing on the bill. Our former chairman and majority leader among others testified in emphatic support. On that day, we already had a bipartisan list of 42 Senators. The committee reported the bill without amendment on March 4 by a vote of 16 to 2. At that time, the total cosponsor list reached 60, including 18 Republicans and 42 Democrats. 
   The President included the Senate legislation in his fiscal year 2000 budget, and expressed his support for this bipartisan initiative in his State of the Union Address. 
   The overwhelming support for this legislation is not surprising given its simple and universal goal: to provide Americans with disabilities the opportunity to work and contribute to the fullest of their ability. Its supporters include persons with disabilities and their families, veterans, health care providers, and health and disability insurers. 
   I join Senators KENNEDY, ROTH, and JEFFORDS in urging its earliest possible consideration and passage by the Senate.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have been debating the subject of banking in the Senate since the 18th century. We began to ask ourselves a question, could we have a national bank, which Mr. Hamilton, of New York, thought we could do and should do. We created one. It had a very brief tenure. It went out of existence just in time that the Federal Government had no financial resources for the War of 1812. So it was reinstituted, as I recall, in 1816 for 20 years, and went out of existence just in time for the panic of 1837. We went through greenbacks. There must have been a wampum period. We went to gold coinage. Then a free coinage of silver dominated our politics for almost two decades, as farmers sought liquidity and availability of credit. Finally, at the end of the century of exhaustive debate, we more or less gave up and adopted what we now call the Federal Reserve System. 
   To say we debated this matter for a century is certainly true. In the past few years, we have turned our focus to the nonbank bank. You are really reaching for obscurity when you define an issue as we have done, and yet that seems to be the term with which we have to deal. 
   The issue of the nonbank banks, also referred to as financial modernization, is facing the Senate today. As we consider Chairman PHIL GRAMM's (R-TX) bill I would like to make two points. The first being that we need financial modernization, that depression era banking laws need to be amended. We all agree on that. The second point that I would like to make is that we must do this in a prudent manner--preserve the things which need to be preserved, and remedy the things which need to be remedied. 
   It strikes me as odd that most corporations are free to engage in any lawful business. Banks, by contrast, are limited to the business of banking. It is generally agreed that the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 need to be  amended. Banks, security firms, and insurance companies should be allowed to offer each other's services. They already do by finding loopholes in the law. Congress must catch up, and pass a law that condones this activity. London does it. Tokyo too. Why not New York, which, if I may say, is one of the world's banking capitals? 
   This is a real problem for the existing banks which find themselves under serious constraints they have lived with under depression-era banking laws. Suddenly, they find that their activities are encroached upon and they are not able to do things that they ought to do, that they are going to need to do, if they are going to survive in a competitive world economy. 
   Now is the time to modernize our financial institutions. But the bill before us has certain problems. The most serious of which is that it weakens the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA, enacted in 1977, has played a critical role in revitalizing low and moderate income communities. New York has benefited from this. A Times editorial states that ``in New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and a new middle class. The banks earn less on community-based loans than on corporate business. But the most civic-minded banks have accepted this reduced revenue as a cost of doing business--and as a reasonable sacrifice for keeping the surrounding communities strong.'' 
   It is for this reason that I cannot support Chairman GRAMM's bill. I voted for the Democratic substitute which was offered by Senator SARBANES. This bill too amends Glass-Steagall and the Bank Holding Company Act. But it preserves the CRA. I want financial modernization as much as the next person. But we cannot do it at the detriment of the CRA.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a month ago, April 7, as the war in Yugoslavia began to assume its present form, President Clinton spoke to the U.S. Institute for Peace. It was an important statement about the nature of conflict in the years to come. ``Clearly,'' he stated, ``our first challenge is to build a more peaceful world, one that will apparently be dominated by ethnic and religious conflicts we once thought of primitive, but which Senator MOYNIHAN, for example, has referred to now as post-modern.'' I am scarcely alone in this; it has become, I believe, a widely held view. A recent article in The Wall Street Journal began by asking: ``Does Kosovo represent the future or the past.'' The distinguished Dean of the John F. Kennedy School had an emphatic answer.  
   ..... Joseph Nye, a Clinton Pentagon alumnus, forecasts a brave new world dominated by ethnic conflicts. There are thousands of ethnic groups that could plausibly argue they deserve independence, he estimates, making it imperative for the U.S. to decide where it should intervene. ``There's potential for enormous violence,'' he says.  
   In this spirit, just yesterday, The Times spoke of ``The Logic of Kosovo.''  
   With the cold war over, the country needs to devise a new calculus for determining when its security is threatened and the use of force is warranted. Kosovo is a test case. If the United States and its NATO allies are prepared to let a tyrant in the Balkans slaughter his countrymen and overrun his neighbors with hundreds of thousands of refugees, other combustible regions of Europe may face similar upheavals.  
   Almost a decade ago the eminent scientist E. O. Wilson offered a perspective from the field of sociobiology. Once ``the overwhelmingly suppressive force of supranational ideology was lifted,'' ethnicity would strike. ``It was the unintended experiment in the natural science mode: cancel one factor at a time, and see what happens.'' For ``coiled and ready ethnicity is to be expected from a consideration of biological evolutionary theory.'' 
   Throw in television and the like, and surely we are in a new situation. Just as surely, it is time to think anew. 
   The first matter has to do with the number of such potential conflicts. Here it is perhaps the case that the United States bears a special responsibility. For it is we, in the person of President Woodrow Wilson, and the setting of the Versailles Peace Conference who brought to world politics the term ``self-determination.'' It is not sufficiently known that Wilson's Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, of Jefferson County, New York, had the greatest foreboding. Hence this entry in his diary written in Paris on December 30, 1918.  
   ``Self-Determination'' and the Dangers 
   DECEMBER 30, 1918 
   The more I think about the President's declaration as to the right of ``self-determination'', the more convinced I am of the danger of putting such ideas into the minds of certain races. It is bound to be the basis of impossible demands on the Peace Congress, and create trouble in many lands ....... The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite. It will raise hopes which can never be realized.  It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. In the end it is bound to be discredited, to be called the dream of an idealist who failed to realize the danger until too late to check those who attempt to put the principle into force. What a calamity that the phrase was ever uttered! What misery it will cause! Think of the feelings of the author when he counts the dead who dies because he coined a phrase! A man, who is a leader of public thought, should beware of intemperate or undigested declarations. He is responsible for the consequences.  
   There have to be limits, and it should be a task of American statecraft to seek to define them. It is not that 185 members of the United Nations are enough. There is room for more. But surely there needs to be a limit to the horrors we have witnessed in the Balkans in this decade, and in Kosovo this past month. From the Caucuses to the Punjab, from Palestine to the Pyrenees, violence beckons. It is not difficult to get started. At least one American diplomat holds a direct view of the origin of the present horror. I cannot speak for every detail of his account, but some are well known, and his view is not, to my knowledge, contested.  
   The current phase of the Kosovo crisis can be traced back to 1996, when financial collapse in Albania (small investors lost their meager life savings in a classic Ponzi scheme condoned by the then government) led to political and social chaos. President Berisha (a Geg from the misnamed Democratic Party) was forced out amidst massive rioting in which the army disappeared as its armories were emptied. Arms found their way into the armed gangs and eventually to an incipient Kosovo Albanian guerrilla movement that called itself the Kosovo Liberation Army. The new government of Socialist Fatos Nan (a Southerner, a Tosk, and a former Communist) was unable to establish effective control over the north and Berisha made a conspicuous point of not only supporting the KLA, but actually turning his personal property in the north over to the KLA as a training base. Supporting fellow Gegs apparently makes for good politics among the northerners. 
   The KLA's strategy was very simple: Target Serbian policemen and thus provoke the inevitable brutal Serb retaliation against Kosovo Albanian civilians, all in the hopes of bringing NATO into the conflict. They have succeeded brilliantly in this goal, but have not proved to be much a fighting force themselves.  
   These are not arguments new to the Senate. A year ago, April 30, 1998, my eminent colleague JOHN W. WARNER and I offered cautionary amendments concerning NATO expansion eastward. I went first with a proposal that new NATO members should first belong to the European Union. I received, as I recall, 17 votes. My colleague then proposed to postpone any further enlargement of NATO for a period of at least three years. That proposal, again if I recall, received 41 votes. We felt, on the whole, somewhat lonely. Now, however, we learn that Defense Secretary William Perry and his top arms-control aide, Ashton Carter, as related by Thomas L. Friedman in The Times of March 16, 1999.  
   Mr. Perry and Mr. Carter reveal that when they were running the Pentagon they argued to Mr. Clinton that NATO expansion ``should be deferred until later in the decade.'' Mr. Perry details how he insisted at a top-level meeting with the President, on December 21, 1994, that ``early expansion was a mistake,'' because it would provoke ``distrust'' in Russia and undermine cooperation on arms control and other issues, and because ``prematurely adding untried militaries'' at a time when NATO itself was reassessing its role would not be helpful.  
   The Secretary of Defense lost the argument; in Friedman's view domestic politics overrode strategic concerns. But who won? The various pronouncements that issued from the recent NATO summit come close to a telephone directory of prospective new NATO members. Before we get carried away, might we ask just how many of them have the kind of internal ethnic tension so easily turned on? Which will be invaded by neighbors siding with the insurgents? Must NATO then go to war in the Caucuses? 
   The second matter of which I would speak is that of international law. The United States and its NATO allies have gone to war, put their men and women in harm's way for the clearest of humanitarian purposes. They have even so attacked a sovereign state in what would seem a clear avoidance of the terms of the U.N. Charter, specifically Article 2(4). The State Department has issued no statement as to the legality of our actions. An undated internal State Department document cites Security Council Resolution 1199 affirming that the situation in Kosovo constitutes a threat to the peace in the region, and demanding that the parties cease hostilities and maintain peace in Kosovo. The Department paper concludes: ``FRY actions in Kosovo cannot be deemed an internal matter, as the Council has condemned Serbian action in Kosovo as a threat to regional peace and security.'' 
   A valid point. But of course the point is weakened, at very least, by the fact of our not having gone back to the Security Council to get authorization to act as we have done. We have not done this, of course, because the Russians and/or the Chinese would block any such resolution. Even so, it remains the case that the present state of international law is in significant ways a limitation on our freedom to pursue humanitarian purposes. Again, a matter that calls for attention, indeed, demands attention. 
   In sum, limits and law.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague and fellow New Yorker, Senator SCHUMER, to introduce this bill to transfer administrative jurisdiction of less than an acre of land at the Home of Franklin Delano Roosevelt National Historic Site from the National Park Service to the National Archives and Records Administration. This legislation would remove the last remaining obstacle to the construction of the National Archives' planned FDR Presidential Library Visitor Center and requires no Federal funds. 
   For the past several years, the National Archives has worked closely with the National Park Service, the New York State Historic Preservation Office, the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, and the General Services Administration, to determine the appropriate site for a visitor center. In order to serve the greatest number of visitors, the optimum location was found to be property currently controlled by the National Park Service. Since the National Archives will administer the visitor center, administrative jurisdiction of the property must be transferred from the National Park Service, which the National Park Service supports. 
   To date, $8,200,000 in Federal funds have been appropriated for this project and the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute has contributed an additional $3,400,000. Design work is scheduled to be completed in September of 1999, and construction could begin after jurisdiction is transferred. 
   Last year, the House passed H.R. 4829 to accomplish this same goal. Unfortunately, time expired on the 106th Congress before we could take it up in the Senate. This year, Congressman JOHN E. SWEENEY has reintroduced the bill, now H.R. 1104, which has a strong chance of passing. We would be most fortunate, indeed, if the Senate would agree to our noncontroversial bill.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1999, a bill submitted by my distinguished colleague, Senator MCCONNELL. This legislation is designed to create a new option in auto insurance for consumers who would prefer a system that guarantees quick and complete compensation. This alternative system would change most insurance coverage to a first-party system from a third-party system and it would separate economic and noneconomic compensation by unbundling the premium. Therefore, drivers would be allowed to insure themselves for only economic loss or for both economic and noneconomic loss. 
   I simply would remark that this issue has been with us for 30-odd years and I wish to provide some of the background and a particular perspective. 
   The automobile probably has generated more externalities, as economists and authors Alan K. Campbell and Jesse Burkhead remarked, than any other device or incident in human history. And one of them is the issue of insurance, litigation, and compensation in the aftermath of what are called ``accidents'' but are nothing of the kind and are the source of so much misunderstanding. 
   When a certain number of ``accidents'' occur (I think that in 1894, if memory serves, there were two automobiles in St. Louis, MO, and they managed to collide--at least, it has been thought thus ever since), they become statistically predictable collisions--foreseeable events--in a complex transportation system such as the one we have built. 
   This began to be a subject of epidemiology in the 1940's, and by the 1950's, we had the hang of it. We knew what we were dealing with and how to approach it. 
   The first thing that we did--I think it fair to say it was done in New York under the Harriman administration, of which I was a member--was to introduce the concept of passenger safety into highway and vehicle design. Safety initiatives were undertaken, first at the State level. The, in 1966, Congress passed two bills, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Highway Safety Act, to establish pervasive Federal regulation. At the time, the last thing in the world an automobile manufacturer would suggest was that its product was a car in which one could safely have an accident! Perhaps other motorists, driving other companies cars, had accidents. It took quite a bit of learning--social learning--but eventually it happened: safety features such as padded steering wheels and dashboards, seat belts, and airbags became integral design considerations. Now it is routine; we take such features for granted. It wasn't always thus. Social learning. 
   And then the issue of insurance and litigation and so forth arose. In 1967, if I could say, which would be 32 years ago, I wrote an article for The New York Time Magazine, which simply said, ``Next, a new auto insurance policy.'' By ``next,'' I meant a natural evolution, building on the epidemiological knowledge we had developed regarding the incidence of 
   collisons and the trauma they caused to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. And I had a good line here, I think: ``Automobile accident litigation has become a twentieth-century equivalent of Dickens's Court of Chancery, eating up the pittance of widows of orphans, a vale from which few return with their respect for justice undiminished.'' 
   The are several fundamental problems with the current system of auto insurance, as I explained back then. First, determining fault, necessary in a tort system, is no easy task in most instances. Typically, there are few witnesses. And the witnesses certainly aren't ``expert.'' The collisions are too fast, too disorienting. And adjudicating a case typical occurs long after the collision. Memories fade. 
   More important, as I remarked at the time, is that ``no one involved (in the insurance system) has any incentive to moderation or reasonableness. The victim has every reason to exaggerate his losses. It is some other person's insurance company that must pay. The company has every reason to resist. It is somebody else's customer who is making the claim.'' This leads to excessive litigation, costly legal fees, and inefficient, inequitable compensation. 
   A 1992 survey of the nation's most populous counties by the U.S. Department of Justice found that tort cases make up about one-half of all civil cases filed in state courts. Auto collision-related lawsuits account for 60 percent of these tort cases--more than all other types of tort lawsuits combined. Such lawsuits are time consuming: 31 percent of automobile tort cases take over one year to process. They are clogging our courts, displacing other types of civil litigation far more important to society. 
   And for all the time, money, and effort these lawsuits consume, they do not compensate victims adequately. On average, victims with losses between $25,000 and $100,000 recover just over half (56 percent) of their losses, and those persons with losses over $100,000 receive just nine cents on the dollar in compensation. 
   ``Auto Choice,'' as our legislation is known, will curtail excessive litigation by changing insurance coverage to a first-party system--at the driver's option. Individuals will insure themselves against economic damages regardless of fault. They can, if they wish, insure for non-economic losses, too. They simply pay a higher premium. In the event they sustain damages in a collision, under Auto Choice, they bypass litigation altogether, and they receive just and adequate compensation in a timely fashion. 
   I earnestly hope that Congress will enact this important legislation this year. It will benefit all American motorists. Its savings are bigger than any tax cut Congress is likely to enact, and they won't affect our ability to balance the budget. But even more important, I think, is the fact that ``auto choice'' will take some of the strain off our overburdened judiciary. I don't know if we can calculate the value of such a benefit.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999, a bill to restore to legal immigrants eligibility for a number of safety net benefits denied to them by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. I am glad to be joined by my colleagues Senators GRAHAM, KENNEDY, DURBIN, FEINSTEIN, WELLSTONE, and LEAHY. 
   The provisions of the 1996 law concerning legal immigrants were based on the false premise that such immigrants are a burden to us all. On the contrary. A recent comprehensive study by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that immigration actually benefits the U.S. economy. In fact, the study found that the average legal immigrant contributes $1,800 more in taxes than he or she receives in government benefits. 
   Many Americans may not realize this, but legal immigrants pay income and payroll taxes. And without continued legal immigration, the long-term financial condition of Social Security and Medicare would be worsened. It is in our interest to see that these immigrant families have healthy children, enough to eat, and support if they become disabled. And it is not merely wise, it is just. These immigrants have come here under the rules we have established and they have abided by those rules. If harm should befall them, it is right to extend a hand. 
   The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act contains several provisions. First, it would permit states to provide Medicaid coverage to poor legal immigrant pregnant women and children, as well as coverage under the new Child Health insurance program (CHIP) for legal immigrant children, whenever they arrive in the United States. Under current law, states are not allowed to extend such health care coverage--which is so important for the development of healthy children--to families who have come to the U.S. after August 22, 1996, until the families have been here for five years. Five years is a very long time in the life of a child. It is common knowledge, emphasized by recent research, that access to health care is essential for early childhood development. We should, at a minimum, permit states to extend coverage to all poor legal immigrant children, no matter when they have arrived here. This builds upon our recent achievements in promoting health care for children--legal immigrant children should not be neglected in these efforts. 
   The bill also permits states to restore Medicaid coverage to certain legal immigrants in nursing homes. These individuals would be eligible for states' ``medically needy'' Medicaid coverage if they were citizens, having ``spent down'' 
   their income and assets in nursing homes to the point of destitution. Several states continue to pay nursing homes for these frail seniors without federal support. We should do our share to care for them. 
   Next, the bill restores Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility for legal immigrants who have come to the U.S. after August 22, 1996, and have since then, unfortunately, become disabled. While it would be preferable to restore full SSI eligibility for these legal immigrants, at this time we propose only that the disabled be again eligible for SSI, because they are the population most in need. A modicum of a safety net. We have made great strides in assisting the disabled in this country in recent years. We should not then, deliberately, refuse aid to individuals who have come to our nation lawfully and then suffered a disability. The bill also completes the process, begun in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, of restoring SSI eligibility to elderly pre-1996 legal immigrants. 
   Fourth, since the 1996 welfare law was enacted we have been successful in restoring a limited amount of food stamp eligibility for the most vulnerable legal immigrants--children, the disabled, the elderly. A Physicians for Human Rights survey in 1998 found that almost 80 percent of immigrant households suffered from limited or uncertain availability of nutritious foods, and that immigrant households reported ``severe hunger'' at a rate more than 10 times that of the general population. While this survey was conducted before the limited restoration of food stamp eligibility in 1998, it suggests the magnitude of the hunger problem among legal immigrants. We need to do more, and this bill restores food stamp eligibility to all legal immigrants who were in the U.S. prior to the 1996 enactment of the welfare law. 
   Finally, there is another vulnerable immigrant population for which we need to do more: victims of domestic violence. The 1996 welfare law put severe limits on the assistance which can be provided to non-citizens suffering from domestic abuse, particularly if they came to the U.S. after August 22, 1996. This legislation will expand the circumstances under which immigrant victims of domestic violence are eligible for Medicaid and TANF assistance, and restores eligibility for food stamps and SSI. These programs provide essential resources to break the economic dependence on a violent relationship. It also ensures that elderly legal immigrants who are abused by their children can obtain access to these benefits as well. 
   Mr. President, simple decency requires us to continue to provide a  measure of a safety net to legal immigrant families. I urge the enactment of this legislation to ensure that we do so.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Sunday the Queens Jewish Community Council honored an important member of the staff of the Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty (Met Council). Her name is Jackie Ebron and she helps serve the more than 100,000 clients who are helped by this remarkable organization. Ms. Ebron, the Met Council's longest serving employee and Director of Crisis Intervention is an African-American whose exceptional service to impoverished Jewish New Yorkers was recently highlighted in New York's Jewish Week newspaper. 
   In the past seven years the Met Council has developed 1300 units of special needs housing for the elderly, mentally ill and the homeless; every day they provide nearly three thousand poor elderly individuals with home care services; they provide job placement to more than one thousand people a year and have trained more than 20,000 home attendants since 1993. Their food programs impact on the lives of well over 100,000 people and they also provide furniture and clothing to thousands. The Met Council's coordination of a network of two dozen Jewish Community Councils across New York City helps deliver services where they are needed in a timely and efficient manner. The Met Council is also one of the most efficient non-profit organizations today. They spend 98% of their budget on programs and services; only 2% is spent on administration.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senator SCHUMER and I have offered this amendment to strike Sec. 314 of S. Con. Res. 20, the Fiscal Year 2000 budget resolution. Sec. 314 expresses the Sense of the Senate that Governors Island will be sold during Fiscal Year 2000. The underlying assumption is that it will be sold for $500 million. Another assumption--not stated in Sec. 314--is that the $500 million will be used as an off-set to help pay for Federal crop insurance reform. 
   At the outset, I must say that I support crop insurance reform. Our farmers are the most productive in the world. I wonder, from time to time, if we appreciate just how affordable--and plentiful--food is in this country. If crop insurance reform will help our farmers to weather natural disasters and low commodity prices, I'm for it. But I have a serious problem with using the sale of Governors Island to pay for it for two reasons. The first is based on principle; the second, on practicality. 
   There is a question of fairness here. Governors Island was part of New York before the United States existed. In 1800, New York State rather magnanimously gave jurisdiction--but not title--over Governors Island to the Federal government. Then, New York spent its own monies to construct Fort Jay and other harbor fortifications and batteries, such as Castle Clinton and Castle William. These fortifications successfully deterred the British from attempting to enter New York Harbor during the War of 1812. Governors Island has served our nation well. It is the site, after all, where Operation Overlord was planned fifty-five years ago. 
   On June 18, 1958, a Federal district court determined that the Federal government needed to take title to the Island and awarded New York one dollar as ``just compensation''. Since then, the Army moved out, and the Island's most recent tenant, the Coast Guard, left in 1997. Now, the 173-acre island sits vacant in New York Harbor.  
   On October 22, 1995, President Clinton invited me to join him at the 50th anniversary of the United Nations' General Assembly. On the helicopter flight from Kennedy Airport we flew over the Lower Harbor; I pointed out Castle William, Fort Jay, and some other fortifications and buildings, starting with Cornbury's Queen Anne mansion built in 1708. I noted that the Coast Guard was about to leave and that, presumedly, all would agree that the Island should revert to New York. President Clinton said that was fine with him, providing it would be used for public purposes. I demurred somewhat--that would involve a whole 
   lot of public purpose--but accepted the offer. We left it there with sufficient accord. 
   Governors Island belonged to New York. New York lent it to the Federal government. Now that the Federal government is no longer using it, New York should get it back, for no more than a nominal sum. 
   Unfortunately, and rather to my surprise, when President Clinton submitted his Fiscal Year 1998 budget request, he proposed selling Governors Island in Fiscal Year 2002 for $500 million. Congress seized on the idea--so much so, in fact, that we have ``sold'' Governors Island a couple of times already! 
   Now Members propose that we sell Governors Island, in Fiscal Year 2000, to pay for crop insurance reform. Even if we put principle and fairness aside, there are real practical problems with this proposal. I guess the first is that there are no buyers. None. Certainly not at the asking price. We don't know how the Island will be zoned. There is no regular ferry service. It costs about $12 million to $15 million each year just to maintain the buildings, many of which are historic. 
   Back in 1997, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated fair market value to be between $250 million and $1.0 billion. That's a pretty big range. There was no appraisal. Any appraisal would be highly speculative since the impact of zoning decisions and ultimate disposal of the Island remain unknown. Moreover, I do not believe that any CBO officials ever contacted anyone at the General Services Administration (GSA) who would be, perhaps, more knowledgeable about what sort of price the Island might fetch. I can tell you this: New York State, or New York City, won't pay a dime more than a dollar. So, in this instance, the CBO estimate is highly suspect. The site is magnificent, but it will be a considerable achievement to combine some public and private uses that preserve the historic portion of the Island. The combination eludes us still. In the meantime, we could lose it all if it should go unused for a few more New York winters. 
   So I repeat what I said at the outset: I am for crop insurance reform. But Governors Island won't pay for it, because the Island will not be sold for $500 million next year. It won't be sold for any price because there are no buyers. We haven't figured out what to do with it yet. 
   Governors Island belonged to New York, and New York ought to have it back. It is, at the same time, a national treasure for the historic value of its fortifications, buildings, and what has taken place there. I hope that Congress, and the Administration, will stop this tiresome tendency of ``selling'' it whenever some other program or initiative--laudable, I'm sure--needs an off-set. I thank the Senator from New Mexico (Senator DOMENICI) and the Senator from New Jersey (Senator LAUTENBERG) for their willingness to accept the amendment Senator SCHUMER and I have offered to strike Sec. 314 from S. Con. Res. 20.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, a bill that will encourage people receiving public assistance to seek work next year as enumerators for the 2000 census. In the previous census over 350,000 people went from door to door seeking information about those who did not return the census forms they received in the mail. In spite of the best efforts of this army of enumerators, some eight million people were not counted, and a disproportionate number of them were minorities. 
   The Bureau of the Census is going to great lengths to improve on the 1990 count, but finding the tens of millions of people who do not return their forms is an enormous undertaking. We know that many of those who must be sought out live in the low income areas of our cities, and many others are among the rural poor. This bill would allow those receiving financial assistance under any federal program, TANF and others, to be employed as enumerators during calendar year 2000 without having their income count against their eligibility for benefits from those programs. The bill further allows these enumerators to have their employment count towards eligibility for Social Security, Medicare, and other benefit programs. 
   Mr. President, encouraging those who live in the low income areas of our population to serve as enumerators will help to open the doors of their neighbors and those who live nearby. It  will help count more of those most difficult to count. And it will provide employment to those who may not be able to find it for various reasons that include lack of transportation to far-off jobs.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Comprehensive Border Protection Act, a bill that addresses the urgent need for increased Customs inspectors and technology along the U.S.-Canadian border. 
   Every day, the U.S. Customs Service must meet the dual challenges of enforcing our trade laws and easing the flow of goods across our borders. Customs carries out this mission at 83 ports-of-entry along the U.S.-Canada border, the world's longest undefended border--some 5,500 miles. 
   The resources, however, that we have provided to the Customs Service to process traffic and trade across this border are woefully deficient. In a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in September 1998, we learned that the current number of authorized Customs inspectors working on the northern border remains essentially the same as it was in 1980, despite the fact that the number of commercial entries they must process has increased sixfold since then, from 1 million to 6 million per year. The increased workload reflects of course the tremendous growth in U.S.-Canada trade: two-way trade in 1988, the year before the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement entered into force, was $194 billion. In 1998, our two-way merchandise trade with Canada reached $331 billion, nearly $1 billion a day. Over one-quarter of our total imports from Canada enter the U.S. through three New York ports-of-entry--Buffalo, Champlain, and Alexandria Bay. 
   This bill aims to correct these problems by authorizing the additional people and technology necessary to handle the increase in trade and traffic between the United States and Canada. In particular, this bill authorizes 375 additional ``primary lane'' inspectors and 125 new cargo inspectors for the northern border, as well as 40 special agents and 10 intelligence agents. The bill also authorizes $26.58 million for equipment and technology for the northern border. 
   The resources available to the Customs Service over the last decade have simply not kept pace with this enormous growth in workload. As trade continues to grow, the day will come when our ports simply will not be able to bear that load, unless we ensure that adequate staffing and equipment are in place.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my good friend from Texas. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of my friend from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD. He proposes a budget point of order against the use of the Social Security surplus for new spending or tax cuts. He would also devote 15 percent of the unified surplus to Medicare.  
   There is broad agreement in the Senate that the Social Security surplus must be protected. Senator CONRAD's approach, in my view, is the right one, unlike a competing proposal under discussion. That proposal would create a new declining debt ceiling on debt held by the public. Inadvertently, but inevitably, it would jeopardize the credit of the United States by hampering the ability of the Treasury to meet the obligations of the Government, absent any financial crisis, but merely as a mechanical result of a bill. 
   Happily, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not brought the proposal to the floor yet, but the budget resolution includes ``advisory levels'' for such a new debt limit, and the Committee Report states that ``it is assumed that separate and apart from the budget resolution a statute will be enacted to enforce these levels.'' 
   A simple explanation: We are going to buy down the debt. It is entirely correct that we should do so. However, anything can happen--a drought to the Midwest, a correction in the markets, a rise in the price of imported oil. In such an event, the revenues of the Government, although growing, will not have grown quite fast enough to have the debt being retired drop to the required level. In that circumstance, that perfectly prosperous economy, perfectly stable government, could find itself in default. 
   We have shut down the U.S. Government any number of times in the course of our history. We have never defaulted on our debt. It is the most secure instrument in the world. There is no reason whatever to put it in jeopardy at a time when we are making it even more secure by bringing the debt down to normal levels. 
   I hope we will not do that.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator SCHUMER to introduce a bill to honor and remember a truly exceptional American, Ronald H. Brown. The bill would designate the newly constructed Federal building located at 290 Broadway in the heart of lower Manhattan as the ``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building.'' 
   It is a fitting gesture to recognize the passing of this remarkable American, and I would ask for my colleagues' support for this legislation to place one more marker in history on Ron Brown's behalf. 
   Ron Brown had a great love for enterprise and industry as reflected in his achievements as the first African-American to hold the office of U.S. Secretary of Commerce. His was also a life of outstanding achievement and public service: Army captain; vice president of the National Urban League; partner in a prestigious law firm; chairman of the Democratic National Committee; husband and father. And these are but a few of the achievements that demonstrated Ron Brown's spirited and sweeping pursuit of life. 
   To have held any one of these posts in the government, and in the private sector, is extraordinary. To have held all of the positions he did and prevail as he did, is unique. Ron Brown was tragically taken from us too soon; we are diminished by his loss. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to this uncommon man.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Friday, the Society for History in the Federal Government awarded its annual James Madison prize for the most distinguished article on an historical topic ``reflecting on the functions of the Federal Government.'' This year, the award was presented to a member of my staff, Mark A. Bradley, for an article he wrote on the disappearance of the U.S.S. Scorpion (SSN 589). 
   The Scorpion was a Skipjack class nuclear submarine. In 1968, after a Mediterranean deployment with the 6th Fleet, the Scorpion was lost with all hands aboard about 400 miles of the Azores. It had been on a secret intelligence mission and the exact circumstances of the tragedy continue to be debated. Mr. Bradley's article recounts the events that led to the loss of the Scorpion and offers an insightful explanation of what might have caused the accident. 
   Our own Senator ROBERT C. BYRD for his masterly work on the Senate, historian Ira Berlin for his work on Emancipation in the American South, and the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, for its W. Averell Harriman project are all past Society for History in the Federal Government award winners. 
   As a Rhodes scholar, Mr. Bradley is no stranger to distinguished awards. He is an accomplished historian who, in his spare time, serves as the Associate Editor of Periodical, the Journal of America's Military Past, where his award winning article, ``Submiss: The Mysterious Death of the USS Scorpion (SSN 589) appeared. We are proud of him and thankful that he has chosen to apply his talents here in the Senate in the service of the nation.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, it is fitting that we have passed this legislation to name the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs (HUD) Washington, D.C. headquarters after Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to three Presidents, national chairman of the NAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary. 
   In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Dr. Weaver to head the Housing and Home Finance Agency, the precursor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1966, when President Johnson elevated the agency to Cabinet rank, he chose Dr. Weaver to head the department. Bob Weaver was, in Johnson's phrase, ``the man for the job.'' He thus became its first Secretary, and the first African-American to head a Cabinet agency.  
   Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``Black Cabinet,'' an informal advisory group promoting Federal job and educational opportunities for blacks. The Washington Post called this work--``the dismantling of a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America''--his greatest legacy. Indeed it was. 
   Bob Weaver was my friend, dating back more than 40 years to our service together in the administration of New York Governor Averell Harriman. Dr. Weaver was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for New York State in 1955, and later became State Rent Administrator with Cabinet rank. It was during these years, working for Governor Harriman, that I first met Bob; I was Assistant to the Secretary to the Governor and later, Acting Secretary. Our friendship and collaboration continued through the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Later, he and I served together on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission. 
   Bob Weaver died in July 1997, at his home in New York City. When he died, America--and Washington, in particular (for he was a native Washingtonian)--lost one of its innovators, one of its true leaders. I was privileged to know him as a friend. He will be missed but properly memorialized, I think, if we can get this legislation to name the HUD building after him to President Clinton for his signature. 
   I wish to thank Senators BOXER, DURBIN, GRAHAM, HOLLINGS, KENNEDY, KERRY, ROBB, SARBANES, and SCHUMER, for cosponsoring S. 67, and I wish to thank the majority and minority leaders for scheduling its expeditious passage.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee in opposing the pending amendment. I do agree with the senator from Arkansas that the Congress ought to take a close look at the terms of any agreement that is reached with China regarding its accession to the WTO. But that is already provided for in the law. Under section 122 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the administration must consult with the appropriate committees with regard to the accession of any country to the WTO. Those consultations are now taking place. I am assured that Ambassador Barshefsky will meet with each and every Senator who has an interest in this matter. 
   Moreover, as a participant in the WTO's Working Party on the Accession of China, the United States already has an effective veto over China's admission if we determine that the protocol of accession and China's market access commitments are inadequate. Since the Working Party operates by consensus, we could simply block the approval of the Working Party report and that would be the end of the matter. 
   It is clear that bringing China within the WTO framework--and subject to the WTO's rules--would be in the United States' interest. China is ranked as one of the top ten exporting countries in the world (WTO report, 1997 ranking) and ranks as the 12th largest importer. It must certainly be to the benefit of the world trading system to have China abide by the same rules as others. 
   American farmers and businesses also have an interest in securing improved access to China's market, and the WTO accession negotiations may provide the best opportunity that we will have in a very long time. 
   Certainly the United States should not accept an agreement that would bend the rules for China. Nor should we settle for a minimal market access package. And we will not. But neither should we cut off the negotiations at this point, which I fear this amendment would do. In essence, it signals, at a minimum, great skepticism on the part of the United States Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to provide greater disclosure to employees about the impact on their retirement benefits of pension plan conversions. 
   Recent media accounts have reported that many large companies in America are converting their traditional defined benefit pension plans to something called ``cash balance plans.'' A cash balance plan is a hybrid arrangement combining certain features of ``defined contribution'' and ``defined benefit'' plans. Like defined contribution plans, they provide each employee with an account in which his or her benefits accrue. But cash balance plans are actually defined benefit plans, and therefore provide a benefit for life which is insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
   Cash balance plans, however, differ from other defined benefit plans in the calculation of benefits. Whereas the value of an employee's retirement benefit in a traditional defined benefit plan grows slowly in the early years and more rapidly as one approaches retirement, cash balance plans decrease this later-year growth and increase the early-year growth. Consequently, younger employees tend to do better under cash balance plans than under traditional plans, while older employees typically do worse. In some cases, upon conversion to a cash balance account an older worker's account balance may remain static for years--typically referred to as the ``wear away'' period. 
   It appears that very few workers who have experienced the conversion of their company retirement plan to a cash balance arrangement understand the differences between the old and new plans. Those who do often complain that the new plans treat older workers unfairly. One 49-year-old engineer profiled by the Wall Street Journal--a rare employee who knows how to calculate pension benefits--determined that his pension value dropped by $56,000 the day his company converted to a cash balance plan. 
   Even more disturbing are complaints from some employees that their employers obscured the adverse effects of plan amendments. When an employer changes the pension plan, the employees have a right to know the consequences. There should be no surprises when it is time to retire. Unfortunately, current law requires little in the way of disclosure when a company changes its pension plan. Section 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requires employers to inform employees of a change to a pension plan resulting in a reduction in future benefit accruals. But that is all. It does not require specifics. The 204(h) disclosure can be, and often is, satisfied with a brief statement buried deep in a company communication to employees. It is imperative that we increase these disclosure requirements regarding reductions in pension benefits. 
   The bill I am introducing today would require employers with 1,000 or more employees to provide a ``statement of benefit change'' when adopting plan amendments which significantly reduce benefits. The statement of benefit change would provide a comparison, under the old and new versions of the plan, of the following benefit measures; the employee's accrued benefit and present value of accrued benefit at the time of conversion; and the projected accrued benefit and projected present value of accrued benefit three years, five years, and ten years after conversion and at normal retirement age. 
   These benefit measures are standard concepts which will be well understood by pension administrators, actuaries and others who work with pensions. They will give the employee a clear picture of the difference between 
   the old and new plans immediately, periodically over a ten-year period, and at retirement. The purpose of the three, five and ten-year comparisons is to disclose any ``wear away'' period, in which an employee would work without gaining any new benefits. Using these comparisons, employees can get a clear picture of the relative merits of the two plans. 
   In preparing this bill, my staff has consulted a number of actuaries and pension attorneys. I believe it is a good approach to resolving the problems I have discussed, and I am happy to work with others to incorporate suggestions to further improve the bill. 
   Of course, many call this measure as intrusive or unnecessary. Some employer groups have criticized the idea of requiring individualized benefits calculations for every employee, saying that this requires reviewing each employee's salary history. But that seems a strange complaint given that we are talking about cash balance plans, which already require highly individualized calculations. If an employer can provide personalized account balances under a cash balance arrangement, then the employer can provide such information for the old plan. 
   Moreover, recently completed regulations appear already to contemplate individualized comparisons. Regulation 1.411(d)-6, just finalized by the Internal Revenue Service, requires that in order  to determine if a reduction in future benefit accrual is ``significant,'' employers must compare the annual benefit at retirement age under the amended plan with the same benefit under the plan prior to amendment. Therefore, the concept of benefit comparisons is not a new one. 
   And indeed, some companies are proving by their actions that benefit comparisons are not unduly burdensome. Kodak, the prominent employer headquartered in Rochester, New York, recently announced that it will convert to a cash balance plan, and that it will give its 35,000 participants in the company-sponsored pension plan the choice between the old plan and the new. To help employees make an informed decision, Kodak will provide every plan participant with an individualized comparison of his or her benefits under the old and new versions of the plan. The company is also providing computer software that will allow employees to make the comparisons themselves. That is the difference between corporate behavior that is responsible and corporate behavior that is unscrupulous. As usual, Kodak sets a fine example. 
   I believe that such disclosure not only is in the best interest of employees, but also of the employer. Several class action lawsuits have been filed in the last three years challenging conversions to cash balance plans. These suits will likely cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in attorneys' fees. But with proper disclosure, they might not have occurred. 
   In closing, let me be clear about one thing. I take no position on the underlying merit of cash balance plans. Ours is a voluntary pension system, and companies must do what is right for them and their employees. But I feel strongly that companies must fully and comprehensibly inform their employees regarding whatever pension benefits the company offers. Companies have no right to misrepresent the projected benefit employees will receive under a cash balance plan or any other pension arrangement. 
   It is time to let the sun shine on pension plan conversions. I urge the Senate to support this important legislation.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues Senators CHAFEE, MIKULSKI, and SNOWE in introducing legislation to ensure that women with breast or cervical cancer will receive coverage for their treatment. The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a successful nationwide program--National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection program--that provides funding for states to screen low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical cancer. However, the CDC program is not designed and does not have funding to treat these women after they are diagnosed. 
   The women eligible for cancer screening under the CDC program are low-income individuals, yet are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid coverage. They do not have health insurance coverage for these screenings and for subsequent cancer treatment. 
   From July of 1991 to September of 1997, the CDC program provided mammography screening to 722,000 women and diagnosed 3,600 cases of breast cancer. During this same period, the program also provided over 852,000 pap smears and found more than 400 cases of invasive cervical cancer. 
   The CDC screening program has had to divert a significant amount of its resources from screenings in order to find treatment for the women found to have  breast and cervical cancer. The lack of subsequent funding for treatment has, therefore, jeopardized the programs' primary function: to screen low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical cancer. Currently, the program screens only about 12 to 15 percent of all eligible women. 
   A study conducted at Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation and the University of Michigan School of Public Health on treatment funding for women screened by the CDC program found that, although funding for treatment services were found for most of these women, treatment was not always available when needed. In addition, during the search for treatment funding, the CDC program lost contact with several women. The study also found that the sources of treatment funding are uncertain, tenuous and fragmented. The burden of funding treatment often fell upon providers themselves. Seeking charity care from public hospitals adds to hospitals' uncompensated care costs. It is no surprise that the National Association of Public Hospitals supports our bill to provide coverage for these women. 
   The legislation would allow states to provide treatment coverage for low-income women who are screened and diagnosed through the CDC program and who are uninsured. States will have the option to provide this coverage through its Medicaid program. States choosing this option would receive an enhanced match for the treatment coverage, similar to the federal match provided to the state for the CDC screening program. With this legislation, the Federal Government will follow through on its intent to assist low-income women with breast and cervical cancer. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has approved this proposal in the past. A similar provision was included in the Senate version of the Balanced Budget bill. I urge the Senate to again support this important legislation.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am honored, sir, to follow the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and his remarks. And might I begin with a phrase from the old Navy--by which I mean the old, old Navy--when a fellow was mustering out, he would say, ``I'm going to put that oar on my shoulder.'' And the reference was that you were going to put that oar on your shoulder and march inland until you reached a town where someone said, ``Hey, fella, what's that thing you've got on your shoulder?'' And then you could settle down in comfort after years at sea. Nebraska would surely qualify for such a site. This extraordinary man, who left Nebraska, joined the Navy, brought such honor and distinction to himself, and now to the Senate is remarkable indeed. 
   You've heard of his work. Just a word about the man. Hemingway said that courage was grace under pressure. BOB KERREY has shown that grace from that very moment 30 years ago on that bluff. Michael Barone in the Almanac of American Politics recounts that when asked about the medals he had won, Senator KERREY answered, ``One Purple Heart, one Bronze Star--one whatever.'' Well, the ``whatever'' is, of course, the Congressional Medal of Honor. There have been--all told--five U.S. Senators to have won that medal. 
   It was created during the Civil War. Four of the senators received the medal for service in the Civil War. And now, 134 years later, a fifth.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. ``Joe, Joe DiMaggio, we want you on our side!'' Well, he is on the other side now, but stays with us in our memories. 
   Mine are, well, special to me. It would be in 1938 or 1939 in Manhattan. The Depression lingered. Life was, well, life. But there was even so somebody who made a great difference and that was Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees. I admired him as no other man. Read of him each day, or so it seemed, in the Daily News. And yet I had never seen him play. One summer day my mother somehow found the needful sixty cents. Fifty cents for a ticket at the Stadium, a nickel for the subway up and back. Off I went in high expectation. But Gehrig, disease I must assume was now in progress, got no hit. A young player I had scarce noticed hit a home run. Joe DiMaggio. It began to drizzle, but they kept the game going just long enough so there would be no raincheck. I went home lifeless and lay on my bed desolate. 
   Clearly I was in pain, if that is the word. The next day my mother somehow came up with yet another sixty cents. Up I went. And the exact same sequence occurred. 
   I went home. But not lifeless. To the contrary, animated. 
   For I hated Joe DiMaggio. For life. 
   I knew this to be a sin, but it did not matter. Gehrig retired, then died. My animus only grew more animated. 
   Thirty years and some went by. I was now the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations. One evening I was having dinner at an Italian restaurant in midtown. As our company was about finished, who walked in but DiMaggio himself, accompanied by a friend. They took a table against the wall opposite. I watched. He looked over, smiled and gave a sort of wave. Emboldened, as we were leaving, I went over to shake hands. He rose wonderfully to the occasion. 
   I went out on 54th Street as I recall. And of a sudden was struck as if by some Old Testament lightening. ``My God,'' I thought, ``he has forgiven me!'' He must have known about me all those years, but he returned hate with love. My soul had been in danger and he had rescued me. 
   Still years later, just a little while ago the Yankees won another pennant. Mayor Guiliani arranged a parade from the Battery to City Hall. Joe was in the lead car; I was to follow. As we waited to get started, I went up to him, introduced myself and told of having watched him at the Stadium these many years ago. ``But I have to tell you,'' I added, ``Lou Gehrig was my hero.'' 
   ``He was my hero, too,'' said Joe. 
   Well, Joe, too, was a hero to many people. Few have embodied the American dream or created a more enduring legend than ``Joltin'' Joe DiMaggio. And fewer have carried themselves, both on and off the field, with the pride and courtliness of, as Hemingway said, ``the great DiMaggio.'' 
   Born the fourth son of an immigrant fisherman--two other brothers also played in the majors--he joined the Yankees in 1936 after dropping out of high school and grew into the game's most complete center fielder. He wore No. 5 and became the heir to Babe Ruth (No. 3) and Lou Gehrig (No. 4) in the team's pantheon. DiMaggio was the team's superstar, on a team of superstars, for 13 seasons. By the time his career ended in 1951, he had played in 11 All-Star games and 10 World Series, nine of which the Yankees won. 
   The ``Yankee Clipper'' was acclaimed at baseball's centennial in 1969 as ``the greatest living ballplayer.'' Even his main rival Ted Williams, admitted this: ``..... he [DiMaggio] was the greatest baseball player of our time. He could do it all.'' DiMaggio played 1,736 games with the Yankees. He had a career batting average of .325 and hit 361 home runs while striking out only 369 times. He could indeed do it all. 
   But there is one statistic for which DiMaggio will be most remembered: his 56-game hitting streak, possibly the most enduring accomplishment in all of sports. The streak began on May 15, 1941, with a single in four at-bats against the Chicago White Sox, and ended 56 games later on July 17 during a hot night in Cleveland. In 56 games, DiMaggio had gone to bat 223 times and delivered 91 hits, including 15 home runs, for a .408 average. He drew 21 walks, twice was hit by pitched balls, scored 56 runs, and knocked in 55. He hit in every game for two months, striking out just seven times. 
   But DiMaggio's game was so complete and elegant that statistics cannot do it justice. The New York Times said in an editorial when he retired, ``The combination of proficiency and exquisite grace which Joe DiMaggio brought to the art of playing center field was something no baseball averages can measure and that must be seen to be believed and appreciated.'' 
   Today, I join the Majority Leader and Senators CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY), BARBARA BOXER (D-CA), DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), and JIM H. BUNNING (R-KY) in introducing a resolution that honors Joe DiMaggio for his storied baseball career and for all that he has done off the field. As we reflect on his life and mourn his death, I ask that we consider ourselves extremely lucky for knowing such a man, particularly in this age of pampered sports heroes, when ego and self-importance often overshadow what is occurring on the field. Even I, who resented DiMaggio for displacing my hero Gehrig, have come to realize that there will never be another like Joseph Paul DiMaggio.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress to require the Department of Energy to return the journal Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg kept as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, who died on February 25 at the age of 86, was the co-discoverer of plutonium, and led a research team which created a total of nine elements, all of which are heavier than uranium. For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 which he shared with Dr. Edwin M. McMillan. 
   Dr. Seaborg kept a journal while chairman of the AEC. The journal consisted of a diary written at home each evening, correspondence, announcements, minutes, and the like. He was careful about classified matters; nothing was included that could not be made public, and the journal was reviewed by the AEC before his departure in 1971. Nevertheless, more than a decade after his departure from the AEC, the Department of Energy subjected two copies of Dr. Seaborg's journals--one of which it had borrowed--to a number of classification reviews. He came unannounced to my Senate office in September of 1997 to tell me of the problems he was having getting his journal released, saying it was something he wished to have resolved prior to his death. Although he has left us, it is fitting that his journal should finally be returned to his estate. This bill would do just that. I introduced a bill to return to Dr. Seaborg his journal in its original, unredacted form but to no avail, so bureaucracy triumphed. It was never returned. Now he has left us without having the satisfaction of resolving the fate of his journal. It is devastating that a man who gave so much of his life to his country was so outrageously treated by his own government.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to call the Senate's attention to works of an artist with whom we are all quite familiar. Constantino Brumidi is famous for having painted much of the fine murals here in the Capitol. What is not as yet known, however, is that his other major body of work, in fact the only other great body of work in the United States, is at the Our Lady of the Scapular & St. Stephen's Church (St. Stephen's) in New York City. Located on 29th Street and Third Avenue on Manhattan's East Side, St. Stephens is home to many Brumidi masterpieces, including a mural of the crucifixion which is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. At one time, St. Stephen's was home to the New York City Arch Diocese and the largest Catholic Church in New York. 
   Unfortunately, many of the paintings and murals have fallen into disrepair and are in need of restoration. The church has undertaken a campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete this task. I am hopeful that some government funds may be available as well, perhaps through the Save America's Treasures program. Our own Barbara Wolanin from the Architect of the Capitol's office is familiar with St. Stephen's and their efforts to preserve their collection of Brumidis. I invite my colleagues to visit St. Stephen's the next time they are in New York and see the other body of work by the artist we have all come to love.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, every year on March 10th we reflect on the plight of the Tibetan people. Forty years ago many Tibetan citizens gave their lives to defend their freedom and to prevent the Dalai Lama from being kidnaped by the Chinese army. For those who are committed to standing with the Tibetan people, it is a day to consider what can be done to lend support to Tibetan people, it is a day to consider what can be done to lend support to Tibetan aspirations. The United States Senate will mark the occasion by considering a resolution to mark this solemn occasion. 
   The United States Congress takes the position that Tibet is an occupied country whose true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile. The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), which has closely followed the situation in Tibet since the Dalai Lama was forced to flee into exile, and has published reports in 1959, 1960, 1964, and 1997. After examining Chinese policies in Tibet, it reported its findings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The 1960 report made the important international legal determination that ``Tibet demonstrated from 1913 to 1950 the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law.'' 
   Now the ICJ has returned to the issue of Tibet and produced another important report. It finds that repression in Tibet has increased since 1994. This is an assessment which my daughter Maura shares after having visited Tibet and having worked closely for many years with Tibetan refugees who continue to make the dangerous journey over the Himalayan mountains to flee persecution in their homeland. In 1996 she returned from Tibet to report that,  
   ..... in recent months Beijing's leaders have renewed their assault on Tibetan culture, especially Buddhism, with an alarming vehemence. The rhetoric and the methods of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have been resurrected--reincarnated, what you will--to shape an aggressive campaign to vilify the Dalai Lama.  
   The Dalai Lama, of course, remains unstained, but it is time for the Chinese to consider a policy of ``constructive engagement'' of their own--with the Tibetans. For many years now, the United States Congress has called on the People's Republic of China to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama or his representatives on a solution to the question of Tibet. Today we continue that message. This resolution declares March 10, 1999 as ``Tibetan National Day in solemn recognition of those Tibetans who sacrificed, suffered, or died as a result of Chinese aggression among their country.'' It also affirms the right of the Tibetan people to ``determine their own political future, including independence if they so determine.'' The government of the People's Republic of China should know that as the Tibetan people and His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet go forward on their journey toward freedom the Congress and the people of the United States stand with them.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues today in introducing the Credit for Voluntary Reductions Act of 1999. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
   The bill represents a far sighted effort to encourage early reductions of greenhouse gases. Under our program, companies in a wide range of industries may participate in a voluntary, market-based system of credit by making measurable reductions in greenhouse gases. 
   We have learned from our experience with implementing the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that the use of market-based incentives is the most cost-efficient, effective way to encourage corporate responsibility with respect to air emissions. Credit based systems have proven to effect emissions reductions which are larger than anticipated, at significantly lesser cost. The program laid out in our bill will remove market disincentives to taking action on greenhouse gas emissions and reward the initiative and innovation in the corporate sector. 
   My good friend Senator CHAFEE has highlighted today what is perhaps the most important issue facing any climate change legislation. While there is growing scientific certainty that human actions may eventually cause harmful disturbances to our climate system, no one is sure what may be done in the future to mitigate the effects of any atmospheric disruptions. The legislative and diplomatic proposals are myriad. Uncertainty over how climate change will be addressed, if at all, is a formidable hurdle to corporate actions which may begin to mitigate the problem. By simply establishing a system of credits which may be used at a later time to document emissions reductions, our bill begins to address this issue of uncertainty and provide incentives for positive action on emissions reductions. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this innovative legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support our efforts.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to see that the Senate passed S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, today. I introduced this bill with Senators CHRISTOPHER S. BOND, JOHN F. KERRY, ROBERT F. BENNETT, CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, and OLYMPIA SNOWE on January 27, 1999. S. 314 establishes a loan guarantee program to help small businesses prepare for the year 2000. Because our economy is interdependent, we must make sure that our small businesses are still up and running and providing services on January 1, 2000. This bill will help ensure that that is the case. 
   I began warning about the Y2K problem 3 years ago. Since that time, people have begun to listen and progress has been made on the Y2K front. The federal government and large corporations are expected to have their computers functioning on January 1, 2000. Good news indeed. But small businesses continue to lag behind in fixing the millennium problem. I am confident that the Readiness Act will help small businesses remediate their computer systems and I urge the House to consider it forthwith. There is no time to waste.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in the first instance to congratulate the chairman of our committee and his vice chairman for the extraordinary work they have done in less than a year. I make the point, it is a point of Senate procedure, that it is rare there is a chairman and vice chairman, not chairman and ranking member. This has been a wholly bipartisan effort from the first, and I think we can see that from the results in so brief a span. 
   The issue has been with us for some while, and it would be derelict of me not to mention that it was brought to my attention by a dear friend from New York, a financial analyst, John Westergaard, who began talking to me about the matter in 1995. On February 13 of 1996, I wrote to the Congressional Research Service to say: Well, now, what about this? Richard Nunno authored a report which the CRS sent to me on June 7 saying that ``the Y2K problem is indeed serious and that fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the Federal Government, as well as the private sector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, 2000.'' 
   I wrote the President, on July 31 of that year, to relay the findings of the CRS report and raise the issue generally. And, in time, a Presidential appointment was made to deal with this in the executive branch, to which I will return. But last spring--less than one year ago--the majority leader and the minority leader had the perception to appoint this gifted committee, with its exceptional staff, and now we have its report before us. 
   Two points, followed by a coda, if I may. Shortly after the committee s establishment, Senator BENNETT and I convened a field hearing--on July 6--in New York in the ceremonial chamber of the U.S. Federal Court House for the Southern District of New York at Foley Square. We found we were talking to the banks, the big, large, international banks in the city, and the stock exchange. And we found them well advanced in their preparations regarding this matter. 
   I think my colleague from Connecticut would agree. They were not only dealing with it in their own terms, they had gone to the Bank for International Settlements in Basel where a Joint Year 2000 Council had been established at our initiative. They were hard at work on their own problems. They were worried about others. 
   One witness told us that 49 Japanese banks planned to spend some $249 million as a group on Y2K compliance; 49 banks are thinking of spending in combination $249 million. Citicorp was planning $600 million, and it already expended a goodly share of that. 
   Indeed, it was not all our initiative, but certainly it was serendipitous, if I can use that term, that the security industry commenced massive testing just a week later--on July 13, 1998. The tests went very well. The industry was on to this subject. The point being, if you are on to this, you can handle it. It is those who aren't who will leave us in the greatest trouble. There will be another industry-wide test later this month. So much for private initiative. 
   We should be grateful for what we have learned, here and abroad. As the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Connecticut have made clear, there are countries that have understood this, as we have done, and are on top of this. But there are too many other countries that don't know the problem exists or might as well not. 
   As a sometime resident in India, I was interested to find that Indian enterprises, concentrated in the Bangalore area, are very much involved in doing the computer remediation. If you would like to know something about the world we live in, Mr. President, the work for the day is sent to them from San Francisco or New York or Chicago; they do it overnight, which is not overnight for them, it is the daytime, and it is back on our desks in the morning. It is that kind of world we live in. 
   Hence, to the second subject, which is the nuclear one. There is potential here for the kind of unintended disaster of an order we cannot describe in terms of medical care or financial statements or, for that matter, air travel at New Year's--which is to say that the failure of computer systems in Russia to give the correct information about early warning systems, such that 6,000 nuclear warheads still in Russia are not inadvertently launched. They could be, you know. They are in place--not all--but enough. A hundred would do. Three would be a calamity. Two were dropped on Japan and ended the Second World War. These are all huge weapons, far above the tonnage and of a different chemical composition than the early atomic bombs, as we have come to know them. 
   The Russians seem to know they have a problem--or they may have a problem. Or they don't know whether they do or they don't. In that situation, ``we didn't quite catch it'' could bring incomprehensible catastrophe just at the moment when we thought that long, dark half a century was ended, the half century that began in 1946, when the Soviets exploded their first nuclear device. 
   We have a danger here and we have an opportunity, and we ought to respond to the one and seize the other. We are given to understand that our Department of Defense officials have begun some negotiations, discussions in Moscow to invite a Russian team to Colorado Springs--where it happens our facilities in these regards are located--to let us watch each other's nuclear launches, nuclear alerts, false alarms. 
   We can think, Mr. President, that this was something behind us, surely a matter of passing. It wasn't. We have learned just recently that in 1983, one Soviet officer, a Stanislav Petrov, a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel, was in the Serpukhov-15 installation where the Soviet Union monitored its early warning satellites over the United States, and all of a sudden the lights began to flash ``Start,'' because the warning time is very short. 
   He made a decision on his own: they only supposed that they had picked up a launching; the equipment picked up five ICBMs. Mankind was spared by one lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Army who knew enough strategic doctrine to know that the United States would never launch five. It might launch 5,000. So as the information went up, by the nanoseconds, through the chain of command, it was decided not to launch a counterstrike.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest that we seek to reach an agreement for the Russians to come and bring with them all their codes and their classified communications modes, learn what our early warning system is, tell us what they will of theirs, perhaps be open about its own weaknesses, which are so great. These are the people who still have the fate of mankind in their hands, and they haven't been paid in 6 months. What they talk about, evidently, is the need for money. How in God's name we cannot provide it I fail to see. The maintenance of our nuclear system in the course of a half century cost $5.5 trillion. I sometimes forget this, but in my years on the Finance Committee, I have learned that a billion minutes ago, Saint Peter was just 30 years dead. A billion is a large number. A trillion is beyond our capacity. They are asking thousands of millions. Very little. 
   I hope Beijing might want to join. I would invite Islamabad and New Delhi, places which are unstable and have nuclear devices. Out of that, Mr. President, out of this immediate crisis, we might find a longrun institution or institutions--they need not be here, exclusively--they can be in many places--in which we would monitor one another's nuclear activity while, pray God, we develop it down, 
   and relearn the confidence-building measures that were so important in the cold war. That telephone between the Kremlin and the White House made more of a difference than we probably know. It is this kind of thing. 
   I note to my dear friends--and I will get complete agreement--this body has  known fewer persons with a greater understanding of the cold war than Senator Sam Nunn and the late Senator Henry Jackson who, in the early 1980s, brought up the concept of a joint early warning system. And then the MX was deployed, and we moved from essentially a deterrence position on nuclear matters, a second-strike, if you will, to a first-strike capacity, such that the Soviet systems had to be constantly alarmed. 
   Now, maybe that idea of Senators Nunn and Jackson will come, come at last. I would hope for two things. And I do not want to impose, and I do not want to presume, but I will do. This is not a time for too much delicacy. 
   I would hope that our chairman and vice chairman--I make that point: the Intelligence Committee and, I believe, the Ethics Committee have a chairman and vice chairman; all the rest is majority rule around here, which is fine, but this is bipartisan--if they might find it possible to visit Moscow and talk with members of the Duma there where the START II treaty, which we took all the 1980s to negotiate, lies unratified. And our plans for START III are, accordingly, on hold. They might go or they might invite--some action from the Congress, I think, is in order. And it would be no harm to point out to the Russian Government that they now have a legislative branch. And if it acts in ways that are not always agreeable to the executive, well, that is not an unknown phenomena. It has been going on for two centuries in the United States. It is an important and necessary initiative we ought to somehow pursue. 
   One final point. I hope my friends will not feel I am trespassing on their--our concerns, as I am a member and am honored to be a member of the committee--the Pentagon is too much disposed to discuss this matter in secret session. This is a time for more openness. This is a time the American people can be trusted with information which the Russian authorities already have. 
   One of the phenomenons of the cultural secrecy which has developed over the last century is that the U.S. Government is continuing to keep information from us which our adversaries know perfectly well. It is only we who do not know. This has done a perceptible harm to American democracy. We have no idea how distant it is from the beginning of the century when Woodrow Wilson could proclaim, as a condition of peace to conclude the First World War, ``open covenants openly arrived at.'' 
   Now, mind you, that same President Wilson, to whom I am devoted, in the day after he asked for a declaration of war, he sent a series of 17 bills, which were rolled together and called the Espionage Act. It provided for prior restraint, as lawyers call it, censorship of the press. First Henry Lodge, on this floor, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``Yes, I think that is a good idea.'' The next day he came back and said, ``You know, I don't think it's a good idea. The press should be free in this country.'' 
   President Wilson wrote the bill manager on the House side, and said, ``Please keep it.'' It was not kept. But it was assumed it was kept, so much so that when the Pentagon Papers were released, the executive branch of our Government just assumed that was a crime and proceeded to prevent their publication and find out more about the person who had released them. And the next thing you know, we had an impeachment hearing in the Federal Government--a crisis that all grew out of secrecy and presumptions of secrecy. 
   I would hope--I doubt there is anybody in the Pentagon listening, but I see the chairman and vice chairman listening--I would hope they would say we could have an open briefing. The American people will respond intelligently to dangers of which they are appropriately apprised. And this surely is one. 
   But, sir, I have spoken sufficiently. I beg to say one last thing. On the House side, our colleague and friend, Representative STEPHEN HORN of California, has been very active producing ``report cards'' on the status of the different departments of the Government and keeping it up regularly. As the Senator from Connecticut observed, the Social Security Administration got A's all along. Others have not. 
   It would not be a bad idea for the chairmen and ranking members of our standing committees to review Representative HORN's report cards and keep an eye on the departments that report to them. 
   Other than that, I think I have spoken long enough. I do not think, however, I have sufficiently expressed my admiration and at times awe of the performance of our chairman and vice chairman. The Senate is grateful, is in their debt. So is the Nation. The Nation need not know that; it just needs to pay attention to their message, sir. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators GRAHAM, ROTH and GRASSLEY in introducing this legislation--the Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999. It is a modest modification providing an enormous protection for nursing home residents. 
   The situation today is as follows. Frail elderly individuals who require nursing home care are faced with costs of $40,000 to $50,000 on average per year. These sums quickly deplete family savings. As a result, about two-thirds of nursing home residents at some point spend down their assets and require the assistance of Medicaid coverage. Because Medicaid typically has low reimbursement rates, nursing homes, in turn, must carefully balance their finances by screening which patients to accept, limiting the number of Medicaid residents. When nursing homes can no longer operate with low Medicaid rates, they may choose to reduce the number of beds available for Medicaid residents or no longer participate in the Medicaid program altogether. 
   What, then, happens to the residents who depend on Medicaid to cover their nursing home costs? The Wall Street Journal first reported on April 7 of last year what has occurred: Vencor Inc., with the nation's largest nursing home chain of 310 facilities, decided to withdraw participation in the Medicaid program. Residents covered by Medicaid were so notified and told they would have to leave the nursing homes--their homes. 
   Industry analysts had predicted that some other companies may follow Vencor's lead in jettisoning Medicaid residents. For example, Renaissance Healthcare Corp. withdrew from Medicaid the year before due to rising expenses. 
   The evictions in Vencor's Indiana and Florida nursing homes caused panic among residents and their families, and aggravated some patients' frail medical conditions. In all, it was a wrenching experience for residents and their families. 
   Our legislation is a small modification amid an otherwise larger problem. The bill would merely protect current Medicaid residents in nursing homes from evictions if their nursing home decides to withdraw from the Medicaid program. Nursing homes will be able to continue to screen patients for acceptance into their facility. The screening process is quite sophisticated and includes collection of information about assets and income to determine when the individual will likely spend down his or her resources before requiring Medicaid coverage. 
   The larger dilemma still exists. We need a system that both covers our frail elderly in nursing homes after they spend themselves into poverty due to nursing home costs and ensures that nursing homes can stay in business in order to provide such services. 
   Momentum is moving behind this legislation. Our bill enjoys bipartisan support in Congress as well as support from the nursing home industry and advocates. On the Senate side, we introduce this bill today with a total of 15 sponsors. Last week, the House Commerce Subcommittee on Health and Environment held a hearing on this legislation. Chairman ROTH and I are committed to marking up this bill in our Committee in the near future. I commend Senator GRAHAM for his leadership in initiating this proposal, and urge its early adoption.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a pioneering scientist and a great American, Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, who died on February 25 at the age of 86. Although a chemist by training, Dr. Seaborg is best remembered for his contributions to nuclear physics. Dr. Seaborg was the co-discoverer of plutonium, and led a research team which created a total of nine elements, all of which are heavier than uranium. For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 which he shared with Dr. Edwin M. McMillan. 
   In 1942, as a member of the Manhattan Project, Dr. Seaborg was assigned to a laboratory at the University of Chicago. There he headed a unit that worked to isolate plutonium from uranium--the fuel used in the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. After the war ended, Dr. Seaborg returned to the University of California at Berkeley until 1961, when, at the request of President John F. Kennedy, he became chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). It was a position he held for ten years, spanning three administrations. Dr. Seaborg was the first scientist to direct the Commission. It was in this capacity that Dr. Seaborg acted as an advisor to the U.S. negotiator, Averell Harriman, in talks that led to the Limited Test Ban Treaty and was an advocate for the peaceful use of atomic energy. 
   Dr. Seaborg kept a journal while chairman of the AEC. The journal consisted of a diary written at home each evening, correspondence, announcements, minutes, and the like. He was careful about classified matters; nothing was included that could not be made public, and the journal was reviewed by the AEC before his departure in 1971. Nevertheless, more than a decade after his departure from the AEC, the Department of Energy subjected two copies of Dr. Seaborg's journals--one of which it had borrowed--to a number of classification reviews. He came unannounced to my Senate office in September of 1997 to tell me of the problems he was having getting his journal released, saying it was something he wished to have resolved prior to his death. I introduced a bill to return to Dr. Seaborg his journal in its original, unredacted form but to no avail, so bureaucracy triumphed. It was never returned. Now he has left us without having the satisfaction of resolving the fate of his journal. It is devastating that a man who gave so much of his life to his country was so outrageously treated by his own government. 
   Dr. Seaborg continued to lead a productive life until the very end. After his tenure as chairman of the AEC, Dr. Seaborg returned to the University of California at Berkeley where he was a University Professor--the highest academic distinction--and later a professor in the university's graduate school of education as a result of his concern about the quality of science education. He was the director of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and until his death its director emeritus. 
   And there were well deserved accolades. In 1991 Dr. Seaborg was awarded the nation's highest award for scientific achievement, the National Medal of Science. In 1997 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry named an element after a living person for the first time. Thus element 106 became Seaborgium (Sg), and Dr. Seaborg was immortalized as a permanent part of the periodic table to which he had already added so much. 
   So today I remember Dr. Seaborg for his contributions to nuclear physics, and I salute him for his service as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. Dr. Seaborg's family is in my prayers at this time of great loss; his wife of 57 years, Helen, and five of their six children: Lynne Annette Seaborg, Cobb, David Seaborg, Stephen Seaborg, John Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Karole Seaborg. Their son Peter Glenn Seaborg died in May of 1997.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise briefly to state my support for the amendment offered by my distinguished friend and fellow member of the Committee on Finance and simply to inform the Senate that the figures he gave amounting to $17.9 billion over a 10-year period have been formally provided to the Committee on Finance by the Joint Committee on Taxation. These are the final arbiters of our calculations in tax matters. So we are talking about real revenue which we can get simply by passing legislation, which we have already passed, and all of which has been proposed by the President's budget at one point or another. 
   Characteristically, Senator GRAHAM has had the good sense to advance an elemental but important proposition: this bill ought to be paid for. As Senator GRAHAM argued a short while ago, it would be a shame if the first bill passed by the Senate in the 106th Congress were to commence a reversal of the fiscal discipline that produced the first Federal budget surplus in three decades. 
   Perhaps memory is beginning to fail us. Thankfully, this Senator can still recall standing on this floor in 1993, during debate on the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of that year. It was not easy getting that great deficit reduction measure enacted, but it was the right thing to do. Its cumulative deficit reduction effect was some $1.2 trillion over five years--twice what we expected when it was enacted. 
   We did the right thing then, and the right thing to do today is what the Senator from Florida has proposed. The offsets in his amendment are straightforward and ought to be non-controversial. The first would extend Superfund taxes; the second would reduce the carryback period for the foreign tax credit (a measure that passed the Senate in 1997 and again in 1998), and the third would reinstate the oil spill excise tax--which wants to be done in any event. All told these offsets total about $17 billion, enough to fully offset the costs of the bill. 
   We grant that adoption of this amendment would create procedural difficulties, but surely these can be overcome on a piece of legislation that enjoys such broad support. In any event what is important here is the principle. I thank the Senator from Florida for pointing it out to us. 
   I thank the Chair, my friend, and the managers for allowing this intervention.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, among the paintings hanging in the Blue Room of New York's City Hall is a full-length portrait of General Lafayette by Samuel F. B. Morse. The father of the telegraph (and noted member of the anti-Catholic ``Know-Nothings''), began his career as a portrait artist. For his commission, Morse received $100 and earned a reputation as a gifted painter. Before turning to invention, he would paint the portraits of a galaxy of New York worthies. 
   The subject of one such portrait is known to opera lovers the world over--Lorenzo Da Ponte. He was, of course, the librettist of Mozart's masterpieces Don Giovanni, Nozze di Figaro, and Cosi Fan Tutte. What makes his life especially intriguing to an American is his career in New York. In a preface to a 1959 edition of his Memoirs (first published in 1830) THOMAS G. Bergin observes  
   By tradition, education, and experience, this European sophisticate would seem to be far removed from the American Psyche; but his deeper nature--eager, adventurous and basically evangelical--was well-adapted to the New World.  
   Born March 10, 1749 in Ceneda, Italy, now Vittorio Veneto, Da Ponte arrived in New York in 1805 in his middle years and with what might seem to be his greatest work already behind him. Upon coming ashore, he was the self-proclaimed ``poet of the Emperor Joseph II, for Salieri, for Storace, for Mozart!'' He found work as a grocer on the Bowery, that great stretch of Manhattan teeming with all the varieties of 19th Century life. He soon fell in with the young Clement Clark Moore, founder of the General Theological Seminary and the (long anonymous) author of The Night Before Christmas. The two shared a love of language and books. Moore, amazed by Da Ponte's brilliance, introduced his friend to a literary group at Columbia College, of which he was a trustee. The group included the future Congressman Gulian Verplank. In time Da Ponte would become a major figure in New York society, dining with Livingstons, Hamiltons, Onderdoncks and the like. He became a professor of Italian, donated the first volume of Italian literature to the New York Public Library, and, with the help of his friends at Columbia, founded the Italian Opera. Don Giovanni was performed at the Park Theater in May 1826 and it may be said New York has never been the same. 
   The scholar Arthur Livingston observes, ``There is no doubt all this was an important moment for the American mind. Da Ponte made Europe, poetry, painting, music, the artistic spirit, classical lore, a creative classical education, live for many important Americans as no one had done before.'' 
   In 1838, his last year on earth, he was given absolution by John MacCloskey, New York's second Archbishop and America's first Cardinal. He died on August 17. Three days later, at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral at Mott and Prince Streets, he was honored with a ``hero's burial'' before a large and distinguished funeral party. As one account has it:  
   Da Ponte was buried, probably in the tomb of a friend, to await reburial and a headstone at a later date. As far as is known, the reburial never took place, and the headstone was not installed. The overcrowded cemetery was closed in 1848, and all of its records (including Da Ponte's) were destroyed when Old St. Patrick's was gutted by fire eighteen years later. ..... Between 1909 and 1915, all the bodies were disinterred and moved, with or without identification, to Calvary Cemetery in Queens.  
   And so, like Mozart, Da Ponte came to rest in an unmarked grave. 
   This year provides an opportunity to rectify, at least in part, this sad and resonant ending. This seems a wondrous time to celebrate perhaps by some memorial in Old St. Patrick's, surely by performing Mozart's Requiem, K.626, composed in 1791. 
   After his death, the New York Daily Express recorded:   
   Signor Da Ponte came to America, where he has resided 32 years, chiefly in this city; and to his indefatigable exertions, commanding talents, and profound literary attainments, are we mainly indebted for the taste everywhere diffused on our country for the music and language of his native land. He has been the Cadmas to whom we owe an unpayable debt for these inappreciable gifts.  
   We are in his debt to this day, and surely 1999 is year to acknowledge it.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I speak to the matter of prudence. Charles L. Black, Jr. begins his masterful account Impeachment: A Handbook with a warning: ``Everyone must shrink from this most drastic of measures. . . . [t]his awful step.'' 
   For it is just that. The drafters of the American Constitution had, from England and from Colonial government, fully formed models of what a legislature should be, what a judiciary should do. But nowhere on earth was there a nation with an elected head of an executive branch of government. 
   Here they turned to an understanding of governance which marks the American Constitution as a signal event in human history--what the Framers called ``the new science of politics.'' What we might term the intellectual revolution of 1787. The victors in the Revolution could agree that no one, or not many, wanted another monarchy in line with the long melancholy succession since Rome. Yet given what Madison termed ``the fugitive and turbulent existence of . . . ancient republics,'' who could dare to suggest that a modern republic could hope for anything better? 
   Madison could. And why? Because study had produced new knowledge, which could now be put to use. This great new claim rested upon a new and aggressively more ``realistic'' idea of human nature. Ancient and medieval thought and practice were said to have failed disastrously by clinging to illusions regarding how men ought to be. Instead, the new science would take man as he actually is, would accept as primary in his nature the self-interestedness and passion displayed by all men everywhere and, precisely on that basis, would work out decent political solutions. 
   This was a declaration of intellectual independence equal to anything asserted in 1776. Until then, with but few exceptions, the whole of political thought had turned on ways to inculcate virtue in a small class that would govern. But, wrote Madison, ``If men were angels, no government would be necessary.'' We would have to work with the material at hand. Not pretty, but something more important: predictable. Thus, men could be relied upon to be selfish; nay, rapacious. Very well: ``Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'' Whereupon we derive the central principle of the Constitution, the various devices which in Madison's formulation offset ``by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives.'' 
   Impeachment was to be the device whereby the Congress might counteract the ``defect of better motives'' in a President. But any such behavior needed to be massive and immediately threatening to the state for impeachment ever to go forward. Otherwise a quadrennial election would serve to restitute wrongs. 
   Further, they had a model for this process in the impeachment of Warren Hastings which had begun in April of 1786 with Edmund Burke presenting twenty-two ``Articles of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The debate in the House of 
   Commons continued into 1787 and was reported in the Pennsylvania Gazette. 
   Burke was hardly a stranger to the Americans at Philadelphia. He had championed the cause of the American colonies during the Revolution, and was now doing much the same as regards the governance of British India. He accused the Governor General of the highest crimes possible against, inter alia, the peoples of India. 
   At Philadelphia, the standard for impeachment was discussed only once--on Saturday, September 8, 1787. At that point in the convention, the draft of the clause in the Constitution pertaining to impeachment referred only to ``treason and bribery.'' 
   Here are Madison's notes of the debate that day:  
   The clause referring to the Senate, the trial of impeachments against the President, for Treason & bribery, was taken up. 
   Col. MASON. Why is the provision restrained to Treason & bribery only? Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach many great and dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be Treason as above defined. As bills of attainder which have saved the British Constitution are forbidden, it is the more necessary to extend: the power of impeachments. He mov.d to add after ``bribery'' ``or maladministration.'' Mr. GERRY seconded him. 
   Mr. MADISON So vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that is aimed at averting much of what has happened over nearly two months of this year and all of the last by amending Title 28 of the United States Code. Modeled on our existing Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940 that forbids civil lawsuits being filed by or against our men and women while they are in uniform, my bill seeks to protect future sitting Presidents from the ravages of civil litigation arising from acts taken or deeds done before they assumed office. 
   I do not do this to insulate our current President but to accept an invitation Justice Stevens and his colleagues extended to us nearly two years ago in the case of Jones versus Clinton when the Supreme Court held that a sitting President could be sued civilly for acts he allegedly committed before assuming office. In that opinion, Justice Stevens wrote that it was up to Congress,  not the Supreme Court, to afford a sitting President more protection from civil lawsuits. 
   But this bill is not about President Clinton. For as Edmund Burke observed when analyzing the causes of the political discontents of the 1760s in England ``this system has not arisen soley from the ambitions of Lord Butte.......we should have been tried with it if the Earl of Butte had never existed.'' 
   As Justice Robert Jackson pointed out over forty years ago, the Presidency concentrates this nation's Executive authority in a single person whose choice the entire nation has a part, making him the force of public hope and expectations and whose decisions so far overshadow any other that ``almost alone he fills the public eye and ear.'' The Founders fashioned this kind of Presidency because they wanted to focus, not spread, executive responsibility in the hands of a single, constitutionally indispensable, individual. They realized that any interference with a President's ability to carry out his public responsibilities is constitutionally equal to interfering with the ability of the entire Congress or the whole Judiciary to carry out their public obligations. 
   Moreover, the Presidency is the only office that the Constitution requires to be always functioning. It knows no recesses or terms. Because of this and the singular import of a President's duties, the diversion of his energies by litigation raises unique risks to the effective functioning of our government. 
   As Thomas Jefferson warned in a June 20, 1807, letter to George Hay in the midst of Aaron Burr's trial in Richmond, unfettered litigation can pull a sitting President from pillar to post and keep him constantly trudging from north to south and east to west, withdrawing him from his constitutional duties. 
   On the other hand, I do not believe in the ancient prerogatives of the monarchs who asserted ``the King can do no wrong.'' We rejected this when we formed our republic over 200 years ago. Under my bill, a litigant can still file his or her claim and exercise his or her discovery rights. This will preserve the litigant's claims and evidence but stay his or her ability to conduct a full-blown trial. This can be done after a sitting President leaves office. Then, like any other citizen, he will be subject to the full sway of our courts and their processes. 
   I do not want to truncate anyone's legal rights or privileges, and my bill does not do so. Rather, it aims to balance these rights with our country's vital need for a focused Chief Executive not being dragged from pillar to post.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my friend and colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, a bill to allow the use of sampling in determining the populations of the states for use in reapportionment. The Supreme Court has ruled that the 1976 amendments to the Census Act do not permit sampling in determining these populations. We believe sampling is vital to achieving the goal of the most accurate census possible, and to a fair and accurate redistricting. 
   The Bureau of the Census proposes to count each census tract by mail and then by sending out enumerators until they have responses for 90 percent of the addresses. The Bureau proposes to then use sampling to infer who lives at the remaining ten percent of addresses in each tract based on what they know of the 90 percent. This would provide a more accurate census then we get by repeatedly sending enumerators to hard-to-count locations and would save $500 million or more in personnel costs. 
   The Census plan is supported by the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, which was directed by Congress in 1992 to study ways to achieve the most accurate population count possible. The NRC report finds that the Bureau should ``make a good faith effort to count everyone, but then truncate physical enumeration after a reasonable effort to reach nonrespondents. The number and character of the remaining nonrespondents should then be estimated through sampling.'' 
   Mr. President, the taking of a census goes back centuries. 
   I quote from the King James version of the Bible, chapter two of Luke: ``And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed (or enrolled, according to the footnote) *.*.* And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city.'' The early censuses were taken to enable the rule or ruling government to tax or raise an army. 
   The first census for more sociological reasons was taken in Nuremberg, in 1449. So it was not a new idea to the Founding Fathers when they wrote it into the Constitution to facilitate fair taxation and accurate apportionment of the House of Representatives, the latter of which was the foundation of the Great Compromise that has served us well ever since. 
   The Constitution says in Article I, Section 2:  
   Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years of the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall direct by law.  
   Those who cite this as saying the Constitution requires an ``actual enumeration'' should consider whether the phrase is being taken out of context. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of sampling. Rather the Court has ruled on the census laws last amended in 1976. 
   I also note that we have not taken an ``actual enumeration'' the way the Founding Fathers envisioned since 1960, after which enumerators going to every door were replaced with mail-in responses. The Constitution provides for a postal system, but did not direct that the census be taken by mail. Yet we do it that way. Why not sample if that is a further improvement? 
   Sampling would go far toward correcting one of the most serious flaws in the census, the undercount. Statistical work in the 1940's demonstrated that we can estimate how many people the census misses. The estimate for 1940 was 5.4 percent of the population. After decreasing steadily to 1.2 percent in 1980, the 1990 undercount increased to 1.8 percent, or more than four million people. 
   More significantly, the undercount is not distributed evenly. The differential undercount, as it is known, of minorities was 5.7 percent for Blacks, 5.0 percent for Hispanics, 2.3 percent for Asian-Pacific Islanders, and 4.5 percent for Native Americans, compared with 1.2 percent for non-Hispanic whites. The difference between the black and non-black undercount was the largest since 1940. By disproportionately missing minorities, we deprive them of equal representation in Congress and of proportionate funding from Federal programs based on population. The Census Bureau estimates that the total undercount will reach 1.9 percent in 2000 if the 1990 methods are used instead of sampling. 
   Mr. President, I have some history with the undercount

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues Senators ROTH, KENNEDY and JEFFORDS to introduce The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill would address some of the barriers and disincentives that individuals enrolled in Federal disability programs face in returning to work. 
   Many persons with disabilities need the health coverage that accompanies their eligibility for cash benefits. (Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries are also covered under Medicare. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries receive Medicaid coverage). Disability is determined based on an inability to sustain gainful work activity, which is measured by an earned income threshold. Under current law, as they return to work and earn income, beneficiaries lose their cash benefits and, subsequently, their health coverage. The risk of losing health benefits may deter disabled individuals from returning to work and, instead, encourage them to  continue to receive cash benefits despite their ability to work. 
   Less than one percent of SSDI and SSI beneficiaries leave the programs and return to work each year. A survey released by the National Organization on Disability showed that, currently, only 29 percent of all disabled adults are employed full-time or part-time, compared to 79 percent of the non-disabled adult population.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Committee on Small Business and the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem--CHRISTOPHER S. BOND, JOHN F. KERRY, ROBERT F. BENNETT, and CHRISTOPHER J. DODD,--and Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE--in introducing the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. I began warning about the Y2K problem three years ago. Since that time, people have begun to listen and progress has been made on the Y2K front. The Federal Government and large corporations are expected to have their computers functioning on January 1, 2000. Good news indeed. But small businesses and state and local governments are lagging behind in fixing the millennium computer problem. 
   Last week, Chairman BENNETT, Senator DODD, and I introduced the Y2K State and Local Government Assistance Programs Act of 1999. This bill provides a matching grant for states to work on the millennium computer problem. Failure of state computers could have a devastating effect on those individuals who rely on essential state-administered poverty programs, such as Medicaid, food stamps, and child welfare and support. These individuals cannot go a day, a week, or a month if these programs are not working properly. Similarly, the collapse of small businesses' computer systems could have the same paralyzing effect on society as a collapse of state and local government's computer systems. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, which we are introducing today, will assist small businesses in preparing for the year 2000. It expands the Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program to provide guaranteed loans to small businesses to address the Y2K problem. This bill raises the government guaranties of the existing 7(a) program by ten percent. For Y2K 7(a) loans of more than $100,000, the government will guarantee 85 percent, and for such loans of $100,000 or less, the government will guarantee 90 percent. The increase in the loan guarantee is to encourage lenders to make Y2K-related loans to small businesses. And the numbers show that small businesses need a great deal of assistance.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at a time when we risk the ever coarsening of our pubic affairs, we would do well to remember a man whose service to this country was distinguished as no other for civility and elegance. I ask that this tribute to Clark M. Clifford by Sander Vanocur be printed in the RECORD. 
   The tribute follows 
   Tribute to Clark Clifford  
   The following anonymous poem was sent to Clark Clifford's daughters, Joyce and Randall, by their sister, Faith, who could not be here today: 
 Think of stepping on shore  and finding it Heaven, Of taking hold of a hand  and finding it God's, Of breathing new air, 
    and finding its celestial air, Of feeling invigorated  and finding it immortality, Of passing from storm and tempest  to an unbroken calm, Of waking up,  and finding it Home.  
   In the secular sense, Clark Clifford found that home in Washington more than fifty years ago. And having found that home, let it be said that while he was here, he graced this place.
   It was a much different place when he and Marny came here, smaller in size but larger in imagination, made larger in imagination by World War II. It may have been, then and for a good time after, as John F. Kennedy once noted, a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm. But it was also at least then, a place where dreams could be fashioned into reality. Being an intensely political city, dreams, as always, had to be fashioned by reality. And it was in this art of political compromise where Clark Clifford flourished. He was known as the consummate Washington insider. Quite often the term was used in the pejorative sense. It should not have been. If you believe as he did in what George Orwell meant when he wrote that in the end everything is political, it should be a cause for celebration rather than lamentation that he played the role, for if he had not played this role who else of his generation could have played it quite so well, especially when the time came to tell a President of the United States, who was also a very old friend, that the national interests of this nation could no longer be served by our continuing involvement in Vietnam? 
   We know of his public triumphs. Some of use also know of his personal kindnesses. Many years ago, at a very bleak period in both my personal and professional life--you know in this city it is bleak when your phone calls are not returned by people you have known for years--there were two individuals in this city who faithfully returned my calls. One was Ben Bradlee. The other was Clark Clifford. When Clark first invited me to his office during this bleak period to offer encouragement and guidance, he closed the door, took no phone calls, sat behind his desk, his hands forming the legendary steeple and listened and advised. On that first visit to his office I looked down on his desk where there appeared to be at least fifty messages, topped by what seemed to be inaugural medallions. I thought to myself on that first visit that Clark Clifford had put the world on hold just to listen to me. But the third time I came to his office, it occurred to me that it was just possible those messages had been there for twenty years. 
   Clark Clifford's final years were not what he would have wished for himself nor what his friends would have wished for him and for his family. They seemed to echo the first lines in Chapter Nine of Henry Adam's novel ``Democracy,'' perhaps the best novel ever written about this city. The lines are: ``Whenever a man reaches to the top of the political ladder, his enemies unite to pull him down. His friends become critical and exacting.'' On this occasion, I cannot speak of this enemies, but I can say that his friends will not be critical or exacting. We will think, instead, of Othello's words just before he dies:  
   ``Soft you; a word or two before you go. 
   ``I have done the state some service, and they know it-- 
   ``No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, 
   ``When you shall these unlucky deeds relate. 
   ``Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate. 
   ``Nor set down aught in malice.''  
   We who loved Clark Clifford will do that and more. We will say now and henceforth: Clark Clifford did the state some service and we know it.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with bittersweet feelings to pay tribute to a dear friend, Leo Cherne. Leo died on January 12, 1999 at the age of 86. What a huge loss we mourn, but what an exemplary life we commemorate. Indeed, I think it safe to say Leo Cherne's life helped to redeem the 20th century. 
   I met Leo in 1954 when I became director of public relations for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Leo, an enormously successful lawyer, economist, and businessman, had become chairman of the IRC in 1951 (after joining the board of directors in 1946). He took over for Reinhold Niebuhr, one of this century's greatest theologians. Leo served as chairman for over forty years. Then, indefatigable as he was, he served as chairman emeritus until his death. 
   Under Leo's stewardship, the IRC grew into the largest refugee relief and resettlement organization in the world. His commitment to refugees and human rights was steadfast, and made a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of forsaken people over the last half century. I guess he took to heart Niebuhr's observation that ``Life has no meaning except in terms of responsibility.'' 
   Leo co-founded the Research Institute of America in 1936; it grew out of his efforts to advise businessmen on how to comply with the new Social Security law. He served as its executive director for approximately 50 years. At the end of World War II he accompanied General Douglas MacArthur to Japan to assist with economic recovery there. In 1953, Leo--a fierce anti-Communist--excoriated Senator Joseph McCarthy for his demagoguery and disregard for civil rights. In 1956, when Soviet tanks rumbled into Budapest to crush the Hungarian uprising, Leo was at the border to help desperate Hungarians flee their country, and to bear witness. He advised presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush. He served as a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 1973 to 1991. 
   In 1984, President Reagan conferred upon Leo the highest award a civilian can receive: the United States Medal of Freedom. President Reagan's citation stated,  
   Since the 1930s, Leo Cherne has stepped forward with brilliance, energy and moral passion, and helped this nation overcome countless challenges. His lifetime devotion to aiding his country and to serving the cause of human freedom, especially through his work on behalf of refugees, reflects the strong and generous character of a man who deserves the respect and gratitude of all Americans.  
   In 1989 Elie Wiesel nominated Leo for the Nobel Peace Prize; he deserved that too. He did receive France's Legion of Honor award, Germany's Commander Cross, and the United Nations' Gold Medal of Peace. 
   All the while he was an accomplished sculptor! His bust of Abraham Lincoln was in the White House. His bust of Eleanor Roosevelt is in the White House. His bust of John Kennedy is in the Berlin square Kennedy made famous with his ``Ich Bin Ein Berliner'' speech. One bust, of Robert Frost, resides in the Department of the Interior, while another, of Albert Schweitzer, is in the Smithsonian. 
   How fondly I recall, when I was with the IRC, the evenings Leo and I would spend at the White Horse Tavern after work! We recited the poem Dylan Thomas wrote to his father, who was dying, ``Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night'':  
   Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night 
 Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
 Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. 
 Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
 Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. 
 Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
 And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
   Leo did not ``go gentle into that good night.'' He fought pronounced illnesses for many years while he continued to live a productive life. He raged against the ``dying of the light'' with the same tenacity he showed fighting totalitarianism as one of our very best ``Cold Warriors''. 
   My wife, Liz, and I miss Leo dearly. Leo is survived by his his brother, Jack Cherne, and by his daughter, Gail Gambino, and his granddaughter Erica Lynn Gambino. All are in our thoughts and prayers. The contributions he made to society cannot be overstated and are not likely to be duplicated. He was a giant among men.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep gratitude to a constituent, Michael O'Hurley-Pitts, for his distinguished record of public service and to wish him well as he ventures North to Toronto in pursuit of new challenges and opportunities. 
   As a young man, Michael served admirably as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division and as an Airborne Ranger with the 1st Battalion (RANGER), 75th Infantry. No ordinary soldier, Michael was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal for Valor in combat and received numerous awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Achievement Medal with Three Oak Leaf Clusters. 
   Following his tenure in the military, Michael continued to devote himself to the service of others. He became the Executive Director of the Children's Rights Council, contributed to parenting education programs in Washington DC, and championed the cause of peace and justice in his native-born Ireland. He also came to Capitol Hill, where he established himself as a respected congressional aide and counsel. 
   It was through his work on behalf of two venerable New York institutions, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral and St. Patrick's Old Cathedral School, that I first learned of Michael's talents and commitment to public service. As St. Patrick's Old Cathedral Development Officer, Michael has been hugely successful in ensuring that its rich history is preserved and that the School's tradition of excellence continues into its third century. 
   Saturday, January 16, 1999, marked the culmination of those efforts--a grand celebration of the famed Irish Brigade soldiers of the Civil War, many of whom were immigrants and first-generation Irish-American parishioners of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral. The event included a Requiem Mass, a reenactment of their 1861 march to join Union forces, and a benefit concert by Irish legend Tommy Makem to be broadcast to a national audience by PBS on St. Patrick's Day weekend. While detained and unable to attend as I had hoped, I have learned that the celebration was magnificent and that there is strong interest in making it an annual event. Mission accomplished. 
   I was saddened to hear that New York will soon lose the gifts of Michael O'Hurley-Pitts, but I wish him the best as he prepares for new challenges in Canada. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague, Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska, in reintroducing legislation that would preserve Social Security and make it solvent permanently, while providing a  payroll tax cut of about $800 billion over the next ten years. 
   Last March, Senator KERREY and I introduced a nearly identical bill--S. 1792, The Social Security Solvency Act of 1998. And in July of 1998 Senators GREGG and BREAUX introduced S. 2313, The 21st Century Retirement Security Plan, with a companion bill introduced in the House by Congressmen KOBLE and STENHOLM. All of these bills attempt to steer a mid-course between those who seek to maintain the current system (albeit with some traditional modifications of payroll tax rates and benefits) and those who seek to replace Social Security with private accounts. The Moynihan/Kerrey and Gregg/Breaux/Koble/Stenholm bills are quite similar. In September of last year I, along with Senators GREGG, BREAUX, KERREY, COATS, ROBB, THOMAS, and THOMPSON formed a Bipartisan Social Security Coalition. In a ``Dear Colleague'' we argued that a number of principles have guided us in our efforts to build a consensus on the future of Social Security including: 
   A payroll tax cut for all working Americans, with an opportunity for all workers to invest in personal savings account; Payroll tax rates set so that annual revenues closely match annual outlays throughout the actuarial valuation period; A progressive benefit formula; Accurate cost-of-living adjustments; Repeal of the earnings test so that beneficiaries are free to work while collecting benefits; and Permanent solvency for the Social Security program with a reduction in the Federal Government's unfunded liabilities. 
   For those who care, as we do, about preserving this vital program, I would simply suggest that without these changes, Social Security as we know it will not survive. For some 20 years now, opinion polls have shown that a majority of non-retired adults do not believe they will get their Social Security when they retire. Ask anyone on the street; ask anyone in their thirties or forties. They are convinced that Social Security will not be there for them. In one sense, they 
   have good reason to think so: the Social Security Trustees so state in their most recent annual report released in April, 1998, which pointedly notes that:  
   *.*.*.in 2034, tax income of OASI (Social Security) is estimated to be sufficient to pay about 3/4 of program costs; that ratio is projected to decline to about 2/3 by the end of the projection period.  
   Lack of confidence is partially the result of neglect by a Social Security Administration that has made little effort to stay in touch with Americans before retirement. But there is also a more powerful influence at work: a serious ideological movement opposed to government social insurance as a threat to individual initiative and, indeed, liberty. There is now abroad a powerful set of distinguished political leaders and academics who would turn the 60-year-old system of Social Security retirement, disability, and survivors benefits over to a system that depends solely on personal savings invested in the market. 
   This is a legitimate idea, with respectable intellectual support. (One thinks of the energetic work of Martin Feldstein, who 20 years ago argued that ``Social Security significantly depresses private wealth accumulation.'') It is an idea that has gained world-wide recognition. Since 1988, workers in the United Kingdom had been permitted to opt out of a part of the Social Security system, if they sign up for some personal retirement savings plans similar to our IRAs or 401(k) arrangements. In Sweden, the model welfare state, a pension reform plan that includes a mandatory private pension component equal to 2.5 percent of earnings went into effect this year, after being enacted by a coalition government composed of Social Democrats and other left of center parties. 
   As the 1990s arrived, and with it the long stock market boom, the call for privatization of Social Security has all but drowned out the more traditional views. For the first time, something akin to abolishing Social Security becamer a possibility. 
   Don't think it couldn't happen. In 1996, we enacted legislation which abolished Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The mothers' pension of the progressive era, incorporated in the 1935 legislation, vanished with scarcely a word of protest. 
   Will the Old Age pensions and survivors benefits disappear as well? What might once have seemed inconceivable is now somewhere between possible and probable. I, for one, hope that this will not happen. A minimum retirement guarantee, along with disability and survivors benefits, is surely something we ought to keep, even as we augment the basic guarantee--as both the U.K and Sweden have done--with some form of private accounts. 
   Here is what Senator BOB KERREY and I proposed, in the legislation that we are reintroducing today. 
   Our bill makes changes that will preserve Social Security and make it solvent indefinitely. Under our plan, private accounts would complement Social Security, not replace it. Markets go up, but they also, as we made painfully clear last summer, frequently go down. But even with fluctuations in markets there are ways to safeguard private accounts. Working with the Securities and Exchange Commission and those in the securities industry we believe that it is possible to provide private savings instruments that meet the needs of workers planning for their retirement, and that are reasonably secure, with diminimus administrative costs. 
   We believe that the best approach to retirement savings in the 21st century is a three-tier system founded on the basic Social Security annuity. To which is added one's private pension--which about half of Americans now enjoy--and one's private savings. 
   Our plan would return Social Security to a pay-as-you-go system. This makes possible an immediate payroll tax cut of approximately $800 billion over the next 10 years, as payroll tax rates would be cut from 12.4 to 10.4 percent. 
   The bill would permit voluntary personal savings accounts, which workers could finance with the proceeds of the two percentage point cut in the payroll tax. Under this provision in our legislation--together with a total of $3,500 deposited in an individual's account at birth and at ages 1-5 under the Kidsave provision of the bill--all workers will be able to accumulate an estate which they can pass on to their children and grandchildren. 
   Our plan includes a one percentage point correction in cost of living adjustments for all indexed programs except Supplemental Security Income. Benefits are also adjusted to reflect projected increases in life expectancy, similar to what has just been adopted in Sweden. 
   It is worth digressing here to note that under current law the so-called normal retirement age (NRA) is scheduled to gradually increase from 65 to 67. In practice, the NRA, is important as a benchmark for determining the monthly benefit amount, but it does not reflect the actual age at which workers receive retirement benefits. More than 70 percent of workers begin collecting Social Security retirement benefits before they reach age 65, and more than 50 percent do so at age 62. Under the bill, workers can continue to receive benefits at age 62 and the provision in the 1983 Social Security amendments that increased the NRA to age 67 is repealed. Instead, under this legislation, if life expectancy increases the level of benefits payable at age 65 (or at the age at which the worker actually retires) decreases. (Sweden has adopted a similar provision allowing workers to continue to retire at age 61, even as monthly benefits are reduced to mirror the projected gradual increase in life expectancy.) 
   We also propose to eliminate the so-called earnings test, which reduces Social Security benefits for retirees who have wages significantly above $10,000 per year, and is a burden and annoyance to persons who wish to work after age 62. 
   Finally, Social Security benefits would be taxed to the same extent private pensions are taxed, with the provision phased-in over the 5 year period 2000-2004. And Social Security coverage would be extended to newly hired employees in currently excluded State and local positions. 
   This package of changes ensures the long-run solvency of Social Security while reducing payroll taxes by almost $800 billion over the next decade, and with little or no change in the Federal budget surplus. Beginning in the year 2030, payroll tax rates would increase gradually to cover growing outlays, and would rise only slightly above the current level in the year 2035.  
   Can this be done? From an actuarial perspective, it's easy. We know--or at least the actuaries can tell us--within a couple of million persons how many workers will be supporting how many retirees in 2050. Contrast this with Medicare, where you do not know where gene therapy will lead in three years, let alone 30 years. The 17 members of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, ably chaired by Senator Breaux, can, I am sure, attest to the analytic complexity of the issues they are discussing as part of that important Commission's work. 
   Politically, however, it won't be easy to fix Social Security. In a manner that the late economist Mancur Olson would recognize, over time Social Security has acquired a goodly number of veto groups which prevent changes, howsoever necessary. In so doing they also undermine confidence in Social Security by supporting a promised level of benefits which the Trustees, as noted above, readily admit cannot be delivered. 
   The veto groups assert that the Moynihan-Kerrey bill will reduce benefits by 30 percent. Not true when compared to what actually can be delivered. With pay-as-you-go, and adjustments in benefits related to an accurate cost of living index and the increase in life expectancy, the Moynihan-Kerrey bill delivers higher benefits than Social Security can actually provide with projected tax revenues under current law. For example, in 2040 the Social Security actuaries estimate that the current program can only deliver 73 percent of promised benefits. We do slightly better than that. Add in the annuity--financed with voluntary contributions of 2 percent of earnings--and benefits are 20 percent or more higher than the current program can deliver--even assuming real rates of interest no higher than a modest 3 percent. For 2070, the actuaries estimate that current financing will only support benefits equal to 68 percent of what is promised--a reduction of more than 30 percent. Again we do slightly better even without the private accounts--and more than 25 percent better with the private accounts. 
   As I say, this won't be easy. Which is why this is a time for courage as well as policy analysis. Social Security, one of the great achievements of our government in this century, is ours to maintain. Our bill does just that.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Government Secrecy Reform Act. I would like to begin by thanking my cosponsors, Senators HELMS, LOTT, DASCHLE, THOMPSON, COLLINS, and SCHUMER. The legislation that we introduce today is intended to implement the core recommendation of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy: a statute establishing the principles to govern the classification and declassification of information. 
   The Federal government has a legitimate interest in maintaining secrets in order to fulfill its Constitutional charge to ``provide for the common defense.'' At the same time, this interest must be balanced by the public's right to be informed of government activities. 
   The Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which I chaired, found a secrecy system out of balance: one which has lost the confidence of many inside and outside the Government. Consequently, information needing protection does not always receive it, while innocuous information is classified and remains classified. The Commission found in its 1997 report that ``[t]he best way to ensure that secrecy is respected, and that the most important secrets remain secret, is for secrecy to be returned to its limited but necessary role. Secrets can be protected more effectively if secrecy is reduced overall.'' 
   Begin with the concept that secrecy should be understood as a form of government regulation. This was an insight of the Commission, building on the work of the great German sociologist Max Weber. The instinct of the bureaucracy, Weber wrote, was to ``increase the superiority of the professionally informed by keeping their knowledge and intentions secret.'' The concept of the `official secret' ``is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this attitude.'' 
   We traditionally think of regulation as a means to govern how citizens are to behave. Whereas public regulation involves what citizens may do, secrecy concerns what citizens may know. And the citizen does not know what may not be known. As our Commission stated: ``Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other areas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know the extent or the content of the regulation.'' 
   Thus, secrecy is the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does not even know that he or she is being regulated! It is a parallel regulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it malfunctions. In our democracy, where the free exchange of ideas is so essential, it can be suffocating. 
   To reform this system, the Commission recommended legislation be adopted. Senator JESSE HELMS and I, and Representatives LARRY COMBEST and Lee Hamilton (all Commissioners), introduced the Government Secrecy Act on May 7, 1997. Our core objective is to ensure that secrecy proceed according to law. Since the Truman Administration, classification and declassification have been governed by a series of executive orders but not one has created a stable and reliable system to ensure we protect what truly needs protecting and nothing more. The system lacks the discipline of a legal framework to define and enforce the proper uses of secrecy. The proposed statute can help ensure that the present regulatory regime will not simply continue to flourish without any restraint and without meaningful oversight and accountability. 
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Chaired by Senator THOMPSON of Tennessee, considered the bill is the 105th Congress and reported it unanimously. In its report to accompany the bill, the Committee had this important insight:  
   Our liberties depend on the balanced structure created by James Madison and the other framers of the Constitution. The national security information system has not had a clear legislative foundation, but.......has been developed through a series of executive orders. It is time to bring this executive monopoly over the issue to an end, and to begin to engage in the same sort of dialogue between Congress and the executive that characterizes the development of government policy in all other means.  
   As the Cold War gathered, this ``executive monopoly'' as the Governmental Affairs Committee has termed it, was spawned. The United States had to organize itself to deal with aggression from the Soviet Union. American society in peacetime began to experience wartime regulation. The awful dilemma was that in order to preserve an open society, the U.S. government took measures that in significant ways closed it down. The culture of secrecy that evolved was intended as a defense against two antagonists: the enemy abroad and the enemy within. 
   Edward Shils chronicled the perils of this growing secrecy system in his 1956 work, The Torment of Secrecy. He said of this era:  
   The American visage began to cloud over. Secrets were to become our chief reliance just when it was becoming more and more evident that the Soviet Union had long maintained an active apparatus for espionage in the United States. For a country which had never previously thought of itself as an object of systematic espionage by foreign powers, it was unsettling.  
   The larger society, Shils continued, was ``facing an unprecedented threat to its continuance.'' In such circumstances, ``the phantasies of apocalyptic visionaries now claimed the respectability of being a reasonable interpretation of the real situation.'' 
   Shils was writing, as he explained in his Foreword, ``after nearly a decade of degrading agitation and numerous unnecessary and unworthy actions......'' Today, by contrast, the public and its representatives have few of the concerns of ideological ``infiltration'' that dominated our attention and our domestic politics during the decade preceding Shils' book. 
   Indeed, if there is such a thing as a ``typical'' case of espionage, it involves an employee well into mid-career who sells national security secrets out of greed, not because of any ideologically-based motivation. 
   Moreover, today it is the United States government that increasingly finds itself the object of what Shils four decades ago termed the ``phantasies of apocalyptic visionaries.'' 
   Conspiracy theories have been with us since the birth of the Republic. The best-known and most notorious is, of course, the unwillingness on the part of the vast majority of the American public to accept that President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone. A poll taken in 1966, two years after release of the Warren Commission report concluding that Oswald had acted alone, found that 36 percent of respondents accepted this finding, while 50 percent believed others had been involved in a conspiracy to kill the President. By 1978 only 18 percent responded that they believed the assassination had been the act of one man; fully 75 percent believed  there had been a broader plot. The numbers have remained relatively steady since; a 1993 poll also found that three-quarters of those surveyed believed (consistent with the film JFK, released that year) that there had been a conspiracy. 
   It so happens that I was in the White House at the hour of the President's death (I was an assistant labor secretary at the time). I feared what would become of Oswald if he were not protected and I pleaded that we must get custody of him. But no one seemed to be able to hear. Presently Oswald was killed, significantly complicating matters. 
   I did not think there had been a conspiracy to kill the president, but I was convinced that the American people would sooner or later come to believe that there had been one unless we investigated the event with exactly that presumption in mind. The Warren Commission report and the other subsequent investigations, with their nearly universal reliance on secrecy, did not dispel any such fantasies. 
   The Assassination Records Review Board has now completed its Congressionally mandated review and release of documents related to President Kennedy's assassination. It has assembled at the National Archives a thorough collection of documents and evidence that was previously secret and scattered about the government. The Review Board found that while the public has continued to search for answers over the past thirty-five years:  
   [T]he official record on the assassination of President Kennedy remained shrouded in secrecy and mystery. 
   The suspicions created by government secrecy eroded confidence in the truthfulness of federal agencies in general and damaged their credibility.  
   Credibility eroded needlessly, as most of the documents which the Board reviewed were declassified. In conducting this document-by-document review of classified information, the Board reports that ``the federal government needlessly and wastefully classified 
   and then withheld from public access countless important records that did not require such treatment.'' 
   With the Government Secrecy Reform Act, we are not proposing putting an end to government secrecy. Far from it. It is at times terribly necessary and used for the most legitimate reasons--ranging from military operations to diplomatic endeavors. Indeed, much of our Commission's report is devoted to explaining the varied circumstances in which secrecy is most essential. Yet, the bureaucratic attachment to secrecy has become so warped that, in the words of Kermit Hall, a member of the Assassination Records Review Board, it has transformed into ``a deeply ingrained commitment to secrecy as a form of partriotism.'' From this perspective, it is easy to see how secrecy became the norm. 
   Secrecy need not remain the only norm--particularly when one considers that the current badly overextended system frequently fails to protect its most important secrets adequately. We must develop what might be termed a competing ``culture of openness''--fully consistent with our interests in protecting national security. A culture in which power and authority are no longer derived primarily from one's ability to withhold information from others in government and the public at large. 
   This is our purpose in introducing the Government Secrecy Reform Act. I thank those who have agreed to cosponsor the bill and ask my colleagues to lend it the attention it deserves.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today with my distinguished colleague Senator SCHUMER to introduce the ``Kate Mullany National Historic Site Designation Act,'' a bill to designate the Troy, New York, home of pioneer labor organizer Kate Mullany as a National Historic Site. A similar measure introduced in the House of Representatives last year by Congressman MICHAEL R. MCNULTY engendered a great deal of support and was cosponsored by over 100 members. 
   Like many Irish immigrants settling in Troy, Kate Mullany found her opportunities limited to the most difficult and low-paying of jobs, the collar laundry industry. Troy was then known as ``The Collar City''--the birthplace of the detachable shirt collar. At the age of 19, Kate stood up against the often dangerous conditions and meager pay that characterized the industry and lead a movement of 200 female laundresses demanding just compensation and safe working conditions. These protests marked the beginning of the Collar Laundry Union, which some have called ``the only bona fide female labor union in the country.'' 
   Kate Mullany's courage and organizing skills did not go unnoticed. She later traveled down the Hudson River to lead women workers in the sweatshops of New York City and was ultimately appointed Assistant Secretary of the then National Labor Union, becoming the first women ever appointed to a national labor office. 
   On April 1, 1998, Kate Mullany's home was designated as a National Historic Landmark by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and on July 15 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presented citizens of Troy with the National Historic Landmark plaque in a celebration. By conferring National Historic Site status on this important landmark, we can ensure that Kate Mullany's contributions to the labor movement and the cause of women's equality in the workplace are not soon forgotten.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, Senators SCHUMER, KENNEDY, KERRY, DURBIN, and ROBB, to introduce legislation to name the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) headquarters here in Washington after Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to three Presidents, director of the NAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary. With Senator KERRY, Senator MOSELEYBRAUN, and Senator KENNEDY I introduced an identical bill last year. It was passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on July 31, 1998 but languished in the House. 
   Bob Weaver was my friend, dating back more than 40 years to our service together in the administration of New York Governor Averell Harriman. In July of 1997, he died at his home in New York City after spending his entire life broadening opportunities for minorities in America. I think it is a fitting tribute to name the HUD building after this great man. 
   Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``Black Cabinet,'' an informal advisory group promoting educational and job opportunities for blacks. The Washington Post called this work his greatest legacy, the dismantling of a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America. Indeed it was. 
   Dr. Weaver was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for New York State in 1955, and later became State Rent Administrator with Cabinet rank. It was during these years, working for Governor Harriman, that I first met Bob; I was Assistant to the Secretary to the Governor and later, Acting Secretary. 
   Our friendship and collaboration continued under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. In 1960, he became the president of the NAACP, and shortly thereafter would become a key adviser to President Kennedy on civil rights. In 1961, Kennedy appointed Dr. Weaver to head the Housing and Home Finance Agency, the precursor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1966, when President Johnson elevated the agency to Cabinet rank, he chose Dr. Weaver to head the department. Bob Weaver was, in Johnson's phrase, ``the man for the job.'' He thus became its first Secretary, and the first African-American to head a Cabinet agency. Later, he and I served together on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission. 
   Following his government service, Dr. Weaver was, among various other academic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, a visiting professor at Columbia Teacher's College and New York University's School of Education, and the president of Baruch College in Manhattan. When I became director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard, he generously agreed to be a member of the Board of Directors.  
   Dr. Weaver earned his undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard; he wrote four books on urban affairs; and served as one of the original directors of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which designed the plan to rescue New York City during its tumultuous financial crisis in the 1970s. 
   When Dr. Weaver died, America--and Washington, in particular (for he was a native Washingtonian)--lost one of its innovators, one of its creators, one of its true leaders. Dr. Robert C. Weaver led not only with his words but with his deeds and I was privileged to know him as a friend. He will be missed but properly memorialized, I think, if we can pass this legislation.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to recognize the immeasurable debt which we owe to a leading Soviet dissident. Dr. Yuri F. Orlov, a founding member of the Soviet chapter of Amnesty International and founder of the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group (the first nation-wide organization in Soviet history to question government actions), who now lives in Ithaca, New York, is threatened by poverty. Yuri Orlov could not be stopped by the sinister forces of the Soviet Union and, no doubt, he will not be stopped by poverty. But I rise today in hopes that it will not come to that. 
   Dr. Orlov's career as a dissident began while he was working at the famous Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow. At the Institute in 1956 he made a pro-democracy speech which cost him his position and forced him to leave Moscow. He was able to return in 1972, whereupon he began his most outspoken criticism of the Soviet regime. 
   On September 13, 1973, in response to a government orchestrated-public smear campaign against Andrei Sakharov, Orlov sent ``Thirteen Questions to Brezhnev,'' a letter which advocated freedom of the press and reform of the Soviet economy. One month later, he became a founding member of the Soviet chapter of Amnesty International. His criticism of the Soviet Union left him unemployed and under constant KGB surveillance, but he would not be silenced. 
   In May, 1976 Dr. Orlov founded the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group to pressure the Soviet Union to honor the human rights obligations it had accepted under the Helsinki Accords signed in 1975. His leadership of the Helsinki Watch Group led to his arrest and, eventually, to a show trial in 1978. He was condemned to seven years in a labor camp and five years in exile. 
   After having served his prison sentence, and while still in exile, Dr. Orlov was able to immigrate to the United States in 1986 in an exchange arranged by the Reagan Administration. A captured Soviet spy was returned in exchange for the release of Dr. Orlov and a writer for U.S. News & World Report who had been arrested in Moscow, Nicholas Daniloff. 
   Since then, Dr. Orlov has served as a senior scientist at Cornell University in the Newman Laboratory of Nuclear Studies. Now that he is 74 years old, he is turning his thoughts to retirement. Unfortunately, since he has only been in the United States for 12 years, his retirement income from the Cornell pension plus Social Security will be insufficient: only a fraction of what Cornell faculty of comparable distinction now get at retirement. 
   His scientific colleagues, Nobel physicist Dr. Hans A. Bethe, Kurt Gottfried of Cornell, and Sidney Drell of Stanford, have made concerted efforts to raise support for Dr. Orlov's retirement, but they are in further need. 
   To this end, I have agreed to assist these notable scientists in their endeavor to secure a more appropriate recompense for this heroic dissident. That is the purpose that brings me here to the Senate floor today, on the first day of the 106th Congress, to introduce a bill on Dr. Orlov's behalf. 
   To understand Dr. Orlov's contributions to ending the Cold War, I would draw my colleagues attention to his autobiography, Dangerous Thoughts: Memoirs of a Russian Life. It captures the fear extant in Soviet society and the courage of men like Orlov, Sakharov, Sharansky, Solzhenitsyn, and others who defied the Soviet regime. Dr. Orlov, who spent 7 years in a labor camp and two years in Siberian exile, never ceased protesting against oppression. Despite deteriorating health and the harsh conditions of the camp, Dr. Orlov smuggled out messages in support of basic rights and nuclear arms control. His bravery and that of his dissident colleagues played no small role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union. I am sure many would agree that we owe them a tremendous debt. This then is a call to all those who agree with that proposition. Dr. Orlov is now in need; please join our endeavor.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the NIS Education Act. For 75 years academic freedom was squelched in the Soviet Union and the tools to build a democratic society were lost to its successor states. Thankfully, that is now passed. The  Russians have the right to claim that they freed their own country from the horrors of a decayed Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. The Russian people and their leaders have something about which to be proud. 
   I rise in that spirit to offer a bill that is simple in both premise and purpose: build democratic leaders of the NIS for the future through education. The NIS Education Act will partially fund graduate education in the social sciences for 500 students from the NIS during the next five years. The benefits of education and exposure to the United States will be long lasting. 
   We want to give these students from the NIS a chance to see American democracy and learn the tools to improve their own society. Indeed, for many it will be their first chance to visit the world's oldest democracy; to see the promise that democracy offers; and to judge its fruits for themselves. As one of our most famous visitors, Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote:  
   Let us look to America, not in order to make a servile copy of the institutions that she has established, but to gain a clearer view of the polity that will be the best for us; let us look there less to find examples than instruction; let us borrow from her the principles, rather than the details, of her laws.......the principles on which the American constitutions rest, those principles of order, of the balance of powers, of true liberty, of deep and sincere respect for right, are indispensable to all republics.......  
   In 1948 the United States instituted the now famous Marshall Plan which included among its many provisions a fund for technical assistance. Part of this fund included the ``productivity campaign'' which was designed to bring European businessmen and labor representatives here to learn American methods of production. During the Plan's three years, over 6,000 Europeans came to the United States to study U.S. production. Though the funding for this part of the plan was less than one-half of one percent of all the Marshall Plan aid, its impact was far greater. The impact of the NIS Education Act may also be great. 
   We must note here the current state of Russia's affairs: it is deplorable. Despite this situation, last spring the United States Senate voted to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Throughout the elements of the Russian political system NATO expansion was viewed as a hostile act they will have to defend against; and they have said if they have to defend their territory, they will do so with nuclear weapons; that is all they have left. 
   The distrust born from NATO expansion will not fade quickly. Let us hope that the NIS Education Act will provide individuals from Russia and the other NIS the opportunity to see that we Americans do not hope for Russia's demise and isolation. Perhaps we can dispel the betrayal they may feel as a result of NATO enlargement, and give them the tools to further develop their own democracies. 
   Beyond that, the importance of training the next generation of social scientists in the NIS is immeasurable. It is this generation that will revitalize the universities, teaching the next generation economics, sociology and other disciplines. It is this generation of social scientists who will be prepared to enter their Governments armed with new ideas and new ways of thinking different from the status quo; they will bring their new knowledge and standards, their linkages to the United States back to their own countries, and they will have the best opportunity to influence change there.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to authorize funding for Cuban nationals for the Fulbright Educational Exchange Program so that they may come to the United States for graduate study. 
   The world is a changed place. The Soviet Union dissolved almost a decade ago, and since then democracy has replaced totalitarianism in Eastern Europe. Since the demise of its sponsor, the Soviet Union, and the disappearance of Soviet subsidies, Cuba has had to change to survive. In time, the winds of democracy sweeping the globe will reach the shores of Cuba. 
   We learned from the cold war that one of the most subversive acts in that ideological conflict was exposing communists to the West. In his lucid chronicle of the demise of the Soviet Union, Michael Dobbs writes in Down with Big Brother: The Fall of the Soviet Empire,  
   A turning point in [Boris] Yeltsin's intellectual development occurred during his first visit to the United States in September 1989, more specifically his first visit to an American supermarket, in Houston, Texas. The sight of aisle after aisle of shelves neatly stacked with every conceivable type of foodstuff and household item, each in a dozen varieties, both amazed and depressed him. For Yeltsin, like many other first-time Russian visitors to America, this was infinitely more impressive than tourist attractions like the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln Memorial. It was impressive precisely because of its ordinariness. A cornucopia of consumer goods beyond the imagination of most Soviets was within the reach of ordinary citizens without standing in line for hours. And it was all so attractively displayed. For someone brought up in the drab conditions of communism, even a member of the relatively privileged elite, a visit to a Western supermarket involved a full-scale assault on the senses. 
   What we saw in that supermarket was no less amazing than America itself,'' recalled Lev Sukhanov, who accompanied Yeltsin on his trip to the United States and shared his sense of shock and dismay at the gap in living standards between the two superpowers. ``I think it is quite likely that the last prop of Yeltsin's Bolshevik consciousness finally collapsed after Houston. His decision to leave the party and join the struggle for supreme power in Russia may have ripened irrevocably at that moment of mental confusion.  
   The young people of Cuba are that country's future. As such what they learn now will help shape a post-Castro Cuba. Since its inception in 1947, at the suggestion of Senator J. William Fulbright, the Fulbright Educational Exchange Program has sent nearly 82,000 Americans abroad and provided 138,000 foreign students and professors with the opportunity to come to the United States for study--to live here, to understand our great country, and return to their own nations so enriched. Nearly 50 years ago they sent me off to the London School of Economics. I left the United States untouched by war to live in Europe as it climbed out of its ruins.  In London, I learned from experience Seymour Martin Lipset's dictum, ``He who knows only one country knows no country.'' Use the simple analogy of eyesight: it takes two eyes to provide perspective. It was a seminal time for the world and for me. This bill will offer that opportunity to Cubans to study in the United States, as I studied in London. 
   Fidel Castro will not live forever--it is time to get ready for an end game. Now is the time to start showing the people of Cuba, especially the young people, how the United States works and how their country might change. So let us bring them here and not act like it's the middle of the Cold War. Let us bring them to the United States and offer them education and a chance to see the world's oldest democracy in action. We need to begin now to expose future leaders of Cuba to the United States. For, as Senator Fulbright observed,  
   The vital mortar to seal the bricks of world order is education across international boundaries, not with the expectation that knowledge would make us love each other, but in the hope that it would encourage empathy between nations, and foster the emergence of leaders whose sense of other nations and cultures would enable them to shape specific policies based on tolerance and rational restraint.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which would place the home and studio of Thomas Cole under the care of the Greene County Historical Society as a National Historic Site. I am pleased Senator SCHUMER has agreed to cosponsor this bill. Thomas Cole founded the American artistic tradition known as the Hudson River School. He painted landscapes of the American wilderness as it never had been depicted, untamed and majestic, the way Americans saw it in the 1830s and 1840s as they moved west. His students and followers included Frederick Church, Alfred Bierstadt, Thomas Moran, and John Frederick Kennesett. 
   No description of Cole's works would do them justice, but let me say that their moody, dramatic style and subject matter were in sharp contrast to the pastoral European landscapes that Americans previously had admired. The new country was just settled enough that some people had time and resources to devote to collecting art. Cole's new style coincided with this growing interest, to the benefit of both. 
   Cole had begun his painting career in Manhattan, but one day took a steamboat up the Hudson for inspiration. It worked. The landscapes he saw set him on the artistic course that became his life's work. He eventually moved to a house up the river in Catskill. First he boarded; then he bought the house. He married and raised his family there. That house, known as Cedar Grove, remained in the Cole family until 1979, when it was put up for sale. 
   The Cole house would be only the second site under the umbrella of the Park Service dedicated to interpreting the life and work of an American painter. 
   Olana, Church's home, sits immediately across the Hudson, so we have the opportunity to provide visitors with two nearby destinations that show the inspiration for two of America's foremost nineteenth century painters. Visitors could walk, hike, or drive to the actual spots where masterpieces were painted and see the landscape much as it was then. 
   I regret that none of Thomas Cole's work hang in the Capitol, although two works by Bierstadt can be found in the stairwell outside the Speaker's Lobby. Perhaps Cole's greatest work is the four-part Voyage of Life, an allegorical series that depicts man in the four stages of life. It can be found in the National Gallery, along with two other Cole paintings. Another work of Cole's that we would be advised to remember is The Course of Empire, which depicts the rise of a great civilization from the wilderness, and its return. 
   Several years ago the first major Cole exhibition in decades was held at the National Museum of American Art. The exhibition was all the evidence needed of Cole's importance and the merit of adding his home to the list of National Historic Sites. I should add that this must happen soon. The house needs work, and will not endure many more winters in its present state. 
   This legislation would authorize cooperative agreements under which the management of the Cole House would go to the Greene County Historical Society, which is entirely qualified for the job. The Society could enter into cooperative agreements with the National Park Service for the preservation and interpretation of the site.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which restricts those who can have access to black powder, the primary ingredient in pipe bombs. At present, there are no restrictions on those who wish to buy commercially manufactured black powder in quantities not to exceed 50 pounds solely for sporting or recreational purposes. Anyone, including a convicted felon, a fugitive from justice, and a person adjudicated to be mentally defective, can buy commercially manufactured black powder in the above amounts with no questions asked. This is both wrong and dangerous. The same restrictions that apply to who can buy explosives should also apply to those who can lawfully buy commercially manufactured black powder.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would require vendors of explosives to notify the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (B.A.T.F.) when they sell such items. Now, there is no requirement that a seller notify the B.A.T.F. when a customer buys explosives. All that is required is that the buyer complete a federally generated form--5400.4--and that the seller keep it. There is nothing that requires the seller to send a copy of this form to the B.A.T.F. 
   In all likelihood, any terrorist attach aimed at this country's infrastructure will use explosives to achieve its purpose. One key way to prevent an attack  such as this is to have information about the individuals who are buying these items.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, On January 3, 1999, Jerry Quarry, a perennial heavyweight boxing champion contender in the 1960's and 1970's, died of pneumonia brought on by an advanced state of dementia pugilistica. He was 53. The list goes on: Sugar Ray Robinson, Archie Moore and Muhammad Ali are but a few examples. The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 was an excellent step toward making professional boxing safer for its participants. Nevertheless, it contains several gaps. 
   The two amendments I propose here today are aimed at protecting professional fighters by requiring more rigorous prefight physical examinations and by requiring a brain catscan before a boxer can renew his or her professional license.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a series of bills aimed at curtailing gun related violence, one of the leading causes of death in this country. These bills launch a two-prong assault. The first seeks to outlaw certain types of ammunition that have no purpose other than killing people. The second imposes heavy taxes on these same deadly categories by making them prohibitively expensive. Similarly, I am proposing that we commission an epidemiological study on bullet-related violence in this country and that we enhance the safety of this nation's police officers by promulgating performance standards for armor piercing ammunition. 
   My first two bills are called the Destructive Ammunition Prohibition Act of 1999 and the Real Cost of Destructive Ammunition Act of 1999. 
   Some of my colleagues may remember the Black Talon. It is a hollow-tipped bullet, singular among handgun ammunition in its capacity for destruction. Upon impact with human tissue, the bullet produces razor-sharp radial petals that produce a devastating wound. It is the very same bullet that a crazed gunman fired at unsuspecting passengers on a Long Island Railroad train in December 1993, killing the husband of now Congresswoman CAROLYN MCCARTHY and injuring her son. That same month, it was also used in the shooting of Officer Jason E. White of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, just 15 blocks from the Capitol. 
   I first learned of the Black Talon in a letter I received from Dr. E.J. Gallagher, director of Emergency Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Municipal Hospital Trauma Center in the Bronx. Dr. Gallagher wrote that he has never seen a more lethal projectile. On November 3, 1993, I introduced a bill to tax the Black Talon at 10,000 percent. Nineteen days later, Olin Corp., the manufacturer of the Black Talon, announced that it would withdraw sale of the bullet to the general public. Unfortunately, the 103rd Congress came to a close without the bill's having won passage. 
   As a result, there is nothing in law to prevent the reintroduction of this pernicious bullet, nor is there any existing impediment to the sale of similar rounds that might be produced by another manufacturer. So today I reintroduce the bill to tax the Black Talon as well as a bill to prohibit the sale of the Black Talon to the public. Both bills would apply to any bullet with the same physical characteristics as the Black Talon. 
   It has been estimated that the cost of hospital services for treating bullet-related injuries is $1 billion per year, with the 
   total cost to the economy of such injuries approximately $14 billion. We can ill afford further increases in this number, but this would surely be the result if bullets with the destructive capacity of the Black Talon are allowed onto the streets. 
    Mr. President, despite the fact that the national crime rate has decreased in recent months, the number of deaths and injuries caused by bullet wounds is still at an unconscionable level. It is time we take meaningful steps to put an end to the massacres that occur daily as a result of gun violence. How better a beginning than to go after the most insidious culprits of this violence? I urge my colleagues to support these measures and to prevent these bullets from appearing on the market. 
   My third measure, the Handgun Ammunition Control Act of 1999, introduces a measure to improve our information about the regulation and criminal use of ammunition and to prevent the irresponsible production of ammunition. This bill has three components. First, it would require importers and manufacturers of ammunition to keep records and submit an annual report to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [BATF] on the disposition of ammunition, including the amount, caliber and type of ammunition imported or manufactured. Second, it would require the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, to conduct a study of ammunition use and make recommendations on the efficacy of reducing crime by restricting access to ammunition. Finally, it would amend title 18 of the United States Code to raise the application fee for a license to manufacture certain calibers of ammunition. 
   While there are enough handguns in circulation to last well into the 22nd century, there is perhaps only a 4-year supply of ammunition. But how much of what kind of ammunition? Where does it come from? Where does it go? There are currently no reporting requirements for manufacturers or importers of ammunition; earlier reporting requirements were repealed in 1986. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Reports, based on information provided by local law enforcement agencies, does not record the caliber, type, or quantity of ammunition used in crime. In short, our data base is woefully inadequate. 
   I supported the Brady law, which requires a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun, and the recent ban on semi-automatic weapons. But while the debate over gun control continues, I offer another alternative: Ammunition control. After all, as I have said before, guns do not kill people; bullets do. 
   Ammunition control is not a new idea. In 1982 Phil Caruso of the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association asked me to do something about armor-piercing bullets. Jacketed in tungsten or other materials, these rounds could penetrate four police flak jackets and five Los Angeles County telephone books. They have no sporting value. I introduced legislation, the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act, to ban the cop-killer bullets in the 97th, 98th and 99th Congresses. It enjoyed the overwhelming support of law enforcement groups and, ultimately, tacit support from the National Rifle Association. It was finally signed into law by President Reagan on August 28, 1986. 
   The crime bill enacted in 1994 contained my amendment to broaden the 1986 ban to cover new thick steel-jacketed armor-piercing rounds. 
   Our cities are becoming more aware of the benefits to be gained from ammunition control. The District of Columbia and some other cities prohibit a person from possessing ammunition without a valid license for a firearm of the same caliber or gauge as the ammunition. Beginning in 1990, the city of Los Angeles banned the sale of all ammunition 1 week prior to Independence Day and New Year's Day in an effort to reduce injuries and deaths caused by the firing of guns into the air. And in September 1994, the city of Chicago became the first in America to ban the sale of all handgun ammunition. 
   Such efforts are laudable. But they are isolated attempts to cure what is in truth a national disease. We need to do more, but to do so, we need information to guide policy making. This bill would fulfill that need by requiring annual reports to BATF by manufactures  and importers and by directing a study by the National Academy of Sciences. We also need to encourage manufacturers of ammunition to be more responsible. By substantially increasing application fees for licenses to manufacturer .25 caliber, .32 caliber, and 9-mm ammunition, this bill would discourage the reckless production of unsafe ammunition or ammunition which causes excessive damage. 
   My fourth measure provides a comprehensive way of addressing the epidemic proportions of violence in America. 
   By including two different crime-related provisions, my bill attacks the crime epidemic on more than just one front. If we are truly serious about confronting our Nation's crime problem, we must learn more about the nature of the epidemic of bullet-related violence and ways to control it. To do this, we must require records to be kept on the disposition of ammunition. 
   In October 1992, the Senate Finance Committee received testimony that public health and safety experts have, independently, concluded that there is an epidemic of bullet-related violence. The figures are staggering. 
   In 1995, bullets were used in the murders of 23,673 people in 
   the United States. By focusing on bullets, and not guns, we recognize that much like nuclear waste, guns remain active for centuries. With minimum care, they do not deteriorate. However, bullets are consumed. Estimates suggest we have only a 4-year's supply of them. 
   Not only am I proposing that we tax bullets used disproportionately in crimes--9 millimeter, .25 and .32 caliber bullets--I also believe we must set up a Bullet Death and Injury Control Program within the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. This Center will enhance our knowledge of the distribution and status of bullet-related death and injury and subsequently make recommendations about the extent and nature of bullet-related violence. 
   So that the Center would have substantive information to study and analyze, this bill also requires importers and manufacturers of ammunition to keep records and submit an annual report to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms [BATF] on the disposition of ammunition. Currently, importers and manufacturers of ammunition are not required to do so. 
   My next two bills, the Violent Crime Reduction Act of 1999 and the Real Cost of Handgun Ammunition Act of 1999, ban or heavily tax .25 caliber, .32 caliber, and 9 mm ammunition. These calibers of bullets are used disproportionately in crime. They are not sporting or hunting rounds, but instead are the bullets of choice for drug dealers and violent felons. Every year they contribute overwhelmingly to the pervasive loss of life caused by bullet wounds. 
   Today marks the fifth time in as many Congresses that I have introduced legislation to ban or tax these pernicious bullets. As the terrible gunshot death toll in the United States continues unabated, so too does the need for these bills, which, by keeping these bullets out of the hands of criminals, would save a significant number of lives. 
   The number of Americans killed or wounded each year by bullets demonstrates their true cost to American society. Just look at the data. 
   The lifetime risk of death from homicide in U.S. males is 1 in 164, about the same as the risk of death in battle faced by U.S. servicemen in the Vietnam war. For black males, the lifetime risk of death from homicide is 1 in 28, twice the risk of death in battle faced by Marines in Vietnam. 
   As noted by Susan Baker and her colleagues in the book Epidemiology and Health Policy, edited by Sol Levine and Abraham Lilienfeld, there is a correlation between rates of private ownership of guns and gun-related death rates; guns cause two-thirds of family homicides, and small, easily concealed weapons comprise the majority of guns used for homicides, suicides and unintentional death. 
   Baker states that:  
   *.*.* these facts of the epidemiology of firearm-related deaths and injuries have important implications. Combined with their lethality, the widespread availability of easily concealed handguns for impetuous use by people who are angry, drunk, or frightened appears to be a major determinant of the high firearm death rate in the United States. Each contributing factor has implications for prevention. Unfortunately, issues related to gun control have evoked such strong sentiments that epidemiologic data are rarely employed to good advantage.  
   Strongly held views on both sides of the gun control issue have made the subject difficult for epidemiologists. I would suggest that a good deal of energy is wasted in this never-ending debate, for gun control as we know it misses the point. We ought to focus on the bullets, not the guns. 
   I would remind the Senate of our experience in controlling epidemics. Although the science of epidemiology traces its roots to antiquity--Hippocrates stressed the importance of considering environmental influences on human diseases--the first modern epidemiological study was conducted by James Lind in 1747. His efforts led to the eventual control of scurvy. It wasn't until 1795 that the British Navy accepted his analysis and required limes in shipboard diets. Most solutions are not perfect. Disease is rarely eliminated. But might epidemiology be applied in the case of bullets to reduce suffering? I believe so. 
   In 1854 John Snow and William Farr collected data that clearly showed cholera was caused by contaminated drinking water. Snow removed the handle of the Broad Street pump in London to prevent people from drawing water from this contaminated water source and the disease stopped in that population. His observations led to a legislative mandate that all London water companies filter their water by 1857. Cholera epidemics subsided. Now treatment of sewage prevents cholera from entering our rivers and lakes, and the disinfection of drinking water makes water distribution systems uninhabitable for cholera vibrio, identified by Robert Koch as the causative agent 26 years after Snow's study. 
   In 1900, Walter Reed identified mosquitos as the carriers of yellow fever. Subsequent mosquito control efforts by another U.S. Army doctor, William Gorgas, enabled the United States to complete the Panama Canal. The French failed because their workers were too sick from yellow fever to work. Now that it is known that yellow 
   fever is caused by a virus, vaccines are used to eliminate the spread of the disease. 
   These pioneering epidemiology success stories showed the world that epidemics require an interaction between three things: the host--(the person who becomes sick or, in the case of bullets, the shooting victim); the agent--(the cause of sickness, or the bullet); and the environment--(the setting in which the sickness occurs or, in the case of bullets, violent behavior). Interrupt this epidemiological triad and you reduce or eliminate disease and injury. 
   How might this approach apply to the control of bullet-related injury and death? Again, we are contemplating something different from gun control. There is a precedent here. In the middle of this century it was recognized that epidemiology could be applied to automobile death and injury. From a governmental perspective, this hypothesis was first adopted in 1959, late in the administration of Gov. Averell Harriman of New York State. In the 1960 Presidential campaign, I drafted a statement on the subject which was released by Senator John F. Kennedy as part of a general response to inquiries from the American Automobile Association. Then Senator Kennedy stated:  
   Traffic accidents constitute one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest of the nation's public health problems. They waste as much as 2 percent of our gross national product every year and bring endless suffering. The new highways will do much to control the rise of the traffic toll, but by themselves they will not reduce it. A great deal more investigation and research is needed. Some of this has already begun in connection with the highway program. It should be extended until highway safety research takes its place as an equal of the many similar programs of health research which the federal government supports.  
   Experience in the 1950's and early 1960's prior to passage of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, showed that traffic safety enforcement campaigns designed to change human behavior did not improve traffic safety. In fact, the death and injury toll mounted. I was Assistant Secretary of Labor in the mid-1960's when Congress was developing the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and I was called to testify.  
   It was clear to me and others that motor vehicle injuries and deaths could not be limited by regulating driver behavior. Nonetheless, we had an epidemic on our hands and we needed to do something about it. My friend William Haddon, the first Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, recognized that automobile fatalities were caused not by the initial collision, when the automobile strikes some object, but by a second collision, in which energy from the first collision is transferred to the interior of the car, causing the driver and occupants to strike the steering wheel, dashboard, or other structures in the passenger compartment. The second collision is the agent of injury to the hosts--the car's occupants. 
   Efforts to make automobiles crashworthy follow examples used to control infectious disease epidemics. Reduce or eliminate the agent of injury. Seatbelts, padded dashboards, and airbags are all specifically designed to reduce, if not eliminate, injury caused by the agent of automobile injuries, energy transfer to the human body during the second collision. In fact, we've done nothing revolutionary. All of the technology used to date to make cars crashworthy, including airbags, was developed prior to 1970. 
   Experience shows the approach worked. Of course, it could have worked better, but it worked. Had we been able to totally eliminate the agent--the second collision--the cure would have been complete. Nonetheless, merely by focusing on simple, achievable remedies, we reduced the traffic death and injury epidemic by 30 percent. Motor vehicle deaths declined in absolute terms by 13 percent from 1980 to 1990, despite significant increases in the number of drivers, vehicles, and miles driven. Driver behavior is changing, too. National seatbelt usage is up dramatically, 60 percent now compared to 14 percent in 1984. These efforts have resulted in some 15,000 lives saved and 100,000 injuries avoided each year. 
   We can apply that experience to the epidemic of murder and injury from bullets. The environment in which these deaths and injuries occur is complex. Many factors likely contribute to the rise in bullet-related injury. Here is an important similarity with the situation we faced 25 years ago regarding automobile safety. We found we could not easily alter the behavior of millions of drivers, but we could--easily--change the behavior of three or four automobile manufacturers. Likewise, we simply cannot do much to change the environment--violent behavior--in which gun-related injury occurs, nor do we know how. We can, however, do something about the agent causing the injury: bullets. Ban them. At least the rounds used disproportionately to cause death and injury; that is, the .25 caliber, .32 caliber, and 9 millimeter bullets. These three rounds account for the ammunition used in about 13 percent of licensed guns in New York City, yet they are involved in one-third of all homicides. They are not, as I have said, useful for sport or hunting. They are used for violence. If we fail to confront the fact that these rounds are used disproportionately in crimes, innocent people will continue to die. 
   I have called on Congress during the past several sessions to ban or heavily tax these bullets. This would not be the first time that Congress has banned a particular round of ammunition. In 1986, it passed legislation written by the Senator from New York banning the so-called ``cop-killer'' bullet. This round, jacketed with 
   tungsten alloys, steel, brass, or any number of other metals, had been demonstrated to penetrate no fewer than four police flak jackets and an additional five Los Angeles County phone books at one time. In 1982, the New York Police Benevolent Association came to me and asked me to do something about the ready availability of these bullets. The result was the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act, which we introduced in 1982, 1983, and for the last time during the 99th Congress. In the end, with the tacit support of the National Rifle Association, the measure passed the Congress and was signed by the President as Public Law 99-408 on August 28, 1986. In the 1994 crime bill, we enacted my amendment to broaden the ban to include new thick steel-jacketed armor-piercing rounds. 
   There are some 220 million firearms in circulation in the United States today. They are, in essence, simple machines, and with minimal care, remain working for centuries. However, estimates suggest that we have only a 4-year supply of bullets. Some 2 billion cartridges are used each year. At any given time there are some 7.5 billion rounds in factory, commercial, or household inventory. 
   In all cases, with the exception of pistol whipping, gun-related injuries are caused not by the gun, but by the agents involved in the second collision: the bullets. Eliminating the most dangerous rounds would not end the problem of handgun killings. But it would reduce it. A 30-percent reduction in bullet-related deaths, for instance, would save over 10,000 lives each year and prevent up to 50,000 wounds. 
   The bills I introduce today would begin the process. They would begin to control the problem by banning or taxing those rounds used disproportionately in crime--the .25-caliber, .32-caliber, and 9-millimeter rounds. The bills recognize the epidemic nature of the problem, building on findings contained in the June 10, 1992 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association which was devoted entirely to the subject of violence, principally violence associated with firearms. 
   My seventh bill introduces legislation today to amend Title 18 of the United States Code to strengthen the existing prohibition on handgun ammunition capable of penetrating police body armor, commonly referred to as bullet-proof vests. This provision would require the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to develop a uniform ballistics test to determine with precision whether ammunition is capable of penetrating police body armor. The bill also prohibits the manufacture and sale of any handgun ammunition determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to have armor-piercing capability. 
   Mr. President, it has been seventeen years since I first introduced legislation in the Senate to outlaw armor-piercing, or ``cop-killer,'' bullets. In 1982, Phil Caruso of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association of New York City alerted me to the existence of a Teflon-coated bullet capable of penetrating the soft body armor police officers were then beginning to wear. Shortly thereafter, I introduced the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1982 to prohibit the manufacture, importation, and sale of such ammunition. 
   At that time, armor-piercing bullets--most notably the infamous ``Green Hornet''--were manufactured with a solid steel core. Unlike the softer lead composition of most other ammunition, this hard steel core prevented these rounds from deforming at the point of impact--thus permitting the rounds to penetrate the 18 layers of Kevlar in a standard-issue police vest or ``flak-jacket.'' These bullets could go through a bullet-proof vest like a hot knife through butter. My legislation simply banned any handgun ammunition made with a core of steel or other hard metals. 
   Despite the strong support of the law enforcement community, it took four years before this seemingly non-controversial legislation was enacted into law. The National Rifle Association initially opposed it--that is, until the NRA realized that a large number of its members were themselves police officers who strongly supported banning these insidious bullets. Only then did the NRA lend its grudging support. The bill passed the Senate on March 6, 1986 by a vote of 97-1, and was signed by President Reagan on August 8, 1986 (Public Law 99-408). 
   That 1986 Act served us in good stead for 7 years. To the best of my knowledge, not a single law enforcement officer was shot with an armor-piercing bullet. Unfortunately, the ammunition manufacturers eventually found a way around the 1986 law. By 1993, a new Swedish-made armor-piercing round, the M39B, had appeared. This pernicious bullet evaded the 1986 statute's prohibition because of its unique composition. Like most common ammunition, it had a soft lead core, thus exempting it from the 1986 law. But this core was surrounded by a heavy steel jacket, solid enough to allow the bullet to penetrate body armor. Once again, our nation's law enforcement officers were at risk. Immediately upon learning of the existence of the new Swedish round, I introduced a bill to ban it.  
   Another protracted series of negotiations ensued before we were able to update the 1986 statute to cover the M39B. We did it with the support of law enforcement organizations, and with technical assistance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In particular, James O. Pasco, Jr., then the Assistant Director of Congressional Affairs at BATF, worked closely with me and my staff to get it done. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on November 19, 1993 as an amendment to the 1994 Crime Bill. 
   Despite these legislative successes, it was becoming evident that continuing ``innovations'' in bullet design would result in new armor-piercing rounds capable of evading the ban. It was at this time that some of us began to explore in earnest the idea of developing a new approach to banning these bullets based on their performance, rather than their physical characteristics. Mind, this concept was not entirely new; the idea had been discussed during our efforts in 1986, but the NRA had been immovable on the subject. The NRA's leaders, and their constituent ammunition manufactures, felt that any such broad-based ban based on a bullets ``performance standard'' would inevitably lead to the outlawing of additional classes of ammunition. They viewed it as a slippery slope, much as they have regarded the assault weapons ban as a slipper slope. The NRA had agreed to the 1986 and 1993 laws only because they were narrowly drawn to cover individual types of bullets. 
   And so in 1993 I asked the ATF for the technical assistance necessary tow write into law an armor-piercing bullet ``performance standard.'' At the time, however, the experts at the ATF informed us that this could not be done. They argued that it was simply too difficult to control for the many variables that contribute to a bullet's capability to penetrate police body armor. We were told that it might be possible in the future to develop a performance-based test for armor-piercing capability, but at the time we had to be content with the existing content-based approach. 
   Well. Two years passed and the Office of Law Enforcement Standards of the National Institute of Standard and Technology wrote a report describing the methodology for just such a armor-piercing bullet performance test. The report concluded that a test to determine armor-piercing capability could be developed within six months. 
   So we know it can be done, if only the agencies responsible for enforcing the relevant laws have the will. The legislation I am introducing requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General, to establish performance standards for the uniform testing of handgun ammunition. Such an objective standard will ensure that no rounds capable of penetrating police body armor, regardless of their composition, will ever be available to those who would use them against our law enforcement officers. 
   I wish to assure the Senate that this measure would in no way infringe upon the rights of legitimate hunters and sportsmen. It would not affect legitimate sporting ammunition used in rifles. It would only restrict the availability of armor-piercing rounds, for which no one can seriously claim there is a genuine sporting use. These cop-killer rounds have no legitimate uses, and they have no business being in the arsenals of criminals. They are designed for one purpose; to kill police officers. 
   The 1986 and 1993 cop-killer bullet laws I sponsored kept us one step ahead of the designers of new armor-piercing rounds. When the legislation I have introduced today is enacted--and I hope it will be early in the 106th Congress--it will put them out of the cop-killer bullet business permanently.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill aimed at raising the fee Federal jurors are paid to that of $45.00 per day. According to the current statute, Federal jurors are paid $40.00 per day for the first thirty days of a trial and $50.00 for each day thereafter. They also receive $3.00 a day for transportation costs. The $40.00 per day a juror receives for his or her all day service is below the prevailing minimum wage, and the daily $3.00 transportation fee falls far below that required for parking or riding a bus or the subway. 
   These inadequate sums place an undue hardship on those jurors who most need compensation: the self-employed, the commissioned, the temporary workers, and those who work for small employers often making it difficult for litigants to have representative jury panels. While undue hardship is often grounds for deferral or excusal from jury duty, it is important that we limit the financial hardship for those of our citizens engaged in this most important civic duty.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just over 98 years ago, in March 1901, the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia was directed by Senate Resolution to ``report to the Senate plans for the development and improvement of the entire park system of the District of Columbia *.*.* (F)or the purpose of preparing such plans the committee *.*.* may secure the services of such experts as may be necessary for a proper consideration of the subject.'' 
   And secure ``such experts'' the committee assuredly did. The Committee formed what came to be known as the McMillan Commission, named for committee chairman, Senator James McMillan of Michigan. The Commission's membership was a ``who's who'' of late 19th and early 20th century architecture, landscape design, and art: Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., Charles F. McKim, and Augustus St. Gaudens. The Commission traveled that summer to Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, and London, studying the landscapes, architecture, and public spaces of the grandest cities in the world. The McMillan Commission returned and fashioned the city of Washington as we now know it. 
   We are particularly indebted today for the Commission's preservation of the Mall. When the members left for Europe, the Congress had just given the Pennsylvania Railroad a 400-foot wide swath of the Mall for a new station and trackage. It is hard to imagine our city without the uninterrupted stretch of greenery from the Capitol to the Washington Monument, but such would have been the result. Fortunately, when in London, Daniel Burnham was able to convince Pennsylvania Railroad president Cassatt that a site on Massachusetts Avenue would provide a much grander entrance to the city. President Cassatt assented and Daniel Burnham gave us Union Station. 
   But the focus of the Commission's work was the District's park system. The Commission noted in its report:  
   Aside from the pleasure and the positive benefits to health that the people derive from public parks, in a capital city like Washington there is a distinct use of public spaces as the indispensable means of giving dignity to Government buildings and of making suitable connections between the great departments ..... (V)istas and axes; sites for monuments and museums; parks and pleasure gardens; fountains and canals; in a word all that goes to make a city a magnificent and consistent work of art were regarded as essential in the plans made by L'Enfant under the direction of the first President and his Secretary of State.  
   Washington and Jefferson might be disappointed at the affliction now imposed on much of the Capitol Grounds by the automobile. 
   Despite the ready and convenient availability of the city's Metrorail system, an extraordinary number of Capitol Hill employees drive to work. No doubt many must. But must we provide free parking? If there is one lesson learned from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, it is that free goods are always wasted. Free parking is a most powerful incentive to drive to work when the alternative is to pay for public transportation. Furthermore, much as expenses rise to meet income, newly provided parking spaces are instantly filled. At the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue is a scar of angle-parked cars, in parking spaces made available temporarily during construction of the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building. Once completed, spaces in the building's garage would be made available to Senate employees and Pennsylvania Avenue would be restored. Not so. The demand for spaces has simply risen to meet the available supply, and the unit block of the Nation's main street remains a disaster. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to improve the Capitol Grounds through the near-complete elimination of surface parking. As the Architect of the Capitol eliminates these unsightly lots, they will be reconstructed as public parks, landscaped in the fashion of the Capitol Grounds. I envision what I call an arc of park sweeping around the Capitol from Second Street, Northeast, around to the Capitol Reflecting Pool, and thence back to First Street, Southeast. Delaware Avenue between Columbus Circle and Constitution Avenue would be closed to traffic and rebuilt as a pedestrian walkway, a grand pathway to the Capitol from Union Station. 
   Finally, there is still the matter of parking. This legislation authorizes the Architect of the Capitol to construct underground parking facilities, as needed. These facilities, which will undoubtedly be expensive, will be financed simply by charging for the parking, a legitimate user fee.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Power Marketing Administration Reform Act of 1999, a bill to require that the Federal Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) sell electricity at market rates and recover all costs. 
   Mr. President, in 1935 only 15 percent of rural Americans had access to electricity. President Roosevelt's administration established the PMAs to sell power to rural Americans below market rates because so many rural areas could not afford to install the transmission and generation equipment required to provide electricity. Commencement of the massive public works projects such as TVA filled a desperate need for jobs during the Depression years and brought electricity to the many areas of our country which lacked access to this most basic amenity of modern life. 
   The PMAs served an essential function in lifting our nation out of the Depression, Mr. President, but that time has passed. Sixty years after its inception, public power is less expensive and more accessible than ever before. The discounted rates provided by public power are a benefit which goes to a relatively few recipients at a tremendous expense to the American taxpayer. Nearly 60 percent of Federal sales go to just four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Washington, and Oregon. PMAs have failed to recover their operating costs for too long, and it is taxpayers who bear the cost of the discrepancy between cost of generation and consumer rates. This discrepancy has brought about a fiscal shortfall and significant environmental damage. 
   Reports over past years from the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Energy confirm this view. In 1997, for instance, the GAO reported that the Bonneville Power Administration, the Rural Utilities Service, and three other PMAs cost American taxpayers $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1996. In March 1998 the GAO showed that the Federal government incurred a net cost of $1.5 billion from electricity-related activities in the Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western PMAs between 1992 and 1996. Up to $1.4 billion of the approximately $7 billion of Federal investment in assets derived from electricity-related activities in these PMAs is at risk of nonrecovery. 
   The GAO has also reported on fairness in lending to the PMAs. The Federal Treasury incurs approximately 9 percent in debt when lending to the PMAs, but recovers only 3.5 percent from the PMAs on their outstanding debt. This is a loss to the U.S. Treasury of 5.5 percent on interest payments alone. It is taxpayers who are required to account for this interest shortfall. 
   Mr. President, my bill would provide for full cost recovery rates for power sold by the PMAs and the TVA. Under the bill, PMA and TVA rates would be recalculated to conform to market rates and be resubmitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for approval. The bill would also require that PMA and TVA transmission facilities are subject to open-access regulation by the FERC, and that FERC would be authorized to revise such rates when necessary to maintain a competitive environment. Cooperatives and public power entities will be given the right of first refusal of PMA and TVA power at market prices. Revenue accrued from the revisal of these rates will go first to the U.S. Treasury to recover all costs. The residual amount will then be disbursed by formula to the Treasury to mitigate damage to the environment attributed to the operation of PMAs and the TVA, and to support renewable electricity generating resources. 
   Mr. President, the time has come for public power to be held accountable for the use of public dollars. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation intended to help students in those States that do not fare well in academic comparisons with students from other nations. It authorizes grants to States whose students continue to be outperformed by students in a majority of the nations which took the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS. 
   TIMSS showed us that indisputably our students do not fare well in international competition. The most striking finding was that American students do worse, comparative speaking, the longer they are in our schools. Our fourth graders performed in the middle range of scores in math and were second to Japan in science. Our seniors are bringing up the rear. 
   American high school seniors performed among the lowest of the 21 countries in the study. In mathematics our students were outperformed by those of 14 countries, were statistically similar to 4 countries, and outperformed only 2 countries. In science our students were outperformed by those of 11 countries, were similar to 7 countries, and again outperformed only 2 countries. Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and Singapore did not participate in the twelfth grade study. Just as well, for morale purposes. Their students embarrassed our students at the fourth and eighth grade levels. 
   The two questions that come to mind are what did we expect and what are we to do? 
   Our expectations were high at the beginning of the decade. In September 1989, President Bush met with the Nation's governors in Charlottesville to set out goals for education. Four months later he devoted a sizable portion of his State of the Union Address to setting forth the agreed-upon goals. Some were lofty, harmless, and unmeasurable: ``By the year 2000 every child must start school ready to learn.'' Most children are. ``Every adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen.'' We know what it means to be a skilled mechanic, but a skilled citizen? Others were lofty, measurable, and the product of a leakage of reality that was stupefying then as now. First and foremost that ``By the year 2000, U.S. students would be first in the world in math and science achievement.'' 
   President Bush was speaking to Congress in a vocabulary created in the 1960's by James S. Coleman, then professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University. The ``Coleman Report'' introduced the language of educational outputs. Previously we spoke of inputs: student-teacher ration, money per student, and such. Coleman introduced the idea of outputs, and measuring our standing in the world is one such. 
   With Coleman we had a new vocabulary for education, but sadly not a new understanding. The first finding of his remarkable report was ``that the schools are remarkably similar in the effect they have on the achievement of their pupils when the socioeconomic background of the students is taken into account.'' This was seismic. Family background is more important than 
   schools. But 24 years later, in 1990, it had not been learned, or could still be ignored. 
   Stating that our goal was to become the leader in math and science was folly. I wrote in the Winter 1991 Public Interest that ``on no account could the President's goals--the quantified, specific goals--reasonably be deemed capable of achievement.'' I cited the general decline in high school graduation rates that began in 1970 and the lack of success we had in meeting very similar goals President Reagan set out in 1984. Most basically, we were ignoring Coleman's findings that we would have to start with the American family before we could expect improvements in American students. 
   I concluded the Public Interest piece by saying, ``If, as forecast here, the year 2000 arrives and the United States is nowhere near meeting the educational goals set out in 1990, the potential will nonetheless exist for serous debate as to why what was basically a political plan went wrong. We might even consider how it might have turned out better.'' 
   Our children will not meet the goals set for math and science leadership. How can we help them do better? The TIMSS report says that it is too early to draw specific conclusions about how to improve performance in twelfth grade, that it will take some time to analyze all the data therein. I should thing the higher education community would be at the forefront of this effort, for the colleges are the most immediately affected by undereducated high school graduates. One student in five takes remedial courses in at least one subject. 
   Without giving short shrift to helping our elementary school students, we must focus on finding ways to keep them at the level they have achieved by fourth grade as they continue through school. This bill would make a small contribution to that effort by providing grants of $500,000 to $1,000,000 to states whose students collectively fall below the median score among the nations whose eighth graders retake the TIMSS tests this year or next. The money would be used to improve mathematics or science education. The grants would be awarded competitively; states whose students' scores qualify them must propose constructive ways of using the grants, such as for equipment, teacher training, or other purposes. 
   The Department of Education last year released Linking the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Third International Mathematics and Science Study: Eight grade results. This study showed how the states' NAEP scores and other nations' TIMSS scores could be compared. The Department of Education would use the same process to determine where states rank in comparision with the upcoming results of the TIMSS exams by a new group of eight graders around the world. Those states whose students score below the median in either math or science would be eligible to apply for these grants.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is intended to shed a little more light on the consequences of a census that is not adjusted for the undercount. The bill requires the Secretary of Commerce to notify each governor how much more or less Federal funding in his or her state would receive each fiscal year following a decennial census if the census were adjusted for the undercount and the adjusted figures were used in grant allocation formulas. 
   This bill is not directly related to the controversy over sampling. The sampling proposal made by the Bureau of the Census is one way to eliminate the undercount, but there are other less controversial methods. Not uncontroversial, but less so. 
    Mr. President, the taking of a census goes back centuries. I quote from the King James version of the Bible, chapter two of Luke: ``And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed (or enrolled, according to the footnote) ..... And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city.'' The early censuses were taken to enable the ruler or ruling government to tax or raise an army. 
   The first census for more sociological reasons was taken in Nuremberg in 1449. So it was not a new idea to the Founding Fathers when they wrote it into the Constitution to facilitate fair taxation and accurate apportionment of the House of Representatives, the latter of which was the foundation of the Great Compromise. 
   The Constitution says in Article I, Section 2:  
   Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made  within three years of the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall direct by law.  
   Opponents of adjustment often say that the Constitution calls for an ``actual enumeration'', and this requires an actual headcount rather than any statistical inference about those we know we miss every time. That seems to take the phrase out of context. I note that we have not taken an ``actual enumeration'' the way the Founding Fathers envisioned since 1960, after which enumerators going to every door were replaced with mail-in responses. The Constitution provides for a postal system, but did not direct that the census be taken by mail. Yet we do it that way. 
   Statistical work in the 1940s demonstrated that we can estimate the undercount, the number of people the census misses. The estimate for 1940 was 5.4 percent of the population. After decreasing steadily to 1.2 percent in 1980, the 1990 undercount increased to 1.8 percent, or more than four million people. 
   More significantly, the undercount is not distributed evenly. The differential undercount, as it is known, of minorities was 4.4 percent for Blacks, 5.0 percent for Hispanics, 2.3 percent for Asian-Pacific islanders, and 4.5 percent for Native Americans, compared with 1.2 percent for non-Hispanic whites. The difference between the black and non-black undercount was the largest since 1940. By disproportionately missing minorities, we deprive them of equal representation in Congress and of proportionate funding from Federal programs based on population. The Census Bureau estimates that the total undercount will reach 1.9 percent in 2000 if the 1990 methods are used instead of sampling. 
    Mr. President, I have some history with the undercount issue. In 1966 when I became Director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard, I asked Professor David Heer to work with me in planning a conference to publicize the non-white undercount in the 1960 census and to foster concern about the problems of obtaining a full enumeration, especially of the urban poor. I ask that my forward to the report from that conference be printed following my remarks, for it is, save for some small numerical changes, disturbingly still relevant. 
   My hope is that if governors and other interested parties learn the financial consequences of the undercount, support may grow for correcting it. It is regrettable that we don't do it, simply because we should. But if a yearly reminder of how the undercount affects formula grant programs helps change some minds, it is worth the effort.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my friend and colleague Senator SCHUMER, a bill to extend the authorization for the Upper Delaware River Citizens Advisory Committee and authorize the construction of a visitors center. The Upper Delaware is a 73-mile stretch of free flowing water between Hancock and Sparrowbush, New York along the Pennsylvania border. The area is home to the Zane Gray Museum and to Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct, which is believed to be the oldest existing wire cable suspension bridge. The Upper Delaware is an ideal location for canoeing, kayaking, rafting, tubing, sightseeing, and fishing. 
   In 1987 the Secretary of the Interior approved a management plan for the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River which called for the development of a visitors center at the south end of the river corridor. It would be owned and constructed by the National Park Service. In 1993 New York State authorized a lease with the Park Service for the construction of a visitor center on State-owned land in the town of Deerpark in the vicinity of Mongaup. This bill allows the Secretary to enter into such a lease and to construct and operate the visitor center.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will provide compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to Tommy Sansone, Jr. Tommy was injured by a DPT vaccine in June 1994 and continues to suffer seizures and brain damage to this day. Tommy is the untended and helpless victim of a drug designed to help him. He needs our help because while the Vaccine Injury Program is meant to make reparations for these injuries, it is hampered by regulations that challenge the worthiest of claims. 
   Back in 1986, Congress passed the Vaccine Injury Act to take care of vaccine injuries because the shots that we required our children to get were not as safe as they could have been. Since the program was established, more than 1100 children have been compensated. Over the first ten years, a great percentage of those with seizures or brain damage or other symptoms were recognized to be DPT-injured, and, they were summarily compensated. But, by 1995, the Institutes of Medicine (IOM) and others concluded that because the symptoms had no unique clinical profile, they were not necessarily DPT injuries. So, HHS changed the definitions of encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain), and of vaccine injury. Those new definitions had unintended consequences. Now, the program that we set up to be expeditious and fair, uses criteria that are so strict that the fund from which these claims are paid pays fewer claims than before and the fund has ballooned to over $1.2 billion. As a result, families of children like Tommy find it nearly impossible to win a claim against the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program is failing its mission. 
   To be clear, VICP is not a medical insurance policy. The program is not designed to take care of those who cannot get or receive care. VICP is a compensation program, where the government makes amends for a failure in the system that it established. Claims are  paid from a trust fund established from surcharges that are paid on each shot a child receives. The fund serves as an insurance policy against vaccine injuries. But, following the regulatory changes made in 1995, the government is not recognizing even the most legitimate of claims. We are failing the very children we are trying to protect. 
   Over the years after his DPT shot (the combined shot for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), Tommy suffers severe seizures 
   and from brain damage that has hampered his mental development. When he wakes in the morning or from a nap, either his mother or father is at his side waiting for the inevitable. Tommy's eyes tear and his face cringes in agony as his entire body is wracked with a muscle-clenching seizure. His parents hold him helplessly until the seizure subsides, sometimes for as long as five minutes. Tommy will then look into his mother's loving eyes, and say, ``No more, mommy. Make them stop.'' 
   At the very least, Tommy's parents know that the strain of vaccine used on Tommy is now being phased out because of the rash of adverse reactions it caused. But this does nothing for Tommy or his parents, who have been in and out of countless hospitals, and consulted with doctors and experts at the Centers for Disease Control and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Their claim for compensation was dismissed in the Federal Court of Claims, but they and Tommy's doctor feel (and I agree with them) that they should have known more about the potential dangers of the DPT vaccine that Tommy received on June 1, 1994. No one told them that there was a chance that the DPT vaccine could cause such trauma. No one told them about ``hot lots,'' an unofficial term for a batch of shots that has had an abundance of adverse reactions. The lot that Tommy received is known to have had 44 such reactions from March-November 1994, including 2 deaths. These are reactions beyond the short-lived fever and rashes that accompany many vaccines. Their doctor didn't know about the availability of the ``new'' acellular strain of pertussis vaccine that is replacing the whole cell version that had been used since the 1930s. Sure, it costs a couple of dollars more, but who wouldn't choose that for their child--given the choice? 
   Tommy's claim would have been covered before the 1995 changes, but that is not the case any longer. He's the victim of a bad DPT vaccine, yet his case continues to be denied because the first seizure didn't occur within 72 hours of the shot. It occurred 18 days later, and he suffers to this day. Tommy also has brain damage (encephalopathy) because of the DPT shot, but it doesn't fit that new definition either. He cried and moaned at a shrill pitch from the moment of the shot until his first seizure, but that doesn't matter either. For the first six months of his life, Tommy was in all ways normal, but for 4 and a half years since the DPT vaccine he and his family have suffered. As a parent and grandparent, I would do anything to protect my family from such pain and suffering. Tom Sansone, Sr. has done everything he knows how to help his son. Now he has turned to me because he knows I am in a position to help and I will not relent in my pursuit of relief for the Sansone family. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program should take care of Tommy, but it doesn't. This bill will enable us to ensure that it does.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator BOB SMITH of New Hampshire, in introducing a bill to allow certain members of the clergy who are currently exempt from Social Security an open season to ``opt in.'' 
   Under section 1402 of the Internal Revenue Code, a member of the clergy who is conscientiously, or because of religious principles, opposed to participation in a public insurance program generally, may elect to be exempt from Social Security coverage and payroll taxes by filing an application of exemption with the Internal Revenue Service within two years of beginning the ministry. To be eligible for the exemption, the member of the clergy must be an ``individual who is a fully ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, or a member of a religious order who has not taken a vow of poverty.'' Once elected this exemption is irrevocable. 
   This legislation would allow members of the clergy who are not eligible for Social Security a two-year open season in which they could revoke their exemption. At the time of exemption, many clergy did not fully understand the ramifications of their actions, and it is not until later in life, when they are blocked from coverage, that they realize their need for Social Security and Medicare. This decision to ``opt in'' would be irrevocable and all post-election earnings would be subject to the payroll tax and credited for the purposes of Social Security and Medicare. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation would affect approximately 3,500 members of the clergy and would increase revenues by about $45 million over the next five years. Similar legislation was passed both in the 1977 Social Security Amendments (Section 316) and in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Section 1704). 
   This bill has been endorsed by the United States Catholic Conference and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. It is a simple but much-needed measure, and I urge every member of the Senate to support it. 
   By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. SCHUMER, Mrs. BOXER, and Mr. CLELAND).

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills which will make significant reductions in the pollutants which most degrade our national air quality. The Acid Deposition and Ozone Control Act of 1999 and the Clean Gasoline Act of 1999 would reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions through national ``cap and trade'' programs, and reduce the sulfur content in gasoline, respectively. 
   We have come a long way since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Since that last reauthorization effort, we have successfully reduced emissions of the pollutants we set out to regulate and tremendously expanded our understanding of the causes and effects of major environmental problems such as acid deposition, ozone pollution, decreased visibility, and eutrophication of coastal waters. We can be proud of these accomplishments, but we have along way to go yet. Since 1990 we have learned, for instance, that the sulfur dioxide (SO  
   2) emissions reductions required under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are insufficient to prevent continued damage to human health and sensitive ecosystems. We have also learned that nitrogen oxides (NO 
   X), which we largely ignored nine years ago, are significant contributors to our nation's many air quality deficiencies. And finally, we have demonstrated that legislation containing regulatory flexibility and market incentives is preferable to the traditional ``command and control'' approach. My bills seek to build upon this new body of knowledge by combining the best and most current scientific evaluation of our environmental needs with the most effective and efficient regulatory framework.
   The scientific data indicate that the 1990 Amendments did not go far enough to prevent continued human health and ecosystem damage from SO  
   2 and NO 
   X. We now know that ozone pollution, caused in large part by NO 
   X emissions, can have a terrible effect on human respiratory functions. The Harvard University School of Public Health's 1996 study of ozone pollution established a strong link between ground level ozone pollution and 30,000-50,000 emergency room visits during the 1993 and 1994 ozone seasons. Ecosystems continue to suffer, too. The 1998 report of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) indicates that sulfate concentrations of surface waters in the Southern Appalachian Mountains have been increasing steadily for more than a decade, making for an increasingly inhospitable environment for trout and other fish species. There are other types of problems, too. Visitors to our nation's national parks and wilderness areas find that it is more difficult than ever before to enjoy these scenic vistas. It is becoming increasingly difficult to see through the haze which clogs the air in our national parks.
   Scientists have produced volumes of scientific literature on ozone, acid deposition, regional haze, and other air quality problems over the past decade. We now know much more about the causes of these problems than we did in 1990. We know that NO  
   X emissions, which we underestimated as a cause of air pollution, in fact play an important role in the formation of ground level ozone, acide deposition, and nitrogen deposition. We know that sulfur dioxide not only contributes significantly to acid deposition, but also to reduced visibility in our great scenic vistas.
   The most recent NAPAP report reflects this changing body of knowledge. The NAPAP report notes that NO  
   X make a highly significant contribution to the occurrence of acid deposition and nitrogen saturation on both land and water. According to NAPAP, a majority of Adirondack lakes have not shown recovery from high acidity levels first detected decades ago. Forests, streams, and rivers outside of New York, in the Front Range of Colorado, the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, and the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains of California are also now showing the effects of acidification and nitrogen saturation.
   And mountains are not the only ecosystems affected. The Ecological Society of America, the nation's leading professional society of ecologists, issued a report in late 1997 which notes that airborne deposition of nitrogen accounts for a significant percentage of the nitrogen content of coastal water bodies stretching from the Gulf Coast up and around the entire length of the eastern seaboard. The Chesapeake Bay is believed to receive 27 percent of its  nitrogen load directly from the atmosphere. For Tampa Bay, the figure is 28 percent. For the coastal waters of the Newport River in North Carolina, more than 35 percent. 
   Clearly, any serious effort to address these problems must address NO  
   X emissions and further reduce SO 
   2 emissions. My bills address the major sources of NO 
   X and SO 
   2. The Acide Deposition and Ozone Control Act of 1998 would affect ``stationary sources'' of NO 
   X
   and SO  
   2, mainly electric utilities, and the Clean Gasoline Act of 1999 would affect ``mobile sources'', mainly cars and trucks, of NOx and other tailpipe emissions.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that will amend several parts of our existing immigration laws, specifically those that fall under the umbrella of the Immigration and Nationality Act. These changes are aimed at making our immigration laws not only fairer but more efficient. 
   The first change will amend Section 240(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In 1996, the laws applying to criminal aliens were made overly restrictive. For example, all persons guilty of aggravated felonies--the number of crimes that fall into this category was greatly expanded and made retroactive in 1996--are now ineligible for virtually any form of leniency. This means that many people, who have led exemplary lives for many years, now find themselves deportable for offenses committed decades ago. They are also subject to mandatory detention and have no chance for an immigration judge to evaluate their individual circumstances. This is unfair. 
   My second change amends Section 240A.(1)(a) of the same act. At present, the Attorney General has the authority to stop the deportation of a lawful resident who has been in this country for seven years. The 1996 changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act now bar this relief for anyone convicted of an aggravated felony. This provision has led to many injustices because of the sheer number of offenses that are now aggravated felonies. I propose that we deny relief only to those who have been convicted of aggravated felonies that carry a penalty of five years or more in prison. 
   In conjunction with this, I propose that we amend Section 240A(d)(1). This provision says that the time for determining the above seven years residency period stops when an aggravated crime is or was committed. This has barred relief for people with ancient convictions but many good years of citizenship since then. This should be changed so that the countable residence period stops only when formal immigration charges are filed because of the crime and not when the crime is or was committed. 
   Another of my amendments made the transitional rules permanent governing Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This section now requires that all criminal aliens be detained from the time of their release on criminal charges until their deportation hearing. This requirement was so harsh and expensive that Congress provided a two-year transition period, ending on October 1998, that allowed immigration judges to use their discretion in evaluating whether or not an individual was a risk of flight or a danger to the community. This discretion should be continued because it is fair and because it will empty our jails of those who will return for their hearings and who pose no threat to our communities. 
   I also propose that we restore judicial review in deportation cases. The 1996 reforms ostensibly banned criminal aliens from seeking a judicial review of their cases. The courts have reached many different outcomes over this ban and the situation, frankly, is a mess. I believe that criminal aliens should have the right to have their convictions reviewed by a United States circuit court of appeals. 
   Similiarly, I believe that aliens should have the right to legal counsel when they are faced with removal. The law now provides that an alien is entitled to counsel if he can afford to retain one. In reality, this has created great expense and delay for the Federal government because cases are often continued for lengthy periods while aliens try to find pro bono counsel or counsel they can afford. My bill creates a pilot program in selected Immigration and Nationalization districts  where free, expert counsel would be provided to aliens. A study of the impact on overall Department of Justice costs would be required to decide if this program should be extended nationwide. 
   My last amendments are concerned with who should be admitted to this country. The most objectionable element of our current admission system is the delay--estimated to be five years--for a vitally important family reunion category, part A of the second family-based preference (FS-2A). This category, for admission of spouses and minor children of lawful, permanent residents, is now limited to 114,000 per year. Nuclear families should live together. To obtain more spaces for the FS-2A preference, the diversity lottery visas should be eliminated, freeing 55,000 spaces annually. 
   Lastly, I believe that the EB-5 preference for investors should be repealed. The rich should not be able to buy their way into this country. This category was added in 1990 to encourage investment. Instead, this provision has led to the creation of some highly questionable investment schemes that have cost the Immigration and Naturalization Service untold hours and resources in attempting to reign them in. Moreover, the evidence of new jobs being created is very thin and not worth the administrative costs.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Y2K State and Local Government Assistance Programs (GAP) Act of 1999.'' I am pleased to have Senators ROBERT F. BENNETT (R-UT) and CHRISTOPHER J. DODD (D-CT), the Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, as original cosponsors of this legislation. This bill provides a matching grant for states to work on the millennium computer problem. While the Federal government and large corporations are expected to have their computers intact on January 1, 2000, state governments lag behind in fixing the problem. Failure of state computers could have a devastating effect on those individuals who rely on essential state-administered poverty programs, such as Medicaid, food stamps, and child welfare and support. These individuals cannot go a day, a week, or a month without these programs working properly. I am hopeful that the bill Senators BENNETT, DODD, and I are introducing today will help states fix their computers, particularly those computers used to administer Federal welfare programs. 
   It has been almost three years since I asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to study and produce a report on the implications of the Y2K problem. CRS issued the report to me with the following comments: ``The Year 2000 problem is indeed serious, and fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the Federal government, as well as the private sector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, 2000.'' I wrote the President on July 31, 1996 to relay the findings of CRS and make him aware of this grave problem. In the letter, I warned the president of the ``extreme negative economic consequences of the Y2K Time Bomb,'' and suggested that ``a presidential aide be appointed to take responsibility for assuring that all Federal agencies, including the military, be Y2K compliant by January 1, 1999 [leaving a year for `testing'] and that all commercial and industrial firms doing business with the Federal government must also be compliant by that date.'' 
   Since that time, the government has taken some of the necessary steps to combat the millennium bug. The President created the Year 2000 Conversion Council and appointed John Koskinen to head it. The Senate, under the leadership of Chairman BENNETT and Vice Chairman DODD, established the Special Committee on the Y2K problem. And Representative STEPHEN HORN (R-CA) continues to due an excellent job in keeping the government focused on the issue. Thanks in part to the work of these individuals, we have made tremendous progress on the millennium bug. Y2K experts have become optimistic enough to dismiss doomsday predictions of widespread power outages, telephone failures, and grounded jetliners in the U.S. 
   Businesses and Federal agencies that were lagging in their repair work last year have redoubled their efforts in recent months; telephone and electric networks, which are crucial to the operation of almost all large computer systems, are in better-than-expected shape; and technicians have found remarkably few date-related problems with the electronic circuitry in a host of other ``day-to-day'' devices, from subway cars to elevators. 
   Mr. Koskinen predicts that the bug's impact will be similar to a powerful winter storm--minor inconveniences for many people and severe, but short-term, disruptions for some communities. I agree with Mr. Koskinen and other Y2K experts. I do not expect the four horsemen, armed with flood and catastrophe, to be riding in on January 1, 2000. But experts agree that state governments are not making sufficient progress in fixing the problem. It is for this reason that Senators BENNETT, DODD, and I are introducing this bill today. 
   The ``Y2K State and Local GAP Act of 1999'' provides funding for states to address the Y2K problem. The bill stipulates that certain Federal poverty programs--Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Women, Infants, and Children (WIC),  food stamps, child support enforcement, child care, and child welfare programs--be listed as priority programs. The people dependent on these programs will be the most adversely affected by the problem if state computers crash. To be eligible for Federal support money, states must submit a plan describing their Y2K development and implementation program. A state that is awarded a grant under this legislation is required to expend $1 for every $2 provided by the Federal government. The matching requirement will give states and local governments incentive to work on their computers. And the numbers indicate that states need a great amount of incentive and help on this issue. 
   According to a National Association of State Information Resource Executives survey, some states have not yet completed work on any of their critical systems, and those systems responsible for administering poverty programs are a real concern. A November 1998 General Accounting Office (GAO) report found that most of the systems used to administer poverty programs are not ready for the new millennium--84 percent of Medicaid systems, 76 percent of food stamps, and 75 percent of TANF systems were not compliant. Since these programs are administered at the state and local level, it is these computers which ensure that benefit payments are on time and accurate. Given the lack of means of those assisted by the programs, the possible disruption of benefit payments should be a cause for concern--a billion dollars in benefits payments might not be delivered because of the millennial malady. 
   Historically the fin de sie 2cle has caused quite a stir. Prophets, prelates, monks, mathematicians, and soothsayers warn Anno Domini 2000 will draw the world to its catastrophic conclusion. I am confident that the Y2K problem will not play a part in this. But we must continue to work on this problem with purpose and dedication. Disraeli wrote: ``Man is not the creature of circumstances. Circumstances are the creatures of men.'' We created the Y2K problem and we must fix it.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce this bill to repeal an unprecedented provision--unprecedented until the 104th Congress--to tamper with the constitutional protection of habeas corpus. 
   The provision reads:  
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-moynihan-ny-18-19990119</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Let me read excerpts from the letter:  
   The habeas corpus provisions in the Senate bill *.*.* are unconstitutional. Though intended in large part to expedite the death penalty review process, the litigation and constitutional rulings will in fact delay and frustrate the imposition of the death penalty *.*.* 
   The constitutional infirmities *.*.* violate the Habeas Corpus Suspension Clause, the judicial powers of Article III, and due process *.*.*. 
   *.*.* A measure is subject to proscription under the due process clause if it ``offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,'' as viewed by ``historical practice.''  
   That language is Medina versus California, a 1992 decision. To continue,  
   Independent federal court review of the constitutionality of state criminal judgments has existed since the founding of the Nation, first by writ of error, and since 1867 by writ of habeas corpus. 
   Nothing else is more deeply rooted in America's legal traditions and conscience. There is no clause in which ``a state court's incorrect legal determination has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable.''  
   That is Justice O'Connor, in Wright versus West. She goes on, as the attorneys general quote. ``We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have an independent obligation to say what the law is.'' 
   If I may interpolate, she is repeating the famous injunction of Justice Marshall in Marbury versus Madison. The attorneys general go on to say,  
   Indeed Alexander Hamilton argued, in The Federalist No. 84, that the existence of just two protections--habeas corpus and the prohibition against ex post facto laws--obviated the need to add a Bill of Rights to the Constitution.  
   The letter from the Attorneys General continues, but that is the gist of it. I might point out that there was, originally, an objection to ratification of the Constitution, with those objecting arguing that there had to be a Bill of Rights added. Madison wisely added one during the first session of the first Congress. But he and Hamilton and Jay, as authors of The ``Federalist Papers,'' argued that with habeas corpus and the prohibition against ex post facto laws in the Constitution, there would be no need even for a Bill of Rights. We are glad that, in the end, we do have one. But their case was surely strong, and it was so felt by the framers. 
   To cite Justice O'Connor again: ``A state court's incorrect legal determination has never been allowed to stand because it was reasonable.'' 
   Justice O'Connor went on: ``We have always held that Federal courts, even on habeas, have an independent obligation to say what the law is.'' 
   Mr. President, we can fix this now. Or, as the Attorneys General state, we can ``wait through several years of litigation and confusion before being sent back to the drawing board.'' I fear that we will not fix it now. 
   We Americans think of ourselves as a new nation. We are not. Of the countries that existed in 1914, there are only eight which have not had their form of government changed by violence since then. Only the United Kingdom goes back to 1787 when the delegates who drafted our Constitution established this Nation, which continues to exist. In those other nations, sir, a compelling struggle took place, from the middle of the 18th century until the middle of the 19th century, and beyond into the 20th, and even to the end of the 20th in some countries, to establish those basic civil liberties which are the foundation of political liberties and, or those, none is so precious as habeas corpus, the ``Great Writ.'' 
   Here we are trivializing this treasure, putting in jeopardy a tradition of protection of individual rights by Federal courts that goes back to our earliest foundation. And the virus will spread. Why are we in such a rush to amend our Constitution? Why do we tamper with provisions as profound to our traditions and liberty as habeas corpus? The Federal courts do not complain. It may be that because we have enacted this, there will be some prisoners who are executed sooner than they otherwise would have been. You may take satisfaction in that or not, as you choose, but we have begun to weaken a tenet of justice at the very base of our liberties. The virus will spread. 
   This is new. It is profoundly disturbing. It is terribly dangerous. If I may have the presumption to join in the judgment of four Attorneys General, Mr. Civiletti, Mr. Levi, Mr. Katzenbach, and Mr. Richardson--and I repeat that I have served in administrations with three of them--this matter is unconstitutional and should be repealed from law. 
   Seventeen years ago, June 6, 1982, to be precise, I gave the commencement address at St. John University Law School in Brooklyn. I spoke of the proliferation of court-curbing bills at that time. I remarked:  
   *.*.* some people--indeed, a great many people--have decided that they do not agree with the Supreme Court and that they are not satisfied to Debate, Legislate, Litigate. 
   They have embarked upon an altogether new and I believe quite dangerous course of action. A new triumvirate hierarchy has emerged. Convene (meaning the calling of a constitutional convention), Overrule (the passage of legislation designed to overrule a particular Court ruling, when the Court's ruling was based on an interpretation of the Constitution), and Restrict (to restrict the jurisdiction of certain courts to decide particular kinds of cases). 
   Perhaps the most pernicious of these is the attempt to restrict courts' jurisdictions, for it is *.*.* profoundly at odds with our Nation's customs and political philosophy. 
   It is a commonplace that our democracy is characterized by majority rule and minority rights. Our Constitution vests majority rule in the Congress and the President while the courts protect the rights of the minority. 
   While the legislature makes the laws, and the executive enforces them, it is the courts that tell us what the laws say and whether they conform to the Constitution. 
   This notion of judicial review has been part of our heritage for nearly two hundred years. There is not a more famous case in American jurisprudence than Marbury v. Madison and few more famous dicta than Chief Justice Marshall's that ``It is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.'' 
   But in order for the court to interpret the law, it must decide cases. If it cannot hear certain cases, then it cannot protect certain rights.  
   We need to deal resolutely with terrorism. And we have. But under the guise of combating terrorism, we have diminished the fundamental civil liberties that Americans have enjoyed for two centuries; therefore the terrorists will have won.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to establish a cultural zone commemorating the Harlem Renaissance, one of this country's greatest cultural, literary, and musical movements. Pioneered by W.E.B. Dubois, Alain Locke, and James Weldon Johnson, the Harlem Renaissance was at the forefront of this country's intellectual, literary, and artistic development in the 1920s. Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, Jean Toomer, and Wallace Thurman were among this movement's most gifted writers. The Harlem Renaissance also included the music of Duke Ellington, the theatrical productions of Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and the rich nightlife of the Cotton Club, the Savoy, and Connie's Inn. 
   This bill empowers the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, to conduct a study to determine how best to memorialize this great movement and to preserve and maintain its rich history. Working and cooperating with the appropriate state and local authorities, I am confident that we can properly recognize and preserve one of this country's foremost cultural, literary, and historical periods.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill to provide access to health insurance for individuals between the ages of 55-65. These individuals are too young for Medicare, not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, and in many cases, are forced into early retirement or pushed out of their jobs in corporate downsizing. 
   The ``Medicare Early Access Act'' is based on the President's three-part initiative announced last January. The bill is a targeted proposal to give older Americans under 65 new options to obtain health insurance coverage. Many of these Americans have worked hard all their lives, but, through no fault of their own, find themselves uninsured just as they are entering the years when the risk of serious illness is increasing. This legislation attempts to bridge the gap in coverage between years when persons are in the labor force and the age (65) when they become eligible for Medicare. 
   The bill has three parts: (1) It enables persons between ages 62 and 64 to buy into Medicare by paying a full premium; (2) It provides displaced workers over age 55 access to Medicare by offering a similar Medicare buy-in option; and (3) It extends COBRA coverage to persons 55 and over whose employers withdraw retiree health benefits. 
   The program is largely self-financing and is substantially paid for by premiums from the beneficiaries themselves. There is a modest cost to the buy-in proposal for 62-65-year-olds because participants would pay the premium in two parts: most of the cost would be paid by the individual up front and a smaller amount would be paid after they turn 65 years-old. Medicare would in effect ``loan'' participants the second part of the premium until they reach 65, when they would make small monthly payments in addition to their regular Medicare Part B premium. The financing of the program is carefully walled off from the Medicare Part A and Part B Trust Funds, to ensure that it will not adversely impact the existing program. 
   In 1998, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of this bill found no impact on the Medicare Part A or Part B Trust Funds. CBO also predicted that about 410,000 individuals would participate (or 33 percent more than first estimated by the Administration). Finally, CBO estimated that the post-65 premium that people ages 62-65 would pay would be only $10 per month per year--$6 per month, or $72 less per year, than the Administration estimated. 
   Mr. President, the problem of health insurance for the near elderly is getting worse. Congress should act now to provide valuable coverage for these individuals.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce today a bill to revise the formula for determining the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. Medicaid services and associated administrative costs are financed jointly by the Federal government and the States. The formula for the Federal share of a State's payments for services, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), was established when Medicaid was created as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965. 
   The FMAP is a somewhat exotic creature, derived from the Hill-Burton Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946, specifically designed to provide a higher Federal matching rate for states with lower state funds, as measured by per capital income. A Senate colleague once described it to me as the South's revenge for the Civil War. 
   The Federal government's share depends upon the square of the ratio of state per capita income to national per capita income. Per capita income is a proxy but not the only proxy for measuring the States' relative fiscal capacity and its population's need for assistance. In March 1982, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations stated that,  
   *.*.*.the use of a single index, resident per capita income, to measure fiscal capacity, seriously misrepresents the actual ability of many governments to raise revenue. Because states tax a wide range of economic activities other than the income of their residents, the per capita income measure fails to account for sources of revenue to which income is only related in part. This misrepresentation results in the systematic over and understatement of the ability of many states to raise revenue. In addition, the recent evidence suggests that per capital income has deteriorated as a measure of capacity.*.*.*  
   Squaring the ration of state per capita income to national per capita income exaggerates the differences between States with regard to this inadequate proxy for both state wealth and of population in need of assistance. At a commencement address in 1977 at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, I proposed a change to the Hill-Burton formula by suggesting that the ``square'' in the formula be changed to the ``square root.'' The idea has not caught on. 
   However, I remain hopeful. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a provision that increased the FMAP rate for Alaska. My colleagues in the Committee on Finance included this provision as an amendment in Committee Mark-up. The provision increased Alaska's FMAP rate from 50 percent to 59.8 percent to reflect the higher cost of living relative to the national average. For states with a higher cost of living, the per capita income proxy systematically underestimates the state's population in need and overstates its relative capacity to raise revenues. As conferees, we posited:  
   The current methodology for calculating match rates, per capita income, is a poor and inadequate measure of the states' needs and abilities to participate in the Medicaid program. The conferees note that the poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii, for example, are different than those for the rest of the nation but there is no variation from the national calculation in the FMAP. The increase in Alaska's FMAP demonstrates there is a recognition that a more accurate measurement is needed in the program.  
   The General Accounting Office (GAO) has studied the formula inequity for the past 
   several years. In testimony before the Committee on Finance in 1995, GAO concluded:  
   The current formula has not moderated disparities across states with respect to the populations and benefits Medicaid covers and the relative financial burden states bear in funding their programs. Our work over the years shows that the use of per capita income to reflect a state's wealth sometimes overstates or understates the size of a state's poverty population and its financial resources.  
   The legislation that I introduce today--The Equitable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage Act of 1999--would provide a more accurate and equitable formula by using more precise measures of a state's relative capacity to raise revenue--or its wealth--and its share of the population in need. The original concept is preserved: The goal of the matching formula is to offset the imbalance between state resources and the number of people in need in the state. I call this the state fiscal imbalance. A state with a larger share of resources compared to its share of need is in a stronger fiscal position than a state with higher needs and fewer resources. The formula would measure the imbalance relative to its share of the national average: the state's fiscal imbalance is its share of the nation's resources compared to its share of the nation's population in need. 
   State Share of Financing Resources. Per capita income only reflects a portion of a state's potential revenue. Perhaps in the 1950's and 1960's, per capita income was the best available indicator of state's wealth. Currently, the Treasury Department estimates each state's total taxable resources or TTR. In 1994, TTR replaced per capita income in the formula for distributing funds under the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services block grant. This proposed formula compares the state's TTR to sum of all states' TTRs. Funding capacity would be adjusted to account for the difference in regional health care costs. This provides a more accurate reflection of a state's ability to purchase comparable services with similar tax efforts. The health care price index is based on the Medicare hospital payment adjuster that accounts for geographic wage differences and on a proxy for office space costs. 
   The Population-in-Need. The number of persons in need of public assistance would be measured by the state's population living below the poverty level. Per capita income--or the average mean income--is a particularly poor measure of poverty. An average income measure skews a state's situation if a state has extreme differences in income levels among its residents, such as a state with a high portion of residents with high-incomes and a high portion of residents with low-incomes. Despite similar per capita incomes, New York has a poverty rate that is nearly 50 percent greater than in Massachusetts, according to GAO. 
   The EFMAP would also use adjusted poverty levels to reflect regional variation in cost of living. Without a cost of living adjustment, the national poverty level underestimates what constitutes poverty in New York, with a cost of living 13 percent above the national average. In addition, the state's adjusted poverty count would be weighted to account for higher cost populations. For example, health care costs for the elderly can be about two and a half to three and a half times that for adults and six to eight times the cost for children. 
   Currently, New York's FMAP is 50 percent. This proposed formula with more accurate and equitable measures of wealth and need would provide New York with a 70 percent matching rate. In State Fiscal Year 1998-1999, this would yield $6.5 billion in additional federal Medicaid funds for New York. In fact, several other states and the District of Columbia would receive a greater matching rate under this bill. 
   In a response to a request from both then-Senator D'Amato and me in 1997, GAO determined that had New York had a similar equitable formula, the state would have received between $3.4 billion and $6.5 billion in additional federal assistance during the period of 1989 through 1996. These additional federal funds would by no means eliminate the existing $18 billion deficit in the balance of payments that New York annually has each year. However, it would be a start, and an important first step toward correcting a longstanding inequity in the Federal government's balance of payments with the states.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Presidents, I rise today to introduce the Poverty  Data Correction Act of 1999, a bill to require that any data relating to the incidence of poverty in subnational areas be corrected for the differences in the cost of living in those areas. This legislation would correct a longstanding inequity and would provide us with more accurate information on the number of Americans living in poverty. 
   Residents of states such as New York and Connecticut earn more, on average,than do residents of Mississippi or Alabama. But they also must spend more. One need only try to rent an apartment in New York City to understand this. Yet, we have a national poverty threshold adjusted only by family size and composition, not by where the family lives. A family of four just above the poverty threshold in New York City or Anchorage is demonstrably worse off than a family of four just below the threshold in, say, rural Arkansas. And yet that family in New York might be ineligible for federal aid and will not count in the tallies of the poverty population used to allocate funds among the states, while the Arkansas family will be eligible and will be counted. 
   Professor Herman B. ``Dutch'' Leonard and Senior Research Associate Monica Friar of the Taubman Center for State and local government at Harvard have devised an index of poverty statistics that reflects the differences in the cost of living between States. If we look at the ``Friar-Leonard State Cost-of-Living index,'' as it has come to be known, we find that, in Fiscal Year 1997, New York had a poverty rate of 20.5% third highest in the nation. yet the official poverty level for 1997 is 16.6%. These adjusted statistics still reflect poverty accurately: the poor states of Mississippi and New Mexico remain ranked higher than New York in this ranking of misfortune. 
   Mr. President, our current poverty data are inaccurate. And these substandard data are used in allocation formulas used to distribute millions of Federal dollars each year. As a result, states with high costs of living--New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Hawaii, California, just to name a few--are not getting their fair share of Federal dollars because differences in the cost of living are ignored. And the poor of these high cost states are penalized because they happen to live there. It is time to correct this inequity.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague, Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska, in introducing legislation to establish a Federal Commission on Statistical Policy. Congressman STEPHEN HORN of California and Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY of New York plan to introduce similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   This legislation is similar to S. 1404, The Federal Statistical System Act of 1997, a bill which was favorably reported out of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs October 6 of last year by a 9 to 0 vote. 
   This Senator first introduced legislation to study the Federal statistical system on September 25, 1996, for the 104th Congress, and again on January 21, 1997, for the 105th Congress. Over the past few years, I have testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology to explain this legislation. This bill represents more than 2 years of work and much bipartisan cooperation. 
   The Federal Commission on Statistical Policy would consist of 16 Presidential and congressional appointees with expertise in fields such as actuarial science, finance, and economics. Its members would conduct a thorough review of the U.S. statistical system, and issue a report that would include recommendations on whether statistical agencies should be consolidated into a centralized Federal Statistical Service. 
   Of course, we have an example of a consolidated statistical agency just across our northern border. Statistics Canada, the most centralized statistical agency among OECD countries, was established in November 1918 as a reaction to a familiar problem. At that time, the Canadian Minister of Industry was trying to obtain an estimate of the manpower resources that Canada could commit to the war effort. And he got widely different estimates from statistical agencies scattered throughout the government. Consolidation seemed the way to solve this problem, and so it happened--as it can in a parliamentary government--rather quickly, just as World War I ended. 
   In April of 1997, a member of my staff met in Ottawa with the Assistant Chief Statistician of Statistics Canada. He reported that Statistics Canada is doing quite well. Decisions about the allocation of resources among statistical functions are made at the highest levels of government because the Chief Statistician of Statistics Canada holds a position equivalent to Deputy Cabinet Minister. He communicates directly with Deputy Ministers in other  Cabinet Departments. In contrast, in the United States, statistical agencies are buried several levels below the Cabinet Secretaries, so it is difficult for the heads of these statistical agencies to bring issues to the 
   attention of high-ranking administration officials and Congress. 
   Statistics are part of our constitutional arrangement, which provides for a decennial census that, among other purposes, is the basis for apportionment of membership in the House of Representatives. I quote from article I, section I:  
   ..... enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall be Law direct. 
   But, while the Constitution directed that there be a census, there was, initially, no Census Bureau. The earliest censuses were conducted by U.S. marshals. Later on, statistical bureaus in state governments collected the data, with a Superintendent of the Census overseeing from Washington. It was not until 1902 that a permanent Bureau of the Census was created by the Congress, housed initially in the Interior Department. In 1903 the Bureau was transferred to the newly established Department of Commerce and Labor. 
   The Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, which was originally an independent body, began collecting data in 1866. It too was transferred to the new Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, but then was put in the Treasury Department in 1913 following ratification of the 16th amendment, which gave Congress the power to impose an income tax.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with my colleague Senator CHAFEE the CHIP Data and Evaluation Improvement Act of 1999. This legislation would ensure comparable data and an adequate evaluation of children's health coverage under the new Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicaid. 
   In 1997, CHIP was established to provide health coverage for low-income uninsured children. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided $48 billion over ten years, mostly in the form of a block grant, for states to develop children's health insurance programs. 
   New York and other states pioneered expanded children's health programs well before the enactment of CHIP. With new federal CHIP funding, more states are beginning to develop their own programs. To date, 48 states have CHIP plans that have been approved by the Health Care Financing Administration, with most just beginning to implement their programs. We await reports on the effectiveness of their efforts to cover the nation's uninsured children.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in November 1998, Essence Magazine reported that between 1980 and 1995 the suicide rate among Black males ages 10 to 19 more than doubled. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study, suicide is now the third leading cause of death among all youth aged 15-19, and the fourth leading cause of death among children aged 10-14 nationally. In many states the problem is even worse. For example, suicide is the number one killer of adolescents 15-19 years old in Alaska and of children 10 to 14 years old in Oregon. The majority of children and adolescents at risk for suicidal behavior are not seen by mental health specialists; therefore, primary health care providers and others in regular contact with young people must be available to respond to these troubled youngsters. 
   The legislation introduced today proposes to focus on seriously emotionally disabled children and adolescents and their families. Adolescents with special health needs, those experiencing chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or serious emotional problems and requiring additional health and related services such as assistance in moving from pediatric to adult health care, to post-secondary education and employment will be helped by this bill. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) located within the Department of Health and Human Services is best situated to 
   implement this program. 
   The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) has roots that go back more than 80 years--to the creation of the Children's Bureau in 1912. This was the first government agency to act as an advocate for mothers, children, and adolescents. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, the bureau's principle statutory responsibility, was originally enacted in 1935 as Title V of the Social Security Act. The MCHB is charged with providing leadership, partnership, and resources to advance the health of all mothers, infants, children, and adolescents--including families with low income, those with diverse racial and ethnic heritages, those with special health care needs, and those living in rural or isolated areas without access to care. 
   Title V encompasses a program of grants to the states and two federal discretionary grant programs: Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS). Funds are used to support research, training, newborn screening, maternal and child health improvements. CISS is only funded when the Title V annual appropriation exceeds $600 million) which occurred for the first time in 1992. The CISS program provides direct support to public and private groups committed to building integrated health delivery systems that provide comprehensive services in local communities. Most importantly, the State  Title V programs are required to coordinate with other related Federal health, education, and social service programs. For example, MCH programs have provided the technical expertise and the service delivery systems to ensure that expanded Medicaid eligibility and benefits result in improved access to services and improved health status of pregnant women and children. 
   The federal Title V mandate places a unique responsibility on state MCH agencies to assure that children with special health care needs are identified and receive the care they need. State programs are required to develop family-centered, community-based, coordinated care systems for children with special health care needs. Services for these children are most often provided through specialty clinics and through purchase of private office or hospital-based outpatient and inpatient diagnostic, treatment, and follow up services. Three-fourths of the State MCH programs have supported local ``one-stop shopping'' models integrating access to Title V, Medicaid, the WIC food program, and other health or social services at one site. In New York, MCH helps to fund or operate regional pediatric resource centers for children with special needs. 
   These centers offer multidisciplinary team care, family support and service coordination and they are beginning to integrate this approach into private practice settings where children are now receiving their specialty medical care. Yet, even though these programs have had encouraging results, most states' health care systems are unable to address all the needs of these vulnerable children--and adolescent youth with special health needs are particularly at risk. And that is why this legislation is so important. Under current law, Title V is permanently authorized at $705 million. It was last extended in FY 1993 to conform to funding levels that went beyond the prior authorization level. This legislation would increase the current MCH Block Grant authorization level from $705 million to $840 million in FY 2000. 
   Health care information and education for families with special health care needs is critical to the success of any integrated physical and mental health service program. The MCHB has begun family support efforts for families of children with special health care needs, and has a promising pilot program to build a national network of statewide family-run support services in FY 1999. The additional funding in this bill is intended to expand upon these family support efforts. With increased funding for the MCH Block Grant, SPRANS and CISS programs, the MCH Bureau will be well-positioned to collaborate successfully with other Federal and State partners to address this new project focus.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enhancing Family Life Act of 1999, a bill inspired by an extraordinary set of proposals by one of our nation's most eminent social scientists, Professor James Q. Wilson. On December 4, 1997, I had the honor of hearing Professor Wilson--who is an old and dear friend--deliver the Francis Boyer Lecture at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). The Boyer Lecture is delivered at AEI's annual dinner by a thinker who has ``made notable intellectual or practical contributions to improved public policy and social welfare.'' Previous Boyer lecturers have included Irving Kristol, Alan Greenspan, and Henry Kissinger. In his lecture, Professor Wilson argued that ``two nations'' now exist within the United States. He said:  
   In one nation, a child, raised by two parents, acquires an education, a job, a spouse, and a home kept separate from crime and disorder by distance, fences, or guards. In the other nation, a child is raised by an unwed girl, lives in a neighborhood filled with many sexual men but few committed fathers, and finds gang life to be necessary for self-protection and valuable for self-advancement.  
   Sadly, this is an all-too-accurate portrait of the American underclass, the problems of which have been the focus of decades of unsuccessful welfare reform and crime control efforts. We have tried a great many ``solutions,'' as Professor Wilson notes:  
   Congress has devised community action, built public housing, created a Job Corps, distributed Food Stamps, given federal funds to low-income schools, supported job training, and provided cash grants to working families.  
   Yet still we are faced with two nations. Professor Wilson explains why: ``[t]he family problem lies at the heart of the emergence of two nations.'' He notes that as our families become weaker--as more and more American children are born outside of marriage and raised by one, not two, parents--the foundation of our 
   society becomes weaker. This deterioration helps to explain why, as reported by the Census Bureau today, the poverty rate for American children is almost twice that for adults aged 18 to 64 (19.9 percent for children versus 10.9 percent for adults). And it grows increasingly difficult for government to address the problems of that ``second nation.'' Professor Wilson even quotes the Senator from New York to this effect: ``If you expect a government program to change families, you know more about government than I do.'' 
   Even so, Jim Wilson, quite characteristically, has fresh ideas about what might help. On the basis of recent scholarly research, and common sense, he urged in the Boyer Lecture that we refocus our attention on the vital period of early childhood. I was so impressed with his Lecture that afterward I set about writing a bill to put his recommendations into effect. 
   The Enhancing Family Life Act of 1999 contains four key elements, all of which are related to families. First, it supports ``second change'' maternity homes for unwed teenage mothers. These are group homes where young women would live with their children under strict adult supervision and have the support necessary to become productive members of society. The bill provides $45 million a year to create such homes or expand existing ones. 
   Second, it promotes adoption. The bill expands the number of children in foster care eligible for federal adoption incentives. Too many children drift in foster care; we should do more to find them permanent homes. The bill also encourages states to experiment with ``per capita'' approaches to finding these permanent homes for foster children, a strategy Kansas has used with success. 
   Third, it funds collaborative early childhood development programs. Recent research has reminded us of the critical importance of the first few years of a child's life. States would have great flexibility in the use of these funds; for example, the money could be used for pre-school programs for poor children or home visits of parents of young children. It provides $3.75 billion over five years for this purpose. 
   Finally, the legislation creates a new education assistance program to enable more parents to remain home with young children. A parent who temporarily leaves the workforce to raise a child would be eligible for an educational grant, similar to the Pell Grant, to help parent enter, or re-  enter, the labor market with skills and credentials necessary for success in today's economy once the child is older. 
   Mr. President, this bill is a starting point. It is what Professor James Q. Wilson and I believe just might make a difference. We would certainly welcome the comments of others. I first introduced this legislation last September and have received several helpful suggestions. I look forward to further such conversations and comments.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prohibit states from imposing the so called ``family cap'' as part of their Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) programs. The ``family  cap'' is a policy under which a child born to a poor family on assistance is simply ignored when calculating the family's benefit--as if the child, this new infant, did not exist and had no needs. More than 20 states have imposed some version of this cap as part of their TANF programs. 
   As I have said in previous debate on this subject, these children have not asked to be conceived, and they have not asked to come into the world. We have an elemental responsibility to them. And so states ought not deny benefits to these children because of the actions of their parents. 
   We recently received the results of an evaluation of welfare reform in New Jersey, the first state to impose such a ``family cap.'' As it is only one study, one should be cautious about generalizing from the results. Still, it was striking to note according to the study, that over the four-year observation period ``[m]embers of the experimental group [i.e. those under a family cap] also experienced an abortion rate that was 14 percent higher than the control group [i.e. those not under a cap].'' Is that really the outcome that authors of the 1996 welfare law intended? Further, the evaluation notes of the New Jersey welfare reform effort, of which the cap as a component, that ``[w]e found no evidence that [the program] had any systemic positive impact on employment, employment stability, or earnings among AFDC recipients.'' That is, it did little to move welfare recipients to work, the ostensible objective of the 1996 welfare law.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would establish a Medical Education Trust Fund to support America's 144 accredited medical schools and 1,250 graduate medical education teaching institutions. These institutions are national treasures; they are the very best in the world. Yet today they find themselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces reshape the health care delivery system in the United States. Explicit and dedicated funding for these institutions, which this legislation will provide, will ensure that the United States continues to lead the world in the quality of its health care system. 
   This legislation requires that the public sector, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector, through an assessment on health insurance premiums, contribute broad-based and fair financial support. 
   My particular interest in this subject began in 1994, when the Finance Committee took up the President's Health Security Act. I was Chairman of the Committee at the time. In January of that year, I asked Dr. Paul Marks, M.D., President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, if he would arrange a ``seminar'' for me on health care issues. He agreed, and gathered a number of medical school deans together one morning in New York. 
   Early on in the meeting, one of the seminarians remarked that the University of Minnesota might have to close its medical school. In an instant I realized I had heard something new. Minnesota is a place where they open medical schools, not close them. How, then, could this be? The answer was that Minnesota, being Minnesota, was a leading state in the growth of competitive health care markets, in which managed care organizations try to deliver services at lower costs. In this environment, HMOs and the like do not send patients to teaching hospitals, absent which you cannot have a medical school. 
   We are in the midst of a great era of discovery in medical science. It is certainly not a time to close medical schools. This great era of medical discovery is occurring right here in the United States, not in Europe like past ages of scientific discovery. And it is centered in New York City. This heroic age of medical science started in the late 1930s. Before then, the average patient was probably as well off, perhaps better, out of a hospital as in one. Progress from that point sixty years ago has been remarkable. The last few decades have brought us images of the inside of the human body based on the magnetic resonance of bodily tissues; laser surgery; micro surgery for reattaching limbs; and organ transplantation, among other wonders. Physicians are now working on a gene therapy that might eventually replace bypass surgery. I can hardly imagine what might be next. 
   After months of hearings and debate on the President's Health Security Act, I became convinced that special provisions would have to be made for medical schools, teaching hospitals, and medical research if we were not to see this great moment in medical science suddenly constrained. To that end, when the Committee on Finance voted 12 to 8 on July 2, 1994 to report the Health Security Act, it included a Graduate Medical Education and Academic Health Centers Trust Fund. The Trust Fund provided an 80 percent increase in federal funding for academic medicine; as importantly, it represented stable, long-term funding. While nothing came of the effort to enact universal health care coverage, the medical education trust fund enjoyed widespread support. An amendment by Senator Malcolm Wallop to kill the trust fund by striking the source of its revenue--a 1.75 percent assessment on health insurance premiums--failed on a 7-13 vote in the Finance Committee. 
   I continued to press the issue in the first session of the 104th Congress. On September 29, 1995, during Finance Committee consideration of budget reconciliation legislation, I offered an amendment to establish a similar trust fund. My amendment failed on a tie vote, 10 to 10. Notably, however, the House version of the reconciliation bill did include a graduate medical education trust fund. That provision ultimately passed both houses as part of the conference agreement, which was subsequently vetoed by President Clinton. The budget resolution for fiscal year 1997 as passed by Congress also appeared to assume that a similar trust fund was to be included in the Medicare reconciliation bill--a bill which never materialized. 
   The Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative BILL ARCHER, was largely responsible for the inclusion of trust fund provisions in the 
   Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and the budget resolution for fiscal year 1997. He and I share a strong commitment to ensuring the continued success of our system of medical education. Indeed, Chairman ARCHER and I were both honored in 1996 to receive the  American Association of Medical Colleges' Public Service Excellence Award. 
   That is the history of this effort, briefly stated.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to permanently extend the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. This bill, cosponsored by Senator ROTH, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, ensures that employees may receive up to $5,250 annually in tuition reimbursements or similar educational benefits for both undergraduate and graduate education from their employers on a tax-free basis. 
   The provision enjoys virtually unanimous support in the Senate. In the 105th Congress, every member of the Committee on Finance sponsored legislation to make this provision permanent, and the full Senate twice voted to support it--in 1997 and again in 1998. 
   The provision enjoys equally broad support in the business, labor, and education communities. I have received letters of support from groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers, from labor and employee groups such as the College and University Personnel Association, and from professional groups such as the National Society of Professional Engineers. 
   Why, then, is it not a permanent feature of the Tax Code today? Because, for reasons this Senator cannot understand, the provision has been opposed in the House. 
   Section 127 should be permanent because it is one of the most successful education initiatives that the Federal Government has ever undertaken. Approximately one million persons benefits from this provision every year. And they benefit in the most auspicious of circumstances. An employer recognizes that the worker is capable of doing work at higher levels and skills and says, ``Will you go to school and get a degree so we can put you in a higher position than you have now--and with better compensation?'' Unlike so many of our job training programs that have depended on the hope that in the aftermath of the training there will be a job, here you have a situation where the worker already has a job and the employer agrees that the worker should improve his or her situation in a manner that is beneficial to all concerned. 
   And the program works efficiently. It administers itself. It has no bureaucracy--there is no bureau in the Department of Education for employer-provided educational assistance, no titles, no confirmations, no assistant secretaries. There is nothing except the individual plan of an employer for the benefit of its employees. 
   Since its inception in 1979, section 127 has enabled millions of workers to advance their education and improve their job skills without incurring additional taxes and a reduction in take-home pay. As one example of the reach of this provisions, IBM, a key New York employer, provides education assistance benefits worth millions of dollars to more than 4,000 participants a year. 
   Without section 127, workers will find that the additional taxes or reduction in take-home pay impose a significant, even prohibitive, financial obstacle to further education. For example, an unmarried clerical worker pursuing a college diploma who has income of $21,000 in 1999 ($10.50 per hour) and who received tuition reimbursement for two semesters of night courses--perhaps worth $4,000--wil owe additional Federal income and payroll taxes of $906 on this educational assistance. 
   And the provision makes an important contribution to simplicity in the  tax law. Absent section 127, a worker receiving educational benefits from an employer is taxed on the value of the education received, unless the education is directly related to the worker's current job and not remedial. Thus, the worker would be subject to tax if the education either qualifies him or her for a new job, or is necessary to meet the minimum educational requirements for the current job. Workers and employers--as well as the IRS for matters in audit--must carefully review the facts of each situation and judge whether the education is taxable under these rules, and employers are subject to penalties if they fail to properly adjust wage withholding for employees who receive taxable education. More work for tax advisors. Permanent reinstatement of section 127 will allow workers who receive, and employers who provide, education assistance to do so without such complexity. 
   Section 127 has also helped to improve the quality of America's public education system at a fraction of the cost of direct-aid programs. A survey by the National Education Association a few years ago found that almost half of all American public schools systems provide tuition assistance to teachers seeking advanced training and degrees. This has enabled thousands of public schools teachers to obtain advanced degrees, enhancing the quality of instruction in our schools. 
   A well-trained and educated work force is a key to our Nation's competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century. Pressures from international competition and technological change require constant education and retraining to maintain and strengthen American industry's competitive position. Alan Greenspan, the esteemed Chairman of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, remarked at Syracuse University in New York in December, 1997 that:  
   Our business and workers are confronting a dynamic set of forces that will influence our nations' ability to compete worldwide in the years ahead. Our success in preparing workers and managers to harness those forces will be an important element in the outcome. 
   ......America's prospects for economic growth will depend greatly on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology. 
   [A]n increasing number of workers are facing the likelihood that they will need retooling during their careers. The notion that formal degree programs at any level can be crafted to fully support the requirements of one's lifework is being challenged. As a result, education is increasingly becoming a lifelong activity; businesses are now looking for employees who are prepared to continue learning.......  
   Section 127 has an important, perhaps vital, role to play in this regard. It permits employees to adapt and retrain without incurring additional tax liabilities and a reduction in take-home pay. By removing the tax burden from workers seeking education and retraining, section 127 helps to maintain American workers as the most productive in the industrialized and developing world. 
   Indeed, recent evidence released by the Census Bureau demonstrates that the earnings gap between individuals with a college degree and those with only a high school education continues to grow. Those who hold bachelor's degrees on average made $40,478 last year, compared with $22,895 earned by the average high school graduate. In other terms, college graduates now earn 76 percent more than their counterparts with less education, up significantly from 57 percent in 1975. 
   Despite efforts by the Senate, the most recent extension of section 127 excluded graduate level education. This was a mistake. Historically, one quarter of the individuals who have used section 127 went to graduate schools. Ask major employees about their 
   employee training and they will say nothing is more helpful than being able to send a promising young person, or middle management person, to a graduate school to learn a new field that has developed since that person acquired his or her education. As Dr. Greenspan stated,  
   ..... education, especially to enhance advanced skills, is so vital to the future growth of our economy.  
   By eliminating graduate level education from section 127, we impose a tax increase on many citizens who work and go to graduate school at the same time. But not all of them. Only the ones whose education does not directly relate to their current jobs. For these unlucky persons, we have erected a barrier to their upward mobility. Who are these people? Perhaps an engineer seeking a master's degree in geology to enter the field of environmental science, or a bank teller seeking an MPA in accounting, or a production line worker seeking an MBA in management. 
   Simple equity among taxpayers demands that section 127 be made permanent. Contrast each of the above examples with the following: The environmental geologist seeking a master's in geology, the bank accountant seeking an MPA, and the management trainee seeking an MBA; each of these persons could qualify for tax-free education, whereas their colleagues would not. There is no justification for this difference in tax treatment. 
   Thus, section 127 removes a tax bias against lesser-skilled workers. The tax bias arises because lesser-skilled workers have narrower job descriptions, and a correspondingly greater difficulty proving that educational expenses directly relate to their current jobs. Less-skilled workers are in greater need of remedial and basic education. And they are the ones least able to afford the imposition of tax on their educational benefits. As noted by Senator Packwood in a 1978 Finance Committee hearing on this provision, employer-provided education is not taxable:  
   ..... so long as it is related to the job, but the trouble is, once you get higher in a corporation, more things seem to be related to the job. If you are a vice president in charge of marketing for Mobil Oil or General Motors, you could have a wide expanse of educational experiences that would be job related. ..... but for the poor devil in private enterprise who dropped out of school at 16 and is working on a production job and would like to move out of that, all you can train him for is to do the production job better. ..... [T]he lower skilled, the minorities, the less educated, are also the ones circumscribed by law.  
   This has been confirmed in practice. A study published by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in December, 1995 found that the average section 127 recipient earned less than $33,000, and a Coopers & Lybrand study found that participation rates decline as salary levels increase. 
   I hope that Congress will recognize the importance of this provision, and enact it permanently. Our on-again, off-again approach to section 127 has created great practical difficulties for the intended beneficiaries. Workers cannot plan sensibly for their educational goals, not knowing the extent to which accepting educational assistance may reduce their take-home pay. As for employers, the fits and starts of the legislative history of section 127 have been a serious administrative nuisance: there have been nine extensions of this provision since 1978, of which eight were retroactive. If section 127 is in force, then there is no need to withhold taxes on educational benefits provided; if not, the job-relatedness of the educational assistance must be ascertained, a value assigned, and withholding adjusted accordingly. Uncertainty about the program's continuance has magnified this burden, and discouraged employers from providing educational benefits. 
   For example, section 127 expired for a time after 1994. During 1995, employers did not know whether to withhold taxes or curtail their educational assistance programs. Workers did not know whether they would face large tax bills, and possible penalties and interest, and thus faced considerable risk in planning for their education. Constituents who called my office reported that they were taking fewer courses--or no courses--due to this uncertainty. And when we failed to extend the provision by the end of 1995, employers had to guess as to how to report their worker's incomes on the W-2 tax statements, and employees had to guess whether to pay tax on the benefits they received. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, we finally extended the provision retroactively to the beginning of 1995. As a result, we had to instruct the IRS to issue guidance expeditiously to employers and workers on how to obtain refunds. 
   The current provision expires with respect to courses beginning after May 31, 2000. Will we subject our constituents, once again, to similar confusion? The legislation I introduce today would restore certainty to section 127 by maintaining it on a permanent basis for all education.  
   Encouraging workers to further their education and to improve their job skills is an important national priority. It is crucial for preserving our competitive position in the global economy. Permitting employees to receive educational assistance on a tax-free basis, without incurring significant cuts in take-home pay, is a demonstrated, cost-effective means for achieving these objectives. This is a wonderful piece of unobtrusive social policy. And it simplifies our tax system for one million workers and their employers.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, to introduce three tax measures designed to strengthen our commitment to enhancing the prospects for long-term economic growth in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and a fourth piece of legislation to ensure fair funding for its Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Twice this decade, Congress has imposed significant tax increases on companies doing business in Puerto Rico. Those tax increases in 1993 and 1996, agreed to in the context of broader deficit reduction and minimum wage legislation, substantially altered the economic relationship between the United States and the possessions. The legislation I introduce today will address several of the economic concerns caused by those tax increases and restore incentives for employment, investment, and business opportunities. 
   Federal tax incentives for economic activity in Puerto Rico are nearly as old as the income tax itself. Under the Revenue Act of 1921, U.S. corporations that met two gross income tests were deemed ``possessions corporations'' exempt from tax on all income derived from sources outside the United States. The possessions corporation exemption remained unchanged until 1976. Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, added by the Tax Reform Act of 1976, maintained the exemption for income derived by U.S. corporations from operations in a possession. It also exempted from tax the dividends remitted by a possessions corporation to its U.S. parent. However, to prevent the avoidance of tax on investments in foreign countries by possessions corporations, the 1976 Tax Reform Act eliminated the exemption for income derived outside the possessions. 
   In 1993, Congress imposed significant limitations on Section 936. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 subjected Section 936 to two alternative limitations (the taxpayer may choose which limitation applies). One limitation is based on factors that reflect the corporation's economic activity in the possessions. The other limitation is based on a percentage of the  credit that would be allowable under prior-law rules. The staff of the Joint Tax Committee estimated that the 1993 Act changes would raise $3.75 billion over five years. 
   While Congress substantially limited tax incentives for companies doing business in Puerto Rico in 1993, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 effectively repealed remaining federal tax incentives, subject to a 10-year transition rule for taxpayers with existing investments in Puerto Rico. The Joint Tax Committee staff estimated the 1996 changes would raise $10.5 billion over ten years. 
   In committee report language accompanying the 1976 Act, Congress recognized that the Federal government imposes upon the possessions various requirements, such as minimum wage requirements and requirements to use U.S. flag ships in transporting goods between the United States and various possessions, that substantially increase the labor, transportation and other costs of establishing business operations in Puerto Rico. In the 1990s, in light of trade agreements such as NAFTA and increased economic competition from low-wage Caribbean countries, these concerns are particularly acute. 
   Traditionally, Puerto Rico has been excluded from or underfinanced in many federal programs because, it has been argued, the island does not pay income taxes to the Federal government. For example, Puerto Rico has only minimal Federal participation in the Medicaid program. In 1998, Puerto Rico's Medicaid program received approximately $170 million in federal funds, whereas it could have received approximately $500 million if it were treated as a state. Clearly, Congress should not adopt a double standard of taxing Puerto Rico's economic activity while denying funding for federal programs. 
   Mr. President, the first of the bills I introduce today, while not designed to reinstate prior law, seeks to build on the temporary wage credit that is currently provided in the Internal Revenue Code. The bill removes provisions that limit, in taxable years beginning after 2001, the aggregate taxable income taken into account in determining the amount of the credit. Employers would generally be eligible for a tax credit equal to 60 percent of wages and fringe benefit expenses for employees located in Puerto Rico. New as well as existing employers would be rewarded for providing local jobs. Instead of expiring at the end of 2005, the credit would terminate three years later for tax years starting after 2008. Thus, businesses would have a 10 
   year period in which to take advantage of these incentives. 
   A second proposal addresses the inequitable treatment of Puerto Rico under the tax credit for increasing research activities (the R&D tax credit). The R&D credit has never applied to qualified research conducted in Puerto Rico and the other U.S. possessions. Until recently, U.S. companies paid no taxes on Puerto Rico source income. As a result, there were no tax consequences to Puerto Rico's exclusion from the R&D credit. With the phasing out of section 936, applying the R&D credit to research expenditures in Puerto Rico has become a matter of fairness, and this legislation would ensure eligibility for companies operating in the possessions. The Government of Puerto Rico has made research and development a centerpiece of its new economic model, and Puerto Rico's 1998 Tax Incentives Act created a deduction for research and development expenses incurred for new or improved products or industrial processes. While the immediate cost of extending the R&D credit to Puerto Rico is minimal (in 1998, the Joint Tax Committee estimated the total five year revenue loss at $4 million), the long term benefits for Puerto Rico's diversifying economy could be significant. 
   The third bill addresses a provision of the tax law a portion of which expired on September 30, 1998. The Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands mandate that all federal collections on insular products be transferred (``covered-over'') to those unincorporated jurisdictions of our Nation. Further, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act provides that collections on all imported rum be transferred to the treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In 1984, because of a dispute concerning the use of the tax cover-over mechanism in Puerto Rico, the cover-over was limited to an amount of $10.50 per gallon tax on rum, rather than the full $13.50 per gallon tax. The disputed practice was discontinued many years ago. In 1993, Congress enacted a temporary increase in the rum cover-over, to $11.30, effective for five years. That provision expired on September 30, 1998, and the rum cover-over dropped back to $10.50. The legislation would restore the cover-over to the full amount of the excise tax collected on rum ($13.50 per proof gallon), as mandated in the basic laws regarding those jurisdictions and in the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Last September, the Congressional Budget Office estimated such a proposal would cost $350 million over 5 years and $700 million over 10 years. 
   Additionally, the proposal provides that, for a five-year period, 50 cents per gallon of the cover-over to Puerto Rico would be further transferred to the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust. The Conservation Trust, created for the protection of the natural resources and environmental beauty of Puerto Rico, was established by the Department of the Interior and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1968. The Trust was initially funded through an oil import fee. More recently, it was primarily financed through Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Trust lost more than 80 percent of its funding as a consequence of the decision to phase-out section 936 and eliminate the Qualified Possession Source Investment Income provision in the tax code. The proposal to transfer a portion of the restored cover-over for five years to capitalize the Trust is projected to result in a permanent endowment. 
   Lastly, I introduce a bill to provide sufficient funding for Puerto Rico and the Territories' Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP). 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established CHIP as a grant to states to cover uninsured low-income children. We provided approximately $20 billion in the first five years. The original allocation formula would have provided only 0.25 percent of the funding to Puerto Rico and the Territories. 
   Recognizing that this allocation provided insufficient funding for CHIP programs in Puerto Rico and the Territories, Congress increased their allotments by $32 million in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY 1999. However, this increase was provided for Fiscal Year 1999 only. 
   This bill would increase the allotments for Puerto Rico and the Territories for future years such that funding would equal about one percent of the total grant funding. Puerto Rico and the Territories account for about 1.52 percent of the nation's population. This would increase funding in Fiscal Year 2000 to $34.2 million. I urge my colleagues' support for this modest but significant legislation. 
   In an era of open borders, expanding trade, and increasingly interlinked economic ties, the United States should not punish Puerto Rico by selectively applying some laws while denying the benefits of others. Economic conditions in Puerto Rico warrant special consideration. While the United States is enjoying the benefits of an historically unprecedented period of economic expansion, unemployment among Puerto Rico's 3.5 million inhabitants remains high at 12.5 percent. The needs of Puerto Rico, and the importance of this provision, were magnified by the devastation recently caused by Hurricane Georges. Mr. President, now is the time to reinforce our close economic relationship with Puerto Rico. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in working toward swift passage of these measures. 
   Finally, Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the four measures be printed in full in the RECORD.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and my Finance Committee colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, to repeal a limitation in the Tax Code that results in the double taxation of certain foreign source income. The issue involves the effect of the corporate alternative minimum tax on income earned abroad by United States companies. Correction of this policy flaw is of significant importance to the affected companies, their current and future employees, and their shareholders.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself and Senators INOUYE and WELLSTONE to correct a little-known estate and gift tax provision that may inadvertently penalize persons who donate their personal papers and related items to a charitable organization for the historical record. 
   The issue arises in connection with the donation of personal papers and related items to a university, library, historical society, or other charitable organizations. In general, such a transfer has no estate or gift tax consequences. While the value of any such transfer may be subject to taxation as a theoretical matter, as a practical matter the gift will not be taxed because a corresponding charitable deduction would be available. This is as it should be: the donor receives neither a tax benefit nor a tax burden, and the tax law is not a factor in the decision to make such a donation. 
   Recently, however, estate planning lawyers have become concerned about situations in which such a gift might give rise to adverse tax consequences. The situation occurs where the donor retains (or transfers to his or her surviving spouse or children) various rights in the papers donated, such as a right to limit or control access. The restrictions might be in place for many understandable reasons, such as to protect the privacy of colleagues, correspondents, staffs, family and friends. Depending on how the retained rights are described in a deed of gift or will, and how such rights are treated under state law, the retention of various rights may cause the gift to fail to qualify for a charitable deduction under the estate and gift tax. 
   The problem arises under a series of rules enacted in the Tax Reform Act of 1969 that were designed to prevent  abuses in the transfer tax system. These rules were written, in part, to address situations involving taxpayers who claimed a charitable contribution deduction significantly in excess of the value of property that the charity was expected to receive. This result was accomplished by making a charitable gift in the form of an income or remainder interest in a trust, claiming an inflated charitable deduction through favorable valuation methods, and adopting an investment policy for the trust that significantly favored the noncharitable interest to the detriment of the charitable interest. In response, Congress established certain requirements to ensure that the charity would actually receive the portion of the property for which a deduction was allowed, and to deny a charitable deduction in cases where a ``split-interest'' gift was made that did not meet the specified requirements. 
   These rules were not intended to apply to the donation of historically important papers. Unlike the abusive situations of the past where charities were unlikely to receive the benefit of the purported gifts, in this situation the charity takes physical possession of the collection of papers. This is not a tax scheme designed to exploit weak rules. 
   I stated that there ``may'' be a problem with the estate and gift tax law because it is not clear whether the split-interest rule would disallow a charitable deduction in situations where donors have retained various rights to control and limit access to their papers. When do such limited rights reach the point of being recognized as a type of ownership interest under state law? I suspect that many prominent people have donated their papers in the past thirty years with similar restrictions, in reliance on documents prepared by knowledgeable 
   legal advisors and curators, and never imagined that there could be adverse tax consequences. 
   One way to get around this problem would be to avoid restrictions on the use of the papers. But that may not be practical, advisable, or desirable. 
   We can look to those who served across the street, in the Supreme Court of the United States, for examples of the types of restrictions that have been imposed on donations of important papers of public figures. Chief Justice Earl Warren, who donated his papers to the Library of Congress, restricted access to those papers for 10 years after his death. Justice Hugo Black, who also donated his papers to the Library of Congress, restricted access during the lifetime of his heirs, and required that permission be obtained from the executors of his estate to use the collection, to publish any writings in the collection, or to publish any writings about them. Justice Potter Stewart donated his papers to the Library of Congress with the restriction that all Court materials be closed pending retirement of all justices who served on the Supreme Court with him. 
   In contrast, Justice Thurgood Marshall donated his papers to ``be made available to the public at the discretion of the library,'' with the only restriction being that the use of the donated materials ``be limited to private study on the premises of the library by researchers or scholars engaged in serious research.'' This was interpreted to allow journalists to access the papers. The publication of certain information contained in the materials shortly after Justice Marshall's death was criticized. Indeed, Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned that Supreme Court Justices might no longer donate their papers to the Library of Congress. 
   Certainly, retained rights can have value, and could be subjected to commercial exploitation. One can imagine a publishing house would want access to the papers of prominent Members, Congressmen, or others, for use in biographies or on books related to the events that they helped shape. 
   However, any opportunity to retain and bequeath commercially exploitable rights in historical papers free of estate taxes is of little importance relative to the need to preserve the documents for scholarly research. Consider decision memoranda from key aides, correspondence, notes of strategy sessions, recordings of telephone conversations such as those made by President Lyndon Johnson and only now being aired--will these documents be destroyed if the choice were to open the items upon death or to pay an estate tax on them? Consider Chief Justice Rehnquist's chilling warning. 
   Yet, in most if not all cases, any retained rights can be expected to have little realizable value, and opportunities for commercial exploitation would appear to be quite limited in scope. 
   To this Senator, the right thing to do is clear. I am introducing legislation to clarify the tax law. In brief, this legislation provides that a person may retain and bequeath limited qualified rights to a collection of papers and related items. I.e., a collection substantially all the items of which are in the form of letters, memoranda, notes, and similar materials. Qualified rights would include the right of access to the materials, and the right to designate, limit, and control access to the materials, for a period of time not to exceed 25 years after the death of the person who created (or collected) the materials.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to correct an anomaly in our tariff schedule that harms American companies like Hickey-Freeman and other producers of fine wool suits. I refer of course to the tariff on fine wool fabric. Hickey-Freeman has produced fine tailored suits in Rochester, New York since 1899. However, the U.S. tariff schedule currently makes it difficult for Hickey-Freeman to continue producing such suits in the United States. 
   Companies like Hickey-Freeman that must import the very high quality wool fabric used to make men's and boys' suits pay a tariff of 30.6 percent. They compete with companies that import finished wool suits from a number of countries. If these imported suits are from Canada or Mexico, the importers pay no tariff whatever. From other countries, the importers pay a compound duty of 19.2 percent plus 26.4 cents per kilogram, or about 19.8 percent ad valorem. Clearly, domestic manufacturers of wool suits are placed at a significant price disadvantage. Indeed, the tariff structure provides an incentive to import finished suits from abroad, rather than manufacture them in the United States. 
   The bill Senators SCHUMER, DURBIN and I are introducing today would correct this problem, at least temporarily. It suspends through December 31, 2004 the duty on the finest wool fabrics (known in the trade as Super 90s or higher grade)--fabrics that are produced in only very limited quantities in the United States. And it would reduce the duty for slightly lower grade but still very fine wool fabric (known as Super 70s and Super 80s) to 19.8 percent--equivalent to the duty that applies to most finished wool suits. The bill also provides that, in the event the President proclaims a duty reduction on wool suits, corresponding changes would be made to the tariffs applicable to ``Super 70s'' and ``Super 80s'' grade wool fabric. 
   I introduced a similar measure last year. I do so again because of the obvious inequity of this tariff inversion, which so clearly puts U.S. producers and workers at a competitive disadvantage. This bill represents a small step toward modifying a tariff schedule that favors foreign producers of wools suits at the expense of U.S. suit makers. We should do so permanently, and perhaps, in time, will do so. In the meantime, we ought to make this modest start.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a tax bill that would correct a serious misallocation of our limited resources under present law: a tax subsidy that inures largely to the benefit of wealthy sports franchise owners and their players. This legislation--the Stop Tax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act, or STADIA for short--was introduced by the Senator from New York for the first time in 1996. Since that time, the bill has attracted the close scrutiny of bond counsel and their clients, and has received much attention in the press, almost all of which has been favorable. 
   Mr. Keith Olbermann, at the time an anchor of ESPN's Sportscenter program, even declared that the introduction of the bill was ``paramount among all other sports stories'' when introduced. Passage of the bill, Mr. Olbermann said, would be ``the vaccine that ..... could conceivably at least lead towards the cure, if not cure immediately, almost all the ills of sports.'' 
   Mr. Olbermann may just be right about the importance of this bill, both to sports fans and to taxpayers. The bill closes a big loophole, a loophole that ultimately injures state and local governments and other issuers of tax-exempt bonds, that provides an unintended federal subsidy that contravenes Congressional intent, that underwrites bidding wars among cities battling for professional sports franchises, and that enriches persons who need no federal assistance whatsoever. 
   A decade ago, I was much involved in the drafting of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A major objective of that legislation was to simplify the Tax Code by eliminating a large number of loopholes that had come to be viewed as unfair because they primarily benefited small groups of taxpayers. One of the loopholes we sought to close in 1986 was one that permitted builders of professional sports facilities to use tax-exempt bonds. Mind, we had nothing against new stadium construction, but we made the judgment that scarce Federal resources could surely be used in ways that would better serve the public good. The increasing proliferation of tax-exempt bonds had driven up interest costs for financing roads, schools, libraries, and other governmental purposes, led to mounting revenue losses to the U.S. Treasury, caused an inefficient allocation of capital, and allowed wealthy taxpayers to shield a growing  amount of their investment income from income tax by purchasing tax-exempt bonds. Thus, we expressly forbade use of ``private activity'' bonds for sports facilities, intending to eliminate tax-exempt financing of these facilities altogether. 
   Yet team owners, with help from clever tax counsel, soon recognized that the change could work to their advantage. As columnist Neal R. Pierce wrote, team owners ``were not checkmated for long. They were soon exhibiting the gall to ask mayors to finance their stadiums with [governmental] purpose bonds.'' Congress did not anticipate this. After all, by law, governmental bonds used to build stadiums would be tax-exempt only if no more than 10 percent of the debt service is derived from stadium revenue sources. In other words, non-stadium governmental revenues (i.e., tax revenues, lottery proceeds, and the like) must be used to repay the bulk of the debt, freeing team owners to pocket stadium revenues. Who would have thought that local officials, in order to attract or retain a team, would capitulate to team owners--granting concessionary stadium leases and committing limited government revenues to repay stadium debt, thereby hindering their own ability to provide schools, roads and other public investments? 
   The result has been a stadium construction boom unlike anything we have ever seen, and there is no end in sight. 
   What is driving the demand for new stadiums? Mainly, team owners' bottom lines and rising player salaries. Although our existing stadiums are generally quite serviceable, team owners can generate greater income, increase their franchise values dramatically, and compete for high-priced free agents with new tax-subsidized, single-purpose stadiums equipped with luxury skyboxes, club seats and the like. Thus, using their monopoly power, owners threaten to move, forcing bidding wars among cities. End result: new, tax-subsidized stadiums with fancy amenities and sweetheart lease deals. 
   To cite a case in point, Mr. Art Modell recently moved the Cleveland Browns professional football team from Cleveland to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Prior to relocating, Mr. Modell had said, ``I am not about to rape the City [of Cleveland] as others in my league have done. You will never hear me say `if I don't get this I'm moving.' You can go to press on that one. I couldn't live with myself if I did that.'' Obviously, Mr. Modell changed his mind. And why? An extraordinary stadium deal with the State of Maryland. 
   The State of Maryland (and the local sports authority) provided the land on which the stadium is located, issued $87 million in tax-exempt bonds (yielding interest savings of approximately $60 million over a 30-year period as compared to taxable bonds), and contributed $30 million in cash and $64 million in state lottery revenues towards construction of the stadium. Mr. Modell agreed to contribute $24 million toward the project and, in return, receives rent-free use of the stadium (the franchise pays only for the operating and maintenance costs), $65 million in sales of rights to purchase season tickets (so-called ``personal seat licenses''), all revenues from selling the right to name the stadium, luxury suites, premium seats, in-part advertising, and concessions, and 50 percent of all revenues from stadium events other than Ravens' games (with the right to control the booking of those events). 
   Financial World reported that the value of the Baltimore Ravens' franchise increased from $165 million in 1992 (i.e., before the move from Cleveland) to an estimated $250 million after its first season in the new stadium. It's little wonder that Mr. Modell stated: ``The pride and presence of a professional football team is far more important than 30 libraries, and I say that with all due respect to the learning process.'' 
   Meanwhile, the city of Cleveland has been building a new, $225 million stadium to house an expansion football team. When Mr. Modell decided to move his team to Baltimore, the NFL agreed to grant Cleveland a new football team with the same name: the Cleveland Browns. Most cities are not as fortunate when a team leaves. 
   We are even reaching a point at which stadiums are being abandoned before they have been used for 10 to 15 years. An article in Barron's reported that a perception of ``economic obsolescence'' on the part of some owners has doomed even recently-built venues:  
   The eight-year-old Miami Arena is facing a future without its two major tenants, the Florida Panthers hockey team and the Miami Heat basketball franchise, because of inadequate seating capacity and a paucity of luxury suites. The Panthers have already cut a deal to move to a new facility that nearby Broward County is building for them at a cost of around $200 million. Plans call for Dade County to build a new $210 million arena before the end of the decade, despite the fact that the move will leave local taxpayers stuck with servicing the debt on two Miami arenas rather than just one.  
   How do taxpayers benefit from all this? They don't. Ticket prices go way up--and stay up--after a new stadium opens. So while fans are asked to foot the bills through tax subsidies, many no longer can afford the price of admission. A study by Newsday found that ticket prices rose by 32 percent in five new baseball stadiums, as compared to a major league average of 8 percent. Not to mention the refreshments and other concessions, which also cost more in the new venues. 
   According to Barron's, the projects:  
   ..... cater largely to well-heeled fans, meaning the folks who can afford to pay for seats in glassed-in luxury boxes. While the suit-and-cell-phone crowd get all the best seats, the average taxpayer is cosigned to ``cheap seats'' in nosebleed land or, more often, to following his favorite team on television.  
   Nor do these new stadiums provide much, if any, economic benefit to their local communities. Professors Roger G. Noll and Andrew Zimbalist recently published Sports, Jobs & Taxes with the Brookings Institution Press, in which they presented studies of the economic impact of professional sports facilities. The conclusion:  
   [I]n every case, the authors find that the local economic impact of sports teams and facilities is far smaller than proponents allege; in some cases it is negative. These findings are valid regardless of whether the benefits are measured for the local neighborhood, for the city, or for the entire metropolitan area in which a facility is located.  
   Or, as concluded by Ronald D. Utt in his Heritage Foundation ``Backgrounder'' Cities in Denial: The False Promise of Subsidized Tourist and Entertainment Complexes:  
   As the record from around the country indicates, the economic boost from public investment in entertainment complexes is exceptionally modest at best, and counterproductive at worst. It diverts scarce resources and public attention from the less glamorous activities that make more meaningful contributions to the public's well-being.  
   And what of the economic consequences to the communities abandoned by teams that relocate? 
   Any job growth that does result is extremely expensive. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported that the new $177 million football stadium for the Baltimore Ravens is expected to cost $127,000 per job created. By contrast, the cost per job generated by Maryland's economic development program is just $6,250. 
   Finally, Federal taxpayers receive absolutely no economic benefit for providing this subsidy. As CRS pointed out, ``Almost all stadium spending is spending that would have been made on other activities within the United States, which means that benefits to the nation as a whole are near zero.'' After all, these terms will invariably locate somewhere in the United States, it is just a matter of where. And should the federal taxpayers in the team's current home town be forced to pay for the team's new stadium in a new city? The answer is unmistakably no. 
   Nevertheless, it seems that every day another professional sports team is demanding a new stadium, threatening a relocation if the demand is not met. This is a growing phenomenon. Professors Noll and Zimbalist wrote that:  
   Between 1989 and 1997, thirty-one new stadiums and arenas were built. At least thirty-nine additional teams are seeking new facilities, are in the process of finalizing the deal to build one, or are waiting to move into one.  
   When I first introduced legislation to address this issue in 1996, stadium bond issuance had already exceeded $1 billion per year. Issuance reached $1.8 billion in 1997, a 30 percent increase from 1996. The bonds issued during 1997 alone represent a federal taxpayer subsidy of approximately $300 million over 10 years. It seems safe to predict that stadium bond issuance continued to increase in 1998.  
   In closing, one note about implementation of this legislation, should it be enacted. It might be considered unfair that some teams have new taxpayer-subsidized sports facilities, while other teams do not, all due to the arbitrary effective date of a change in the tax law. After all, why should some team owners be rewarded with a stadium subsidy while those owners who were reluctant to threaten relocation or to exploit unwarranted tax benefits do without? Congress could certainly provide appropriate transition rules--as it did in the 1986 Act when it first shut down tax-exempt stadium financing--to allow these latter teams stadium subsidies. 
   What is clear is that we have got to do something about the explosion in tax-subsidized stadium construction, if not through this legislation, then through some other similar means. Perhaps Congress should consider some form of excise tax, or some limitation on use of bonds to situations that do not involve a relocating team. We could also consider requiring that stadium bonds be repaid by stadium revenues--or at the very least we could re-examine current law, which effectively prohibits such a use of stadium revenues. Or, we could consider tightening the prohibition on the use of tax-exempt bonds to finance luxury skyboxes so that it cannot be so easily circumvented. 
   The STADIA bill would save about $50 million a year now spent to subsidize professional sports stadiums. The question for Congress is should we subsidize the commercial pursuits of wealthy team owners, encourage escalating player salaries, and underwrite bidding wars among cities seeking or fighting to keep professional sports teams, or would our scarce resources be put to better use? To my mind, this is not a difficult choice.

   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution that notes with approval the International Labor Organization's new Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, which was agreed in June 1998 at the 86th International Labor Conference. This resolution simply urges the prompt and effective implementation of this important Declaration and its monitoring mechanism. 
   The impact of globalization on working conditions and, indeed, on workers' rights in general, has arisen as an important, and somewhat difficult, issue in the debate over the direction of America's trade policy. In 1997, I suggested to the Administration that they might look to the International Labor Organization for assistance in addressing this matter. After all, the ILO was established in 1919 for the express purpose of providing governments that wanted to do something to improve labor standards with a means of so doing--international conventions--that would not compromise their competitive advantages. I worked with the Administration to incorporate into the President's 1997 fast track proposal language recognizing the important role of the ILO, and in September 1997, the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee agreed to include the ILO provisions in his own fast track bill. In July 1998, the Finance Committee updated the bill to reflect its approval of, and hopes for, the new Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its monitoring mechanism. 
   In essence, the ILO has bundled together, in a single declaration, four sets of fundamental rights--the core labor standards embodying the broad principles that are essential to membership in the ILO. Having declared that those rights are fundamental, the document then provides for a monitoring system--a ``follow-up'' mechanism, to use the ILO term--to determine how countries are complying with these elemental worker rights. 
   The four sets of fundamental rights are: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; the effective abolition of child labor; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
   These rights flow directly from three sources. First, from the ILO Constitution itself, which was drafted by a commission headed by Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor and became, in 1919, part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. Second, from the immensely important Declaration of Philadelphia, which reaffirmed, at the height of World War II, the fundamental principles of the ILO, including freedom of expression and association and the importance of equal opportunity and economic security. Adopted  in 1944, the Declaration of Philadelphia was formally annexed to the ILO Constitution two years later. And, not least, these four groups of core labor standards flow from the seven ILO conventions that are recognized as Core Human Rights Conventions. 
   These seven conventions are not the highly technical agreements that make up the vast majority of the ILO's 181 conventions. Rather, they directly address the rights of working people. They are Convention No. 29, the Forced Labor Convention of 1930; Convention No. 87, the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention of 1948; Convention No. 98, the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention of 1949; Convention No. 100, the Equal Remuneration Convention of 1951; Convention No. 105, the Abolition of Forced Labor Convention of 1957; Convention No. 111 on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation, which was done in 1958; and Convention No. 138, the Minimum Age Convention of 1973. 
   They are extraordinary conventions. The Social Summit in Copenhagen in 1995 identified six of these ILO conventions as essential to ensuring human rights in the workplace: Nos. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, and 111. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has classified them as ``International Human Rights Conventions.'' The Governing Body of the ILO subsequently added to the list of core conventions Convention No. 138, the minimum age convention, in recognition of the importance of matters relating to child labor. These conventions embody the broad principles that are basic to membership in the ILO. 
   The Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Renato Ruggiero, was solidly behind the ILO's efforts, as we discussed at length in Geneva during a visit in January 1998. In the end, the tenacity of Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman and her able Deputy Under Secretary for International Labor Affairs Andrew Samet, Abraham Katz, President of the United States Council for International Business, and John Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, paid off: the Declaration was approved in June 1998 by an overwhelming margin. 
   The Declaration can play a useful role in advancing core labor standards if it is carried out with energy and determination. The key will be its follow-up mechanism, and the extent to which that tool evolves into an effective means of monitoring compliance with these fundamental worker rights and securing their enforcement. This may take a period of years, but much good could come of it. The resolution I have introduced today recognizes both the significance of the Declaration and the useful role it could play in addressing workers' concerns about the global economy.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at a time when we risk the ever coarsening of our public affairs, we would do well to remember a man whose service to this country was distinguished as no other for civility and elegance. I ask that this tribute to Clark M. Clifford by Sander Vanocur be printed in the RECORD. 
   The tribute follows. 
   Tribute to Clark Clifford  
   The following anonymous poem was sent to Clark Clifford's daughters, Joyce and Randall, by their sister, Faith, who could not be here today: 
 Think of stepping on shore  and finding it Heaven, Of taking hold of a hand  and finding it God's, Of breathing new air,  and finding it celestial air, Of feeling invigorated  and finding it immortality, Of passing from storm and tempest  to an unbroken calm, Of waking up,  and finding it Home.  
   In the secular sense, Clark Clifford found that home in Washington more than fifty years ago. And having found that home, let it be said that while he was here, he graced this place. 
   It was a much different place when he and Marny came here, smaller in size but larger in imagination, made larger in imagination by World War II. It may have been, then and for a good time after, as John F. Kennedy once noted, a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm. But it was also, at least then, a place where dreams could be fashioned into reality. Being an intensely political city, dreams, as always, had to be fashioned by reality. And it was in this art of political compromise where Clark Clifford flourished. He was known as the consummate Washington insider. Quite often the term was used in the pejorative sense. It should not have been. If you believe as he did in what George Orwell meant when he wrote that in the end everything is political, it should be a case for celebration rather than lamentation that he played the role, for if he had not played this role who else of his generation could have played it quite so well, especially when the time came to tell a President of the United States, who was also a very old friend, that the national interests of this nation could no longer be served by our continuing involvement in Vietnam? 
   We know of his public triumphs. Some of us also know of his personal kindnesses. Many years ago, at a very bleak period in both my personal and professional life--you know in this city it is bleak when your phone calls are not returned by people you have known for years--there were two individuals in this city who faithfully returned my calls. One was Ben Bradlee. The other was Clark Clifford. When Clark first invited me to his office during this bleak period to offer encouragement and guidance, he closed the door, took no phone calls, sat behind his desk, his hands forming the legendary steeple and listened and advised. On that first visit to his office I looked down on his desk where there appeared to be at least fifty messages, topped by what seemed to be inaugural medallions. I thought to myself on that first visit that Clark Clifford had put the word on hold just to listen to me. But the third time I cam to his office, it occurred to me that it was just possible those messages had been there for twenty years. 
   Clark Clifford's final years were not what he would have wished for himself nor what his friends would have wished for him and his family. They seemed to echo the first lines in Chapter Nine of Henry Adams' novel ``Democracy,'' perhaps the best novel ever written about this city. The lines are: ``Whenever a man reaches to the top of the political ladder, his enemies unite to pull him down. His friends become critical and exacting.'' On this occasion, I cannot speak of his enemies, but I can say that his friends will not be critical or exacting. We will think, instead, of Othello's words just before he dies: 
 Soft you; a word or two before you go. I have done the state some service, and they know it-- No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate. Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.  
   We who loved Clark Clifford will do that and more. We will say now and henceforth: Clark Clifford did the state some service and we know it.

    Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Thomas Carlyle remarked, ``A well-written Life is almost as rare as a well-spent one.'' Carlyle could have written these words, if construed as a double entendre, about my rare, dear friend, Russell Baker. Baker's last ``Observer'' column appeared in the New York Times this past Christmas, ending a 36-year run. Over the course of some 3 million words, by his own reckoning, Russell Baker has displayed grace, gentle wit, decency, and profound insight into the human condition.  
   Nearly fifteen years ago, I stated that Russell Baker has been just about the sanest observer of American life that we've had. He has been gentle with us, forgiving, understanding. He has told us truths in ways we have been willing to hear, which is to say he has been humorous ..... on the rare occasion he turns to us with a terrible visage of near rage and deep disappointment, we do well to listen all the harder.  
   He leaves a huge hole I doubt any other journalist can fill. As Boston Globe columnist Martin F. Nolan observed last month, ``the most bathetic braggarts and most lubricated louts among us never thought we were as good or as fast as Russell Baker.'' 
   A life well-spent? He's a patriot, having served as a Navy flyer during World War II. For nearly fifty years, he has been married to his beloved Miriam. They have three grown children. His career has taken him from the Baltimore Sun's London Bureau to the Times' Washington Bureau. He has covered presidential campaigns, and he has accompanied Presidents abroad. He has met popes, kings, queens--and common people, too, for whom he has such enormous and obvious empathy. And now he is the welcoming presence on Mobil Masterpiece Theatre. 
   A life well-written? The Washington Post's Jonathan Yardley calls Russell Baker ``a columnist's columnist,'' writing, ``Baker broke his own mold. He was, simply and utterly, sui generis.'' I would not use the past tense, because I doubt Russell Baker is done putting pen to paper. But the sentiment is spot on. 
   A life well-written? Baker has won two Pulitzer Prizes--one in 1979 for Distinguished Commentary and another in 1983 for his 1982 autobiography, ``Growing Up.'' He has written thirteen other books and edited The Norton Book of Light Verse and his own book of American humor. Russell Baker isn't just one of the best newspaper writers around, as Yardley puts it; he is ``one of the best writers around. Period.''
