   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are finally at the finish line at the end of a legislative triathalon. It's been a long, difficult road, but we've finally come up with a health and education appropriations bill for this fiscal year. It truly was a test of endurance. Not only can we take pride in having survived the experience, but, even more importantly, we've produced a bipartisan agreement that is a victory for the health and education of our nation. 
   This agreement is not only a model for giving our nation the building blocks we need for a strong and secure future. It is a model of how Democrats and Republicans can work together across party lines to do what is the best interest of the American people. 
   Believe me, it hasn't been easy. Before the election, Senator STEVENS, Senate BYRD, Senator SPECTER, and I, along with Congressmen BILL YOUNG, DAVE OBEY, and JOHN PORTER worked for months to craft a solid bipartisan agreement. At times the negotiations got heated, but both sides hung in there, and in the end we came up with a good compromise.  
   That bipartisan agreement would have passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate--which is why we were all just baffled when, less than 12 hours after we had signed our names to the bill, a tiny faction of the House Republican leadership decided to kill it. 
   As a result, some reductions had to be made, some of which were very disappointing. I hope that in the next Congress, a spirit of cooperation and civility will prevail and prevent these sort of last-minute, partisan maneuvers. 
   That being said, I believe that the version of our bill that we have here today is a very, very good one. It maintains most of our hard fought gains and provides critical investments to improve health care, education, and labor conditions for all Americans. 
   I want to extend my sincere thanks and commendation to my long-time partner, Senator ARLEN SPECTER and his staff. We have had a great bipartisan partnership on this bill for a decade. Year after year, Senator SPECTER has done yeoman's work, and it is a pleasure to work with him. This is always a difficult bill to maneuver and this year may have been our toughest. 
   I also want thank and commend our chairman, Senator STEVENS, and ranking member Senator BYRD for their great work. This bill would not be possible without their outstanding and steadfast efforts. 
   Finally, I want to thank our colleagues on the House side, Congressman OBEY, Congressman PORTER, and Chairman BILL YOUNG. I especially want to commend Congressman PORTER who is retiring this year. 
   Here are some of the reasons why I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bipartisan agreement. 
   Education funding: $1.6 billion to lower class sizes, up from $1.3 billion last year; $900 million to repair and modernize crumbling schools: should result in over $5 billion in school repairs, based on successful Iowa model; and increase to $3,750 for the maximum Pell grant--that's a record increase in the grants to make college more affordable; and $6.2 billion for Head Start: that's a $933 million increase from last year which will allow thousands of additional children to be served. 
   Afterschool care: $850 million for after school care: nearly 50 percent increase. 
   Home heating: $1.4 billion for LIHEAP to help low-income Americans heat their homes this winter: a $300 million increase. 
   Health care: $20.3 billion for NIH funding: $2.5 billion increase, the largest increase ever; thousands of new research projects on Alzheimer's, cancer, childhood diabetes, HIV, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, and others; $125 million for new program to assist family caregivers struggling to keep elderly loved ones in their homes--provide respite and other needed services. 
   I am also especially excited about the funding in this bill for the Medical Errors Reduction Act of 2000 which Senator SPECTER and I introduced. Medical errors are estimated to be the 5th leading cause of death in this country. In fact, more people die from medical errors each year than from motor vehicles accidents (43,458), breast cancer (42,297), or AIDS (16,516). Our bill gives grants to states to establish reporting systems designed to reduce medical errors. It also calls for better research, training and public information on the issue of medical errors. 
   I'm also very proud of the funding in this bill for numerous programs that will give people with disabilities a real choice to live in their own communities near their families and friends. Most notably, this bill includes $50 million for systems change grants to help states reform their long-term care systems and make it easier for people with disabilities and the elderly to live at home. 
   This is just the beginning of our work to help states meet their so-called Olmstead obligation to provide services and supports to people with disabilities in the most integrated settings appropriate and feasible. This year is the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and these provisions are a great way to implement the ADA's ideals of independence and justice for all. 
   Finally, I would like to mention how pleased I am with the FAIR Act--the Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act--that is attached to the LHHS Appropriations Bill, I, Senator THOMAS, and several other Members of Congress introduced this bipartisan bill to provide Medicare providers relief from the excessive payment reductions resulting from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. This bill will allow approximately 30 states, including Iowa, to benefit from fairer Medicare payments to states below the national average. 
   This bill allots approximately $35 billion over 5 years for reimbursement improvements to hospitals, home health agencies, nursing facilities, rural health providers and Medicare managed care. It will help our struggling rural hospitals, nursing facilities and home health agencies continue to provide quality care to seniors in Iowa and across the nation. 
   The bill will also help to improve enrollment rates for families and children in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   While I'm disappointed that our original LHHS Appropriations compromise was derailed, this bill is still a major step forward. It provides important investments in the health, education and productivity of all Americans. 
   This bill would not have been possible without the tireless, often heroic work of my staff. They's worked late nights and long weekends, and I am incredibly grateful for their expertise and excellent advice. I would especially like to thank Ellen Murray, Lisa Bernhardt, Peter Reinecke, Katie Corrigan, Sabrina Corlette, and Bev Schroeder for their outstanding work. 
   In passing this bill, I am hopeful that we will move beyond the partisan bickering that stalled our negotiations for so long. 
   With this year's elections, the American people sent us a strong message. They gave us one of the closest Presidential elections in history along with an evenly divided Senate and a closely divided House. 
   Clearly, they are tired of the bickering and bitterness that have characterized our politics, and they want us to bridge our differences and work together for their best interests. It is now time for us to come together and heed their call.

   Mr. HARKIN. I would like to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership on this subject. It is also my understanding that relevant federal, state, industry, labor, citizen, and environmental parties should participate in this study so as to gain a broader range of views and recommendations on the current problem and future solutions in order to prevent such problems as he has described from occurring again.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chairman, as you know, many members on both sides of the aisle have concerns about the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the lack of an advance appropriation for that program in fiscal year 2002. As you know, home heating costs have skyrocketed over the past year in many areas of the country. The LIHEAP program helps over four million low-income households with their heating bills. Usually this appropriations bill includes advance funding for LIHEAP so that states have time to plan their program, but due to a provision in the budget resolution capping advance appropriations we were not able to do so this year. 
   I hope, as I know you do, that we finish our work on this bill before October 1 next year. But if we do not, I think we should do everything we can to see that any continuing resolution for fiscal year 2002 would include sufficient funds for States to properly run their LIHEAP programs.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank and commend Chairman LUGAR for all of his hard work and leadership in bringing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act to the point of this final, agreed upon bill, which will be a part of the appropriations measure passed later today. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Chairman LUGAR on this important legislation and to cosponsor it. 
   This bill will bring much-needed modernization, legal certainty, clarification and reform to the regulation of futures, options and over-the-counter financial derivatives. At the same time, it maintains regulatory oversight of the agricultural futures and options markets and continues and improves protections for investors and the public interest with regard to futures, options and derivatives.

   Mr. HARKIN. After many years of effort, this legislation resolves a number of very difficult issues regarding the trading of futures on securities--issues that have caused a great many headaches as well as disparities in the markets over the years. I am pleased that we have been able to arrive at solutions that clear away regulatory impediments to market development, while maintaining and strengthening investor protections and addressing margin and tax issues in order to avoid giving any market an inappropriate competitive advantage over others involved in related transactions. 
   Clearly, modernizing the regulatory scheme for futures and derivatives must be balanced with maintaining and strengthening protection for individual investors and the public interest. The principal anti-fraud provision of the Commodity Exchange Act is section 4b, which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has consistently relied upon to combat fraudulent conduct, such as by bucket shops and boiler rooms that enter into transactions directly with their customers, even though such conduct does not involve a traditional broker-client relationship. Reliance on section 4b in such circumstances has been supported in federal courts that have examined the issue, and is fully consistent with the understanding of Congress and with past amendments to Section 4b, which confirmed the applicability of Section 4b to fraudulent actions by parties that enter transactions directly with customers. It is the intent of Congress in retaining Section 4b in this bill that the provision not be limited to fiduciary, broker-client or other agency-like relationships. Section 4b provides the Commission with broad authority to police fraudulent conduct within its jurisdiction, whether occurring in boiler rooms and bucket shops, or in the e-commerce and other markets that will develop under this new statutory framework. 
   I would also like to discuss my views regarding the substantial regulatory changes for electronic markets in derivatives relating to non-agricultural commodities. Essentially, those commodities are energy and metals. With particular regard to energy, given the recent high volatility in energy markets--with dramatic price increases for gasoline, heating oil, natural gas and electricity--we must take great care in whatever Congress does affecting the way in which markets in energy function. In the Agriculture Committee, I worked to remove an outright exclusion from the bill and basically to continue with the substantial exemption the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had already granted for energy and metal derivatives. Later, there were further negotiations to arrive at the provisions on this subject that are in this bill. 
   While I still have certain reservations about the energy and metals markets, I recognize the need for compromise, particularly in considering the overall importance and positive features of this legislation. This bill's language and Congressional intent is clear that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission retains a substantial role in ensuring the honesty, integrity and transparency of these markets. For exempt commodities that are traded on a trading facility, this bill clearly specifies that if the Commission determines that the facility performs a significant cash market price discovery function, the Commission will be able to ensure that price, trading volume and any other appropriate trading data will be disseminated as determined by the Commission. This bill also clearly continues in full effect the Commission's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority with regard to exempt transactions in energy and metals derivatives markets. 
   I also want to mention and express appreciation for the cooperation of Chairman GRAMM and Ranking Member SARBANES of the Banking Committee in completing this bill. With respect to banking products, the language of the bill clarifies what is already the current state of the law. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission does not regulate traditional banking products: deposit accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, banker's acceptances, letters of credit, loans, credit card accounts and loan participations. 
   The language of Title IV of this bill is very clear and very tightly worded. It requires that to qualify for the exclusion, a bank must first obtain a certification from its regulator that the identified bank product was commonly offered by that bank prior to December 5, 2000. The product must have been actively bought, sold, purchased or offered--and not be just a customized deal that the bank may have done for a handful of clients. The product cannot be one that was either prohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act or regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In other words--a bank cannot pull a futures product out of regulation by using this provision. 
   For new products, Title IV is also abundantly clear: the Commodity Exchange Act does not apply to new bank products that are not indexed to the value of a commodity. Again, the plain language is clear and the intent of Congress is clear that no bank may use this exclusion to remove products from proper regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
   Lastly, Title IV allows hybrid products to be excluded from the Commodity Exchange Act if, and only if, they pass a ``predominance test'' that  indicates that they are primarily an identified banking product and not a contract, agreement or transaction appropriately regulated by the CFTC. While the statute provides a mechanism for resolving disputes about the application of this test, there is no intent that a product which flunks this test be regulated by anyone other than the CFTC. 
   Once again, I commend Chairman LUGAR and Congressman TOM EWING, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Risk Management, Research and Specialty Crops, as well as all staff involved for their outstanding work in making this important legislation a reality. 
   Exhibit 1 DECEMBER 15, 2000. Hon. TOM HARKIN, Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the first anniversary of U.S. ratification of the ILO's newest core human rights convention: ILO Convention #182--the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 
   Last Friday was not just the first anniversary of ILO Convention #182. It was also the date on which Convention #182 came into effect in the United States. That means the first report on U.S. compliance with the terms of this treaty is due in Geneva by next September. 
   I have long been deeply involved in the struggle to end abusive child labor. Ten years ago, the scourge of abusive child labor was spreading in the U.S. and throughout the world with little notice or concern from our government. 
   That is why I supported the first-ever, day-long Capitol Hill forum on the Commercial Exploitation of Children. I had two primary goals in mind back then. 
   First, I wanted to sound an alarm about the increase in abusive child labor in the U.S. and overseas. Second, I wanted to elevate this human rights and worker rights challenge to a global priority. 
   I am heartened to report that significant progress has been made in the past decade, even though much remains to be done. 
   In June of 1999, ILO Convention #182 was adopted unanimously--the first time ever that an ILO convention was approved without one dissenting vote. Just one year ago, the Senate, in record time, ratified ILO Convention #182 with a bipartisan, 96-0 vote. 
   And today, 41 countries have ratified ILO Convention #182--countries from every region of the world. 12 African nations, 12 European nations, 10 American Caribbean nations, 5 from the Middle East, and 2 from Asia. Since the ILO was established in 1919, never has one of its treaties been ratified so quickly by so many national governments. 
   In May of 2000, we enacted the Trade and Development Act of 2000. This Act included a provision I authored that requires more than 100 nations that enjoy duty-free access to the American marketplace to implement their legal commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in order to keep these trade privileges. 
   Since May, the State Department has demanded thorough review of the efforts of over 130 nations to eliminate  the worst forms of child labor. The U.S. Labor Department is planning to file its first comprehensive report to Congress on whether countries that enjoy preferential access to our markets are fulfilling their obligations de facto until ILO Convention #182. And they've dispatched fact-finding teams around the world to investigate. 
   Their findings will be submitted to an inter-agency review process chaired by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Later this year, this process will decide which beneficiary countries should retain their trade privileges and which should not. 
   Last year, this Congress approved a $30 million U.S. contribution to the ILO's International Program to Eliminate Child Labor (IPEC) for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   This made our country the single largest contributor to IPEC. And--if and when we finally approve our LHHS Appropriations Bill--our contribution will increase to $45 million in Fiscal Year 2001. This is yet another reason for us to wrap up that legislation before we adjourn. 
   That's the good news, Mr. President. But we've got a long way to go in our battle to eliminate abusive child labor and open up a bright future for more than 250 million child laborers around the world. 
   Our first, and perhaps most important step, is to heed ILO Convention #182 in our own country. We have to develop a national action plan to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in our midst--labor which ``by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.'' 
   Mr. President, who among us can deny that there are children working under such circumstances in our own country? 
   In order to be a credible leader in the world struggle against abusive child labor, we've got to do more to eliminate the worst forms of child labor right here in America. 
   Fortunately, the Child Labor Coalition has recently convened meetings of non-governmental organizations to begin fashioning recommendations for the U.S. national action plan required by ILO Convention #182. 
   Hopefully, President Clinton will be moved to act on some of these recommendations when they are presented to White House officials today. He has already distinguished himself as a President who has done more than all of his predecessors combined to fight abusive child labor. 
   I conclude my remarks by describing one glaring example of abusive child labor in our own backyard that cries out for immediate legislative redress. 
   Right now, as many as 800,000 migrant child laborers toil in the fields of large-scale commercial agriculture picking the produce we eat every day. They are working at younger ages, for longer hours, exposed to more hazardous conditions than minors working in non-agricultural jobs. 
   Their plight has prompted me to introduce the Children's Act for Responsible Employment (S. 3100--The CARE Act) which I will push hard to enact next year. 
   This legislation will end our current double standard in employment. It will extend to minors working in large-scale commercial agriculture--corporate farms, if you will--the same rights and legal protections as those working in non-agricultural jobs. It will also: Toughen civil and criminal penalties for willful child labor violators; protect children under 16 from working in peddling or door-to-door sales; strengthen the authority of the U.S. Secretary of Labor to deal with ``hot goods'' made by children and shipped in interstate commerce; improve coordination and reporting among federal, state, and local governments on injuries and deaths of minors on the job; improve collaboration between the U.S. Labor and Agriculture Departments to enforce federal child labor laws; and preserve exemptions for minors working on family farms as well as those selling door-to-door as volunteers for non-profit organizations like the Girl Scouts of America. 
   So today, we should all celebrate that day one year ago when we took the high road and ratified ILO Convention #182. But we cannot rest on our laurels. In the next Congress, we've got to re-dedicate ourselves to restoring the childhoods of millions of child laborers and lifting them up from the cruel hand that they and their impoverished families have been dealt.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over a month has passed since the Republican and Democratic negotiators came to agreement on the health and education appropriations bill for this year. As I said back then, the agreement was reached as a product of long and difficult bipartisan negotiations. Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, Senator SPECTER, and I, along with Congressmen BILL YOUNG, Congressman DAVID OBEY, and Congressman JOHN PORTER, worked for months to craft this agreement. 
   Chairman STEVENS and Chairman YOUNG had been charged by their leadership to lead these negotiations to closure so that we could pass this very  important bill. That is exactly what they did. At times when negotiations got heated, both sides hung in there, and in the end we came up with a compromise. Neither side liked everything that was in it, but it was a true compromise. 
   Less than 12 hours after we reached agreement, the faction within the House leadership led by Congressman DELAY and Congressman ARMEY decided to renege on our bipartisan conference. We were baffled by this sudden decision. We spent many late hours giving and taking, compromising, and negotiating. We came to an honorable, mutually satisfactory agreement. 
   As I said, no one was 100-percent happy with it. For example, I was extremely displeased that, at the insistence of Republicans, an important regulation protecting workers from workplace injuries--such as carpal-tunnel syndrome--was delayed yet again; despite the fact that last year's conference report contained explicit language, it would be delayed further. 
   Each year, over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-related, musculoskeletal disorders that cost employers $15 billion to $20 billion a year in compensation. It may cost our economy as much as $60 billion total a year. 
   I was especially disappointed in the delay because this ergonomic provision, as a nonpartisan proposal, initiated under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole in the Bush administration 9 years ago. 
   While I was displeased with certain aspects of the bill, I was satisfied that the bill contained important provisions to improve the education of our kids, provide health care for working women, and safeguards for Social Security and Medicare. Those provisions are far too important to be destroyed by last-minute partisan politics. 
   There is a 21-percent overall increase in education funding in this bill and 35-percent more funding for class size reduction. This means 12,000 new teachers across America will be making a difference for 648,000 children. 
   There is school modernization funding that will generate approximately $9 billion for school repairs; $250 million to increase accountability to turn around failing schools; a 40-percent increase in IDEA grants, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grants, to States; the largest increase ever in Pell grants, so that college is affordable to working families and their kids; 70,000 more kids will get Head Start under this bill; an additional $817 million for child care to serve 220,000 more children; another almost $.5 billion for afterschool care for 850,000 kids. 
   In the health care area, there will be 1.4 million more patient visits to community health centers under this bill with an additional $150 million; an additional $18 million for breast and cervical cancer screening; an additional $1.7 billion for NIH funding, the largest ever; home heating, an additional $300 million for the Low-Income Heating Energy Assistance Program. 
   In the end, each side won some battles and each side lost, but we ended up with a fair and honorable agreement that was in the best interests of our Nation. That is what bipartisan compromise is all about. 
   Some are suggesting we just adopt a full year's continuing resolution. Not only would that be an abdication of our responsibility, but it would be exactly the wrong start to the next 2 years of a possibly evenly divided Senate and closely divided House. 
   It would toss out one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation that we have had this year, the bipartisan cooperation to enact the Labor-Health-Education appropriations bill. 
   Even worse, Mr. President, a full year's continuing resolution would be a step backwards for the education of our kids and making health care available to all Americans. It would wipe out all the gains I have just mentioned that are included in the bill. We would be kissing goodbye all these important advances in class size reduction, Head Start, breast and cervical cancer treatment, and many others. 
   Among other things, a full year's continuing resolution would cut NIH research by 47 percent, denying funding to 4,500 new research project grants this year. This chart indicates that. 
   If we pass a 1-year continuing resolution, here is what will happen: Under the current bill on which we had bipartisan agreement, we will be able to fund 9,500 new research projects at NIH. If we have a 1-year continuing resolution at last year's level, we will have only 5,000.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to continue to address the key pending piece of legislation that has not been enacted this year. It has been passed by both the House and Senate. In the conference committee, we finished our work. But it is sort of hanging in limbo. That is the funding bill for Education, Health and Human Services, other important programs such as the National Institutes of Health, and, of course, the low-income heating energy assistance program which is so vital to many of our low-income and elderly citizens who live in the northeastern part of the United States and in a lot of the other northern parts of America. 
   That bill right now is in limbo. We passed the appropriations bill in the Senate; the House passed the bill. Then ensued about 4 months of very tough negotiations between the House and the Senate, culminating in a marathon session that took place one weekend before we left, a couple weeks before the election, in which we agreed. When I say ``we,'' I mean Chairman STEVENS of the Appropriations Committee; Senator BYRD, our ranking member on the full Appropriations Committee; Senator SPECTER, who is the chairman of the education appropriations subcommittee; and me. I am the ranking member on the subcommittee. On the House side, we had Chairman YOUNG of Florida, the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee; we had Congressman PORTER, who is chairman of the subcommittee on that side; Congressman OBEY, ranking member on the subcommittee, and also ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee. We all agreed. 
   It was a Sunday, and we were there until 2 a.m. on Monday morning. We finally agreed. The negotiations were heated. Many times we were hung up on certain things, but in the end we came up with a good compromise. 
   That was Monday morning. That was right before we left for the election. Less than 12 hours later, a faction within the House Republican leadership, led by Congressman DELAY and Congressman ARMEY, decided to renege on that bipartisan compromise. We were all baffled by this sudden decision. We spent many late hours compromising, negotiating, giving and taking. 
   I think we came to an honorable, mutually satisfactory agreement. Again, no one was 100-percent happy with it. For example, I was extremely displeased that an important regulation protecting workers from workplace injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome was delayed yet again, for the third year in a row, despite the fact that last year's conference report contained explicit language stating it would not be delayed any further. Well, Republicans insisted we try to delay this yet again. 
   Each year, over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-related, musculoskeletal disorders. This costs employers $15 billion to $20 billion a year in compensation. It may cost our economy upwards of $60 billion annually. I was especially disappointed because this so-called ergonomics provision was a nonpartisan proposal initiated under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, a Republican, in the Bush administration 9 years ago. 
   Yet while I was displeased with this particular aspect of the bill, I was satisfied that the bill contained important provisions to improve education for our kids, improve health care for women and the elderly, fund needed research at the NIH, and safeguard Social Security and Medicare--provisions that are far too important to be destroyed by last-minute partisan politics. 
   In this bill, we had the highest increase ever in funding for education, with 35 percent more funding for class size reduction. It meant 12,000 new teachers would be hired across America. That is what was in the bill. There was school modernization funding that would generate about $9 billion in needed school repairs to some of our older schools; $250 million to increase accountability to turn around failing schools; a 40-percent increase in grants to States for the education of kids with disabilities and special needs; the largest increase we ever gave for IDEA, from $4.9 billion to $6.9 billion; the largest increase ever for Pell grants, to make college more affordable to working families. That is what was in this bill--the largest increase ever for Pell grants; the biggest increase for grants to States for educating kids with disabilities; school modernization, the first time ever, which would have funded about $9 billion in needed school repairs; 35-percent funding for class size reduction, the most ever. That is just in education. 
   In child care, again, was a record amount of money, an additional $817 million that would have covered 220,000 more children in America to have child care; afterschool care, $546 million in this bill, so that 850,000 children in America could have some form of afterschool care. 
   Health care. We added money so that 1.5 million more patient visits could take place at our community health centers around America. We put in an additional $18 million for breast and cervical cancer treatment and screening, an additional $1.7 million for NIH research--the highest level we have ever given, the biggest increase ever for funding at the NIH. 
   I mentioned earlier a record amount for LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, so that the elderly and low income in the northeastern parts of our country can get the heat they need this winter. 
   That is what is in the bill. It addresses the educational needs of our country, child care, health care, medical research, and, as I said, things such as home heating for the elderly and low income. 
   Well, each side won some battles; each side lost some. Isn't that what compromise is about? Isn't that what bipartisanship is about, where I don't get my way all the time and you don't get your way all the time? Maybe I will get some of what I want and maybe you will get some of what you want. That is what bipartisanship is about. We hear all this talk about bipartisanship. It looks as if next year the Senate is going to be right down the middle, 50-50, for the first time ever. If there is ever a time that we need bipartisanship, where we have to mentally understand that we Democrats don't get our way all the time and you Republicans don't get your way all the time but we work these things out, it is now. That is what we did on this appropriations bill. 
   As I said, it took us almost 5 months of tough negotiations, with strong feelings about this. Finally, we shook hands and we all signed our names to it and we walked out of the room. Then, two Republicans on the House side, Mr. DELAY and Mr. ARMEY, turned thumbs down on it after we had done our work to reach a bipartisan agreement. 
   Well, if we are going to set the stage for working closer together next year, I suggest we start here and now with the appropriations bill for education. We have a bipartisan bill. Republicans and Democrats who worked on it for 5 months know all the line items that are in it. We all agree that some are progressive, some are conservative, and there are moderates--almost the entire spectrum of the political ideology was involved in this bill. Yet we all agree, except Mr. DELAY and Mr. ARMEY on the House side. 
   Why should two people in a position of power be able to tell the entire Congress and, in fact, the entire country that we are not going to have this bipartisan agreement that we reached, on which we worked so hard? Two people say that we are not going to have it. 
   Congressman YOUNG, with whom I served in the House, has been a distinguished House Member for a long time. He and I don't agree philosophically on a lot of things, but we worked it out. Along with Congressman OBEY, Senator STEVENS, and Senator BYRD, we worked these things out. 
   So I hope we can tell the American people on the crucial issues of education, health care, and child care, yes, we got the message from this election. Let's work in a bipartisan way, just as we did on this bill, and let's send this  bill down to the President for his signature. 
   Some are now suggesting, I hear, that we adopt a full year's continuing resolution, that we disband all of the work we did on this bill and just go to a full year's continuing resolution. Not only would that be an abdication of our responsibility and send exactly the wrong message, but it would be exactly the wrong start for the next 2 years of an evenly divided Senate and a closely divided House. As I said, it would throw out one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation that we were able to muster this year. Even worse, a full year's continuing resolution would be a step backward for the education of our kids and the health care available to all Americans. If we had a continuing resolution, it would wipe out all the gains I spoke of, including class size reduction, Head Start, and breast and cervical cancer treatment and screening. 
   I have a chart which shows one of the things that would happen if we do not adopt the appropriations bill on education and health. 
   As I said, we have the largest increase ever for NIH funding. Why did we do that? We did that because this Congress a few years ago voted overwhelmingly that we were going to double the funding in 5 years for the NIH. Republicans voted for it and Democrats voted for it. 
   Both Senator SPECTER and I took that charge. We have been adding that money to double that. This year we have a $1.7 billion increase for NIH funding to get it up to double. 
   That increase means that under the current bill about which I am speaking we will be able to fund 9,500 new research project grants over and above what we have had in the past. 
   If we have just a continuing resolution, we will be able to fund only 5,000, and 4,500 new research grants will not be funded next year if we don't get this bill to the President and have just a continuing resolution. 
   What does that mean? It means things such as Alzheimer's disease, child cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, childhood diabetes, HIV, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy--I have a whole list. I will not read the whole list--all of the things that we are very close to making breakthroughs on--spinal cord injury is another one--and are very close to making tremendous breakthroughs with the new tools that we have--the human genome project is being finished; stem cell research is being done. We are close to making tremendous breakthroughs. Who knows? One of these 4,500 grants that wouldn't be funded could be the one key that unlocked the door to which we could find interventions and a cure for Parkinson's disease. It could be one of those 4,500. But it won't be funded if we don't pass this bill. That is what is at stake. 
   These are the things that won't be funded: Research to develop drugs to prevent Alzheimer's disease, clinical trial efforts on childhood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, childhood diabetes, and HIV. They are just a few of the things that would be cut back. A full year's continuing resolution would cut NIH research by 47 percent. Forty-five hundred new research project grants would not be funded. 
   I wanted to take this time because this is our first day back. We were back once since the election, but this is the first time we have been back to really get some legislative work done. 
   The Christmas season is about upon us. People will be anxious to get out of here and get home to spend time with their families and constituents. But we can't shortchange the American people. 
   Are we going to shortchange our kids? Are we going to say to the teachers across America that we are not going to reduce class size? Are we going to say to our property taxpayers around the country that we are not going to help them rebuild their crumbling schools; that they will have to take it out of their property taxes? 
   Are we going to say to families hard pressed, who need school care for their kids and who may live in a place where they really need some afterschool care, that we are not going to fund that either? 
   What about a working family that has a few kids and one of them is doing well in school and wants to go on to college but they can't afford it? They need a Pell grant. Yet we are not going to give the additional money for the Pell grants. 
   What about our school systems that are hard pressed around this Nation because more and more of the burden of educating kids with special needs is falling upon our local property taxpayers and they are finding it more and more difficult to meet their constitutional requirements of equal education for kids with disabilities but they aren't able to fund it because the property taxpayers are overburdened as it is? 
   We have a 40-percent increase in this bill to help our local schools make sure they can meet their constitutional obligation to educate kids with disabilities. We have a continuing resolution, and there that goes. 
   I think the election is very clear. People in America want us to operate in a bipartisan fashion. This is the opportunity for us to show them that we mean it. 
   We have a bipartisan bill passed by the Senate, passed by the House, worked out in conference committee, and agreed to by Republicans and by Democrats. Are we going to say that two people in the majority party in the House are able to say they don't like it? Is that what bipartisanship is going to be about around here--that we can all work in a bipartisan fashion but when it gets to the higher echelon of leadership in the House, they don't like it and they can operate by themselves? Is that what bipartisanship means? I don't think that is what the American people think bipartisanship means. 
   I believe the American people believe bipartisanship is exactly what we did on the education bill. We worked hard on it and lost. We negotiated. We sat and we sat and we talked and talked. We left and came back. 
   We finally worked it out--not to my satisfaction, not to the satisfaction, I am sure, of Senator SPECTER, and not to the satisfaction, I am sure, of any one of us. 
   We all had different ideas of what should be in it, but we all gave a little bit. In giving a little bit, we were able to get a bipartisan bill. 
   I say to my friends on the Republican side--I shouldn't say it here; we had agreement in the Senate. I would be preaching to the choir. But I say to my Republican friends on the House side that if you really want to show the American people that we can work in a bipartisan spirit, this is the chance to show it--with the education bill. 
   What a great Christmas gift this would be to the hard-working families of America, to our kids, and to the teachers. What a great Christmas gift this would be to millions of Americans who are suffering from debilitating illnesses such as Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, AIDS, and cancer. What a great Christmas gift it would be to them to say we are not going to back down and that we are going to fund the National Institutes of Health; we are going to put the money into this basic research to find the cures that we know are there. 
   I think that is the Christmas present Congress ought to give to the American people. 
   I am hopeful that before this week is out cooler heads will prevail and that we will take this bipartisan bill on education and health and send it down to the President, who has indicated that he would indeed sign it. That would be the best Christmas present we could give to the American people. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. I should like to take a few moments today to honor the life of a great Iowan and a great American--a man who dedicated many years of his life in service to the people of Iowa and our nation--our friend Park Rinard. 
   It's been said that on the day John F. Kennedy died, a tailor in New York put a sign on the door of his shop that read, ``Closed Due to a Death in the Family.'' 
   Well, that's how I felt when I heard that Park had passed away, like we had had a death in our family. 
   Unfortunately, I was unable to attend Park's funeral. It was held during the week before election day, and I had  committed to campaign for AL GORE and other Democratic candidates in Iowa. 
   I felt awful that I would be missing the service, and I thought about taking the day off to attend it. 
   But then it occurred to me--by hitting the road and working to get good Iowa Democrats elected, I was paying my respects just the way Park would have wanted. 
   Park Rinard was a legend in Iowa Democratic politics. He began his political career back in 1957 as an aide to Governor Herschel Loveless. 
   He then befriended a rough-hewn, young, Iowa truck driver who had a beef with the state's trucking policies. Park persuaded this disgruntled fellow--a man by the name of Harold Hughes--to join the Democratic party and run for office. The rest, as they say, is history, and Hughes later referred to Park as his tutor in government. 
   Park went on to advise Senator John Culver, Congressman Neal Smith, and many others who have made their mark on our Nation. 
   Mr. President, when I think back on Park's career, I'm reminded of something that Adlai Stevenson once said: ``Every age needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of things that are to be.'' That's a perfect description of Park Rinard. 
   Like my hero, Hubert Humphrey, Park believed that ``..... the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy .....'' And Park had a vision of government big enough and bold enough to encompass all of them. 
   He envisioned a government that trusted citizens--that believed in their strength and capacity to learn, work and serve a government that would invest in people and leave the potential of no citizen untapped. Through his work with Governor Hughes, Park transformed that vision into the wave of progressive legislation that characterized the ``Golden Age'' of Iowa politics. 
   During these years, Park helped establish Iowa's community college system, create the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, and appoint the first black state judge in Iowa. He worked to grant home rule for cities, increase spending for schools, and abolish the death penalty. And he successfully convinced Governor Hughes to oppose the Vietnam war. These achievements were Park's proudest legacies, and some of his most enduring. 
   But Park also had a vision for America--a vision which he spent the remainder of his career fighting for in Congress. He believed deeply in expanding women's rights, and he was a strong supporter of the equal rights amendment long before it penetrated the popular consciousness. He also spoke passionately about ending discrimination against gay Americans, long before many others. 
   But make no mistake about it, Park wasn't a knee-jerk liberal, not by a long shot. He just believed in a fundamental, basic, golden rule kind of fairness. That was his moral compass, and he steadfastly followed where it led. It is therefore unsurprising that Park had such disdain for polls and focus groups. For Park, politics wasn't about pandering and spin, it was about leadership and telling the truth. 
   And tell the truth he did. No matter whom he was speaking with, Park Rinard did not mince words. He was once asked by a hostile audience how his boss could even consider supporting food stamps for union strikers. Park simply replied, ``hungry people are hungry people.'' 
   A gifted speechwriter, Park wielded the written word as forcefully as the spoken. He spent hours pecking away at his old manual typewriter, massaging policy into poetry often finishing a speech at the last possible moment, sometimes just minutes before his boss was scheduled to deliver it. 
   Park never hesitated to use his gift for strong language to stand up to his bosses--some of whom were nearly twice his size--when he thought they were wrong. 
   Park once told a fellow staffer, ``Remember, you might work for one particular Senator, but your paycheck is from the Senate of the United States, and every employee of the Senate works for the people of America.'' That was Park's ultimate loyalty--to the people his bosses served. When Park stood up to his bosses, he was standing up for the American people. 
   And perhaps most extraordinary in this city that's seen its share of egos and ambition is that Park worked his magic entirely behind the scenes, happy to slip through back doors and pound out details in back rooms. Park felt that, as Ralph Waldo Emerson once noted, ``There is no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesn't matter who gets the credit.'' He never cared who got the applause and the pat on the back for his own hard work. He just cared about doing right. 
   Park was fundamentally humble. He spent a lot of time among giants--Governors, Presidential candidates, great political leaders--but his ego never swelled to match. Park believed, as the saying goes, that ``you don't have to be who's who to know what's what.'' 
   He was as comfortable lending a hand to a lost tourist, saying a kind word to a new intern, or shooting the breeze with a cafeteria employee as he was chewing out a Senator whom he felt had gone awry. There were no small people with Park Rinard. 
   All people mattered to Park--and his family mattered most of all. He was a devoted husband to his wife Phyllis, a proud father to his children Judy, David and Grant, and a doting grandfather to his grandson David Bayard. Their generosity in sharing him is appreciated by all of us enriched by his life. 
   The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote that ``Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time.'' Park was a great man. And he left lasting footprints on the political landscape of Iowa and America. 
   Today, in part because of the foundation he laid, Iowa leads the nation in education and literacy, and it's ranked as one of the top ten states to raise a child. And today, because of the dialogues he helped begin, the idea of banning discrimination against women and minorities or passing hate crimes laws no longer seems novel, but natural. 
   These are Park Rinard's footprints--echoes from a golden time in our history when this slight, softspoken man made it his mission to create a more humane world for the most vulnerable among us. 
   With his words and ideas, both written and spoken, Park Rinard appealed to the best in those he worked for and stood for nothing less. 
   We are lucky that so many great men and women heeded his call and made good on his dreams.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator DICK BRYAN  is one of few people who has served in this Chamber who has literally devoted nearly his entire life to serving the people of his state and nation. 
   Senator BRYAN's distinguished career started the day he took the oath of office as president of his 8th grade class at John S. Park Elementary School. It continued when he took office as president of his sophomore and senior classes at Las Vegas High School and student body president at the University of Nevada-Reno. 
   After graduating from law school, he served as deputy district attorney in Clark County and was then appointed as Clark County's first public defender at age 28. He did two terms in the Nevada State Assembly. Two terms in the Nevada State Senate. A term as Attorney General. Two terms as Nevada Governor. And he's now done two terms in the United States Senate. 
   He is the only Nevadan ever to have served as his state's Attorney General, Governor, and United States Senator. 
   He's also one of few, if any, Senators who've managed to pull an extraordinary triple play and serve on the three major fiscal committees--Finance, Commerce, and Banking. 
   And he's used these positions to fight harder than just about anyone else here to protect American consumers. 
   As former member of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, he passed an amendment requiring the installation of passenger side air bags in all cars sold in America. Over the years, this piece of legislation has saved hundreds of lives. 
   Senator BRYAN was also one of the early leaders on privacy issues in this  Congress. He led the charge to enact the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act--the first ever federal Internet privacy protection legislation. He has also been leading the fight to add new privacy regulations into the banking industry. 
   In addition, Senator BRYAN authored laws to reduce telemarketing fraud and to give consumers new rights in combating errors on personal credit reports. He passed the PMI legislation which protects people from having to pay hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars to private mortgage insurance lenders once they have enough equity in their homes. And he was one of the lead sponsors of Airline Passenger Bill of Rights. 
   Along with Senator MCCAIN, he passed important boxing reform bills to protect the health and safety of boxers and to maintain the integrity of the sport. 
   And finally, he has worked tirelessly to protect his constituents from nuclear waste dumping in Nevada. 
   The one consolation I take when I think about him retiring from the Senate is that he'll finally get to spend more time with his terrific wife, Bonnie. I'm hopeful that the two of them will set aside some time to come out and visit me in Iowa, especially since Senator BRYAN actually has roots in my home state. His father, Oscar Bryan, was born in Des Moines. And Senator BRYAN's uncle by marriage, Keith More, practiced law in Harlan, Iowa for years. Keith's brother, Jack More, was chair of the Democratic State Party in Iowa and headed up Truman's efforts in 1948. 
   But, no matter what his current plans are, I have a sneaking suspicion that Senator BRYAN isn't going to stop serving his State and his country for a long time to come. He has done it honorably since he was a boy, and he still has a tremendous amount to offer.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is the kind of scholar-public servant our founding fathers envisioned when they designed our great government. Senator Moynihan has a keen intellect and a kind heart, and his distinguished career is a testament to the power of this combination. 
   Senator Moynihan began serving this country just one year after he graduated from high school. He enrolled in the United States Navy from 1944-1947 and served in the Naval Reserve for 20 years. 
   After receiving his BA, MA and PhD, he went on to serve in the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. In fact, he is the only person in American history to have ever served in the Cabinet or subcabinet of four successive presidential administrations. 
   He served as U.S. Ambassador to India from 1973-1975, U.S. Representative to the United Nations from 1975-1976, and he represented the United States as President of the United National Security Council in 1976. 
   He has authored or edited 18 books on topics ranging from the Reagan era to the American family to poverty to ethnicity to the practice of government. And he has received 62 honorary degrees. 
   Senator Moynihan's list of legislative accomplishments is no less impressive. He produced the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century which provided money and incentives for States to build mass transit systems. 
   He has done outstanding work on cleaning up our environment through his legislation to clean up nuclear waste and toxic sites and to control acid rain. 
   He has also been a leader in transforming our social welfare system. His 1988 Family Support Act began the process of changing the AFDC program from an income security program to one which helps individuals secure employment. He has also sponsored a bill to improve the Social Security Administration and to keep Social Security solvent for the future. 
   And if you take a walk around this city--or any number of other American cities for that matter--you won't get far before you see a building that Senator Moynihan helped to build or preserve. From the Old Patent Office which now hosts two Smithsonian museums, to the Old Post Office, to the Old Pension Building, which is now the National Building Museum, and many more. 
   The Senate will sorely miss its resident scholar. Senator Moynihan combined a mind for philosophy, an eye for beauty, and a heart for service. And this city, the State of New York, and our Nation are the better for his sensitive and dedicated work. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I commend and congratulate my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation to set up a commission. I think it is very timely. 
   I would just say to my friend from Pennsylvania, it seems that one of the things I have picked up in traveling around Iowa is that people are deeply concerned and somewhat unnerved by the fact that we have all these different types of voting machines around the United States. We are a mobile society. We move a lot. We go from one jurisdiction to another. You can go from one county to another and have a completely different system of voting on machines. Plus, some of these are really outdated. We have technology today that really can ensure that your vote is as you want it and that there are no mistakes made unless you intentionally want to do something such as that. We just have not adopted that new technology. 
   I think the proper course would be to set up some type of commission, give them the proper funding, and make sure it is a bipartisan commission that would be evenly divided, that could go out and look at these things and perhaps report back to Congress in due time. I understand the Senator said he wanted 1 year to report back, if I am not mistaken.

   Mr. HARKIN. I think you might. In fact, in my comments I was going to talk about that. Obviously, we are thinking along the same lines. I really do believe there ought to be more uniformity, especially in national elections, on the type of equipment that is used. I must admit, being from Iowa, we don't use punch cards. That went out years ago. I was quite surprised some States were still using punch cards. Really, they are open to all kinds of problems. Some States still use the old lever, the old hand-cranked machines. 
   I don't know; does the Senator know how many different types of voting machines are used in the United States today?

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
   I note many Americans have expressed concern about the time it is taking to determine whom the American people elected as President last Tuesday. We just came out of a meeting. A bunch of reporters stopped me just off the floor, talking to me about the crisis and shouldn't we have to get this resolved. I said: Wait a minute, there is no crisis in this country right now. Frankly, I am heartened to see that most Americans' first priority is to ensure the votes are counted with precision, accuracy, and fairness. The American people know how important is one of the bedrocks of our great democracy, the idea no matter how rich or poor, powerful or weak, no matter what race, creed, or sex, the vote of every American counts equally: One person, one vote. 
   We can all agree this Presidential election is one of the closest in our Nation's history. Now it appears that Vice President AL GORE has won the popular vote. He currently leads by about 223,000 votes. He also, right now, is ahead in the electoral college, but that electoral college outcome is much less clear. At this point, whichever candidate wins Florida probably wins the Presidency, and right now, according to the latest reports, only 388 votes separate the two candidates. To put it in context, that is .0067 percent of the votes in Florida. 
   Frankly, I think we can all agree the spirit of ``whatever it takes to win and to heck with the will of the voters'' has no place in American politics. So I was pleased to see the initial polling shows that these efforts have failed. According to a recent Newsweek poll, 72 percent of American adults believe that making certain the count is fair and accurate is more important than rushing to judgment to get matters resolved quickly. 
   Yes, democracy is slow. Yes, democracy takes time. But it is worth it, and the American people understand that. There is no crisis. We should take our time, and we should determine accurately what the will of the voters really is. 
   Much has been said of the hand counting of ballots in Florida, as if that were something strange and new. We do hand counting of ballots all the time for sheriff, for local county commissioner--all the time. This is done at every election in the United States, Federal and State and local, when it is very close. Why is the office of President less important than local sheriff? It seems to me if hand counting of a ballot is important for the local sheriff's race, it is equally important, even more important, for the highest office of the land. 
   It has been said that machines are neither Democratic nor Republican. That is true. But let's keep in mind, the only reason we use voting machines in this country is, No. 1, it is cheaper and, No. 2, it is quicker. Still, the most accurate way to determine each person's vote is to have that person walk into a voting place, give each a paper ballot, and have each go in there and mark the boxes with an x, fold the ballot, step out, and put it in a box. Then when the polls close, a committee looks at these ballots and counts each one. That is clearly the most accurate way of counting votes. 
   Why don't we do that in America? Obviously, you would not know the outcome of elections for months afterwards because it would take that long  to hand count all the ballots. Second, it would be prohibitively expensive. But the idea that somehow machines are more accurate than human counts is just nonsensical. It is just not true. The human count is still the most accurate. 
   When the votes are really close and when the office is at stake because of the closeness of the votes--.0067 percent of the votes in Florida, as I stand here--it is incumbent upon us to do what we would do in a local sheriff's race or supervisor's race, and that is to hand count these ballots. 
   Again, having said that, I will have more to say about it later on this afternoon. I see the hour is 12:30 so the time has come for our recess. We will be back in at 2:15. At that time, I want to explore a little further the idea of having a standardized procedure for standardized voting machines for the entire country, one on which people can rely no matter where they live. People move all the time. They should not have to be confronted with different voting machines. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor of the legislation just introduced by Senator SPECTER of Pennsylvania.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I said this morning, we can certainly all agree that this Presidential election is one of the closest in our Nation's history. While AL GORE appears to have won the popular vote, leading by 223,000 votes, the electoral college outcome is much less clear, even though Vice President GORE also leads in the electoral college vote at this time. At this point, whichever candidate wins Florida will probably win the Presidency. Right now, according to the latest reports, only 388 votes separate the two candidates. That is 0.0067 percent of the votes in Florida--less than seven-thousandths of 1 percent. 
   Yet when it appeared that the extremely close vote in Florida would decide the election, rather than waiting for a careful counting of the ballots as required by Florida law, the Bush campaign pushed for acceptance of the current count. The American people disagree. According to a recent Newsweek poll, 72 percent of American adults believe that making certain the count is fair and accurate is more important than rushing to judgment to get matters resolved quickly. Democracy is slow, yes; democracy takes time, yes; but democracy is still the fairest system of all, and the American people understand that. 
   It was very discouraging that just days after the Bush campaign sharply criticized our respected former Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, for leaving open the possibility of seeking judicial review of highly questionable portions of the process, the Bush lawyers themselves went to Federal court to block a hand recount of questionable ballots--a process that is generally recognized as much more accurate than machine counting. 
   I also find it highly ironic that the Bush lawyers chose to try to block a hand recount when they themselves, according to news reports, supported a hand recount in New Mexico. In fact, in 1997, Governor Bush himself signed a Texas law that seems to encourage hand recounts of disputed votes. 
   Now, as we all know, just a few hours ago, the latest attempt to block a complete and fair count has been upheld by a court in Florida, although an appeal is expected shortly, if in fact it hasn't happened by now. 
   The court ruled that Florida's Secretary of State, who was an active Bush supporter and traveled around the Nation on his behalf, could cut off the county's recount efforts at 5 p.m. this afternoon. She made the decision to end the count at that time, 5 p.m. today, knowing full well that the hand count of the ballots allowed by Florida law cannot possibly be completed by that point in time. 
   In America, we are certainly used to getting results of our elections from the news networks almost immediately after the polls close, sometimes 3 or 4 hours later in relatively close elections but almost certainly the next morning. However, we have to realize that what we heard from the networks early on election night were not actual election results but exit poll results based on a very few counted ballots. When the difference between the candidates falls below a couple of points, we have to wait for an actual vote count. When the 
   difference falls below a few tenths of 1 percent, we have to wait for a careful recounting of the votes. 
   There are several important reasons for these procedures. First, precinct and county election officials are dealing with many numbers quickly on election night. Mistakes are unavoidable. But in this case, where the difference is not 1 percent or a half percent but less than seven one-thousandths of 1 percent, or just over 300 votes out of over 5 million cast, we cannot allow any room for error. 
   The very machines that we use to count votes are prone to inaccuracies. The inaccuracies in some Florida counties occurred because not all voters marked their ballots to the preset machine standards. In some cases, they were using punch cards. Well, people don't always push the paper dot out of the hole, and sometimes they don't totally fill in the circle with the No. 2 lead pencil; thus, the machines can't always detect these votes. In a typical election, this isn't a problem. 
   Election officials know that one out of every so many votes won't be counted by machines. I wonder how many American people know it is a given fact that one out of so many votes will not be counted by a machine. They are very inaccurate. In an election where one candidate wins by 5 percent or 8 percent of the vote, these inaccuracies make very little difference in the final outcome. 
   But in an election as close as this, every single one of these votes matters. We have to count every single last one of them. No American should be disenfranchised because of a mechanical error. That is why I believe we have to be patient and allow the process to continue. 
   Again, former Secretary of State James Baker keeps saying that we have already counted the votes twice. But what he doesn't mention is that these counts were both done with machines that have error rates far larger than the percentage of votes separating the two candidates. Machine error rates are far higher than seven-thousandths of 1 percent. Mr. Baker says that machines don't have bias, that they are neither Democratic nor Republican. I keep hearing this statement. 
   It is also true that machines are far too inaccurate for the kind of count we  need in this election. These machines just cannot count all those ballots where the hole is not completely punched or the circle is not completely filled in. Only human beings who can see whether someone tried to punch through the paper or make a mark can do that. To those who say that machines are more accurate than human beings counting ballots I would just ask: Have you ever gotten a phone bill that was inaccurate? How about your credit card bill? Machines make mistakes all the time. If you are not careful in catching them, you may be paying a little too much on your phone bill when you pay it. That is why we carefully look over our bills. The only way to really accurately get a count is through the time tested, old-fashioned way of counting these ballots. 
   Why do we use voting machines? We do not use voting machines because they are more accurate. We use voting machines because, No. 1, they are quicker and, No. 2, they are less expensive. They do not cost as much. Still, the most accurate way of determining every person's vote is to have people walk into a voting place; you hand them a paper ballot. They walk into the booth; they take their pencil and they mark the X in the box or circle; they fold the ballot, stick it in the box, and when the polls close those ballots are hand counted by human beings, impartial panels--one from each party, let's say--counting these ballots. 
   If that is the most accurate way, why don't we do that in America? Because in a national election such as this it would take maybe a couple of months to count all the ballots nationwide, and we want to know before then what the results are. Plus the cost of paying humans to sit there and count the ballots would be exorbitant. So we must disabuse ourselves of this false notion that somehow voting machines are more accurate. They are not. The most accurate is still hand counting those ballots. 
   We have to remember also that there is nothing exceptional about conducting a recount. Both hand recounts and machine recounts are common in close elections. This happens all over America in every election. We have recounts even in local sheriffs' races. Imagine. Let's take the Florida race. Let's bring it home to a county. Let's say we are having a sheriff's race in a county and let's say there were 4,000 votes cast in the sheriff's race, 2003 for one candidate, 1,997 for the other. The county says it is too close; we are going to have a recount. They start hand recounting it. They hand recount 200 ballots out of the 4,000 and the outcome changes by 2 votes. Now, instead of being separated by 6 votes, the candidates are separated by only 4 votes. 
   Let's say the top ranking election official in the county comes in and says: Stop counting. You have counted 200 ballots; you cannot count anymore. What do you think the outcry would be like in that county? 
   What, you have counted 200 ballots, the vote has changed by 2, that could be 30 or 40 votes out of 4,000 ballots. That could reverse the original improperly counted outcome. 
   That is exactly what is happening in Florida on a much larger scale than the local sheriff's race to which I just alluded. 
   Secretary Baker protested that the election officials in control of the Florida counties being recounted are Democrats. I find it interesting he is not protesting that the chief 
   election official in Florida is a Republican, the very official who decided today to suspend the ballot counting at 5 p.m. The Secretary also neglected to mention there are Republicans sitting in the counting rooms, monitoring the count to eliminate even the slightest possibility of partisanship. To this day I have not read or heard a single word in the newspaper or on the media anywhere to suggest that any improprieties in hand recounts have occurred. The American people can be satisfied that hand recounts are accurate and fair. 
   Again, what has happened today with the Secretary of State saying at 5 p.m. we have to have all the ballots in and stop counting the hand ballots--that is like in the local sheriff's race, you have counted 200 ballots out of 4,000, the votes have changed a couple, and the election official says: Don't count anymore. I think the American people understand this. They get it. You cannot just count a few and say we are going to stop there. 
   In our democracy, victory is determined by who gets the most votes in each State. I see no harm in waiting to make sure each count is fair and accurate. The electoral college doesn't vote until December 18, and their votes are tentatively set to be counted by a joint session of Congress on June 6, 2001. So we have plenty of time to make sure the true winner is named. So I submit the most fair and most accurate way of determining who won the electoral votes of Florida, because that is what is in contest right now, the electoral votes in Florida--the best way to determine that is to have a hand recount of all the ballots in Florida. I am told by those knowledgeable of this situation this could be done within probably 10 days to 2 weeks at the most. This could be done and then we would know with a finality and a certainty just who is selected to be the next President of the United States. If we do not do this, a cloud is going to hang over whoever is chosen to be the next President. 
   I think that is the proper way to proceed. It is improper, illogical, and not in the best interests of fairness and accuracy to stop the hand counting of ballots when only a few have been hand counted. I understand about 1 percent of the ballots in a couple of counties have been counted at this time. 
   With States such as Florida in question and with candidates separated by a tiny vote margin, it may take a few weeks to make a clear determination. I believe that is in our best interests. Slow down. We are not in any hurry. What is the rush to judgment? Let's take our time. Whoever is the President, is going to be President for the next 4 years. I submit what is important at this point in time is not whether Vice President GORE is the President-elect or Governor Bush is the President-elect. That is not what is important right now. What is important right now is the sanctity of each person's vote; to make sure that each person's vote is counted properly. That is what is important here. If we know--and we do know--that machines make mistakes, and we have seven-thousandths of a percent dividing these two candidates in the State of Florida, then the most fair way to do it is to hand recount these ballots. 
   For the life of me I do not understand why the Bush campaign is so opposed to this. As I said earlier, we have hand recounts.

   Mr. HARKIN. As I said earlier, we have hand recounts every election in the United States. Most often they are on more local elections such as elections for county supervisor, maybe a State representative. But it is not unheard of to have hand recounts for the House of Representatives or for the U.S. Senate. It is just that we have never had a Presidential election this close. So if it is fair and logical and in the best interests of ensuring that every voter's vote is counted accurately, if it is in our best interests to do that in a race for sheriff, is it not even more in our interest to have that kind of hand recount in this race for the Presidency of the United States? 
   I believe those who are somehow trying to stop the hand recount in Florida, trying to say let's just take the machine count whatever it is and we will live by that, or I guess with some overseas ballots that are due in, knowing full well the margin of error in the machines is more than the percentage difference in the two votes--if you are making that argument, what you are basically saying is the most important thing is to stop the process right now. That is more important than deciding the fairness and accuracy of each person's vote. 
   There is no crisis in America. Frankly, I disagree with Secretary Baker completely. This morning he was saying the markets are now going to be upset by this. That is nonsense. That is just nonsense. The American people understand this. There is no crisis in America. We are going about our business. People are getting up and going to work every day. Nothing is happening. We can take our time. The President-elect is not sworn in until January 20. We have time to make sure  the vote is accurate and fair. There is no need to pull the curtain down and say, no, we have to end it right now, when so much is in doubt, when the race is so close, and when a fair and accurate counting of the ballots may move it one way or the other. 
   I do not know; maybe Mr. Bush will win the election. As I have said, it is not important right now whether Mr. Bush wins or Mr. GORE wins. What is important is that every voter's vote in Florida is counted accurately and counted fairly, and whether that takes us 10 days or 12 days or 2 weeks, I believe the American people deserve to have those votes counted fairly and accurately. 
   Earlier today my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, introduced a bill proposing the formation of a commission to examine methods to reduce the miscounting of votes at the polls. I have cosponsored that legislation with him because I believe we do need to look at this situation. I think we should carefully examine alternatives, given the experience we are now going through. We should examine the electoral college. Maybe it is not perfect, but I happen to think it may be more perfect than a direct election but I am willing to look at it. Perhaps we could allocate the elector's votes by electoral district as Nebraska and Maine have decided to do. Perhaps we should consider automatically giving these electoral votes to whoever wins the State, rather than electing individual electors who could actually vote against the will of the voters in their areas. But I am intrigued by having electoral votes determined 
   by congressional districts as Maine and Nebraska do, as I said. 
   We ought to consider providing counties and States the necessary funds to assist them in modernizing and standardizing their voting methods. Although it may be somewhat more expensive--we don't know--there is voting technology that exists and is used today, or some of it may be not used, that could reduce voting errors and errors in vote tally. No technology will completely eliminate inaccuracies, but this election clearly demonstrates our current methods must be improved. That is why I joined with Senator SPECTER to cosponsor this legislation. I really do believe we need a more standardized methodology of voting machines in this country. 
   I asked my staff earlier, How many different kinds of voting machines do we have in this country? We have looked at this question and we do not know the answer.

   Mr. HARKIN. We do not know how many different kinds of voting machines there are in this country. Since we are a mobile people, we move from one State to another, one area of a State to another, they can go and be totally confused by a voting machine that is different than what they had used the election before. So I wonder aloud about maybe standardizing voting machines throughout the country so, no matter where you go, you have the same voting machine that you had before. 
   I also believe we have to look at the latest technology--it exists--which could reduce to the barest possibility that a person does not vote for whom he or she wants to vote. There are interactive devices; I have seen them demonstrated myself, devices that any person with a disability, whether you are blind or deaf or whatever you might be, could use alongside anybody else. It wouldn't differentiate. 
   It would ensure that when you walked out of that booth, you knew exactly for whom you voted or for what you voted in terms of some of the resolutions and other items that are on the ballots. 
   If nothing else, we ought to be about this in the next session of Congress. I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation in this session, and I look forward to cosponsoring it with him when we meet again in January. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was going to speak about the bankruptcy bill and how bad it is for working families, especially the elderly, and talk about how most of the people who are getting into bankruptcy situations are families who have unusually high medical bills. That is true in my State of Iowa, and many of these are elderly people. I will talk about that as we go along. 
   However, I have to take a few minutes today to follow up on what our minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, just spoke about a few minutes ago. That is the status of the most important bill we have to pass, the education bill. 
   One day has passed since Republican and Democratic negotiators came to agreement on the health and education appropriations bill for this year. As I said on the floor yesterday, the agreement we reached was a product of long and difficult bipartisan negotiations. Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, Senator SPECTER, and I, along with Congressmen Bill Young, Dave Obey, and John Porter, worked for months to craft this agreement. We worked past 1:30 yesterday morning to hammer out the last remaining differences. As I said yesterday, as with any honorable compromise, both sides gave and got. At times, the negotiations got a little heated, but both sides hung in there. 
   In the end, we came up with a good compromise. Chairman STEVENS and Chairman YOUNG led these final negotiations. They have been charged by their leadership to come to closure so we can conclude our business and pass the bill. That is exactly what they did. 
   Less than 12 hours after we reached an agreement and our staffs were busily writing the final conference report, a faction within the House Republican leadership, led by Congressman DELAY and Congressman Armey, decided to renege on our bipartisan compromise. As I said yesterday, I hope, in the interests of our children and our country, they will reconsider and let the bill go forward. 
   None of us is happy with everything in this bill. That is what bipartisan compromise is all about. Overall, passing this bill is in our Nation's best interests. 
   Right now, I will mention a few more details of the agreement we reached to demonstrate to my colleagues and the American people why it is so important. There is a 16-percent increase overall in education; class-size reduction, 35 percent more. That means 12,000 new teachers will be hired across America this next year. 
   There is a provision I have been working on for 8 years called school modernization. There is $1 billion included for school modernization, the first time we have ever had it. If the Iowa experience is any standard--and I think it will be--this should generate somewhere between $7 and $9 billion in needed school repairs around the country. 
   Individuals with disability education grants go from $4.9 billion to $6.9 billion, a 40-percent increase, the largest in history, to help our local school districts educate our kids with special needs; also, $250 million in funds to increase accountability and to turn around failing schools. That is almost double what it was before. We had the largest increase ever in Pell grants, to make college affordable to working families. In this bill, 70,000 more kids will be able to get Head Start, bringing the total in our Head Start Program to 950,000 kids. 
   There is money in there for youth training and youth opportunity grants; a 66-percent increase in money for child care; community health centers, up $150 million to $1.2 billion, meaning 1.5 million more patients can be served next year; the important low-income heating and energy assistance program, $300 million more; Breast and cervical cancer screening, so that women can get the needed preventive health care they need, an $18 million increase; NIH, a $1.7 billion increase, the largest in our Nation's history. Afterschool care is almost double; it means 850,000 children will be served by afterschool programs. Also in the health end, 9,600 more research projects, one of which could bring major medical breakthroughs in cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease. That is what is in this bill. Forty-two thousand more women would be screened for breast and cervical cancer. That is cost effective and saves lives. 
   There are a lot of things in this bill that are too important to be destroyed by last-minute partisan politics. As I said, nothing is perfect. The conference agreement has a number of items about which I have concern. For example, at the insistence of Republicans, an important regulation protecting workers from workplace injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome was delayed yet again. We have delayed these worker protections for 3 years now, and last year's conference report contained explicit language that they would not be delayed any further. 
   Yet as part of the give and take of the final negotiations, language was included to delay implementing this regulation until June 1. 
   Each year over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-related muskoloskeletal disorders, like carpal tunnel syndrome and back injuries. Employers spend $15 to 20 billion a year just for workers compensation related to these injuries. The estimated annual total cost to workers and the Nation due to ergonomics is a high as $60 billion, according to the Department of Labor. So this is a major problem. 
   This proposal was initiated under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole in the Bush administration 9 years ago. This is not a partisan issue. It is a worker protection issue plain and simple. 
   Apparently, that is not good enough for Mr. DELAY. He wants to kill this important worker protection outright. I do not see how we can face the 600,000 people who are injured each year and say, ``No, your health and your safety just aren't important enough to be protected.'' How can you say, with a straight face that protecting these workers from serious injury is a ``special interest provision. 
   So I again urge the House Republican leadership to reconsider their decision to kill this important bill. We had a good, honest bipartisan agreement. Nobody loved every part of it, but it was decided upon honorably and in good-faith. 
   This is what the American people want and need. They want us to work together in good faith and to come up with a product that is in their best interest. A lot of sweat and debate and compromise went into doing just that. It is late, but it is not too late to bring back our agreement. 
   I am confident we would have more than enough votes in the House and Senate to pass it. And I have personally been assured by President Clinton that he would sign it as it come out of committee. 
   We ought to do what is right. 
   I just learned a few minutes ago that there is a possibility we are going to renege on the agreement that we reached in conference; that the language we adopted there is now being changed to reflect original language that we conferees talked about, fought over, discussed, changed, modified over a period of about--over a period of a couple of months but finally, Sunday night, over a period of about 2 or 3 hours. We finally reached language with which everyone agreed. I am now being told that language is being thrown out. It is being thrown out and  we are going back to the initial language that was the source of the contention. 
   If that is so then, indeed, we have reached a very bad situation in this Congress. If this is what happens, what it means is when we go to conference with the House and we come up with our compromises and we shake hands on it, we sign our names to it, if you happen to be in the majority, and you want to change it, then tough luck; it means absolutely nothing. We operate on our word around here.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun safety legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 31, 1999: 
   Francisco Aguillon, 31, Chicago, IL; 
   Helton Calderio, 42, Detroit, MI; 
   Lashon Carter, 18, Kansas City, MO; 
   Archie Dean, 29, Pittsburgh, PA; 
   Roland Ford, 15, Washington, DC; 
   Eddie Griffith, Sr., 71, Memphis, TN; 
   Richard Hall, 19, Pittsburgh, PA; 
   Larry Lavigne, 22, New Orleans, LA; 
   Willie Matthews, 48, Oakland, CA; 
   Preston Noble, 25, Philadelphia, PA; 
   William Ohlig, 21, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Billijo M. Pyle, 51, Akron, OH; 
   Derrick Smith, 20, Rochester, NY; 
   Doniell Smith, 14, Washington, DC; 
   Gene Thompkins, 57, Akron, OH; and 
   Jorge Vega, 34, Miami-Dade County, FL. 
   Two of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 15-year-old Roland Ford and 14-year-old Doniell Smith of Washington, D.C., were shot and killed by four masked gunmen while the two boys and their friends were walking back from a Halloween party hosted by their church. The gunmen fired nearly 30 shots into the group, injuring two and killing Roland and Doniell. A police department representative described the two boys as ``strait-laced kids who weren't involved in any negative activity in the community.'' 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have now served on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee. I have been on that committee 15 years. Each year when we pass the budget for education and health, there are always tough negotiations, but we always manage to get through it and we get it to the President and move ahead. 
   This year we had some long and tough negotiations on our bill. The first part of the year, the majority leader of the Senate said education was going to be their priority. Yet here we are at the end of the year--actually at the beginning of the new fiscal year; we are a month into the new fiscal year--and we still do not have our education budget through yet. It is going to be the last bill through. 
   We have been working very hard over the last several weeks to bring this bill to its final conclusion. First of all, the chairman of our appropriations subcommittee, Senator SPECTER, worked very hard this year to get it through our committee and to get it through the Senate. Then we went to conference, and we have been locked in conference now for the better part of 3 months, most of it over the last month working out these differences, as we do on bills. 
   Last night, Sunday night, we met for what was supposed to be our final negotiating process on the education budget. We started meeting last night after our vote in the Senate, so that must have been around 8 or 9 p.m. We met until almost 2 a.m. There were tough negotiations. Senator STEVENS, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Congressman BILL YOUNG from Florida on the House side, Congressman PORTER, Congressman OBEY, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee and on the subcommittee that deals with education, and I and, of course, the Director of OMB, Mr. Lew, was there also. 
   As I said, we had tough negotiations, but we had it down to about four or five issues, finally, and we hammered them out. 
   Finally, at about 1:30 a.m. this morning, we reached our agreement. As is usually true of any agreement or compromise, there are things in the compromise that I do not like. I am sure there were things in there Senator STEVENS does not like. There are items in there that Congressman PORTER, a Republican from the House, and Congressman OBEY do not like. Together we decided this was the best package we could do, and we all shook hands on it. 
   Today, thinking we had finally reached an agreement on this important education bill, I find out that Majority Whip DELAY has turned his thumbs down on it, and so did Majority Leader ARMEY turn his thumbs down on it. 
   Evidently, Speaker HASTERT has said the same thing. 
   What are we doing here? Why do we even have committees? Why don't we just let Speaker HASTERT and Congressman DELAY and Congressman ARMEY deal with everything? 
   The reason we have the committees is because people such as Senator STEVENS know these issues. He has been working on these issues for years. And Congressman PORTER and Congressman YOUNG and Congressman OBEY and Senator SPECTER and myself, we know these issues. We know the ins and outs of these issues. We have been working on them a long time. 
   I am not on the Commerce-State-Justice Committee, so I could not negotiate on that because I do not know all the ins and outs of it, and neither does Congressman DELAY or Congressman ARMEY or Congressman HASTERT know that. Yet they turned thumbs down on this deal we struck last night. 
   Senator STEVENS worked long and hard to reach this agreement. I am sure he was not happy with everything that was in it, just as I was not. But Senator STEVENS dealt in good faith. We gave our word. We shook hands on it. So did Congressman BILL YOUNG. I have worked with Congressman YOUNG for 15 years--and Congressman PORTER and Congressman OBEY. We reached our agreements. We walked out of the room at 1:30 a.m. And today, Congressman DELAY and Congressman ARMEY say: No. 
   I do not know. I feel very badly for Senator STEVENS and the others who worked very hard on this, gave their word, shook hands. We had the agreement. 
   What is at stake here? Is this all just an inside ball game, that it shouldn't bother anybody outside the beltway? Here is what is at stake. 
   In education: Pell grants, some of the largest increases ever in Pell grants; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, giving money out to the States to help pay for the education of kids with disabilities; class size reduction, hiring more schoolteachers to reduce class size; school modernization so we can get money out to our schools so they can repair and fix up their schools. The average age of our schools in America is 42 years. They need to be fixed up. We had money for that. 
   In health care, medical research: All the money for NIH for medical research; all the money for our community health centers that are doing so much to help our uninsured people in this country with health care; an important cancer-screening program for breast and cervical cancer for women. 
   Child care: One of the biggest increases that we have ever had for child care. 
   These issues are too important to be playing politics at this late moment. That is what is happening on the House side--pure politics. 
   Again, I hope this is just a temporary setback. Congressman ARMEY, Congressman DELAY, and Speaker HASTERT are talking about things that they do not understand. I am hopeful they will meet with Congressman YOUNG and Senator STEVENS, who understand that we had an agreement. Not everyone liked it, but it was a good agreement. It was one that we could live with, and one that I felt the President could sign. 
   So these issues are much too important for our Nation's future, for our kids' future, for the health of women--too important for these kinds of partisan games this late in the year. 
   I just want to take this time to urge our friends on the 
   House side to not play games with this important education bill. We have to get this money out. We are already a month into our fiscal year. Our colleges, our school boards, our State departments of education need to know, need to have this money out there, so we can continue to hire teachers and reduce class size and modernize our schools. 
   We need to get the money out there for breast and cervical cancer screening for women all over America. What we do not need is the kind of interference that we have had by Congressman DELAY and Congressman ARMEY and Congressman HASTERT on the House side. 
   Now is the time to pull together, as we did last night. This was a true bipartisan effort. Republicans in the House, Democrats in the House, Republicans in the Senate, and Democrats in the Senate worked together and we got an agreement. That is the way this place should work. Senator STEVENS led it on the Senate side, Congressman YOUNG on the House side. We got our agreements. It is too bad we see this last minute kind of partisan bickering from the House leadership. 
   Again, I am hopeful this is a temporary setback. Let's get our education bill done. Let's get it to the President so he can sign it, so we can move ahead with the necessary task of educating our kids in this country. It is, indeed, a sad day today when we see what happened in education.

I would just say to him, also, that, quite frankly, we had great cooperation from Senator STEVENS on the Republican side in getting this bill through. He worked very hard on it, too. I just want to make that point because it is just a darn shame that in these last hours we have gotten thrown into this partisan thing on the House side by the House leadership.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Conservation Security Act today together with Senator GORDON SMITH of Oregon. This important bipartisan legislation represents the first meaningful step toward comprehensive conservation on all of America's working farms and ranches. Although the reintroduction of this bill comes late in the session, it represents the beginning of the new approach for conservation in the next farm bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is truly a privilege to be here today to speak in support of this important reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I want to thank Senators JEFFORDS, DEWINE, MIKULSKI and KENNEDY for their leadership and steadfast work toward bringing this for us to consider today. As you know, this is the first reauthorization of these programs in eight long years. The House passed H.R. 782 on a vote of 405-2 yesterday. It's time has come today. 
   The Older Americans Act is the most important Federal senior's services program and has provided essential services to our nation's seniors for the last 35 years. In particular, the program has provided services to those seniors who are vulnerable because poverty, frailty or isolation. As America gets older, we have a growing need for the services and programs authorized by the OAA. We in Iowa have the highest percentage of seniors over the age of 85 in the country. We are ranked 5th in the nation in our percentage of seniors over the age of 65. The services provided through the Older Americans Act provide a lifeline to many of my constituents. 
   I'm proud to support the strengthening of programs such as congregate and home delivered meals, family caregiver support, in-home services for the frail elderly such as those with Alzheimer's disease, home health, and the senior community service program. These programs help Iowa seniors live independently and remain in their homes and communities. 
   One of my constituents told me recently what the OAA means to her: Virginia Mehl, who lives in a rural town in Iowa, had never worked away from her farm home. At the age of 79, faced with the death of her husband, she had to go and find work, cleaning an office. Suffering from fibromyalgia, she was having a real tough time. Thankfully, someone pointed her to Green Thumb, one of the organizations administering the senior community service employment program. With their help, Mrs. Mehl learned computer and office skills, enabling her to be placed in the office where she now works. She told me: ``Green Thumb is the best thing that ever happened to me. [I have] the opportunity to learn new skills, meet new people, and pay for my aqua-exercise classes which I need for my disease.'' 
   Mrs. Mehl is just one example of how the Older Americans Act has been an extraordinary vehicle for helping hundreds of thousands of senior Americans obtain the training and job experience needed to improve their lives and provide economic independence, changing the negative stereotypes about aging, encouraging seniors to embrace new technology and keep up with the changing face of our economy.  
   Seniors in our States have been calling on us since 1995 to reauthorize these important programs. Today, at long last, and with strong bipartisan cooperation, we will do just that.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened somewhat tentatively to the comments made by my friend from Arizona. He talked about ending the partisan gridlock. If you want to end the partisan gridlock, take a look at the tax bill that just came over. This package was never considered in the Finance Committee, never considered on the Senate floor. No Democrats were ever invited to any of the meetings to work it out. There was no consultation with any Democrat. No paper was ever shared with any Democrat in putting it together. It was stuffed into an unrelated conference report. It was sent over here for a vote. And the Republicans have said to the Democrats: Take it or leave it, but you have no part in drafting it, debating it, or anything else. 
   I would say, if you want to end the partisan gridlock, Republicans should start working in a bipartisan fashion around here to fashion. 
   I hear George Bush out there. He is saying he wants to come to Washington and end this gridlock. I say to Governor Bush: Pick up the phone and call Senator LOTT. Pick up the phone and call Speaker HASTERT. Tell them to quit playing these kinds of games, these partisan games around here, where we get a tax bill on the Senate floor, in the closing days of this year, that we have had absolutely no part in--absolutely none whatsoever.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator from Nebraska bringing that out because obviously this is a targeted tax cut. As the Senator just said, they have targeted it to the wrong people: not the kind of people and the families whose sons and daughters lost their lives in the Persian Gulf recently, not those, but to those with the highest incomes. 
   I know the Senator had the aggregate figures, but he mentioned the fact  that most of these families make less than $40,000 a year. Under the Republicans' targeted tax cut, if you are a family making $24,000 to $39,300 a year, if you are in that group where average Americans are, you get $94 a year in a tax cut. If, however, you are making more than $319,000 a year, on average, you get 4,158 bucks a year in a tax cut from their targeted tax cut. 
   So the Senator is right. They have targeted it to those who make more than $319,000 a year. And the Senator is right, you have to ask the question: What is fair about this?

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. It does not pass the fairness test at all. I might ask the Senator one other question. We know that there are a lot of people in this country who lack health insurance. As I understand it, in this tax bill, there is a provision that is supposed to expand coverage. But the way it is drafted, $18,000 in tax benefits are provided for each estimated person who will gain health insurance coverage. I ask the Senator, does this sound like fiscal conservatism?

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator points out that most people pay payroll taxes. Especially in the income brackets where they are lacking health insurance, they are paying more in payroll taxes than they are income taxes. That is why you are only getting 600,000 more people with health insurance at a cost of $18,000 in tax incentives per person per year. What a giveaway. 
   Does the Senator agree that for those income groups that lack a lot of health insurance coverage--and that is low-income people who are working for minimum wage or maybe above minimum wage, or working for small businesses that can't afford to give them health insurance coverage in our small towns and communities --would it not be better or cheaper, fairer to expand the Medicaid program or the CHIP program to cover the kids?

   What the Republicans have done is they have given us this tax package without involving any Democrat. So you are right, none of us was in the room to ever ask the question, Is this fair? They have now dropped this on us. What they have done, really, is sort of given lie to their whole campaign theme with Governor Bush, and that is that you need a tax cut--to just shotgun it out there--and they have given us a targeted tax cut. I am grateful to the Senator for pointing that out.

   Again, I will just add on top of that, the other unfairness part of this bill is that they didn't what they should have to really expand health insurance coverage in a meaningful way to low-income people. I am talking about people who are working, not people who are on Medicaid and getting coverage. I am talking about low-income people above the poverty line and modest income people who are working hard, making $20,000 a year; they may have a couple kids. They are not in this bill.

I ask: can we afford to add 600,000 additional individuals under their bill by giving a tax incentive for health insurance that costs $18,000 per person per year that gains coverage, how can we afford that? Can we afford it when there are so many ways that far more people could acquire health insurance with a far smaller incentive, but one that was properly designed for the purpose.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, an article appeared today in the Washington Post, Thursday, October 26, 2000, in which the American Academy of Actuaries, a respected nonpartisan organization of financial and statistical experts, reported Governor Bush's plan to cut taxes and divert Social Security payroll taxes to establish individual accounts would make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly held national debt. 
   It is interesting. Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, faulted the study because it relied on growth estimates contained in a recent Congressional Budget Office report that projected long-term budget trends. He said that this assumes growth ``at an unusually low level'' past 2010. 
   Wait a minute. The Congressional Budget Office is run by the Republicans, not by the Democrats. 
   Lastly, this report said ``counting his taxes and individual accounts, Bush is very much overspending Gore.'' 
   I ask, in this campaign who is really the big spender? Obviously, it is Gov. George Bush of Texas. Don't take my word for it. Take the word of the American Academy of Actuaries for it. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing the Agricultural Producer Protection Act of 2000, a bill which will help ensure an open competitive agricultural marketplace. There is no issue raising more concerns in agriculture today than the rapid increase of economic concentration and vertical integration. The structure of agriculture and the entire agribusiness and food sector is being massively transformed--and the pace is accelerating. Large agribusinesses through mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances are controlling more and more of the production and processing of our agricultural commodities. Beyond this horizontal concentration, these large firms are relying on production and marketing contracts to hasten the trend toward vertical integration in agriculture. 
   According to the Department of Agriculture, the top four fed cattle packers control 80 percent of the market, while the top four pork processors control almost 60 percent of the market. In the grain industry, the top four firms control 73 percent of the wet corn milling, 71 percent of soybean milling, and 56 percent of flour milling. This conglomeration of power is limiting producers' marketing choices and adversely affecting the prices they receive. While the market basket of food has only increased by 3 percent since 1984, the farm value of that market basket has plummeted 38 percent. In fact, the farmer's share of the retail food dollar has dropped from 47 percent in 1950 to 21 percent in 1999. In addition, the farm-to-wholesale price spreads for pork increased by 52 percent and for beef by 24 percent in the past five years. 
   But farmers are not the only ones at risk because of the conglomeration of economic power by a few large agribusinesses and the reductions in competition. Consumers are also at risk. I liken arrangement to an hourglass, with many farmers on one side and many consumers on the other side. In the middle is a choke point with just a few large agribusiness firms. We, as consumers, should not become reliant on an every dwindling number of companies for our food. 
   Agribusiness is changing the way they play the game and it is becoming increasingly clear that enforcement of the antitrust and competition laws--including the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Packers and Stockyards Act--is not enough by itself to ensure healthy competition in agriculture. Congress must step in and clarify the rules of the game before the big conglomerates push the independent producers out entirely. That is what my legislation is designed to do. 
   Consolidation and vertical integration in the agricultural sector is resulting in a great disparity in bargaining power and a gross inequality in economic strength between agribusinesses and producers. The impacts of this disparity are being most dramatically seen in the increased use of contracting in agriculture. I recognize that it is probably inevitable that there will be more contracting for a number of reasons. However, as recognized by several state Attorneys General who have proposed model state contract legislation, contracting with large agribusinesses pose serious problems that our current laws do not reach. 
   First, large companies are increasingly leveraging their economic muscle and control of market information to dictate contract terms to the detriment of producers. Large companies often offer contracts to producers on a ``take it or leave it'' basis. The company tells the farmer to sign a form contract with no opportunity to negotiate different terms and with little or no ability to take time to think about whether or not to sign the contract. 
   Second, large agribusinesses are transferring a disproportionate share of the economic risks to farmers through contracts. The contractual risks producers will face under a contract are usually buried in pages of legalese and fine print. Producers are often stuck with unfair contract terms they did not even know existed because of the lack of opportunity to consult with an attorney or an accountant. 
   Third, increasing use of contracts threatens market transparency. Prevailing prices for agricultural commodities have traditionally been readily available through public transactions. The use of strict confidentiality clauses in contracts veil transactions in secrecy. These clauses prohibit farmers from comparing contracts and negotiating for a fair deal. Farmers are often prohibited from discussing their deals with other producers, let alone with a financial or market advisor, an attorney, or an accountant. 
   Fourth, once a producer enters into a contractual relationship with a company there is virtually no realistic protection from unfair practices, abuses, or retaliation. Most production contracts require producers to make substantial long term capital investments in buildings and equipment prior to ever getting a contract. Once a producer makes the financial commitment, they are offered short term contracts that must be continually renewed. Because of these financial obligations, producers often have no other alternative than to sign whatever contract is offered to them. This situation not only makes it easier for a company to retaliate against those who try to speak up for their rights but also eliminates virtually any bargaining power the producer may have had. They often have no other alternative than to take a contract which further exploits them with unfair terms and which further shifts the economic risks to producers. In addition, if a producer has to litigate individually against an agribusiness conglomerate it is very expensive and they are at a huge disadvantage. 
   The Agricultural Producer Protection Act of 2000 provides reasonable oversight of agricultural contracting that will address these problems and promote fair, equitable, and competitive markets in agriculture. The Act would: (1) require contracts to be written in plain language and disclose risks to producers; (2) provide contract producers three days to review and cancel production contracts; (3) prohibit confidentiality clauses in contracts; (4) provide producers with a first-priority lien for payments due under contracts; (5) prohibit producers from having contracts terminated out of retaliation; and (6) make it an unfair practice for processors to retaliate or discriminate against producers who exercise rights under the Act. 
   My legislation also recognizes that there must be a balance between providing oversight of contracting and addressing the root of the problem--the growing disparity in bargaining power between large agribusinesses and independent producers. Independent farmers can compete and thrive if the competition is based on productive efficiency and delivering abundant supplies of quality products at reasonable prices. But no matter how efficient farmers are, they cannot survive a contest based on who wields the most economic power. 
   Because of the increased levels of concentration and vertical integration in agriculture, it is imperative that Congress facilitate a more competitive and balanced marketplace for negotiations between large agribusinesses and producers. The Agricultural Producer Protection Act of 2000 provides farmers with the tools necessary to bargain more effectively with large agribusiness conglomerates for fair and truly competitive prices for the commodities they grow. 
   Congress passed the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 to ensure that farmers could join together to market their commodities without fear of interference or retribution from processors. Unfortunately, the law has several weaknesses which prevent it from truly helping producers generate enough market power to bargain effectively with large processors. The law: (1) does not require that processors bargain with association members; (2) contains a loophole allowing agribusinesses to refuse to bargain with producers for any reason besides belonging to an association, which makes it much easier to manufacture an excuse for why they refuse to deal with association members; and (3) does not give the Secretary of Agriculture authority to impose penalties for violations of the Act, which greatly reduces the incentive for processors to obey the law. 
   My legislation addresses these shortcomings. The Agricultural Producer Protection Act of 2000 sets up a procedure where farmers can voluntarily  form an association of producers and petition to the Secretary to become accredited. Once accredited, agribusinesses are required to bargain in good faith with the association of producers. This requirement will help producers organize in order to negotiate fairly and effectively on the price and marketing terms for their commodities. In addition, my legislation gives the Secretary increased investigative and enforcement authority to ensure that these large processors follow the law. 
   Finally, my legislation amends the Packers and Stockyards Act of 2000 to give the Secretary administrative enforcement authority to stop unfair practices in the poultry industry. Unlike the livestock industry, the Secretary does not currently have authority to take administrative actions, including holding hearings and assessing civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act in the poultry industry. My legislation addresses this discrepancy and responds to the Administration's repeated requests for this authority. 
   Unfortunately, current law has resulted in little being done to stop the rapid consolidation and vertical integration in agriculture which is threatening both farmers and consumers. We must address this trend now before it builds more momentum, making independent farmers a footnote in the history books and putting consumers at the mercy of large agribusiness companies. 
   My legislation attacks the problems resulting from agribusiness concentration and vertical integration in two very fundamental ways. First, it provides reasonable oversight of contracting practices in order to stop the current inequalities and unfair practices farmers are facing due to the lack of bargaining power. But, I also recognize that we must address the increasing disparity in bargaining power head on. My legislation gives producers the tools necessary to enhance their bargaining position in order to negotiate fairly and equitably on the price and marketing terms for their commodities. I believe both must be done in order to ensure a fair, open agricultural marketplace.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, while we are encouraged by democratic gains in Serbia, the people of Burma continue to suffer at the hands of the world's most brutal military dictatorship--a regime which, perversely, calls itself the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Now more than ever, as a nation committed to democracy, freedom, and universal human and worker rights, America must dissociate itself from Burma's repressive regime. We must do all we can to deny any material support to the military dictators who rule that country with an iron fist. Amidst the most recent crackdown on pro-democracy forces launched in mid-August, we must demonstrate anew to the Burmese people our recognition of their nightmarish plight and our support for their noble struggle to achieve democratic governance. 
   A few yeas ago, Congress enacted some sanctions and President Clinton issued an Executive Order in response to a prolonged pattern of egregious human rights violations in Burma. At the heart of those measures is the existing prohibition on U.S. private companies making new investments in Burma's infrastructure. Pre-1997 investments were not affected. 
   Nevertheless, the ruling military junta in Burma has hung on to power and continues to blatantly violate internationally-recognized human and worker rights. The most recent State Department Human Rights Country Report on Burma cites ``credible reports that Burmese Army soldiers have committed rape, forced porterage, and extrajudicial killing.'' It mentions arbitrary arrests and the detention of at least 1300 political prisoners. 
   Human Rights Watch/Asia reports that children from ethnic minorities are forced to work under inhumane conditions for the Burmese Army, deprived of adequate medical care and sometimes dying from beatings. 
   The UN Special Rapporteur on Burma, just released a chilling and alarming account which puts the number of child soldiers at 50,000--the highest in the world. Sadly, the children most vulnerable to recruitment into the military are orphans, street children, and the children of ethnic minorities. 
   The same UN report also discussed how minorities in Burma continue to be the targets of violence. It deals vicious human rights violations aimed at minorities including extortion, rape, torture and other forms of physical abuse, forced labor, ``portering'', arbitrary arrests, long-term imprisonment, forcible relocation, and in some cases, extrajudicial executions. It also cites reports of massacres in the Shan state in the months of January, February and May of this year. 
   A 1998 International Labor Organization Commission of Inquiry has determined that forced labor in Burma is practiced in a ``widespread and systematic manner, with total disregard for the human dignity, safety, health and basic needs of the people.'' 
   In one recent high-profile court case, California District Court Judge Ronald Lew found ``ample evidence in the record linking the Burmese Government's use of forced labor to human rights abuses.'' 
   In sum, gross violations of human rights and systematic labor repression inside Burma go on and on, outside the purview of CNN and the rest of the international media. 
   But despite the onslaught of the Burmese military regime and their vow to destroy the National League for Democracy (NLD) by the end of this year. Aung San Suu Kyi, a remarkably courageous leader, stands steadfast--like a living Statue of Liberty--in her work with the Burmese people for democracy. We must never forget that she and her NLD colleagues won 392 of 485 seats in a democratic election held in 1990. But they have never been allowed to take office. 
   Still, Aung San Suu Kyi--the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner--and countless others are denied freedom of association, speech and movement on a daily basis. During the past two and a half months, she has come under renewed threats and intimidation. Last August, her vehicle was forced off the road by Burmese security forces when she tried to travel outside Rangoon to meet with her NLD colleagues. She sat in her car on the roadside for a week until a midnight raid of 200 riot police forced her back to her home and placed her under house arrest until September 14, 2000. Nevertheless, she tried again on September 21st, but she was prevented from boarding a train. The latest pathetic excuse from the authorities for abridging her freedom to travel within Burma on that occasion, was that all tickets had been sold out.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am also introducing legislation today that would ensure working men and women the representation they deserve in future trade negotiations. 
   The Trade and Labor Negotiation Fairness Act would create a new, Presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed position of Chief Labor Negotiator at the United States Trade Representative's USTR office. The Chief Labor Negotiator would represent the interests of workers during trade negotiations. 
   Nearly three years ago, farmers and others in the U.S. agriculture sector felt they needed stronger representation and greater attention by USTR. So I called for the creation of a new position at USTR having ambassadorial rank and devoted solely to representing the U.S. in agricultural trade matters. I met with Ambassador Barshefsky and pursued my proposal in the Administration. Peter Scher was appointed early in 1997 to the new USTR position and was succeeded by Greg Frazier. Both of them have done a good job representing U.S. farmers and our agriculture sector. 
   Earlier this year, in the Trade and Development Act of 2000, Congress specified in statute that USTR shall  have a Chief Agricultural Negotiator. That position will exist regardless of who is in the White House or USTR. This position would have equal status to that of the Chief Agricultural Negotiator at USTR. 
   Why do we need a Chief Labor Negotiator at USTR? Because the crucial role that worker rights play in the global economy has been ignored for too long. Enforceable labor standards have been left out of the trade agreements the U.S. has negotiated. 
   U.S. working men and women are placed at a disadvantage by this unfair competition. If this trend continues, U.S.-based companies will face continuing pressure to lower their standards to compete in the global economy. 
   The result will be depressed wages, fewer benefits, unsafe working conditions for American workers, and little or no improvement in other countries. 
   We need to use trade negotiations to raise standards around the world--not drag down standards here at home. We must ensure that labor rights are a key consideration in future trade negotiations and an integral part of future trade agreements. The Chief Labor Negotiator's primary job would be to make this happen by ensuring that the interests of workers are represented in future trade negotiations. 
   I've heard the argument that other countries don't want to talk about labor rights in trade discussions. USTR needs to take the lead and insist labor standards are an essential part of future trade negotiations. Our own economy and the well being of our families depend on it. And if trade is truly going to improve living standards around the world, it is essential that labor standards are included in future trade agreements. 
   USTR needs someone who represents workers' interests--not on the sidelines, but in the room during discussion of future trade agreements. Because the Chief Labor Negotiator at USTR will have ambassadorial rank, that person will be able to meet with the highest-level trade officials of other countries--and to insist that labor standards are on the table and are included in future agreements. 
   Vice President GORE recognizes that. He has repeatedly said that as President, he would work to ensure workers' rights are included in future trade agreements. Establishing a Chief Labor Negotiator position at USTR would help him and future Presidents keep that commitment. 
   I urge my colleagues to review this bill over the coming weeks because I will be re-introducing it next year with the hope of getting it passed in the Senate and signed into law.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I along with 15 of my colleagues are introducing a bill today that addresses an issue we haven't talked enough about in the Senate in recent years--but it's a critically important issue that we cannot continue to ignore. 
   I am talking about workers rights--specifically the erosion of a worker's fundamental right to strike, to protect that right. 
   Today, we are introducing the Workplace Fairness Act. This may sound familiar to many of my colleagues here in the Senate. It was a bill my good friend and former colleague Senator Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio introduced in the 102d and 103d Congress. 
   The Workplace Fairness Act would amend the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act by prohibiting employers from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strike. It would also make it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to allow a striking worker who has made an unconditional offer to return to go back to work. 
   Why do we need this legislation? 
   Because right now, a right to strike is a right to be permanently replaced--to lose your job. Every cut-rate, cutthroat employer knows they can break a union if they are willing to play hardball and ruin the lives of the people who have made their company what it is. In my own state of Iowa--Titan Tire Company out of Des Moines, is trying to drive out the union workers with permanent replacements--the union has been on strike for two and a half years now. 
   Over the past two decades, workers' right to strike has too often been undermined by the destructive practice of hiring permanent replacement workers. Since the 1980s, permanent replacements have been used again and again to break unions and to shift the balance between workers and management. 
   Titan Tire just outside is just one of many examples. 
   On May 1, 1998, the 650 members of the United Steelworkers of America, Local 164, who work in Des Moines Titan Tire plant, were forced into an Unfair Labor Practice Strike. 
   During the contract negotiations preceding this strike, Titan International Inc. President and CEO, Morry Taylor, attempted to eliminate pension and medical benefits and illegally move jobs and equipment out of the plant. He also forced employees to work excessive mandatory overtime, sometimes working people as many as 26 days in a row without a day off. 
   Well, the membership decided that Titan's final offer was impossible to accept, and they voted to strike. Two months later, in July, 1998, Titan began hiring permanent replacement workers. 
   During the past two and a half years, approximately 500 permanent replacement workers have been hired at the Des Moines plant. And little or no progress has been made toward reaching a fair settlement. In fact, on April 30, 2000, the day before the second anniversary of the Titan strike, Morrie Taylor predicted that the strike would never be settled. 
   Workers deserve better than this. Workers aren't disposable assets that can be thrown away when labor disputes arise. 
   When we considered this legislation in 1994, the Senator Labor and Human Resources Committee heard poignant testimony about the emotional and financial hardships caused by hiring permanent replacement workers. We heard about workers losing their homes; going without health insurance because of the high costs of COBRA coverage; feeling useless when they were permanently replaced after years of loyal service. 
   The right to strike--which we all know is a last resort since no worker takes the financial risk of a strike lightly--is fundamental to preserving workers' right to bargain for better wages and better working conditions. Without the right to strike, workers forego their fair share of bargaining power. 
   Permanent striker replacement not only affects the workers who were replaced. It affects other workers in competing companies. When one employer in an industry breaks a union, hires permanent replacements, and cuts salaries and benefits, it affects all the other companies in the industry. Now they either have to find a way to compete with the low-wages and shoddy benefits of a cut-rate, cut-throat business--or they have to follow suit. 
   Also, workers faced with being replaced are forced to make a choice. They can either stay with the union and fight for their jobs, or they can cross the picket line to avoid losing the job they've held for ten or twenty or thirty years. 
   Is this a free choice, as some of our colleagues would suggest? Or is this blackmail that takes away the rights and the dignity of the workers of this country? What does it mean to tell workers, ``you have the right to strike''--when we allow them to be summarily fired for exercising that right? 
   In reality, there is no legal right to strike today. And because there is no legal right to strike, there is no legal right to bargain collectively. And since there is no legal right to bargain collectively, there is no level playing field between workers and management. 
   In other words, Management gets to say that you must bargain on their terms--or find some other place to work. If you're permanently replaced,  that means you're out of work; you lose all your pension rights; you lose your seniority; you lose your job forever. 
   How did this happen? We've got to go back to the 1930's for the answer. 
   In response to widespread worker abuses--and union busting--Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act--the Wagner Act--in 1935 and it was signed into law by President Roosevelt. The Wagner Act guarantees workers the right to organize and bargain collectively and strike if necessary. It makes it illegal for companies to interfere with these rights. In fact, it specifies the right to strike and states: `Nothing in this act--except as specifically provided herein--shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike.' 
   In 1938, the Supreme Court dealt the Wagner Act a mortal blow in the case National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) versus Mackay Radio and Telegraph Co. In that case, the Court said that Mackay Radio could hire permanent replacement workers for those engaged in an economic strike. 
   There are two types of strikes: economic and unfair labor practices. Employers must rehire employees in unfair labor practice strikes. The NLRB determines if the strike is economic or based on unfair labor practices. Union cannot know in advance whether NLRB will rule that their employer has engaged in unfair labor practices. So any employee participating in a strike runs a risk of permanently losing his or her job. 
   What's interesting is that following the Court's ruling, companies did not take advantage of this loophole until the 1980s. Before then, they recognized that doing that would upset this level playing field. For almost 40 years, management rarely hired permanent replacements. 
   That began to change in the 1980s. Since then, hiring permanent replacements has become a routine practice to break unions and shift the balance between workers and management. 
   Again Mr. President, the Workplace Fairness Act would restore the fundamental principle of fair labor-management relations--the right of workers to strike without having to fear losing their jobs. 
   Permanent striker replacement keeps us from moving forward as a nation into an era of high-wage, high-skilled, highly productive jobs in the global marketplace. Without the right to strike, workers' rights will continue to erode. The result will be fewer incentives and less motivation to produce good work, and companies will also suffer with less quality in their products. 
   Obviously, Mr. President, this legislation won't be adopted this year. But we are introducing it today to begin the debate and to signal our intent on raising it and other fundamental labor law reforms in the next session of Congress. Its time for us to level the playing field for hard-working Americans.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack has proclaimed October 25 ``Iowa Disability Mentoring Day.'' Today, Iowans around the state will work to raise awareness of the benefits for all of us of increasing employment opportunities for young people with disabilities. And young people with disabilities will learn about job opportunities through on-site work experiences, job shadowing, and other forms of job mentoring. 
   Many of the mentors will themselves be people with disabilities. All children need role models, and I'm thrilled that through mentoring, children with disabilities will see tangible evidence that their disability does not diminish their ability to participate in the cultural, economic, educational, political, and social mainstream. 
   It's no surprise that Iowa is celebrating disability mentoring, because we are a leader in the field. This week, Iowa received a Federal grant under the Work Incentives Improvement Act for the Working Together So All Can Work program. This grant will enable more people with disabilities to participate in the workforce. 
   And Iowa Creative Employment Options, along with the University of Iowa Hospital School, has started up the Healthy and Ready to Work Mentoring Project. The project is run by a mentoring group of young adults with disabilities who have achieved their career goals or are pursuing the education and training they need to reach their goals. 
   These young men and women are college students, computer programmers, teachers, television directors, social workers, and businesspeople. On top of their studies and jobs, they are working with high school guidance counselors, meeting with students with disabilities, and developing a resource book to help students with disabilities and other students prepare for their careers. And they're planning to do even more in the future. 
   Mr. President, ten years ago, we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. We said no to exclusion, dependence, and paternalism for people with disabilities, and we said yes to inclusion, independence, and empowerment. Iowa Disability Mentoring Day and projects like the Healthy and Ready to Work Mentoring Project and the Working Together So All Can Work Program bring the ADA to life every day by increasing the independence and self-sufficiency of people with disabilities. I thank everyone who is a part of these efforts.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Craig and I are introducing the National Rural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund Act to create a new public/private partnership designed to attract equity investment in cooperatives and other businesses in rural America. Senators Daschle, Jeffords, and JOHNSON are cosponsoring this bipartisan measure. 
   The Iowa 2010 Strategic Planning Council was commissioned by Governor Vilsack to identify barriers to Iowa's economic development progress over the next ten years. The council found that two very significant hurdles were lack of venture funding and access to capital. 
   The situation is no different in many other rural areas. Many new rural businesses, particularly cooperatives and farmer-owned businesses, have tremendous difficulty acquiring equity capital--especially those involving value-added agricultural processing. 
   In Iowa alone, I have seen many cases where equity capital would have made a big difference in the future of a rural business. And every time we lose an opportunity to help a business, it means fewer jobs, fewer well-paying jobs, and less income for rural and small town America. 
   In fact, just recently, in eastern Iowa, a group of turkey producers joined together to purchase the soon-to-be-closed West Liberty packing plant from Louis Rich. Ultimately--with the assistance of a USDA loan guarantee and state and private support--the co-op successfully purchased the plant. However, they almost went under because of limited equity. Only by the skin of our teeth are those jobs still in Iowa and those farmers still enjoying the benefits of cooperative ownership of that plant. In too many other cases, good ideas have been shattered because of a lack of equity. 
   My state has made some progress through the Iowa Department of Economic Development's ``Community Economic Betterment Account'' or CEBA, which recently set aside some funding for venture capital. But far more resources are needed in Iowa and across Rural America. 
   That's why this legislation is so important. If we pass the National Rural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund Act, we will help quality rural cooperatives and businesses succeed and expand, and we will create jobs and raise the incomes of employees and farmers. 
   We're opening this bill up to discussion today with the hope of passing it in the next Congress. I believe this legislation has a strong start in the support of Senators CRAIG, DASCHLE, JEFFORDS, and Johnson. We also have the support of a number of national organizations that are key players in rural economic development including: Agribank, the American Bankers Association, CoBank, the Farm Credit Council, the Independent Community Bankers Association, the National Cooperative Business Association, the National Cooperative Bank, National Farmers Union, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, and the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Cooperation. 
   The equity fund created by this legislation will have a 12-person Board of Directors that would decide which proposals to fund. This board would include the Secretary of Agriculture and two of his or her appointees, and the remainder of the Board would be made up of private investors in the fund. The first $150 million in private sector investments will be matched dollar for dollar by the U.S. Department of Agriculture over a three year period. As a compensation for the lower rate of return in the equity fund relative to other investments, the Department of Agriculture will guarantee up to 50 percent of an investment. Debentures, which would be guaranteed, could also be issued. 
   Businesses applying for equity from the fund must be sponsored by a local entity, such as a bank, a regional or local development council, or a cooperative or economic development group. The businesses must be based in rural areas, and they cannot be primarily retail businesses. Cooperatives and other businesses receiving an equity investment from the fund will be required to invest a substantial amount of their own capital. 
   The Fund is intended to support projects that will provide off-farm income, additional markets for agricultural products, and new business opportunities in rural communities. A diverse range of viable projects, representing a variety of business structures, operating in rural communities of various sizes would be encouraged. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and those concerned about rural economic development to examine this measure between Congresses and at the beginning of the coming Congress. I am hopeful that we will be able to make the National Rural Cooperative and Business Equity Fund a reality.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the most serious issues facing our national air transport system is the shortage of space--both in the air and on the ground at key airports. We've seen this most clearly this past summer in the backups at Chicago O'Hare and in much of the airspace in the Northeast. 
   Americans have developed a tremendous appetite for air travel for both leisure and business needs. In the last few years, with our economy so strong, the result has been an increasing number of packed planes all year round, especially during the peak summer travel season. 
   But for many Americans trying to enjoy some vacation time, this summer was a season of discontent filled with bad weather, aging air traffic control systems and airline-employee difficulties. Countless Americans spent hours sitting on the tarmac at O'Hare waiting to take off, or sitting in the airport lounge, waiting for their planes to arrive. Thousands of Americans found themselves delayed, stranded and disappointed. A once-reliable system has become increasingly unreliable. 
   Some of these events are unavoidable. Clearly, there are times when bad weather requires us to delay or cancel flights. But when an airport is near capacity, even the tiniest alteration in landing and takeoff timing can quickly turn into considerable delays. 
   We've been seeing the warning signs for years. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission, chaired by the current Secretary of Commerce, Norm Mineta, warned us three years ago about our looming air travel crisis.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few brief remarks about one of our colleagues and a good friend of mine who is retiring this year. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG is a perfect example of the American dream come true. He grew up the son of immigrants, joined the Army Signal Corps in Europe during World War II, and then attended Columbia University on the G.I. bill. After graduation, Senator LAUTENBERG helped found a payroll services company called Automatic Data Processing. He soon became the firm's CEO, and, with 33,000 employees, his company is now one of the largest computing services companies in the world. 
   But Senator LAUTENBERG knew that the American dream isn't just about making it to the top. It's about giving back once you get there. That's why he ran for the United States Senate, and that's why, during his eighteen years in this Chamber, he's fought hard to make our country better for all Americans. He has fought hard to leave the ladder of opportunity down for others to climb. He's fought to improve transportation. His legislation and leadership has built and modernized highways and bridges and Amtrak rails across this country, and he's worked hard to make sure our planes and trains and cars are safe.

   Mr. HARKIN. I want to add to what the Senator from North Dakota is saying. I am sorry the Senator from Idaho has left. 
   Basically, the Senator from Idaho said Vice President GORE's proposals would--I do not know if he used the word ``bankrupt,'' but they would destroy the Social Security surplus, et cetera. 
   I say to the Senator from North Dakota, the actuaries of the Social Security Administration did a study. They said the Gore plan that would apply the interest savings, improve the widow's benefits, and end the motherhood penalty, would, in total--when you take the total package--extend the Social Security trust fund solvency to over 50 years. That is from the actuaries themselves. 
   So if my friend from Idaho were here, I would make sure he heard that. Maybe he did.

   Mr. HARKIN. What did this Rand study show? Let me read the first couple paragraphs:  
   What Do Test Scores in Texas Tell Us? 
   Do the scores on high-stakes, statewide tests accurately reflect student achievement? To answer this critical question, a team of RAND researchers examined the results on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS), the highest-profile state testing program and one that recorded extraordinary gains in math and reading scores. 
   The team's report, an issue paper titled ``What Do Test Scores in Texas Tell Us?'', raises ``serious questions'' about the validity of those gains [in Texas]. It also cautions about the danger of making decisions to sanction or reward students, teachers and schools on the basis of test scores that may be inflated or misleading.  
   It continues:  
   To investigate whether the dramatic math and reading gains on the TAAS [the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills] represent actual academic progress, the researchers compared these gains to score changes in Texas on another test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP tests were used as a benchmark because they reflect standards endorsed by a national panel of experts, they are not subject to pressures to boost scores, and they are generally considered the nation's single best indicator of student achievement. Both the TAAS and the NAEP tests were administered to fourth and eighth graders during comparable four-year periods.  
   According to the Rand study: The ``stark differences'' between the stories told by NAEP and TAAS are especially striking when it comes to the gap in average scores between whites and students of color. According to the NAEP results, that gap in Texas is not only very large but increasing slightly. According to TAAS scores, the gap is much smaller and decreasing greatly. 
   ``We do not know the source of these differences,'' the researchers state. But one reasonable explanation, consistent with survey and observation data, is that ``many schools are devoting a great deal of class time to highly specific TAAS preparation.'' While this preparation may improve TAAS scores, it may not help students develop necessary reading and math skills. The authors suspect that ``schools with relatively large percentages of minority and poor students may be doing this more than other schools.'' 
   Then it went on to say: Other features of the Texas test also may contribute to the false sense that the racial gaps are closing. 
   Let me read now what Governor Bush has said about the Texas tests. According to Governor Bush:  
   One of my proudest accomplishments is I worked with Republicans and Democrats to close that achievement gap in Texas.  
   Bush said that on ``Larry King Live.'' 
   The Rand study shows this claim is false. The achievement gap is not closing; it is actually increasing in Texas. 
   Bush says that:  
   Without comprehensive regular testing, without knowing if children are really learning, accountability is a myth, and standards are just slogans.  
   That is from a George Bush press conference. 
   The Rand study shows that the tests cited by Bush to support this claim are biased, the gains are the product of teaching to the test, and that claims of success far exceed the actual results. 
   Here is another Bush quote:  
   And our State provides some of the best education in the nation, not measured by us, but measured by the Rand Corporation, or other folks who take an objective look as to how states are doing when it comes to educating children.  
   Bush said this in a live web chat on August 30. 
   Governor Bush was citing the Rand Corporation as an independent, outside organization to look at what States are doing and what they are doing in educating their children. 
   Here the Rand Corporation came out with their finding today. ``I think the, quote, `Texas miracle' is a myth,'' Stephen Klein, a senior Rand researcher who helped lead the study, told Reuters in a phone interview. He said: the ``Texas miracle'' is a myth. 
   So much for what George Bush is saying about the ``Texas miracle'' in education. What it shows is that Texas set up its own tests, called the TAAS, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. They administered those, put rewards out there for how well you do on these tests. 
   So what did they start doing in those schools? They taught to the test, especially in schools that had a high proportion of minority students. But when measured against the national test --that is not biased, that is generally accepted around the Nation as the test to measure achievement--the Texas test falls short. 
   It showed that the gap is not closing. It is actually widening, especially when it comes to the gap between white students and students of color. 
   George Bush's claim that great progress in education has been made in Texas is simply a myth. I am glad the Rand Corporation study came out at this time. The American people deserve to know this, that the exaggerations of George Bush on education are clearly just that--terrible, gross exaggerations of what is actually happening in Texas, when he cites the Rand Corporation and then the Rand Corporation comes out and says, wait a minute, this is a myth. There are serious questions about the validity of the gains in Texas, stark differences between the stories told by Texas and by national testing. 
   It is obvious to me. George Bush keeps talking about taking tests and taking tests, but when you measure against the nationally respected NAEP test, Texas falls far short. So much for that exaggeration. Mr. Bush believes so much in taking tests; he should take an exaggeration test. He would flunk it. So much for education. 
   We were down at the White House earlier. We are sitting here now, almost a month into the new fiscal year. We have not passed our appropriations bills that fund education. We have no money for class size reduction, no money for rebuilding and modernizing our schools, no money for building new schools, no money for teacher training, no money for job training. We are a month into the new fiscal year. The last bill to be worked on is our education bill. The leadership on the Republican side said this year that education was their No. 1 priority. Yet it is the last bill to get through the Congress. 
   Finally, the Governor of Texas was quoted in today's Washington Post as saying that the Vice President has blocked reform for the past 7 1/2 years. This is the exact quote from the newspaper:  
   ``For 7 1/2 years the vice president has been the second biggest obstacle to reform in America,'' Bush added. ``Now he wants to be the biggest, the obstacle in chief.''  
   That is kind of a cute line, I have to admit. He says that the Vice President and President Clinton have blocked reform for the last 7 1/2 years. He has his little chant: They have had their chance. They have not led. We will. It is a catchy little phrase. 
   I have been watching George Bush. He has a lot of catchy phrases. It makes one wonder: What country has George Bush been living in for the last 8 years? Look at the record. During the Reagan and Bush years, we had record deficits. Our debt quadrupled in this country during those years, low job growth, low economic growth. Bill Clinton and AL GORE took us from the depths of a Republican-made recession to the heights of the longest peacetime economic expansion in this Nation's history, balanced our budgets; it took us from record deficits of $290 billion a year--that is what it was in 1992, a $290 billion deficit--and the surplus this year will be $237 billion, the largest surplus in our Nation's history. 
   We are now on track to eliminate the public debt by 2012. The Clinton and Gore team, in contrast to what George Bush is saying, created 22.2 million new jobs, an average of 242,000 new jobs every month. That is the highest number of jobs ever created under a single administration. Unemployment is now at the lowest rate in 30 years. Under the Reagan and Bush years, 
   the number of people on welfare rose by 2.5 million, an increase of 22 percent. But under Bill Clinton and AL GORE, we ended welfare as we knew it. We have moved 7.5 million people off of welfare, a decrease of 50 percent. Today we have the lowest number of welfare recipients since 1968. 
   George Bush is saying: They are big spenders; they wanted to spend all this money. The size of Government has grown. 
   Let's look at the record. 
   Bill Clinton and AL GORE have shrunk spending. Today, Federal Government spending as a share of the economy, of our gross product, has  dropped to its lowest level since 1966. It is right at about 18.5 percent, the lowest level since 1966.

She has had her hearing. She has done a great job running the Violence Against Women office. Everyone agrees on that. She would be an outstanding circuit court judge. No one doubts her qualifications. Yet the Judiciary Committee refuses to report out her name. 
   It is really a disservice to her and to our country, and it is really a disgrace on this body that her name continues to be bottled up in the Judiciary Committee. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. The Grain Standards Act contains the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 2000, legislation that enables the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to provide cost-share money for local sponsors to rehabilitate dams that were built with funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Before approving a project, NRCS will examine all options, including correcting damage or deterioration of the structure, upgrading the structural measure to meet changed land use conditions or safety needs within the watershed, and decommissioning the structure. Let me ask you, Mr. Chairman, is it your understanding that even though NRCS must fully evaluate every reasonable option, if a local sponsor does not wish to choose decommissioning the local sponsor can reject that option if NRCS presents it?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I recognize that this Act is silent on the requirements of a formal cost-benefit analysis. I would like to ask you, Mr. Chairman, if it is your understanding that each project should be completed using the most-effective option possible that also has the fewest environmental costs, including the options of voluntary buy-outs of at-risk structures, wetland restoration, dam decommissioning, and dam removal?

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senate has passed a substantially similar version of the Act. When the bill was reported by the Senate Agriculture Committee our report embodied the Committee's understanding of how the provisions of the bill should be carried out. Mr. Chairman, does that report still embody our understanding of the interpretation of the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 2000?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now 23 days from the end of the last fiscal year, and 15 days before the election. So far, this Congress can be defined more by what it has failed to do than what it has done. The majority has so far succeeded in killing a number of critical initiatives needed by working families and senior citizens. The list of legislative corpses could fill several obituary pages. 
   Here is the report card on this Congress: Patients' Bill of Rights, not done; prescription drug benefit for Medicare, not done; school modernization and renovation, not done; class-size reduction, not done; minimum wage increase, not done; pay equity, not done; farm bill reforms, not done; gun safety measures, not done; campaign finance reform, not done; hate crimes legislation, not done; Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, not done; college tuition tax deductibility, not done; long-term care tax credit, not done; child care tax credit, not done. 
   That list could go on and on but I think that summarizes it pretty well. 
   One might ask, what have we been doing around here this year? Quite frankly, not a heck of a lot when it comes to the people's business. And not only regarding the agenda, there are important authorizations and reauthorizations that have not been authorized. 
   Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the first time since 1965 that Congress fails to reauthorize. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Older Americans Act, the Superfund, Clean Water Act, Energy Policy Act and Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act--none of these reauthorizations have taken place this year. 
   On top of that, we failed to pass our critical appropriations bills. 
   Right now, we are meeting--I'm the Senate leading Democrat on the Labor-HHS and education bill--on our education appropriations bill. We are in negotiations now. We have been in negotiations since last July and we can't seem to get it done. We are talking about class-size reduction. We have had it for 2 years. It is working well. Go around to your States and talk to the schools. Teachers love it. They are getting more teachers in the classroom. They are getting aides, assistant to come in, especially for kids with disabilities. And right now the Republicans want to turn the clocks back. They don't want to do that anymore. They want to turn the clock back. 
   On school modernization and construction, they don't want to do that one, either. Mr. President, 14 million American children attend classes in buildings that are unsafe or inadequate. How do we expect our kid to learn for the 21st century when they are in schools not equipped for the 20th century? Yet this Congress says no; no to the educational things that will make our kids better students, make our schools better schools, make the future a better one for all of our people. They say no. 
   We have had for 3 years, a demonstration projects in Iowa on school  repair, $17.6 million in Federal funds to make needed repairs. It is leveraged an additional $141 million, a ratio of $8 to every $1. 
   It has been a great success. This is what we could expect around the nation if the Republicans would just get serious and fund this modernization and classroom construction program. We need to continue the class size reduction. 
   I read this morning in the Congress Daily that the majority leader may make public a tax plan that he intends to pass before we leave: $260 billion over 10 years, more than the prescription drug plan that we do not even have time to consider. I am very disappointed that we have not considered a prescription drug plan. Now, we may have a $260 billion tax plan dropped in front of us with a request to pass it before we have an opportunity to find out what is in it. I have not seen it. No one seems to have seen this tax bill. Unfortunately, I hear is it is full of tax breaks for the wealthy and breaks for the middle class and those with modest incomes are being taken out. If we do get a tax bill, we are going to have to look through this with a fine tooth comb before we vote on it. The American people deserve to know who benefits from this bill. I will be having more to say about that later, if and when we do see this so-called tax bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. As I have almost every day we have been in session, now, for the last few weeks--I brought up the issue of Bonnie Campbell, who has bipartisan support, who has had her hearing in the Judiciary Committee, yet has not been reported out for a vote. This is it. We had 7 nominations for circuit court judges, 2 had their hearings, one was referred, and one was confirmed--one out of 7 this year. Yet in 1992, when there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, we had 14 nominations for circuit court judges in the election year, 9 had a hearing, 9 were referred, and 9 were confirmed. Everyone who had a hearing got confirmed, and that was during the election year. Yet this year we only got 1 out of 7. 
   One of those stuck in there who has had the hearing is Bonnie Campbell, who headed the Office of Violence Against Women ever since it started. She has done an outstanding job at that. We passed the Violence Against Women Act. We reauthorized it by an overwhelming vote in the House and Senate. I think that is a testimony to the fact that Bonnie Campbell has done such an outstanding job of running that Office of Violence Against Women. 
   She was nominated in March, had her hearing in May, yet she has been sitting there ever since. It is unfair to her. It is unfair to make her sit bottled up in that committee. So, as I do when I get on the floor: 
   I ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee on further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, that her nomination be considered by the Senate immediately following the conclusion of action on the pending matter and that debate on the nomination be limited to 2 hours, equally divided, and that a vote on her nomination occur immediately following the use or yielding back of that time.

   Mr. HARKIN. We always hear that objection, but we don't know why. She has had her hearing. Let's bring her out for a vote; do the decent thing. Bring her out and vote it up or down. That's the decent thing. 
   Until we finish here, I will ask that unanimous consent to point out we are not the ones holding it up. All we want is a vote for Bonnie Campbell for the eighth circuit. I believe she deserves no less.

   Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator for pointing that out. I am as guilty as anyone--we get wrapped up in the language of the Senate, the language of legislation. I did not realize until now the Senator is making the point that the average person out there, maybe listening to what I said about the fact that we have not brought up or voted on a Patients' Bill of Rights or prescription drugs or Medicare or an increase in the minimum wage--we haven't brought any of 
   those up--might say: Why don't you bring them up? The Senator has pointed it out--we cannot because we are blocked. 
   Again I ask the Senator, to again clarify this one more time. This motion to proceed that has been here for a month and a day--is it the observation of the Senator that nothing has been done to move to that? We have not gone to that bill. It has just been sitting there. Does the Senator see any move on that side to go to S. 2557, whatever it is?

   Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I was at a town meeting last week and had an interesting question posed to me by a man in the audience. He said, why don't you people there work more closely together? Why don't you get along a little bit better? Why is there all this bickering? Why can't you just work these things out? 
   I thought about that. I responded to him and said, we would love to do that but in the legislative process, the way you work things out is, I have my position; you have your position. What we do is we send the bills to the committee; we bring them on the floor; we debate them--full, open, public debate. We may offer amendments. Maybe I want to change it a little bit, maybe you want to change it a little bit. Then when that is all done, you vote and you let the chips fall where they will. 
   That is the legislative process. That is what the people of this country deserve. I said to him: The way the rules are set up now in the Senate, I do not get to debate or vote or offer amendments that I think might improve a bill as I might want to improve it. I might lose, but that is all right. At least I have made my case. At least we have had a vote. At least my constituents will know where I stand and what I want to do. I may not succeed, but at least I made my case. 
   The way the situation is on the Senate floor today, I cannot make that case. I cannot tell my constituents I have fought the fight for them because I have been blocked by the rules of the Senate. I say to my friend from North Dakota, it is grossly unfair. It is unfair to the people of this country to have this kind of blockage where we cannot offer amendments, debate, vote up or down, and move on with the business of this country.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Conservation Security Act of 2000, a bill which represents a fresh new approach to the future of farm policy. 
   America's farmers and ranchers hold the key for production of a bountiful, safe, and nourishing food supply for Americans and for the population around the globe, as well as for the future for our environment. Farmers and ranchers have a long history to build on. 
   Specifically on the issue of conservation, it became a national priority in the days of the Dust Bowl, leading to the creation in the 1930s of the Soil Conservation Service at the Department of Agriculture, which is now the Natural Resources Conservation Service. With the very foundation of our food supply at risk, the Government stepped forward with billions of dollars in assistance to help farmers preserve their precious soils. 
   Since that time, Federal spending on conservation has steadily declined in inflation adjusted dollars. Yet today agriculture faces a wide range of environmental challenges, from overgrazing and manure management to cropland runoff and water quality impairment. Urban and rural citizens alike are increasingly concerned about the environmental impacts of agriculture. 
   Farmers and ranchers pride themselves on being good stewards of the land, and there are farm-based solutions to these problems being implemented all over the country. But every dollar spent on constructing a filter strip or developing a nutrient management plan is a dollar that farmers don't have for other purposes in hard times like these. And even in better times, there is a lot of competition for that dollar. 
   So who benefits from conservation on farm lands? As much or more than the farmer, it is all of us, who depend on the careful stewardship of our air, water, soil and our other natural resources. Farmers and ranchers tend not only to their crops and animals, but also to our nation's natural resources. They are the real stewards for future generations. 
   Since we all share in these benefits, it is only right that we share in conserving them. It is time to enter into a true conservation partnership with our farmers and ranchers to help ensure that conservation is an integral and permanent part of agricultural production nationwide. 
   In the 1985 farm bill, we required that farmers who wanted to participate in USDA farm programs develop soil conservation plans for their highly erodible land. This provision helped put new conservation plans in place for our most fragile farmlands. In the most recent farm bill, we streamlined conservation programs and established new cost-share and incentive payments for certain practices. 
   The Conservation Security Act of 2000, which establishes the Conservation Security Program, builds on our past successes and takes a bold step forward in farm and conservation policy. 
   My bill would establish a universal and voluntary incentive payment program to support and encourage conservation activities by farmers and ranchers. Under this program, farmers and ranchers could receive up to $50,000 per year in conservation payments through entering into 5 to 10-year contracts with USDA and choose from one of three tiers of conservation practices. Payments are based on the number and types of practices they maintain or adopt on their working lands. It is not a set-aside or easement program. 
   For implementing a basic set of practices, farmers would receive an annual payment of up to $20,000, as well as an advance payment of the greater of $1,000 or 20% of the annual payment. This basic category, Tier I, would include such practices as nutrient management, soil conservation, and wildlife habitat management. 
   To receive up to $35,000 and an advance payment of the greater of $2,000 or 20% of the annual payment, farmers would add to their Class I practices by choosing a minimum number of Class II practices--including such practices as controlled rotational grazing, partial field practices like buffers strips and windbreaks, wetland restoration and wildlife habitat enhancement. 
   Farmers who adopt comprehensive Tier III conservation practices on their whole farm--under a plan that addresses all aspects of air, land, water and wildlife--would receive up to $50,000 plus an advance payment of the greater of $3,000 or 20% of the annual payment. 
   Again, I emphasize, the Conservation Security Program would be totally voluntary. It would be up to the farmer or rancher to decide if they want to do it. If they do, then they would get additional payments. A lot of these practices farmers are already doing now, for which they receive little or no support. My legislation changes that by rewarding those farmers and ranchers who have already implemented these practices through payments to maintain them. 
   Again, these practices don't just benefit the farmer or rancher. The beneficiaries are all of us. We all will benefit from cleaner air, cleaner streams and rivers, saving soil, protecting our groundwater, and wildlife habitats.  
   Our private lands are a national resource, and conservation on farm and ranchlands provides environmental benefits that are just as important as the production of abundant and safe food. I am introducing the Conservation Security Act because I believe it will help secure both the economic future of our farmers by helping them obtain better income and as a cornerstone of our national farm policy and the environmental future of agriculture.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before getting into my main comments on the Agriculture Appropriations conference report, I want to make a few comments in response to the Senator from Arizona, who spoke about various items that are in this bill and criticized them. 
   I am very proud of my service on the agriculture appropriations subcommittee, and I am very proud of our chairman and ranking member for the bill they put together. It is a good bill. I am going to vote for it because it provides needed funding for a range of programs and activities important not only to farm families and rural communities but to consumers and our Nation generally. 
   I thank our agriculture appropriations chairman, Senator COCHRAN, and the ranking Democratic member, Senator KOHL, for their hard work on this bill. I appreciate the opportunity to have worked with them, and I thank them for their cooperation in responding to my views on various items in this legislation. I commend them for their work in putting this bill together. Overall, it is a good bill. 
   The Senator from Arizona cited a number of items in the bill. I did not hear him mention some research grants for the fruit and vegetable market analysis for Arizona. There was a produce pricing item in there for Arizona. There was a Federal administration research grant for shrimp aquaculture for several States, including Arizona. Also in the conference report, there is a $5 million item for Water Conservation and Western Cotton Laboratory in Maricopa, AZ. 
   I do not know a lot about those facilities. I know our colleague, Senator KYL, is on the committee. I am sure he has looked at these items and may have had something to do with them being in there. I do not know. But I believe the Senator from Arizona, who just spoke, is off the mark because most of the items in this bill are there because Senators pay attention to the needs of their constituents and they pay attention to the needs of our country. 
   I am not cognizant of this Water Conservation and Western Cotton Laboratory in Maricopa for $5 million, but it probably has something to do with cotton production, which is important to our country. It probably has something to do with cotton production in Arizona, which is obviously important to the people of Arizona and Western States. 
   I don't know. Maybe this has something also to do with the large amounts of Federal subsidies that our Government provides for water and for irrigation for cotton in Arizona. I listened in vain to hear my colleague from Arizona decry the use of subsidized water in his State of Arizona. Well, I'm not here today going after it. It is probably necessary for the people of Arizona, probably necessary for western cotton production, and could be important for western animal production. 
   So I think my friend from Arizona, in taking after a lot of the items in the Agriculture appropriations bill, is just simply off the mark. Oh, I know it probably makes good press. You can probably get a good column written once in a while about pork barrel spending and all that kind of stuff, but when you go down these items, these are items that are important to the people of those constituencies in those States, important to agriculture in those States and, as such, it is important to agriculture for the entire country. 
   So that is why I commend the chairman and the ranking member for putting this bill together. It is a good bill. 
   In fact, if you want to talk about items that are in the bill that pertain to States, let me talk about one in my own State. One of my highest priorities was to obtain funding for the planning and design of new facilities at the Department of Agriculture's National Animal Disease Laboratory in Ames, IA. I am pleased that the bill has the full $9 million that was requested for this purpose in the President's budget. 
   These new facilities are absolutely critical for biocontainment and work with animals with highly contagious diseases. The National Animal Disease Laboratory is one of--of course, in my opinion, it is the preeminent animal disease research facility in the United States. But the conditions of this facility are very poor. The main facility there was constructed beginning in the 1950s. Now we face threats from new animal diseases; some that are highly contagious, some that can be used by terrorists for bioterrorism. Yet the facilities, some that were built some 40 years ago, are not built to contain them adequately, safely, and securely. We need to move forward to improve the National Animal Disease Laboratory facilities as quickly as possible, to protect against emerging, highly contagious, highly infectious animal diseases, many of which, if not contained, if let loose in the environment, could cause tremendous numbers of illnesses and deaths. So the NADL funding is not just about protecting animal life and health; it is also for protecting human life and health as well. Sure, this facility is located in Iowa--I am very proud of it; it predates my service in Congress--but it is a national laboratory. This is another example where money has gone to a State, but it has gone for a national purpose. It is just like any of the other national laboratories that we have. This is the preeminent one for animal disease.  
   I also want to point out some other priority items of particular interest in Iowa that are in the bill. They are particular to Iowa, but they are broader than the State, including funding for research that will help block the use of anhydrous ammonia to make methamphetamine. That is one that is in this bill. It helps us in Iowa, but it helps us in many other States. 
   There is an item in the bill for addressing serious erosion problems in Iowa's Loess Hills. The Loess Hills in Iowa make up the only geologic formation of its kind anywhere in the world outside the nation of China. These are a national treasure. There is some money in here to address some of the serious erosion problems in this very unique geologic formation. 
   There is money in here for research into industrial lubricants made from soybeans and other commodities, for farm safety education, and for dairy research and education. 
   I see my friend from Minnesota is here. I just joined him in Minnesota yesterday. We traveled around the State. I was reading an article--I think it happened in Minnesota, but if it didn't happen in Minnesota, it happened in Iowa--where a little 3-year-old boy got one arm and his other hand caught in a farm auger. I was reading the tragic story of how the doctors tried to reattach his arm and were unsuccessful in doing so. So this young 3-year-old boy has lost his right arm and, I believe, his left hand because of an accident on a farm. 
   Do we need funds for better research and education so that farmers and their families can be more safe in their occupations? You bet we do. And that is very worthwhile funding. 
   This bill also includes major increases in funding for food safety activities at USDA and FDA. This has been a priority of mine for a number of years. For USDA, food safety funding will increase by $28.3 million; and for FDA, the funding will increase by $30 million. That means that for USDA and FDA we are fully funding the President's food safety initiative. That is good, but there is a lot more we have to do in the way of food safety. 
   Last month, we had a hearing in the Agriculture Committee on food safety. Chairman LUGAR and I worked together to help set it up. In that hearing we gathered some very telling information about the resources that we are putting into food safety. The General Accounting Office testified that in fiscal year 1999, about $1 billion was spent on USDA and FDA food safety activities combined. Of that amount, USDA received $712 million to inspect some 6,000 meat, poultry, and egg establishments. 
   FDA, however, received only $260 million with which it had to inspect over 57,000 food establishments and 9,000 animal drug and feed establishments. So USDA gets $712 million. They have 6,000 establishments to inspect. FDA got only $260 million. They had to inspect over 66,000 establishments. 
   Here is the twist. About 85 percent of the instances of foodborne illness are linked to foods that fall under FDA's jurisdiction, and only 15 percent of them fall under USDA's jurisdiction. So clearly, we have our work cut out for us in the area of food safety. 
   We need more resources for the Food and Drug Administration. But, in reality, we really need a more unified and coordinated structure for federal food safety. Next year, this Congress should work to that end. I know my colleague, Senator DURBIN from Illinois, has a bill on that. Obviously, all the bills will die at the end of this session of this Congress, but we need to join forces in a bipartisan fashion next year. I believe there will be broad support among food producers and consumers to have a unified coordinated structure for food safety here at the Federal level. 
   I was also pleased to be able to work with Congressman WALSH of New York to include in this conference report important hunger relief measures. The provisions in this bill will significantly help in making sure Americans who have high rent and utility costs, or who just happen to have a modest, reliable automobile, can still receive food stamp benefits they need to feed their families. The vehicle provision is especially important in rural areas where people need to have a decent car to get to town or to get to work. They should not be disqualified from food stamps just because they own a modest, dependable vehicle. 
   I am also pleased that there were significant increases in rural housing, sewer, and water assistance, and economic development support important for rural America. I am, however, concerned about an increase in the fee for rural housing. For the rural housing loan assistance program, the fee was increased from 1 percent to 2 percent. That was included in the final measure. I believe this hurts the ability of modest-income families to become homeowners in rural areas. I will be working to reverse that. 
   This legislation also includes a substantial amount of additional emergency spending to respond to the needs arising from various types of economic and natural disaster losses. Overall, there is approximately $3.6 billion in emergency assistance, including compensation for crop production and crop quality losses, livestock and dairy assistance, and funding for the important emergency conservation and emergency watershed programs. This emergency assistance will be very important to farmers who have suffered from drought and severe weather in Iowa and many other States. 
   Over the past several years, Congress has provided a good deal of emergency assistance to farmers. In the past 3 years, the emergency assistance has amounted to over $22 billion. As I said, in this bill there is an additional $3.6 billion. For the most part, that assistance was clearly needed--in fact, critically needed. It helped keep many farm families on the land who otherwise would have been forced out of business. Keep in mind, these emergency payments were on top of the spending under provisions of the existing farm bill. 
   For fiscal year 2000, USDA made some $28 billion in direct payments of one kind or another to U.S. farmers. That is a record. And the overall cost of farm programs was $32.3 billion, another record. Looking at it another way, in calendar year 2000, U.S. farmers will receive $23.3 billion in direct payments from the Federal Government, but they will have a net farm income of only $45.6 billion. Over 50 percent--over half--of U.S. net farm income this year will come from direct Government payments. In fact, last year in Iowa, USDA payments exceeded our net farm income. 
   I can't help but ask, whatever happened to the promises made by the backers of the so-called Freedom to Farm bill? They were going to ``get the Government out of agriculture and let the free market work.'' What do we have? Commodity prices have crashed. Farm program spending by the Government is at record levels, and farmers are still being driven off the land by the thousands. Get the Government out? Farmers today are every bit, if not more, reliant on the Government than they have ever been before. Freedom to Farm did not get the Government out of agriculture, but it sure has been successful in getting family farmers out of agriculture. 
   Today our farmers plant for the Government program. They market for the Government program. They rely on the Government program for over half their net farm income. Already, Freedom to Farm has cost $29 billion more than its backers promised when it was passed in 1996. The emergency assistance we have passed went to help a lot of farmers. But it is a serious indictment of the current Freedom to Farm bill that Congress has had to provide 
   emergency farm income assistance 4 years in a row. And the way things are going, we are going to have to add more in this fiscal year beyond what is in this bill. 
   We cannot any longer tolerate a farm policy that lurches from one emergency spending measure to the next. It is time for Congress to recognize that Freedom to Farm has become ``freedom to fail.'' It has failed. We need to write a new farm bill, one that maintains the planning flexibility and the environmental programs we all support--but that restores the income protection, the farm safety net, the countercyclical programs that farmers need. 
   I listened to the debate last night. What I heard was Vice President GORE say we need to change our farm program, we need a better safety net, we need better conservation programs that are voluntary, that we can put  more money into conservation, but to provide a better income protection and a countercyclical program for farmers. To the best of my knowledge and information, Governor Bush has said he wants to stick with Freedom to Farm. 
   I think those who live in rural America and on our farms should know that, should know the data, the facts I have just laid out. Farm program spending is at an all-time high, yet thousands of farmer are still going out of business. We need a new direction and a new farm bill. We need it soon. 
   Here is another aspect of the failure of the Freedom to Farm bill. Because farmers are so heavily reliant on direct payments, Congress has stepped in this year and last year to raise the payment limitation for loan deficiency payments, what are known as LDPs, and marketing loan gains. We have raised the payment limitation for loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains to $150,000 instead of $75,000 which was in the farm bill. It was done last year, and it is done again this year in this bill. 
   But there is a wrinkle that deserves more attention. If an individual sets up partnerships or corporations, that individual can actually double the effective payment limitation. That means that, in reality, the payment limitation for the largest farms is now $300,000 for an individual. 
   I have to ask: How can we justify paying out such large amounts of money to the largest farms while family farms are struggling to survive and going out of business? We are told that this payment limitation relief was absolutely necessary, even to help family-size farms. But in reality, only a very small share of farms actually receive any benefit from this increase in the payment limit. 
   The Environmental Working Group analyzed the USDA data and determined that fewer than five-tenths of 1 percent of farms and farm businesses that are receiving USDA payments actually benefited from the payment limitation increase Congress approved in 1999. These 3,400 individuals and farm businesses received an average of $148,000 under this program last year, 14 times higher than the $7,200 received by the average farmer. 
   We have similar numbers from the Office of the Chief Economist at USDA. Based on data collected in the 1997 census of agriculture, they found that the number of farmers who might benefit for that year with the change included in this conference report is about 13,000, which is perhaps about 1.5 percent of the total participants in the Federal commodity programs. 
   So again, this doubling of farm payment limitations went to help just a very small percentage of farms of the largest size. It seems to me, if we are going to provide these amounts of money, we should put it in to help the family size farms that are struggling, the kind of farms Senator WELLSTONE and I visited yesterday in southern Minnesota. These are not huge farms, these are family farms, yet they are the ones being squeezed. The big ones that are perhaps farming thousands of acres of land are getting huge payments of up to $300,000. That doesn't make sense. These large farms can protect themselves, take care of themselves. If we are going to put the money in for farmers, let's help the struggling family farms first. 
   I also want to talk about the Cuba provisions. I believe what is in this conference report on Cuba was really a step backward. There is a superficial sham opening of the embargo on agricultural shipments to Cuba from the United States, but the restrictions are so great that I do not believe it will amount to anything. Keep in mind that no direct financing can be provided by any U.S. financial institution to anyone who wants to sell products to Cuba. Well, financing is a critical part of agricultural exports. Anyone knows that. Yet no direct financing can be provided. You have to go to some third country to get it. Also, the bill locks into statute the travel restrictions that have been in place regarding Cuba, which are administrative. This locks them into law. It will make it just that much harder to bring down the barriers to change in Cuba. 
   We have had a failed policy on Cuba for 40 years now--a failed policy. This bill keeps us on the same path. Actually, what we are doing in this bill is the best thing we could ever do to keep Fidel Castro in power. If you want to change things in Cuba, open it up and let people travel there. Open it up for exports. Let our farmers travel there and sell our goods and products in Cuba without the restrictions this bill writes into law. That would be the single best thing we could do. But, no, we are doing the same thing we have done for 40 years. Someone once described insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We keep doing the same thing year after year after year with Cuba, and we expect some different results. It is time we change our Cuba policy. 
   Lastly, I want to talk about the issue of drug reimportation. There was a provision in this bill that would have allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to reimport prescription drugs. 
   The cost of prescription drugs is a critical issue. I have had meetings with seniors across Iowa to talk about the rising prices of medicines and their prescription drugs. First of all, I must add that the most urgent and important thing I believe we can do here is to enact a meaningful Medicare drug benefit for all seniors. We have it pending, but the Republican leadership will not bring it up and let us vote on it. I think it is a disgrace that we have not acted on this issue before leaving this year. 
   The drug reimportation amendment, offered by Senators DORGAN and JEFFORDS, which would allow pharmacies and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, was well intentioned and began as a creative way to try to get lower cost drugs to seniors with important safety precautions. If done correctly, this proposal would have been a real help to seniors, many of whom already travel to Canada and Mexico to buy medications at a fraction of their U.S. price. But not every senior in Iowa or in other States is able to travel to Canada or to Mexico to get those drugs. 
   Unfortunately, the provision in the bill now is the product of a closed-door discussion. We were kept out. At the last minute, we got some paper handed to us and we voted on it. I believe the authors have rendered it unworkable with language that will prevent any importation of affordable FDA-approved drugs. 
   In spite of months of bipartisan work to craft this language, the Republican leadership decided abruptly to take a partisan approach that is riddled with loopholes to minimize the impact of the new system. In fact, I think it may be completely unworkable.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I have done repeatedly every day we have been here for the past few weeks, I want to talk about the stalled nomination of Bonnie Campbell for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   I understand the Judiciary Committee of the Senate has again scheduled an executive meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m.--I guess to talk about subpoenas for the Department of Energy, and something else. 
   I had my staff do an inquiry, and I found out that Bonnie Campbell's name is not on the agenda. 
   We are in session. We are in session tomorrow. We are going to be in Friday. We are going to be here next week, yet the Judiciary Committee again refuses to allow Bonnie Campbell's name to come out for a vote. It is bottled up. 
   All we want is a vote. 
   Bonnie Campbell has strong bipartisan support. Both Senators from Iowa support her. Senator GRASSLEY, a Republican; I, a Democrat. 
   She has great support from law enforcement and service groups. We just had a big debate and an overwhelming vote last week to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Senator after senator got up to speak about how great it was. It has been a good law. It has done a lot of good. The one person who has been primarily responsible for the implementation of that act since its inception has been the head of the Office of Violence Against Women in the Justice Department. Who has that been? Bonnie Campbell. She has done a great job. She is the former attorney general of the State of Iowa, now standing in glory in her own right. Yet her nomination is bottled up in the Judiciary Committee. 
   I ask again: Why is she being bottled up? 
   Look. In 1992, when we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, we had 14 nominations for circuit court judges in 1992 during an election year. Nine of them had hearings. Nine of them were referred, and nine were confirmed, including one in October right before the election. Yet we are told no; Bonnie Campbell's nomination came too late. It is too late when we have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate. But it wasn't too late when we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate. 
   Nine hearings; nine referred; nine confirmed in 1992. Here we are in the year 2000: Seven nominated; two had hearings; one referred; and one confirmed. 
   Who is the one who had the hearing that has not been referred? Bonnie Campbell. What a disgrace. What a shame. What a slap in the face to an outstanding individual who has done well in the field of law. I haven't heard anyone--Republican or Democrat--say that she hasn't performed superbly in running the Office of Violence Against Women. Her performance is reflected in the House's 415 to 3 vote to reauthorize the act and the Senate's 95 to 0 vote on that legislation. 
   I will, as I do every day, ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee on further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, the nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court, that her nomination be considered by the Senate immediately following the conclusion of action on the pending matter, that the debate on the nomination be limited to 2 hours equally divided, and that a vote on her nomination occur immediately following the use or yielding back of that time.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I knew it would be objected to. But I am going to do it every day to make the point that her name is unfairly being bottled up in the Judiciary Committee. No one has said she is unqualified, or anything such as that. 
   I can only assume it's that the Republicans figure maybe their nominee will win the Presidency, and all of these will fall by the wayside, and, rather than Bonnie Campbell, we will have somebody else. Maybe that is the way they feel. But that is not the way to run this place. 
   Once you go far down that road, it may be pretty hard to turn back. Times change. There will be a time when there will be a Republican in the White House and the Senate will be Democratic. Do we want to repeat the same thing this year? Do we want to go down that road? Is that what this place has become? If you start it on that side, that is what is going to happen, because when the Democrats take charge, they'll look back at what happened in the year 2000. We shouldn't go down that road.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few more points on the hunger relief provisions. 
   The centerpiece of this package would allow states to reform their treatment of cars and trucks when determining whether a household meets the food stamp resource eligibility limits. Rural families need to look for and travel to employment, to get groceries, and for a host of other purposes. Rural roads and seasonal driving hazards make a dependable vehicle a real necessity. Particularly in an era of welfare reform, we should not be forcing households to choose between reliable transportation and needed food assistance, as current rules effectively do. 
   States have recognized this, and a great many of them have greatly reformed their treatment of cars in their TANF-funded programs. This is particularly true of the first car that a household has. Under this provision, states would be free to apply a more realistic TANF policy to a household's primary vehicle even if its policy is to exclude that vehicle completely from evaluations of the family's resources. If the household had an additional car or truck and its TANF policy was stricter than food stamp rules for second vehicles, that additional car or truck should then be evaluated under the usual food stamp procedures. 
   This change in the law gives a state the broadest flexibility to adopt a policy that effects vehicles from any assistance program it operates under the TANF statute. The Secretary has appropriately interpreted similar language already contained within the Food Stamp Act as applying to any program that receives support either from federal TANF block grant funds or from the funds that the TANF statute requires states to spend as ``maintenance of effort'' in order to draw down the TANF block grant. A similar construction is appropriate here. All that would be required is that the program get TANF block grant or maintenance of effort funds that it provide a benefit that can meet the definition of assistance, not necessarily cash assistance. For example, a state could apply the policy it uses in a child care program because HHS's regulations define child care as assistance when provided to non-working families. 
   Once a state decided to apply the policies from a state program to evaluating cars for food stamp purposes, those policies would apply to all food stamp households in the state, whether or not they receive or even are eligible to receive TANF benefits of any kind. 
   The other Hunger Relief Act provision would raise the cap on the food stamp excess shelter cost this March and then adjust it for inflation beginning October 1, 2001. The shelter deduction reflects the commons sense principle that the same money cannot be spent on both housing costs and food. It provides that when a household is spending more than half of its income on food or mortgage, utilities, and similar costs, the amount of those costs that exceed half of its income will be deducted when calculating how much the household can be expected to be able to spend on food. The shelter deduction is also important in rural America, in part because fewer people in rural communities receive housing subsidies and in part because housing costs can easily exceed half of the relatively modest wages that some low-income families receive in rural areas. 
   Unfortunately, the shelter deduction is arbitrarily capped at $300 for households that do not contain an elderly or disabled member. This means that low-income families that are not getting housing subsidies and that are struggling under the burden of extremely high shelter costs are getting unrealistically low food stamp allotments.  This provision should help, in particular by making sure that the cap does not lose ground to inflation. I hope that in reauthorization, we can revisit this issue and fully provide fair and equitable treatment to these hard-pressed households the vast majority of which have children.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I stand here today to pay tribute to a good friend, Mel Carnahan, Governor of Missouri, and express my sorrow at the loss of his son Randy and his longtime aide, Chris Sifford. 
   I had known Mel for a long time. I have followed his career with pride and admiration as his neighbor to the North. Mel's service to the State of Missouri spans four decades and even more elected offices. He started out as a municipal judge in his hometown of Rolla at the age of 26. He served in the Missouri State Legislature. He was State treasurer and Lieutenant Governor, and in 1992 became the 51st Governor of Missouri. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I had the privilege of campaigning with Mel this past year. As I watched Mel Carnahan on the trail and watched him talk with the people of Missouri and listen to their concerns and their hopes to gain their confidence and trust, I was reminded of something Adlai Stevenson once said:  
   Every age needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of things that are to be.  
   Mel Carnahan was one of those men, and as Governor of Missouri, he had a vision for his State and for our country. We saw it in his work on education. We saw it in his work on Missouri's economy. He created thousands of jobs and moved some 100,000 people from welfare to work. We saw it in his work on crime and children's health insurance and so many other issues, how he stood up to the gun industry and stood strong for those who have the deck stacked against them. 
   He had a vision for this Nation which he took into his Senate race. He believed, as Hubert Humphrey stated, that the measure of government is in how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children, those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly, and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick and the needy. That is why he wanted to come to Washington. This was his vision. 
   Its very urgency makes it harder to accept the fact that he was taken from us before he could help make it a reality. His death is a loss for all of us in Congress who would have had the honor of working with him. It is a loss for the people of Missouri who would have had the privilege of being represented by him. It is a loss for the people of this Nation who would have had the good fortune of being served by him. 
   We cannot let our sorrow overwhelm us. We cannot let our sadness become bitterness, despair, or regret. That would not be a fitting tribute to Mel Carnahan. Rather, we owe it to him, to his country, and to his family to take up the torch of his life's work and to carry it on. We owe it to ourselves to let his memory be our solace, his record our guide, and his legacy our inspiration, to let the life of this good and decent man continue to light our way. That is the best and enduring memorial for our friend Mel Carnahan. 
   Earlier this year, I was flying in that very plane with Mel and his son Randy at the controls. Being a pilot myself, we talked a lot about flying. It was a night flight. We talked about the aircraft. I talked to Randy about the different instrumentation he had on his aircraft. Randy was a very qualified pilot. He knew what he was doing. Mel was, too. Mel had been taking flying lessons and had hoped to complete them at some time but had to interrupt them for his campaign. 
   For me, it makes the loss even so much more poignant and tragic since just a couple of months ago I was on that very plane with them. We do not know exactly what happened. Right now what went wrong is really of no consequence. What is of consequence is that we have lost three good lives in that tragic accident in Missouri. 
   My heart and my prayers are with Jean, his very lovely and very dedicated wife, their children Russ, Robin, and Tom, and with the family and friends of Chris Sifford who also lost his life in that tragic accident.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Women's Health Research Career Enhancement Act of 2000. This legislation addresses a critical shortage of qualified clinician researchers available to investigate the diseases and conditions that primarily affect women. 
   As the brother of two sisters lost to breast cancer and the father of two daughters, I know first-hand the importance of making women's health initiatives a top priority. More can and must be done to guarantee that women have the quality care they deserve. This includes making sure that qualified researchers are out there leading the search for cures and treatments. 
   In 1985, the United States Public Health Task Force on Women's Health Issues concluded that women's health care was getting short shrift by the lack of research focus on women's health concerns. Since then we have made good progress to expand women's health research, but more needs to be done. 
   In 1990, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) found that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been slow and ineffective in implementing a policy to include women in research study populations. At the urging of myself and others, and in response to passage of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, the NIH began to take more comprehensive measures to increase research on health problems affecting women.  
   And more recently, at my request, along with Senators OLYMPIA SNOWE and BARBARA MIKULSKI, and Representative HARRY WAXMAN (D-CA), the GAO published a report last May assessing the NIH's progress on conducting research on women's health in the past decade. The GAO's report found that while NIH has made significant progress in implementing a strengthened policy on including women in clinical research, they have failed to fully analyze clinical data on women's health. 
   It is clear we can and must do more to advance a comprehensive women's health agenda. 
   A growing body of evidence is emerging that demonstrates significant differences between men and women and how they get sick and how they react to potential treatments. Women and men metabolize food, alcohol, medication and environmental toxins differently. 
   And certain diseases and conditions disproportionately affect women. For example, women comprise 80% of those suffering from osteoporosis. Seventy-five percent of those afflicted with autoimmune diseases are women. And although we have made significant progress, we are still fighting the terrible epidemic of breast cancer in this country, a disease that strikes 1 out of every 8 American women. 
   Women everywhere will benefit through more and better scientific research on the diseases and conditions that affect them. And our scientific enterprise will reap maximum returns when it involves teams of investigators with expertise in various disciplines. A comprehensive, targeted approach is necessary to develop a multi-disciplinary cadre of researchers with the interest and expertise to broaden the field of women's health research. 
   In addition, mentoring between junior and senior scientists is important to promoting an inclusive and diverse research environment. Mentoring relationships can lead to the retention and advancement of talented scientists from all segments of the population and enhance our investment in medical research. 
   Mr. President, my legislation authorizes two important initiatives to expand the number of qualified investigators in women's health research by providing improved career development opportunities through the National Institutes of Health (NIH): 
   First, the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health Program--will support the career development of junior women's health scientists by providing new opportunities to improve their research skills in interdisciplinary settings. The NIH, through the Office of Research on Women's Health, will provide grants to research institutions to pair junior investigators with seasoned senior investigators, who will mentor them for 2-5 years. 
   Second, the Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers--will help build the next generation of investigators in obstetrics and gynecology by giving clinicians the experience they need to become women's health scientists. The NIH, through the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Research on Women's Health, will provide grants to research institutions and hospitals for the training of new women's health researchers. 
   The Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers program and the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health grant program have already stimulated women's health research across a variety of disciplines. Authorizing and expanding these programs will speed breakthroughs in women's health research by building and improving the network of scientific investigators expert in the diseases and conditions that affect women. 
   Mr. President, I have a long tradition of supporting research and specifically women's health research both as Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. This year we will provide an unprecedented, $2.7 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, keeping us well on track towards our goal of doubling the NIH budget over 5 years.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Technology for All Americans Act. This Act will maximize our country's potential by helping to close the Digital Divide for people with disabilities. In doing so, it will increase their independence and self-sufficiency and further strengthen our economy and society by enabling the greatest possible number of us to contribute our abilities. 
   As we celebrate the Americans with Disabilities Act's 10th Anniversary, we are entering a new millennium; one that will be defined by technology. But technology can be a double-edged sword for people with disabilities, who continue to fight for the freedom to live independently. 
   If the Internet and other technologies are accessible, they will offer people with disabilities unprecedented opportunities for independence and self-sufficiency. But if they are not accessible, they simply will create new barriers to full participation of people with disabilities in our society and our economy. 
   Although new technologies have improved the lives of many Americans with disabilities, there remains a significant ``Digital Divide'' between Americans with and without disabilities. Although people with disabilities are nearly twice as likely as people without disabilities to say that the Internet has improved their lives significantly, they are barely one-quarter as likely to use the Internet and less than half as likely to have access to a computer at home. 
   The Technology for All Americans Act will begin to bridge this gap. The Act provides incentives for public and private researchers to use universal design and accessibility principles in new technologies, and to develop technologies to eliminate functional barriers to full independence for people with disabilities. It will increase public access to technology by providing grants to States to make public libraries, including those in elementary and secondary schools, technology accessible. It will increase the development and use of accessible technology by providing grants to colleges and universities to establish model curricula incorporating the design and use of accessible technology into academic and professional programs. And it will help children with disabilities maximize their potential in school and after graduation by ensuring their access to technology. In a nutshell, this Act will help ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to participate in society. 
   But, this act is not just for people with disabilities. It is, as it's name says, for all Americans. When people with disabilities succeed in school, join the workforce, and participate in day-to-day life, we all benefit from their abilities. 
   History also demonstrates that research on accessible technology benefits everyone. How many people know that the typewriter was invented for an Italian countess who was blind? In 1990, the Television Decoder Circuitry Act, which I introduced, required closed captioning for most television sets so that people who are deaf could watch TV. But today millions of people who are not deaf use closed captioning at home, at work, at gyms, and at sports bars, to name a few. And, millions of people use voice-activated technology at work or in car phones and cell phones. That technology also was intended primarily for people with disabilities. 
   This trend will accelerate as the Technology Revolution moves forward. The technologies that make things accessible for people with disabilities have applications for all of us. 
   More and more each day, every American's ability to participate in society is determined by how well they are able to use technology. This Act will help us take the greatest advantage of technology for the benefit of the greatest number of Americans. This must be one of our priorities as we move into the new millennium. 
   So I ask my colleagues, people with disabilities, educators, technology experts, and others who are interested to share their ideas with me about this bill and about the issue of making technology accessible to every American, so that next Congress we can ensure that every American has access to the tools that will shape our future.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this conference report contains a number of provisions of great importance to our troops and our veterans. First, I am very glad that one of the top priorities of this conference report is improving the military health care system. The expansion of TRICARE, the military health care system, to Medicare-eligible retirees provides a permanent comprehensive health care benefit to military retirees, regardless of age. All military retirees and their families will now be able to remain in the TRICARE health program for life. 
   At least as important, military retirees will now have complete prescription drug coverage. With this new benefit, there is an even stronger case for Congress passing a Medicare prescription drug plan for all seniors this year before we go home. 
   I am also pleased that this bill provides our troops a significant pay raise as well as supplementary benefits for troops on food stamps and increased WIC nutritional support for troops overseas. These are issues on which I have worked for several years on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   I am especially pleased that we have overcome significant opposition among the House majority to provide compensation to some of those who were harmed by dangerous conditions at our nuclear weapons plants. I am sure that by now all my colleagues are aware that many of our citizens were exposed to radioactive and other hazardous materials at nuclear weapons production plants in the United States. While working to protect our national security, thousands of workers were subjected to severe hazards, sometimes without their knowledge or consent. 
   I would like to address in more detail another provision that is important for former workers at our nuclear weapons facilities. The dangers at these plants thrived in the darkness of Government secrecy. Public oversight was especially weak at a factory for assembling and disassembling nuclear weapons at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant in Middletown, IA. I first found out about the nuclear weapons work there from a constituent letter from a former worker, Robert Anderson. He was concerned that his non-Hodgkins lymphoma was caused by exposures at the plant. But when I asked the Department of Energy about the plant, at first they denied that any nuclear weapons work took place there. The constituent's story was only confirmed when my staff saw a promotional video from the contractor at the site that mentioned the nuclear weapons work. 
   The nuclear weapons production plants were run not by the Defense Department but by the Atomic Energy Commission, which has since been made part of the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy has since acknowledged what happened, and is now actively trying to help the current and former workers in Iowa and elsewhere by reviewing records, helping them get medical testing and care, and seeking compensation. 
   I compliment Secretary Richardson for his foresight and for taking this matter very seriously and making sure that the Department of Energy is forthcoming in regard to getting testing and care and compensation. 
   I was pleased this past January to host Energy Secretary Richardson at a meeting with former workers and community members near the plant in Iowa. The Department specifically acknowledges that the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant assembled and disassembled nuclear weapons from 1947-1975. And their work has helped uncover potential health concerns at the plant, such as explosions around depleted uranium that created clouds of radioactive dust, and workers' exposure to high explosives that literally turned their skin yellow. 
   And while the Department of Energy is investigating what happened and seeking solutions, the Army is stuck, still mired in a nonsensical policy. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to ``neither confirm nor deny'' the presence of nuclear weapons were assembled in Iowa without admitting that there were nuclear weapons in Iowa. So they write vaguely about ``AEC activities,'' but don't say what those activities were.  
   There have been no nuclear weapons at the Iowa site since 1975, but it is well known that weapons were there before that. The DOE says the weapons were there. A promotional video of the Army contractor at the site even says the weapons were there. But the Army can't say it. 
   What this does is, it send the wrong signal to the former workers. These workers swore oaths never to reveal what they did at the plant. And many of them are still reluctant to talk. They are worried that their cancers or other health problems may be caused by their work at the plant. But they feel that they can't even tell their doctors or site cleanup crews they worked there or what the tasks were they did. They don't want to violate the oaths of secrecy they took. One worker at the Iowa plant said recently: There's still stuff buried out there that we don't know where it is. And we know people who do know, but they will not say anything yet because they are still afraid of repercussions. Instead of helping these workers speak out, the Army has forced them to keep their silence. 
   I am pleased that the conference report includes a provision I offered to help these workers. It is narrowly targeted to require the Defense Department, in consultation with the Energy Department, to review their classification and security policies to ensure they do not prevent or discourage workers at nuclear weapons facilities from discussing possible exposures with their health care providers and other appropriate officials. The provision specifically recognizes that this must be done within national security constraints. It also directs the Department to contact people who may have been exposed to radioactive or hazardous substances at former Defense Department nuclear weapons facilities, including the Iowa plant. The Department is to notify them of any exposures and of how they can discuss the exposures with their health care providers and other appropriate officials without violating security or classification procedures. 
   I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the conference committee for joining with me in a colloquy to clarify that this provision applies to all workers at such facilities, and not just DOD personnel. 
   I am pleased we are passing this provision today. I thank the managers of the bill for including this provision and for the fine work they have done on all aspects of this bill. 
   Lastly, I am very concerned about the recent upsurge of violence in the Middle East. I strongly support the efforts of President Clinton and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to negotiate a cease-fire. This cycle of killings and destruction must end so there can be a return to the negotiating table to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement in the Middle East. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. If I might reciprocate, I thank the chairman and Senator LEVIN, the ranking member, for including this in the bill. These were hard workers. They were good people. They work for a contract employer, not the Department of Defense. With this change, it makes it clear they are covered also. I thank them both.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member to engage in a brief colloquy on section 1078 of the Department of Defense Authorization Conference Report regarding secrecy and worker health. This originally passed the Senate as an amendment I sponsored that was agreed to by all parties. The amendment referred to workers at former nuclear weapons facilities. The provision in the conference report was rewritten, and now defines these workers to be ``employees and former employees of the Department of Defense'' at defense nuclear weapons facilities. However, at least one such facility, the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, is owned by the Defense Department but operated by a contractor. Thus virtually all employees at the facility were and are employees of the contractor and not directly of the Department of Defense. Is it the understanding of my colleagues that this provision is intended to refer to all employees at such facilities, including those employed directly by the Department of Defense and indirectly through contractors?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Taxpayer Protection and Contractor Integrity Act. This legislation, which was introduced concurrently by Rep. PETER DEFAZIO in the House, is intended to crack down on fraud and abuse in government contracts. It would say to federal government contractors that have been convicted or had civil judgement rendered against them at least three times for procurement fraud and related offenses: you do not deserve further taxpayer support; you are suspended from new contracts for three years. Three strikes and you're out. 
   A recent report by the General Accounting Office on procurement fraud by the 100 largest Department of Defense contractors during the years 1995-1999 found: 8 criminal cases in which contractors pled guilty and paid fines totaling $66 million, and 95 civil cases, including 94 settlements and one judgment, in which awards totaled $368 million. The offenses included overcharging, kickbacks, defective products, procurement fraud, misuse/diversion of government furnished materials, cost/labor mischarging, and others. A number of companies, including some of the largest DOD contractors, had several criminal convictions or civil judgments for similar offenses over a few years. This clearly demonstrates a pattern of misconduct. 
   But the Department of Defense continued to conduct business with contractors even after these companies had committed multiple frauds against the government. Not one of the top military contractors guilty of procurement fraud was barred from future contracts. According to a recent Associated Press analysis, there are 1,020 contractors government-wide that were sued or prosecuted for fraud in the past five years. Of these, 737 remain eligible for future contracts. 
   It is disgraceful that the Pentagon and other agencies seem to hear and see no evil in the criminal fraud committed by contractors. Now it's up to Congress to step in and start cracking down on big contractors who have been swindling the federal government out of billions of dollars. I am hopeful that the bill we're introducing today will force all contractors to play by the rules and stop ripping off American taxpayers. 
   Under current law, a contracting officer is required to make a determination regarding the integrity and responsibility of a potential contractor prior to awarding a new contract. In making this determination, prior convictions can be taken into account, but even with several convictions an individual or company may still be granted a contract award. 
   The bill I introduced would require contractors to disclose the number of convictions or civil judgments, the nature of the offense, and whether any fines, penalties, or damages were assessed. Any contractor who has three or more convictions or civil judgements for fraud and similar offenses related to government contracts would be prohibited from receiving future contracts. Existing contracts would not be impacted. The prohibition on future contracts would last three years. If, during that period, the contractor demonstrates a satisfactory record of ethics and integrity by avoiding additional criminal convictions, the contractor may become eligible for future federal contracts. The bill also allows a waiver by the President in the interest of national security or to prevent serious injury to the government. Note that the bill does not prevent debarment under current procedures for fewer than three violations or broader consideration of ethics under the proposed OMB regulations. But recognizing that some agencies will not use these discretionary procedures, the bill sets a firm limit. 
   The bill was crafted much like the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which made life in prison mandatory for criminals convicted of their third federal felony. That's why we sometimes call this the ``Three strikes and you're out'' bill. This bill, however, is much softer, as the suspension can be lifted after three years. We've made a commitment in this country to be tough on crime. That resolve should apply to federal contractors too. It is time to stop rewarding criminal contractors with American taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Vermont for yielding me this time to voice my support for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. It is an important act that should be passed forthwith. 
   I was a proud cosponsor of this bill when it passed in 1994, and I am an original cosponsor of the reauthorization bill. This is a law that has helped hundreds of thousands of women and children in my State of Iowa and across the Nation. Iowa has received more than $8 million through grants of VAWA. These grants fund the domestic violence hotline and keep the doors open at domestic violence shelters, such as the Family Violence Center in Des Moines. 
   VAWA grants to Iowa have provided services to more than 2,000 sexual assault victims just this year, and more than 20,559 Iowa students this year have received information about rape prevention through this Federal funding. 
   The numbers show that VAWA is working. A recent Justice report found that intimate partner violence against women decreased by 21 percent from 1993 to 1998. This is strong evidence that State and community efforts are indeed working. But this fight is far from over. The reauthorization of this important legislation will allow these efforts to continue without having to worry that this funding will be lost from year to year. I commend the Democratic and Republican leadership for working to get this bill done before we adjourn. 
   I believe my friends on the Republican side of the aisle are suffering from a split personality. They are willing to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, but they are not willing to put a judge on the Federal bench who knows more about this law, has done more to implement this law than any other person in this country, and that is Bonnie J. Campbell, who right now heads the Office of Violence Against Women that was set up by this law in 1994. In fact, Bonnie Campbell has been the head of this office since its inception, and the figures bear out the fact that this office is working, and it is working well. 
   Bonnie Campbell's name was submitted to the Senate in March. She had her hearing in May. All the paperwork is done. Yet she is bottled up in the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   Yesterday, the Senator from Alabama appeared on the CNN news show ``Burden of Proof'' to discuss the status of judicial nominations. I want to address some of the statements he made on that show. 
   Senator SESSIONS said Bonnie Campbell has no courtroom experience. The truth: Bonnie Campbell's qualifications are exemplary. The American Bar Association has given her their stamp of approval. She has had a long history in law starting in 1984 with her private practice in Des Moines where she  worked on cases involving medical malpractice, employment discrimination, personal injury, real estate, and family law. 
   She was then elected attorney general of Iowa, the first woman to ever hold that office. In that position, she gained high marks from all ends of the political spectrum as someone who was strongly committed to enforcing the law to reducing crime and protecting consumers. 
   As I said, in 1995, she led the implementation of the Violence Against Women Act as head of that office under the Justice Department. Her strong performance in this role is reflected in last month's House vote to reauthorize VAWA--415-3. 
   Senator SESSIONS from Alabama says she has no courtroom experience. I will mention a few of the judicial nominees who have been confirmed who were criticized for having little or no courtroom experience. 
   Randall Rader--my friend from Utah might recognize that name--was appointed to the U.S. Claims Court in 1988 and then to the Federal circuit in 1990. Before 1988, Mr. Rader had never practiced law, had only been out of law school for 11 years, and his only post-law-school employment had been with Congress as counsel to Senator HATCH from Utah. Yet today, he sits on a Federal bench. But Senator SESSIONS from Alabama says Bonnie Campbell has no courtroom experience; that is why she does not deserve to be on the Federal court. 
   Pasco Bowman serves on the Eighth Circuit. He was confirmed in 1983. Before his nomination--

   Mr. HARKIN. I just point out, J. Harvie Wilkinson is another judge in the Fourth Circuit. Again, he never had any courtroom experience either. 
   I am just pointing out, the Senator from Alabama yesterday, on the same TV show, said Bonnie Campbell was nominated too late. Nonsense. Gobbledy-gook. 
   Bonnie Campbell was nominated on March 2 of this year. The four judicial nominees who were confirmed just last week were nominated after Bonnie Campbell. Why didn't Senator SESSIONS from Alabama stop them from going out of committee? They were nominated after Bonnie Campbell. Three of them were nominated, received their hearings, and were reported out of the committee during the same week in July. Bonnie Campbell had her hearing in May, and she has since been bottled up in committee. 
   I keep pointing out, in 1992 President Bush nominated 14 circuit court judges. Nine had their hearing, nine were referred, and nine were confirmed--all in 1992. I guess it was not too late when the Republicans had the Presidency, but it is too late if there is a Democrat President. 
   Here is the year: 2000. Seven circuit court judges have been nominated; two have had their hearing, one has been referred, and one has been confirmed--one out of seven. 
   So who is playing politics around this place? 
   The Senator from Alabama said the Judiciary Committee is holding hearings, just as they did in the past. 
   In 1992, there were 15 judicial hearings; this year, there have been 8. 
   The Senator from Alabama also said some Republican Senators claim Bonnie Campbell is too liberal. 
   But Bonnie Campbell has bipartisan support. Senator GRASSLEY, law enforcement people, and victims services  groups also all support her. Is that the test?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it has now been 218 days--218 days that the Judiciary Committee of the Senate has had Bonnie J. Campbell's name there and not reported her out. She has had her hearings. Her paperwork is done. Yet she sits bottled up in the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   I understand that later today--or maybe early next week--there will be a unanimous consent request to bring up for consideration and pass the Violence Against Women Act. It is a very good bill, a good law, that has done a lot to help reduce domestic violence in our country. 
   But we have an interesting dichotomy here. There will be a line of Senators out here talking about how they are all for the Violence Against Women Act. It will go through here like greased lightning. But when it comes to the person who has been in charge of implementing the provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, the person who has been in charge of the Office of Violence Against Women since its beginning in 1995--because it was created by the Violence Against Women Act--when it comes to that person who is widely recognized all over America as the one person who has done more to implement that law than anybody else--when it comes to that person, they say, no, we are not going to let her be reported out of the Judiciary Committee. That is Bonnie Campbell. 
   It is all right to have the Violence Against Women Act but, no, it is not all right to have her sit on the court of appeals--the one person who knows this law intimately, the one person who has led the fight in this country against domestic violence and violence against women in general. 
   Bonnie Campbell has not been treated fairly by this Senate, by the Republican leadership, and by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   I have heard all the arguments--including the one that she she wasn't nominated until this year. Mr. President, she was nominated in early March. She had her hearing in May. Yet the other day we reported four judges out, all of whom were nominated later than Bonnie Campbell. Three were nominated in July, had their hearing, and were reported out all in the same week. Yet Bonnie Campbell sits there, 218 days today. 
   It is not as if the appeals courts are full. We have 22 vacancies on the appeals courts. And we need more women serving on the appeals court. Out of 148 circuit judges, 33 are women--22 percent. Yet the Republican leadership in this Senate and on the Senate Judiciary Committee will not let Bonnie Campbell's name come out for a vote.  
   If somebody on the other side wants to vote against her, for whatever reason, that is their right. It is their senatorial privilege and even their responsibility, if they feel deeply about it, to do so. But I don't believe it is anyone's responsibility, nor even a right, to hold that name bottled up in committee when she is fully qualified. I have not heard one Senator say Bonnie Campbell is not qualified for this position--not one. I have heard no objections raised at all. She is supported by both the Senators from Iowa--a Republican Senator, Mr. GRASSLEY, and by me, a Democrat. So there has been strong, bipartisan support. 
   Again, she is a former attorney general of the State of Iowa and now head of the Violence Against Women office. Yet they won't report her name out. 
   Yes, they will let the Violence Against Women Act come through, and we will hear wonderful speeches about it, I am sure, from the Republican side. The House of Representatives, last week, voted for the Violence Against Women Act, 415-3. Does anybody believe they would have voted that overwhelmingly if the only person who has run that office had done a bad job and had not enforced the law fairly and equitably and brought honor to the law and the position? Absolutely not. By that 415-3 vote, they were saying Bonnie Campbell has done an outstanding job.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I intend to make my point every day. And as you can see, an objection to bringing Bonnie Campbell's name out of the Judiciary Committee so we can have a debate and vote is made every time on the Republican side. That is who is holding this up. It is a darn shame that this is being done to a person who has led an exemplary life, done an outstanding job in public service both as attorney general of Iowa and now as head of the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice. It is not right, it is not fair. 
   So every day that we are here I will continue to ask unanimous consent to bring her name out. Before I yield the floor, once again, I will point out that in 1992, when there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, 9 circuit court judges had their hearings; there were 14 nominated in 1992, during an election year, and 9 had hearings. Of all those who had hearings, they were all referred and all confirmed--one as late as October of 1992, a couple in September, and a couple were in August. 
   When the shoe was on the other foot, when there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, we had the hearings. Everyone who had a hearing during the Bush Administration got a vote in Committee. All but one got a vote on the Senate floor. Well, Bonnie Campbell had her hearing. All the paperwork is done. Yet she has been referred. Every single one was confirmed in 1992. 
   Well, this is the year 2000 and we have had seven circuit court judges nominated this year. One has had a hearing and was referred and was confirmed. That is one out of seven. In 1992, it was 9 out of 14. Tell me who is playing politics around this place. Tell me who wants to play politics with the circuit courts. It is not our side. It is the other side. 
   In 1992, as I said, we had nine circuit judges nominated and confirmed. This year, there was only one. No. 1, it is a flimsy argument to say because she was nominated this year it is too late. No. 2, it is a phony argument that, well, it is a circuit court and maybe George Bush will win the election and, therefore, we will put Republicans on there instead of somebody such as Bonnie Campbell. 
   In 1992, as I pointed out, when the roles were reversed, we confirmed nine circuit court judges that year. We could have said the same thing: Bill Clinton may win, so don't confirm them. But we didn't do that. I believe the right course of action to follow is to report those out, let them have a debate. If people want to vote one way or the other, that is their right. 
   I will continue to take this floor every day until we adjourn sine die, or whatever we do here. I will begin to use every means at my disposal to get her name out of the Judiciary Committee and make sure she is treated fairly by this Senate and that at least we have a vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am following up on the Presidential debates of the other evening. I was thinking about what Governor Bush was saying about his Medicare plan. He was referring to Vice President GORE and saying: You are engaging in ``Mediscare''--``Mediscare.'' You are trying to scare the seniors. 
   The more I have looked at Governor Bush's Medicare proposal for prescription drugs, I have come to the conclusion that if his plan ever comes into effect, the senior citizens in this country ought to be scared. They ought to be scared about this. 
   Here is the difference between what Vice President GORE wants in terms of prescription drugs and what Governor Bush wants. In my right hand I have a Medicare card. Under the prescription drug policies of Vice President GORE, this is all you need to get your prescription drug. You have a Medicare card, you go to your doctor, he prescribes the drugs, you go to your local pharmacy, and you get your drugs filled. That is all you need--your Medicare card. 
   Under the Bush proposal, which goes out to the States, they have to pass legislation, and if you make over $14,600 a year, you get nothing. So in order to qualify for prescription drugs under the plan advocated by Governor Bush, you would basically have to meet all of the requirements for Medicaid in terms of showing your income, assets, everything else. 
   I want to put together the sheaf of papers you would have to fill out if you were an elderly person and you wanted to get prescription drugs under the Bush plan. This is what you would fill out. It looks like about 40 pages of paperwork. First of all is the tax return. You have to take that in and show them how much you made. Then you have to do all the documents, including instructions, applications, certificates, estate recovery--of course, if you have some estate and you have some assets. There is an insurance questionnaire. This is the type of paperwork you would be faced with under the Bush proposal. 
   Under the Gore proposal: One simple Medicare card. 
   I sum it up by saying what the seniors of this country want is Medicare; they don't want welfare. That is exactly what Governor Bush is proposing in his Medicare prescription drug proposal.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, an issue I will be talking about every day is the issue of judgeships and the fact that we still have our judges bottled up, especially Bonnie Campbell, who has now been waiting 217 days to be reported out of the committee. Yet we just had some judges approved this week who were nominated in July, had their hearing in July. They were approved. But Bonnie Campbell still sits in the Judiciary Committee. 
   It is not right, it is not fair to her, it is not fair for our judicial system. Bonnie Campbell has all of the qualifications to be a judge on the Eighth Circuit. A former attorney general of Iowa, she did an outstanding job there. Since 1995, she has been the first and only director of the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice which was created by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Again, she has done an outstanding job. 
   There has been some good news. During that period of time, domestic violence against women, in fact, has decreased. But the facts are we have a long way to go. In 1998, American women were the victims of 876,340 acts of domestic violence. Domestic violence accounted for 22 percent of violent crimes against women. During those same years, children under 12 lived in 43 percent of the households where domestic violence occurred. 
   We have to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Last week, the House passed by 415-3 the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Again, I doubt they would have passed it so overwhelmingly if its only person charged with enforcing that law had done a bad job in running the office. I did not hear one comment on the House floor, nor have I heard one here, 
   that in any way indicates that Bonnie Campbell did not do an outstanding job as head of that office. She did do an outstanding job and everyone knows she did. So now we're hearing that the Violence Against Women Act will be attached to something else and pass the Senate that way. 
   Yet perhaps the one person in this country who understands this issue and this law better than anyone else is Bonnie J. Campbell, who has directed that office for the last 5 years. We need people on the courts and on the bench who understand that law and can apply it fairly across our Nation. That is why we need Bonnie Campbell on the Eighth Circuit. 
   Right now we have quite a lack of women serving on our circuit courts. Frankly, the number of women on our circuit courts is appalling. We need more women on our circuit courts. And we need to confirm them here. Of the 148 circuit judges, only 33 are women--22 percent. That, in itself, is scandalous. 
   Bonnie Campbell should be added to that list. 
   Again, it doesn't seem right that Bonnie Campbell would get a hearing back in May and then remain bottled up in Committe. Lets go back to the presidential term of George Bush. During that time, every single district and circuit nominee who got a hearing--got a vote in Committee. And all but one got a vote on the Senate floor. 
   Yet we are not allowed to vote on Bonnie Campbell's nomination on the floor. So as I said, it is not fair to her. It is not fair to the judicial system. It is not fair to the advise and consent clause of the Constitution to hold her up. 
   Mr. President, I will again, today, as I will do every day, ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee of further consideration of this nomination.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee from further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, the nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court, that her nomination be considered by the Senate immediately following the conclusion of action on the pending matter, that the debate on the nomination be limited to 2 hours equally divided and a vote on her nomination occur immediately following the use or yielding back of that time.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, every day I will come out and ask unanimous consent to get Bonnie Campbell's name out of the committee and on the floor for a vote. Yet the objections come from the Republican side of the aisle. Why, I don't know. As I said, no one has said she's not qualified. If someone wants to vote against her to be on the Eighth Circuit, that is that Senator's right--obligation, if it is a vote he or she feels in conscience that he or she must cast. But, again, I say, give her a vote.

   Mr. HARKIN. So it only seems fair and right we bring her out here and have a vote. If people want to vote one way or the other, that is fine. But it is not fair, 217 days. 
   I will end my comments again by saying the standard bearer of the Republican Party, Governor Bush of Texas, has stated there ought to be a 60-day deadline on judge nominations, in other words 60 days from the day nominated to the time they get a vote in the Senate. I endorse that. Bonnie Campbell has been sitting there 217 days. Let's bring her out for a vote. 
   I will yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I want to get engaged in that discussion. I guess we will have time for that later. But the fact is, I think the Senator from Florida is correct. What we are seeing here, really, is a continuation of Newt Gingrich's philosophy that Medicare should wither on the vine. We all remember that. That was this ``Contract on America.'' That was Newt Gingrich's philosophy. I think we see it further taking place here today. 
   The Senator from Minnesota, I think, is basically going down that same path that Governor Bush is. Basically, what they have envisioned is a prescription drug program where, basically, if you are poor, you are on welfare, and you get it. If you are rich, you don't need it, and you pay for your own or you can belong to your own insurance plan and pay for it, or maybe you have an employer-sponsored program. But if you are the middle class, and you are in that middle group, you are paying the bill for both of them. You are paying for the tax breaks for the wealthy, and you are paying for the welfare benefits for the poor so they can get their prescription drugs. But you, in the middle class, don't get anything. If you do, in fact, get in this program, you will be paying and paying and paying and paying. 
   The Republicans have never liked Medicare. They did not like it when it came in, and they have never liked it since. So they just keep coming up with these kinds of programs that sound nice, but basically it is designed to unravel Medicare and let it wither on the vine. 
   Mr. President, I want to take to the floor today again to speak about the lack of due process in the Senate regarding judgeships, and especially the nomination of Bonnie Campbell for a position on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Her nomination has now been pending for 216 days. Yesterday, the Senate voted through four judges. Three of them were nominated and acted on in July; one was nominated in May. Bonnie Campbell was nominated in March. Yet those got through, but they are holding up Bonnie Campbell. Why? 
   Maybe it is because she has been the Director of the Violence Against Women Office in the Justice Department for the last 5 years; that office which has implemented the Violence Against Women Act, which, by all accounts, has done an outstanding job. 
   Maybe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not want any woman that is qualified to be an appeals court judge. Maybe that is why they are holding it up. Maybe it is because she has done such a good job of implementing the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Maybe they are holding her up because they think there are enough women on the circuit court. Of 148 circuit judges, only 33 are women; 22 percent. But maybe my colleagues on the Republican side think that is enough women to have on the circuit court. 
   I have said time and time again--and I will say it every day that we are in session--that Bonnie Campbell is not being treated fairly, not being accorded, I think, the courtesy the Senate ought to afford someone who is well qualified. 
   All the paperwork is done. All the background checks are done. She is supported by Senator GRASSLEY, a Republican, and by me, a Democrat from her home State. That may rarely happen around here. So Bonnie Campbell is not being treated fairly. 
   Senator HATCH, the other day, said, well, the President made some recess appointments in August, and that didn't set too well with some Senators. But what has that got to do with Bonnie Campbell? Maybe they don't like the way President Clinton combs his hair, but that has nothing to do with Bonnie Campbell being a judge on the circuit court. 
   Is Senator HATCH really making the argument that because President Clinton made some recess appointments that he didn't like, so that gives him an adequate excuse and reason to hold up Bonnie Campbell? I find that an interesting argument and an 
   interesting position to take. 
   I have heard that there was a news report that came out today that some of the Senators on the other side had some problems with her views. Now, this is sort of general. I don't know what those problems are. But that is why we vote. If some Senator on the other side does not believe Bonnie Campbell is qualified or should not be a Federal judge in a circuit court, bring her name out, let's debate it. These are debatable positions. Let's talk about it. And then let's have the vote. 
   If someone feels they can't vote for her, that is their right and their obligation. But we did not even have that. We do not even have her name on the floor so we can debate it because the Judiciary Committee has bottled it up. 
   Then I was told her name came in too late. It came in just this year. I heard that again. That is also in the news reports today, that somehow this vacancy occurred a year ago, but her name did not come down until March. 
   So I did a little research. 
   In 1992, when President Bush--that is the father of Governor Bush--was President in 1992, and the Senate was in Democratic hands, we had 13, 14 judges nominated; 9 had hearings; 9 were referred; and 9 were confirmed--all in 1992. Every judge who had a hearing got referred, got acted on, and got confirmed. 
   Now, that was OK in 1992, I guess, when there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate. But I guess it is not OK when we have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate. 
   Here we are. This chart shows this year, we have had seven nominees, including Bonnie Campbell. We have had two hearings; we have had one referred; one confirmed--one out of seven. So this kind of story I am hearing, that her nomination came in too late, is  just pure malarkey. This is just another smokescreen. 
   Circuit judges. They say: Well, it's a circuit court. There's an election coming up. We might win it, so we want to save that position so we can get one of our Republican friends in there. 
   Well, again, in 1992, circuit nominees, we had nine: six were acted on in July and August, two in September, and one in October. Yet in the year 2000, we had one acted on this summer, and we are in the closing days of October. No action. 
   So, again, it is not fair. It is not right. It is not becoming of the dignity and the constitutional role of the Senate to advise and consent on these judges. 
   Thirty-three women out of 148 circuit judges; 22 percent--I guess my friends on the other side think that is fine. I do not think it is fine. 
   Again, everything has been done. All of the paperwork has been in, and here she sits.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will now--and I will every day--ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee on further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, the nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court, and that her nomination be considered by the Senate immediately following the conclusion of action on the pending matter, and that the debate on the nomination be limited to 2 hours, equally divided, and that a vote on her nomination occur immediately following the use or yielding back of that time.

   Mr. HARKIN. I wish I knew why people are objecting. Why are they objecting to Bonnie Campbell? Why are they objecting to a debate on the Senate floor? Why are they objecting to bringing her name out 
   so that we can have a discussion and a vote on it? 
   I want to make clear for the Record, it is not anyone other than the Republican majority holding up this nominee. Every day we are here--I know there will be an objection--I am going to ask unanimous consent because I want the Record to show clearly what is happening here and who is holding up this nominee who is fully qualified to be on the circuit court for the Eighth Circuit. 
   Now I want to turn my comments to something the Senator from Minnesota was talking about; that is, the prescription drug program from the debate last night. Quite frankly, I was pretty surprised to hear Governor Bush talking about his prescription drug program. He calls it an ``immediate helping hand,'' and there is a TV ad being waged across the country to deceive and frighten seniors. He talks about ``Mediscare''; that was Bush's comment last night. He accused the Vice President of engaging in ``Mediscare,'' scaring the elderly. 
   If the Bush proposal for prescription drugs were to ever go into effect, seniors ought to be scared because what it would mean would be the unraveling of Medicare, letting Medicare wither on the vine. 
   Let's take a look at the Bush proposal. We know it is a two-stage proposal. First, it would be turned over to the States. It would require all 50 States to pass enabling or modifying legislation. Only 16 States have any kind of drug benefit for seniors. Each State would have a different approach. 
   The point is, many State legislatures don't meet but every 2 years. Even if we were to enact the program, there are some State legislatures that wouldn't get to it for a couple years. 
   Our most recent experience with something such as this is the CHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which Congress passed in 1997. It took Governor Bush's home State of Texas over 2 years to implement the CHIP program. It is not immediate. 
   He calls it ``immediate helping hand.'' It won't be immediate because States will have a hard time implementing it. In fact, the National Governors' Association says they don't want to do it. This is the National Governors' Association:  
   If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage to seniors, it should not shift that responsibility or its costs to the states.  
   That is exactly what Bush's 4-year program does. Beyond that, his plan only covers low-income seniors. Many of the seniors I have met and talked with wouldn't qualify for Bush's plan. 
   A recent analysis shows that the Bush plan would only cover 625,000 seniors, less than 5 percent of those who need help. His plan is not Medicare; it is welfare. What the seniors of this country want is Medicare, not welfare. Seniors would likely have to apply to a State welfare office. They would have to show what their income is. If they make over $14,600 a year, they are out. They get nothing, zero. 
   After this 4-year State block grant, then what is his plan? Well, it gets worse. Then his long-term plan is tied to privatizing Medicare; again, something that would start the unraveling of Medicare. It would force seniors to join HMOs. 
   So under Governor Bush's program, after the 4-year State program, then we would go into a new program. It would be up to insurance companies to take it. So seniors who need drug coverage would have to go to their HMO. They would not get a guaranteed package. The premium would be chosen by the HMO, the copayment chosen by the HMO, the deductible chosen by the HMO. And the drugs you get? Again, chosen by the HMO.

   Mr. HARKIN. Bush's plan would leave rural Americans out in 
   the cold. Thirty percent of seniors live in areas with no HMOs. And contrary to what the Senator from Minnesota said, if I heard him correctly, under the Bush program, the Government would pay 25 percent of the premiums and Medicare recipients would have to pay 75 percent. 
   The Bush program basically is kind of scary. Seniors ought to be afraid of it, because if it comes into being, you will need more than your Medicare card. You will need your income tax returns to go down and show them how much income you have, how many assets you have. If you qualify, you are in; if you don't, you are out. That would be the end of Medicare. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I will support consideration by the Senate of these nominations to fill district judge vacancies in Arizona and Illinois because we are entering a critical stage in the rising number of judicial vacancies in our Federal courts. However, in addition to the district vacancies, there are 22 vacancies in our Federal appeals courts, and pending before the Judiciary Committee are several appeals court nominations who are more than qualified to fill those positions. That, of course, includes a constituent of mine, Bonnie J. Campbell, former attorney general of the State of Iowa and presently the head of the Department of Justice Office of Violence Against Women. Her nomination is for the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. 
   These positions should be filled with qualified individuals as soon as possible. I urge the Republican leadership to take the steps necessary to allow the full Senate to vote up or down on these important nominations. 
   Basically what I have been hearing from the other side of the aisle, the Republican leadership, is: This is an election year. Why allow circuit nominees a vote on the floor? Hold it up. Maybe Governor Bush will win the election and we will control the Senate and the House, and we can have a whole new batch of appointees next year. 
   That attitude led me to take a look at the history of our judicial nominations. Let's go back to a time when there was a mirror image of what we have here, when there was a Republican President in the White House and a Democratic majority in the Senate. That year would be 1992. That year, then-President George Bush nominated fourteen circuit court judges. From July through October, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed nine of those judges. This year, a Democratic President nominated seven circuit court judges but with a Republican-controlled Senate, only one of these nominees has been confirmed. We have several pending, but we see no action. Time is running out. Basically what I have been told is, it is over with. They are not going to report any more of these nominees out for circuit courts. 
   I have also heard the argument that Bonnie Campbell was not nominated until this year so we shouldn't expect this nominee to go through. Let's take a look at what I am talking about with these charts. This is kind of a busy looking chart, but these are the circuit judges nominated in 1992 by then-President George Bush. These were all nominated in 1992. There were 14 nominated. There were 9 who had hearings, 9 who were referred, and 9 who were confirmed, 9 out of 14 who were nominated that year. 
   There was one nominee--Timothy Lewis--who was nominated in September of 1992, had his hearing in September of 1992, was referred in October of 1992, and confirmed in October of 1992. If the attitude that prevails among the Republican leadership today had prevailed in the Democrat-controlled Senate in 1992, we would not have confirmed anyone after July. This year, we have had none since July. 
   In 1992, we had two in September, two in August, and one in October, despite the fact that it too was late in an election year. This year we have only had one. 
   It is clear who is playing politics with judgeships. The Republican leadership of the Senate is playing the most baldfaced politics. It is not alleged that these nominees are not qualified. It is simply that they were nominated by a Democratic President. That is all. I have not heard one person on the Republican side tell me that Bonnie Campbell is not qualified to be a circuit court judge. 
   Some people on the other side may have some differences with her on some of her views. I understand that. I have had differences of view with judges I have voted to confirm. Why? Because I thought they were qualified. 
   I thought that if the President nominated them, they had a fair hearing, and they were reported out, my only decision was whether or not they were qualified--not whether they were ideologically opposed to me or to how I feel or what I believe. It has been my observation over the last quarter century that oftentimes when judges who have more of a liberal bent get appointed to the court, in many cases they come down on the more conservative side of cases. And I have seen conservative judges appointed to the court come down on the liberal side of cases. You never really know how this will come out, but you know whether or not people are legitimately qualified to serve on the bench. 
   So the arguments made that Bonnie Campbell wasn't nominated until this year--well, as I said, in 1992, we had nine circuit court judges confirmed that were nominated in that year. A couple of these were quite controversial. This year, we have had one confirmed. We have six more pending for the circuit courts. I know my colleague  from Vermont, who is ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, stated this last week that when a majority in the Senate starts playing these kinds of games, the result is that when the other side becomes the majority they will do the same thing. That is too bad for our democratic system of government, too bad for the judgeships, and for our third branch of Government to have that happen. 
   I am not naive enough not to know that there are always politics involved in how judges are nominated. I understand that. That is the system in which we live. But there comes a point where politics ends and responsibility begins. When you have people who have had a hearing, who are qualified, yet they won't be reported out for a vote on the Senate floor, that is pure politics and that is the height of irresponsibility. The Republican leadership is being totally irresponsible. 
   Of the judges nominated in 1992, every judge who got a hearing--every single judge who had a hearing in a Democrat-controlled Congress, when a Democrat was the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, when the Democrats controlled the Judiciary Committee, every person who got a hearing was confirmed. Every single one. That is not the case today. Too many political games are being played, I am afraid, on the Judiciary Committee and on the other side. 
   I would like to mention one other judicial example from 1992. Michael Melloy was nominated for the district court in April of that year. He was a Bush nominee, supported by Senator GRASSLEY. As my colleagues know, Senator GRASSLEY and I have a longstanding commitment to support the nominations of individuals from Iowa to our courts. Mr. Melloy is an example of this. He was nominated April 9, 1992, received his hearing on August 4, 1992, reported out of committee on August 12, 1992, and confirmed by the Senate that very same day in 1992. 
   Again, I may have been ideologically opposed to Mr. Melloy. There may have been some things he believed in that I didn't, but there was no question in my mind that Mr. Melloy was fully qualified to be a Federal judge. As long as he was qualified and supported by Senator GRASSLEY and the administration, I supported that nominee, even though it was in the closing days of 1992. 
   Let's look at the current nominees that we have. Three of the four we are going to be voting on today were nominated, got hearings, and were reported out of the committee within one week. Mr. James Teilborg was nominated on July 21, 2000, got his hearing on July 25, and was reported out of the committee on July 27. Now he stands to be confirmed today. On the other hand, Bonnie Campbell received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee in May--more than 2 months before Mr. Teilborg. Yet she is not here on the floor. Why is it that Mr. Teilborg can come out on the floor today and not Bonnie Campbell? Politics, the rankest form of politics. 
   The majority is being very inconsistent in their arguments. They say, well, Bonnie Campbell was nominated this year, so it is too late. Mr. Teilborg was nominated this year--nominated, had 
   a hearing, and was reported out all in the same week, and he will be confirmed today. If this year was too late for Bonnie Campbell, why wasn't it too late for James Teilborg? 
   As I said, nobody has come up and said Bonnie Campbell is not qualified. I challenge someone to come on the floor and say that. Again, if people want to vote against Bonnie Campbell to be a circuit court judge, that is the right of each Senator--not only a right, but an obligation--if they believe someone is unqualified. We can't do that as long as she is bottled up in the committee. 
   The Senator from Utah has the power on that committee to report her out. I say to my good friend from Utah, who just appeared on the floor, the Senator from Utah can report Bonnie Campbell's name out here to the floor and we can have a vote on this nominee. That is the way it should be done. Nobody has come up to me to say she is not qualified. She is a former attorney general of the State of Iowa. Since 1995, she has led the implementation of the Violence Against Women Act as the head of that office under the Justice Department. She has broad support on both sides of the aisle. This is a case where a judicial nominee has the support of both the Republican Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, and the Democratic Senator from Iowa, me. Yet she has not been reported out of the Judiciary Committee. I say report her out. If people want to vote against her or say something about her qualifications, let them. 
   I can stand here today and talk about the qualifications of James Teilborg, or the other people; but, quite frankly, I am convinced they are qualified. I may be opposed to the way they think once in a while, but they are qualified. Is the reason Bonnie Campbell is not being reported out because somebody on the other side of the aisle doesn't like the way she thinks, or because she may have a view on an issue contrary to theirs? The rankest form of politics is holding up Bonnie Campbell's nomination. We have a backlog of nominees and we should vote on her. 
   The Violence Against Women Act expires this year. The Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice has had only one person head it since this bill was first implemented in 1995, and that is Bonnie J. Campbell. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act was voted on in the House of Representatives last week. If I am not mistaken, I think the vote was 415-3. So 415 Members of the House voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Now, if the only person to ever head that office had done a bad job in enforcing that law, had not acted responsibly, had not brought honor and acclaim to that office and the administration of that law, do you think that 415 Members of the House would have voted to reauthorize it? No. They would have been on their feet over there, one after the other, talking about how terrible this office has been run and how the person operating that office had done such a bad job in enforcing the law. Not one Member of the House took the floor to so speak. 
   The one person to head that office is Bonnie J. Campbell. Not one person I have ever run across has said she has done anything less than an exemplary job in running that office. Yet the Senate Judiciary Committee will not report her name out for action by the full Senate. Yet we will get the Violence Against Women Act here and Senator after Senator will rush up to speak about how great this law is. I will bet you won't hear one Senator get up and say how badly this law has been administered by the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice. 
   That tells you what an outstanding job Bonnie Campbell has done in that office. 
   If that is the case, why won't the Senate Judiciary Committee report her name out? Politics; pure rank politics. That is what is going on in the Judiciary Committee today. I hope it won't be that way if the Democrats take charge of the Senate. I am not on the Judiciary Committee, but we tend to get in what I call a ``cesspool spiral,'' like a whirlpool. One side takes over the majority and begins to stall nominations, and then the other side takes over, we keep spiraling down further and further to the point where any nominee for a Federal court will be held up months and perhaps even years while we await the next election. Then our third branch of Government truly becomes a political football. 
   I hope the Judiciary Committee and the leadership on that side--I say to my friend from Utah--will listen to the words of Texas Governor George Bush. He said he would call for a 60-day deadline for judges--once they are nominated, the Senate will have 60 days to hold a hearing, to report out of committee and vote on the Senate floor. 
   Bonnie Campbell has been there a lot longer than 60 days and so have some of the other judges. 
   I say to my friends on the Republican side--you are supporting George Bush for President. If he said he would call for a 60-day deadline, I ask my friends on the Republican side: Why don't we act accordingly? 
   In this Congress, the judicial nominees who have been confirmed had to wait on average 211 days. Governor Bush said they should not wait longer than 60 days. This is not getting better; it is getting worse around here. It is really a shame. 
   Let's look at the percentages. I am told: This is the same today as it was before--blah, blah, blah, blah. I hear this all the time--nothing has changed.  
   It has changed dramatically. For example, in the Reagan years, during the 98th Congress, the Republicans were in the majority. They had a Republican President. We received 22 circuit court nominations, and 14 were confirmed. This is a Republican President and a Republican Senate--22 received, and 14 confirmed, for a 63.6-percent confirmation rate. 
   Let's look at the 100th Congress. President Reagan was still President, but there was a Democratic Senate. Twenty-six circuit court judge nominations were received; 17 were confirmed, for a 65.4-percent confirmation rate. 
   Think about that. Democrats had a higher confirmation rate under President Reagan--a very conservative President. We had a higher confirmation rate when the Democrats were in charge of the Senate than when the Republicans were in charge. We didn't block things when the Democrats were in charge. 
   Next, the 102d Congress, 1991-1992. President Bush was the Republican making nominations and the Democrats were in charge in the Senate. We received 31 circuit court nominations. Twenty were confirmed, again, for a 64.5-percent confirmation rate--Republican President and a Democratic Senate. 
   Now we move to the 104th Congress. We had a Democratic President, President Clinton, and we had a Republican Senate. Twenty circuit court nominations were received; 11 were confirmed. That was a 55-percent confirmation rate. 
   Now we are in the 106th Congress. We have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate. Thirty-one circuit court of appeals nominations have been received; 15 have been confirmed, for a 48.4-percent confirmation rate. 
   I ask my friend--and he is my friend--the chairman of the Judiciary Committee: How can we live with something like that? How can the Judiciary Committee come to this Senate with a straight face and say that a 48-percent confirmation rate is what we did in the past, when the record is clear? The record is in the 60-percent confirmation rate when we had Republican Presidents and 
   a Democratic Senate. Yet today we are faced with a 48-percent confirmation rate. 
   I have heard from many judges. I have gotten letters from them saying that it is time we filled the bench. Cases are backing up. We need to get judges on the bench. But I suppose we first have to pay attention to the elections. 
   This one nominee, Bonnie J. Campbell, should be reported out if for no other reason than we need people on the bench who are sensitive to what is happening in domestic abuse cases and violence against women. 
   In 1998, American women were the victims of 876,000 acts of domestic violence. In 5 years--1993 to 1998--domestic violence accounted for 22 percent of the violent crimes against women. During those same years, children under the age of 12 lived in 43 percent of the households where this violence occurred. It is generational. The kids see it, they grow up, and they become abusive parents themselves. 
   In Iowa, and all across America, prosecutors, victim service organizations, and law enforcement officers are fighting. But they need help. We need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. But there is more we can do to make sure that we have judges who know what is happening from firsthand experience and who can make sure that the law is applied fairly and upheld in courts around the country. 
   That is why we need someone like Bonnie Campbell on the circuit court of appeals. As I said, she is widely supported. She is supported by me and by Senator GRASSLEY. She has the support of judges, police organizations, women, and domestic violence coalitions. She has strong support in the State of Iowa and on both sides of the aisle. 
   I ask the chairman of the committee: Why aren't we reporting out Bonnie Campbell? Why? Just one simple question: Why? Is there a member of the majority who thinks she is not qualified? Let them so state. Have specific objections been raised as to her qualifications? If so, we ought to know that so they can be addressed. But all we hear is a deafening silence from the other side. We are left to assume that the reason Bonnie Campbell is being held up is because they are hoping their nominee wins the election. That is their right to hope that. They can work as hard as they can for him. I don't blame them for that. But to hold up a qualified person like Bonnie Campbell who had her hearing 2 months before Mr. Teilborg had his; yet she is being locked up in the committee--all the paperwork is done. Yet politics is holding her up.

   Mr. HARKIN. I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee on the floor. He is a good man. He and I have fought many battles together. I like him personally and I respect him. If he would like to engage in colloquy, I will. He knows how strongly I feel about this nominee, about her qualifications and about the kind of job she has done at the Department of Justice. I am sure he knows I will do everything that is humanly and senatorially possible to try to get her name here. I believe I have a right and an obligation to do that. I will, within the confines of what is right and proper in the Senate, not violating any rules, do everything I can to try to get her name out. 
   We will be here this week and we will be here next week. I ask my friend from Utah, will we be allowed to have a vote on Bonnie Campbell for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of Senators and staff, I initially had 3 hours of time on which to speak about the judicial nominees and, more specifically, the holdup that is happening on the Judiciary Committee with regard to the former attorney general of the State of Iowa, Bonnie J. Campbell, who has been nominated for a seat on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   In discussing this with several Senators, I can say that it is now my intention to speak for a few minutes and to yield back the remainder of my time. In discussions with our side, I understand there probably will be just voice votes on all of these nominees. 
   Just for planning purposes--I know how sometimes I get irritated when I don't really know what is happening when some people have a lot of time--I want Senators to know I am going to speak for a few minutes, yield back my time, and then move to the votes on the nominees. 
   Again, I want to respond a little bit to what my friend from Utah said this morning, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH. I am reading from the transcript of this morning's session. Senator HATCH said:  
   It had always been my intention for the Judiciary Committee to report Ms. Campbell's nomination. However, events conspired to prevent that from happening. 
   First, during the August recess, as I have explained, the President determined to recess appoint several executive branch nominees over the express objection of numerous Senators. 
   He did so notwithstanding his agreement to clear such recess appointments with the relevant Senators....... 
   Second, after their August recess, Democrat Senators determined to place holds on the four nominations we are debating today, even everybody admits--I think everybody admits--that they are important nominations and this arrangement that has been worked out has been fair. 
   Again, they threatened to shut down the Senate's committee work, going as far as to invoke the 2-hour rule and forcing the postponement of scheduled committee hearings. ..... For these reasons, Bonnie Campbell's nomination has stalled. Ms. Campbell has only the White House and Senate Democrats to blame for the current situation.  
   I don't know what the Senator from Utah is talking about. Bonnie Campbell had nothing to do with whether the President made recess appointments or not. And the holds that were placed on the four nominations--they were saying, wait a minute, Bonnie Campbell had her hearing 2 months before some of the nominees that we are voting on today. Three of these nominees that will get their vote today were nominated, got their hearing and were reported out of Committee within one week in July of this year. Bonnie Campbell's hearing was in May. 
   So we are only saying: Why not take those who had their hearings first? Why take up those who had them later? Bonnie Campbell had her hearing, answered questions; they had more written questions that they sent her, and she responded to those. Yet there again, three of the four judges we are voting on here today went through the first three steps of the process within one week. 
   Ms. Campbell has only the White House and Senate Democrats to blame for the current situation? What is the Senator from Utah talking about? What is to blame are the pure rank politics of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Republicans for holding up Bonnie Campbell's nomination and keeping it bottled up in committee. 
   The Senator from Utah knows full well that this Senator from Iowa had every right to exercise his rights as a Senator on the floor, to bottle up a lot of things on this floor after the August recess. I did not do so because I was led to believe that, by acting in good faith, the Senate Judiciary Committee would act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination. Why? Because the Senator from Iowa,  Mr. GRASSLEY--and if I am not mistaken, he is the second ranking member on the Judiciary Committee--supports Bonnie Campbell and has stated so publicly. So I figured, well, he is second ranking. 
   Now, Mr. KYL, the Senator from Arizona, is fourth ranking on the committee, but he gets his nominee through. He was nominated, had a hearing, and was reported out that week. Mr. KYL gets his nominee through. 
   Well, I figured if I acted in good faith--and I did so by not doing anything and letting the Judiciary Committee go from one week to the next, one week to the next, and I thought this week they didn't report her out, maybe they'll do it next week, or maybe the next week. Well, now, the time has run out and it is clear to me I was being strung along all this time with false promises that the Judiciary Committee would, indeed, act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination. 
   So now to say that it is the Senate Democrats who are to blame for the current situation with Bonnie Campbell is utter fabrication, total nonsense. The Senator from Utah knows as well as I do that there is one reason it is being held up, and it is called politics--pure rank politics. Then, again, Senator HATCH says that the reason it has been held up is because President Clinton had some recess appointments, and that we had a hold on these four nominees for a while. Well, why is he singling out one nominee? Why is he targeting Bonnie Campbell? Why is Bonnie Campbell the target? What about all the other judges? Why is he singling her out? 
   Is it because of her work to prevent domestic violence as the director of the Office of Violence Against Women at the Justice Department? The Senate Republicans have stalled passing the reauthorization of that law just as they have blocked Bonnie Campbell's nomination from getting a vote on the Senate floor. 
   Bonnie Campbell has done a superb job of focusing on the issue of violence against women, especially domestic violence. The Violence Against Women Act has expired. It expired on the last day of September of this year. This Republican Congress didn't even see fit to take it up and pass it. 
   So it is no surprise to me that in poll after poll after poll across this country women are saying no to Republican candidates because they see what has been happening here. This Republican Senate is holding up the one person who really knows what violence against women is about, who headed that office and has done a superb job; yet Senate Republicans aren't going to let her come out. How well has she done? Take a look at the House vote on reauthorization. The vote was 415 to 3. Do you really think this bill would have been reauthorized if the person who has headed the office to implement its provisions had done a bad job? 
   Well, I say to Senate Republicans, you better beware. The women of this country are watching what you do up here on the issues that are important to them. They want the Senate to reauthorize VAWA. They want judges who will enforce that law. Who better to do that than Bonnie Campbell? She is qualified, and no one has come to the Senate floor and said any differently since her hearing. 
   I can tell you, this Republican Senate that is holding up her nomination and the reauthorization of VAWA will have only themselves to blame if the women of this country vote overwhelmingly against their party in November. It pains me to say this, but I think that is what it has come down to. If they want to play politics with Bonnie Campbell and Violence Against Women, go right ahead, but it will bite them bad. Real bad. 
   You may think you are only holding up one person, only one judge, saying, well, she was from Iowa, not of any consequence. I say to my Republican friends, you are seriously mistaken. Bonnie Campbell did an outstanding job as attorney general for the State of Iowa. She was well known to women all over this country as a role model and someone they have looked to for leadership, someone who has brought honor to our State, honor to the legal profession, honor to this administration, and honor to what we are about as a nation in trying to provide more equality for women in this country. 
   I say to my friends on the Republican side, if you think you are playing smart politics by holding up Bonnie Campbell's nomination, I say to you that you are sadly mistaken. 
   But I guess it has come down to this. I am told that there is no use even talking about it anymore. They are not going to let Bonnie Campbell's nomination be reported out. I don't know about that. I say it is never over until it's over. And perhaps some cooler heads will prevail on the Republican side. They will see that they are only hurting their own cause. They are only hurting themselves and their candidates who are out there running by holding up Bonnie Campbell's nomination. 
   It is time we have more diversity on the Federal bench. Only 20 percent of the Federal judiciary are women. Of the 148 circuit judges, only 33 are women. It is time we have more--qualified women on the federal bench. 
   Last year, a report by the Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts--an independent group--verified that the time to confirm female nominees is now significantly longer than that to confirm male nominees. There is a difference that has defied logical explanation. The fact is--it is true--to confirm female nominees takes a lot longer than men. 
   We have some men who are being voted on today. We have one man being voted on today who was nominated in July. He was passed out the same week. Bonnie Campbell has waited 215 days since she was nominated. 
   The standard bearer of the Republican Party this year--Gov. Bush of Texas--said there should be a deadline of 60 days from nomination through the process. 
   Evidently, the Republicans in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee are not paying much heed to their standard bearer. 
   I am sorry to have to disagree with Mr. HATCH. But the White House is not to blame for this, and neither are the Senate Democrats. 
   Mr. HATCH has an argument with the White House on recess appointments. That is another matter entirely. It has nothing to do with judicial nominees. 
   Maybe he doesn't like what Mr. Clinton said at a press conference. Maybe Senator HATCH doesn't like a lot of things the President does. But does that give the Senator from Utah the right to hold up a judicial nominee because he doesn't like what the President did on some other matter? 
   I want to point out again that three out of the four nominees voted on today were nominated, a hearing was held, and they were reported out of the committee in 1 week in July. Yet Bonnie Campbell has been waiting 215 days, and they will not report her out of the committee. 
   One can only ask again why the Republicans are playing this political charade. I guess they figure, well, if they just hold on, maybe their guy will win and they can move ahead. 
   But, as I said earlier, I think the Republicans over there ought to be aware of this one. This one is going to bite hard. 
   Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from Minnesota desires. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I respond by saying I was not trying to imply one way or the other that seniority had something to do with who gets out of the Judiciary Committee. My main point was that three of the four nominees we voted on today have been pending a very short time. They were nominated in July, their hearing was in July, and they were reported out of Committee in July--all in the same week. And they were brought to the floor today. Bonnie Campbell has been sitting there for 215 days. She had her hearing in May. Yet they won't report her out of the Judiciary Committee. 
   This is unfair. It is unfair to her. It is unfair to the women of this country. It is unfair to the court which needs to fill this position. We recognize in Bonnie Campbell a champion, a champion of women, someone who has done an outstanding job in administering the office of violence against women. She is the only one who has held that office since the legislation was passed. The House last week voted 415-3 to reauthorize it. Now we will try to do something in the Senate. I think the women of this country understand the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee and the Republican-controlled Senate are stopping the Senate from having a vote on Bonnie Campbell for pure political reasons. 
   I think it is wrong the way they are treating Bonnie Campbell in this nomination process. I will continue to point that out every day that we remain in session. It is unfair to her. It is unfair to the women of this country to have someone so qualified, someone who has done so much to reduce and prevent violence against women, to have the Senate Judiciary Committee bottle up her name and not even permit it to come on the floor for a vote. 
   I am still hopeful perhaps they will see the light and permit that to happen, although time is running out. I will take every day we are here to talk about it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today in continuing concern over the National Ignition Facility, a massive stockpile stewardship facility being built at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Labs in California. This program has been beset by cost overruns, delays, and poor management. The House in its Energy & Water bill included $74.1 million for construction of NIF. The Senate adopted an amendment I offered that capped spending at the same level, and also requested an independent review of the project from the National Academy of Sciences. 
   I know the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee each have their own concerns about NIF, and I greatly appreciate their efforts to bring this program under control. But frankly I am disappointed in what has come out of conference. The funding for NIF construction has risen from $74 million to $199 million. $74 million in the House, $74 million in the Senate, and $199 million out of conference. 
   That is a lot of money to spend on a program that is out of control. Projected costs of constructing this facility have almost doubled in the last year. We don't know if the optics will work. We don't know how to design the target. Even if the technical problems are solved, we don't know if the National Ignition Facility will achieve ignition. We don't even know if this facility is needed. DOE's recent ``rebaselining'' specified massive budget increases for NIF for several years, but, despite Congressional requests, did not say where this money would come from or what impact it would have on the stockpile stewardship program. 
   This is the time to slow down, conduct some independent studies, reconsider how we can best maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile and whether this risky program really is critical to that effort. Instead we are saying full steam ahead. 
   It is true that part of the money, $69 million, is held back until DOE arranges for studies of some of these issues and certifies that the program is on schedule and on budget. These issues are critical to future Congressional action on NIF. Unfortunately, the bill does not clearly specify who will conduct those studies. 
   I wish we could entrust DOE with these reviews, but history suggests they have not earned our trust. A recent article in the journal Nature describes ten years of failed peer review on this project: so-called ``independent'' reports that were not independent, that were written by stacked panels with conflicts of interest, that even were edited by project officials. A recent GAO report notes that reviews ``did not discover and report on NIF's fundamental project and engineering problems, bringing into question their comprehensiveness and independence.'' DOE is currently under threat of a second lawsuit regarding violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act in NIF studies. 
   We need a truly independent review. I am pleased that the Chairman and Ranking Member agreed to join me in a colloquy on this concern, and hope the studies mandated in this bill will be fully independent and credible. Otherwise, I fear that the $199 million we are appropriating will be poured down a bottomless pit with the $800 million already spent. We've seen this happen too many times, with the Superconducting Supercollider, the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, the Space Station, and on and on. I will continue to strive to protect our taxpayers, keep our nuclear stockpile safe, and end wasteful spending on NIF before more billions are spent.

Reserving the right to object, I ask the distinguished majority leader, in good faith, if he would modify his unanimous consent request to discharge the Judiciary Committee on further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, the nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court, and that her nomination be considered by the Senate under the same terms and at the same time as the nominees included in the majority leader's request?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object for just one more, again, I just want to say to the majority leader that on some of these nominees--I think maybe three of them were nominated, got their hearings and were reported out of committee all within one week in July. Yet Bonnie Campbell from Iowa was nominated early this year. She has had her hearing, and has been sitting there now for four months without being reported out. I just find this rather odd. I haven't heard of any objections to bringing her nomination out on the floor. 
   I just ask the majority leader whether or not we can expect to have at least some disposition of Bonnie Campbell before we get out of here.

   Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator. I want to say a few more things on my own time about Senator BYRD's presentation this morning, but I also want to respond to the point that my friend from California is making about being able to offer amendments to the appropriations bills that come up. 
   I ask the Senator from California: I do not know if we agree on this, but I think if we had more of an opportunity to act as a 
   Senate, to bring legislation out and to be able to consider bills that we might be interested in, that we wouldn't have to do them on appropriations bills. But because we are prevented from doing so, many times it is only the appropriations bills where we can offer them. 
   I ask the Senator from California if she would maybe--I see her nodding her head--agree with that decision; if we had that opportunity to act as a Senate and to bring authorizing bills out here to be able to offer those amendments, then we wouldn't have to do that on appropriations bills.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   I want to point out to the Senator from West Virginia, regarding the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, this is the first time since it was enacted in 1965 we have not reauthorized it. Why? There is no reason we cannot debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act before we adjourn. 
   I am certain reasonable minds on both sides would agree to time limits. No one wants to filibuster the bill. Offer the amendments. But the way things are today, if someone has ideas on what we want to do on education in this country, they are precluded from doing so. It is still stuck on the calendar, for the first time since 1965. S. 2, the No. 2 bill of this Congress, and it is still on the calendar. We haven't had a chance to act. 
   I say to my friend from California, the Senator from West Virginia referred to returning back to the Dark Ages. I was thinking about that when the Senator was speaking. Someone remarked to me that: All this talk about rules and procedure is gobbledygook. Who cares? That is inside ball game stuff around here, and it doesn't really matter on the outside. 
   I know it sounds like inside ball game stuff when we talk about rules and procedures, rule XVI and things such as this. The Senator mentioned the Dark Ages; I got to thinking about the Dark Ages. That is an appropriate allegory because the reason they were the Dark Ages is that we didn't have rules, we didn't have laws, it was uncivilized. In order for us to be civilized, we said there are certain rules by which we should live. 
   We have these rules in the Senate so that we don't live in the Dark Ages. They have a lot to do with people's lives outside of the beltway of this city. I think the Senator's mentioning of the Dark Ages is very appropriate. That is what we are returning to. We are returning to a rule-less kind of Senate where whoever is in charge calls the shots. That is what the Dark Ages was about: Whoever had the power ran everything. It was a lawless society. Through the years we developed our rules. 
   There is a reason the Senate is the way it is. Read the Senator's ``History of the Senate.'' There is a reason the Founding Fathers set up the Senate the way it is. It is to allow some of the smaller States and others to have their say and to have their equal representation so they aren't bound up by the rules of the House of Representatives.

   Sometimes--I am not mentioning any names--sometimes we talk with colleagues about the rules. There is kind of a smirk: Oh, yes, we have business to do around here. And there is sort of--I detected it lately--there is sort of: ``Well, the rules are the rules, but if we have the votes, we don't care.'' 
   That is a terrible attitude. As the Senator from West Virginia said, it really returns us to the Dark Ages when we were a lawless, ruleless society.

   Mr. HARKIN. I was trying to say--I will yield in just a second more--I think what is happening is that the foundation on which this Senate has been based is beginning to crumble. It is not all gone yet. But I was thinking, the Senate is like a foundation. If you pull one brick out, OK; it still holds. You pull another brick out--the foundation is still strong. 
   What is happening, I believe, and I say this in all candor, the majority side, for the last several years, has been pulling some bricks out of the foundation. They pulled one out and no one complained. They pulled another one out and nothing happened. What concerns me is that one feeds on another. So if we take back the majority, do we then say we will take out another brick? And then another brick? And then it bounces to the other side? Pretty soon the foundation crumbles and nobody can point to that first brick and when it was pulled out. 
   That is what I see, a kind of insidious pulling out of the bricks of the foundation of the Senate. Yet since things do happen, at the end of the year there is this big omnibus that is put together and people say: There you go, no big deal. But I predict pretty soon the foundation is going to start crumbling if we don't stop pulling out the bricks.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for pointing this out. It is true, it is the first time since 1965 we have not reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. What the Federal Government has done since the adoption of that bill, since 1965, as the Senator knows, is we have filled in the gaps. 
   Obviously, education still remains a local and State obligation, as we want it to be, but we recognized there were certain gaps. For example, disadvantaged students: We came up with the title I program to provide needed funds to States to help educate disadvantaged children in disadvantaged areas. I do not think there is a Governor anywhere in this country who does not like title I, or educators. Since we set up title I, it has done great things for our kids. That is at stake here. Without reauthorization, we cannot give guidance and funds to title I. 
   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: for kids with disabilities, is another example of what will slip through the cracks in terms of bringing us into the new century and addressing the new problems in education. 
   Teacher training is a very vital component of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to provide guidance and, yes, support for teacher training, for example, in new technologies, such as closing the digital divide. This is all part of that. This will all fall through the cracks. 
   Because of the intransigence of the Republican majority in the Senate--we will fund it; I am sure we will get the appropriations bill through; we will fund it--we will not address the new problems in education which we need to address. We will still be answering the problems of 8 years ago and 10 years ago rather than addressing new problems.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I respond in kind by thanking the Senator from California for pointing out again what is at stake because we are not allowed to offer our amendments. The Senator from California has done a great service not only to the Senate, but to the country, in pointing out why so many people are disenfranchised in this country because they do not have a voice with which to speak here if we are blocked from offering our amendments. I thank the Senator from California for pointing that out. 
   I want to talk about another issue we are, again, blocked from addressing in the Senate, and that is the issue of prescription drugs for the elderly. Of all the issues out there that cry out for solutions and intervention, this has to be No. 1 on our plate. Anyone who has gone to their State and talked with the elderly who are on Social Security, who are on Medicare, has heard heartrending story after heartrending story about how much our seniors are paying out of pocket for prescription drugs. 
   Vice President GORE was in my home State of Iowa yesterday. There is a story that was running on the news programs and in the newspapers this morning about a 79-year-old woman. I do not know her. I have never met her, to the best of my knowledge. Winifred Skinner, 79 years old, from, I believe, the small town of Altoona--but I cannot be certain about that--who showed up at a meeting with Vice President GORE and talked about how she goes along the streets and the roadways picking up aluminum cans because she can get payment for them. I think it is a nickel a can, if I am not mistaken. She collects these to make some money to help pay for her prescription drugs. 
   This is a real person. It is not a phony person. This is a real person with real problems, and she needs some help. We have tried time and again to bring this legislation to the Senate floor to openly debate it. If other people have other ideas, let's debate them, have the votes, and let's see what the Senate's position will be, but we are precluded from doing so. 
   Now we have an ad campaign put on by the Republican candidate for President, Gov. George Bush. This TV ad  campaign is being waged across the country to deceive and frighten seniors about the Medicare prescription drug benefit proposed by Senate Democrats and Vice President AL GORE. I thought I would take a few minutes today, as I will do every day we are in session, to set the record straight. 
   First, we have to examine Bush's ``Immediate Helping Hand.'' That is what he calls it, ``Immediate Helping Hand.'' Quite simply, it is not immediate and, secondly, it does not help. 
   Is it immediate? No. The Bush proposal for prescription drugs for the elderly requires all 50 States to pass some enabling or modifying legislation. Only 16 States right now have any drug benefit for seniors. Many State legislatures do not meet but every 2 years, so we might have a 2-year lapse or 3-year or 4-year lapse in the Bush proposal. 
   How do we know this? Our most recent experience is with the CHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. We passed it in 1997. It took Governor Bush's home state of Texas over 2 years to implement the CHIP program. 
   In addition, the States have said they do not want this block grant program. This is what the National Governors' Association said, Republicans and Democrats, by the way: 
   If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage to seniors, it should not shift that responsibility or its costs to the states. .....''  
   But that is exactly what the Bush 4-year program does. 
   Again, keep in mind, the Bush proposal on prescription drugs is a two-phased program. In the first 4 years, he delegates it to the States. As I pointed out, States do not even want to do it. 
   Secondly, many legislatures do not meet for 2 years. 
   Thirdly, talk about a ``helping hand,'' who gets helped under the Bush program? If your income is more than $14,600 a year, you are out--$14,600 a year, and you are out. 
   What does that mean? It means many of the seniors will not qualify. The Bush plan will only cover 625,000 seniors, less than 5 percent of those who need help. 
   Again, under the Vice President's proposal--and what we are supporting--all you need is a Medicare card. If you have a Medicare card, you can voluntarily sign up for a drug benefit, your doctor prescribes the drugs. You go to the pharmacy and you get your drugs. That is the end of it. That is all you have to show. 
   If you are under the Bush program, you are going to have to take your income tax return down, plus probably other paperwork to show your assets, to show that you have income of less than $14,600.

   Mr. HARKIN. That is true. 
   I thank the Senator from California for amplifying on that. Because Governor Bush's program is not Medicare; it is welfare. What seniors want is they want Medicare, they do not want welfare. 
   Look at the States. To sign up for Medicare, seniors fill out long, complex applications in 26 States. They must meet an extensive asset and income test in 41 States. And they have to sign up in the welfare office in 34 States. Maybe that is why only 55 percent of eligible seniors sign up for Medicaid compared to 98 percent who sign up for Medicare. 
   That is what the Bush proposal would do: Send seniors to the local welfare office. Take your income tax returns down, take down other paperwork, fill it out, show them what your income and assets are, and then maybe--maybe--you will qualify. 
   As I have said repeatedly, the seniors of this country want Medicare, they do not want welfare. The Bush plan would put them on welfare. Then, after the 4 years--the first 4 years of the Bush block grant--then what does his proposal do? His proposal 
   turns it over to the HMOs. So it gets even worse. 
   The long-term plan under Governor Bush is tied to privatizing Medicare, a move that would raise premiums and force seniors to join HMOs. Under the Bush drug plan, there would be radical changes in Medicare--radical changes. You would not recognize it today. 
   Premiums for regular Medicare would increase 25 to 47 percent in the first year alone. Why is that? Why do we say that? Because once you turn it over to the HMOs and the insurance companies--which is what the Bush plan does--after the first 4 years, it shifts to universal coverage, but turns it over to the insurance companies. 
   Obviously, the insurance companies are going to do what we call cherry pick. They are going to pick the healthiest seniors and give them a really good deal to join their insurance program. Who does that leave in Medicare? The oldest and the sickest. And to cover the Medicare costs, under legislation we have that exists, their premiums will go up 25 to 47 percent in the first year alone. That is shocking. 
   But we have to understand that what the Bush proposal is for Medicare is the fulfillment of Newt Gingrich's dream to let Medicare ``wither on the vine.'' Governor Bush supported that concept when Mr. Gingrich was Speaker of the House. Governor Bush's proposal fulfills Newt Gingrich's dream because by turning it over to the insurance companies, by privatizing Medicare, it would ``wither on the vine.'' 
   Governor Bush would leave seniors who need drug coverage at the mercy of HMOs. Listen. Under the Bush proposal, who would decide what the premiums are going to be? HMOs. Who would decide copayments? HMOs. Who would decide any deductibles? HMOs. Who would even decide the drugs that you can get? It would be the HMOs--not your doctor, not your pharmacist. 
   Lastly, as someone who represents a rural State and who still lives in a town of 150 people, the Bush plan would leave rural Americans out in the cold. Thirty percent of our seniors live in areas with no HMOs. 
   In Iowa, we have no Medicare HMOs. Listen to this. Only eight Iowa seniors, who happen to live near Sioux Falls, SD, belong to a Medicare HMO with a prescription drug benefit. Yet in Iowa, we have the highest proportion of the elderly over the age of 80 anywhere in the Nation. And only eight--count them--elderly, who happen to live near Sioux Falls, SD, belong to a Medicare HMO that has a prescription drug benefit. 
   Also, HMOs are dropping like flies out of rural areas. Almost a million Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this year alone, mostly in rural areas. 
   So, again, our seniors want Medicare. They do not want welfare. The Bush plan turns it over to the States for the first 4 years. Take your income tax returns down, show how poor you are, maybe you will get help. 
   The Bush plan for prescription drugs says, if you are rich, you are fine. If you are real poor, you are OK. But if you are in the middle class, you are going to pay for it both ways. 
   Lastly, we have to talk about priorities. The Bush priority is $1.6 trillion in tax breaks, almost 50 percent of which goes to the top 1 percent of the wealthiest people in this country. For prescription drugs for the elderly, he is proposing $158 billion over the next 10 years. There you go. Those are the priorities right there. 
   So every day we are in session, I will take the floor to point out the fallacies  in Governor Bush's proposal for prescription drugs for the elderly, how it will put elderly first on the welfare rolls--they will have to be eligible for welfare--and then take their income tax returns down; and how, secondly, it will turn it over to the private insurance companies, and it will destroy Medicare as we know it.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California. She is absolutely right. Forty-three percent of these tax breaks go to the top 1 percent, who have an average income of over $915,000 a year. This is where Governor Bush's tax breaks go. Yet Winifred Skinner--age 69, in my home State of Iowa--has to go around the streets and the roads and pick up aluminum cans so she can pay for her prescription drugs. I think that says it all. 
   I thank the Senator from California. I thank the Senator for yielding me the time and yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman and ranking member to engage in a brief colloquy on the National Ignition Facility. The bill as it passed the Senate requested a study by the National Academy of Sciences of a number of issues regarding the National Ignition Facility. The current bill and conference report language require reviews of several issues, including the need for the  facility, alternatives to NIF, consideration of starting with a smaller facility, and planning for the Broader stockpile stewardship program. All these elements are important, but the bill does not specify how these reviews are to be conducted. 
   Previous supposedly independent DOE reviews of NIF have been strongly criticized in the recent GAO report and in a recent article in the journal Nature, and have even been subject to lawsuits for violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act. I believe it is critical for the credibility of these reviews that they be conducted by an independent body, such as the National Academy of Sciences, and that they be organized as independent studies under FACA rules. This is a troubled program, and we need the very best thought of independent experts to help us get it back on track or to scale it back as needed.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my disappointment that the Republican leadership in the Senate seems to have better things to do than to pass a bill reauthorizing one of our most effective laws to combat domestic violence. I am talking about the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Since it became law in 1994, it has provided money to State and local programs to help women obtain restraining orders and to arrest those who are abusing women. The numbers show that the Violence Against Women Act is working. 
   A recent Justice Department report found that domestic violence against women decreased by 21 percent between 1993 and 1998. That is good news, but we still have a long way to go. 
   In 1998, American women were the victims of 876,340 acts of domestic violence. Between 1993 and 1998, domestic violence accounted for 22 percent of the violent crimes against women. And during those same years, children under the age of 12 lived in 43 percent of the households where domestic violence occurred. This is generational. The kids see it, they grow up, they become abusive parents themselves. 
   In Iowa and all across America, law enforcement officers and prosecutors and victims service organizations are fighting back, but they need help. The help they need is to make sure we reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, to make sure it is funded, to keep the great job going that it has been doing over the last 5 years.  
   There is other help that we need to cut down on domestic violence and violence against women; that is, to make sure that we have judges on our courts who understand this law, who know what is happening out there and can make sure the law is applied fairly and is upheld in the courts around the country. 
   To that end, it is again disappointing that the Republican Senate is holding up the nomination of one person uniquely qualified to ensure that the Violence Against Women Act is enforced in our courts around the country. 
   Since the beginning of the Violence Against Women Office that was created under the Justice Department in 1995, the person who has been at the head of that office is the former attorney general of the State of Iowa, Bonnie Campbell. Earlier this year, the President nominated her for a vacancy on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has had her hearing on the Judiciary Committee. She is broadly supported on both sides of the aisle, strongly supported in her home State of Iowa where, as I said, she served with distinction as attorney general. Yet for some reason, the Judiciary Committee is holding up her nomination. 
   I have heard a couple of reasons: It is too late in the year; this is an election year; they want to hold on, maybe Bush will be elected and they can get their people in. 
   So, that makes me feel the need to take a look at the history of our judicial nominations. In 1992, when there was a Republican in the White House and the Democrats controlled the Senate. But in 1992, from July through October, the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed nine circuit court judges. This year, with a Democratic President but a Republican-controlled Senate, we have only gotten one confirmed since July. We have some pending who could be reported out, one of whom is Bonnie Campbell. But we see no action and time is running out. 
   And everything I have heard from the Judiciary Committee is that they will not report her name out. The other thing I heard was, she was nominated too late. I also heard from some people on the committee--that she was only nominated earlier this year. I shouldn't expect her to be reported out. 
   Well, again, let's take a look at the record books. In 1992, when there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, nine circuit nominees were nominated and confirmed that same year. Let me say that again. They were nominated in 1992 and acted on in 1992. Yet this year, we are told that the Republican-controlled Senate cannot move circuit court judges out because it is an election year. Yet when the Democrats were in charge in 1992, as I said, nine were nominated and nine were acted upon by the Democratic Senate. 
   Let's jump back to this year. Seven people this year were nominated to sit on the judicial circuit. Only 1 of those seven has been confirmed and that was in July. 
   I want to focus on Bonnie Campbell. A hearing was held in May. All the paperwork is done. She is widely supported. If there are people here who would like to vote against her, at least bring her nomination to the floor; and if they want to vote against her, for whatever reason, let them do so. But I have not had one person on the Republican side or the Democratic side come to this Senator and say that Bonnie Campbell is not qualified to be a circuit court judge--not one. She is eminently well qualified and everyone knows it. 
   Here is this person who has headed the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice since it started. She has run it for 5 years. The House of Representatives, yesterday, reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, with 415 votes for it. I ask, do you think 415 Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, would have voted that overwhelmingly to reauthorize the bill if the person who had been running that office had not done an exemplary job? I think by the very fact that 415 Members of the House, from every end of the ideological spectrum, voted to reauthorize that bill, what they are saying is that Bonnie Campbell gets an A-plus on running that office, implementing the VAWA provisions and enforcing the law. Yet this Republican Senate will not report her name out on the floor to be confirmed, or at least to vote on her to be a circuit court judge. 
   Well, I tell you, talk about a split personality. The Republicans in this Senate can talk all they want to about violence against women and that they are going to bring the bill up and we are going to pass it before the end of the year; but if this Republican-controlled Senate holds Bonnie Campbell's name and won't let her come out for a vote, they are saying: We will pass the Violence Against Women Act, but we don't want judges on our courts who are going to enforce it. I say that because nobody is more qualified to enforce it than Bonnie Campbell. 
   The Judiciary Committee, I am told, is going to meet tomorrow. I am hopeful that tomorrow they will report Bonnie Campbell's name out for action by the full Senate.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is time to shed some light on the Medicare prescription drug proposal advanced by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and by their nominee for President, Gov. George Bush. 
   Unfortunately, there is a big TV ad campaign being waged across the country to deceive and frighten seniors about the Medicare prescription drug benefit proposed by Vice President AL GORE and the Democrats in the Senate. So I want to set the facts straight. 
   First, let's examine Bush's ``immediate helping hand.'' That is what Governor Bush calls his Medicare proposal. Quite simply, it is not immediate and it doesn't give much help. Will it be 
   immediate? The answer is no. His plan for Medicare would require all 50 States to pass enabling or modifying legislation. Right now, only 16 States have any kind of drug benefit for seniors. Each State will have a different approach. Many State legislatures only meet once every 2 years. So for Bush's plan to go into effect, the State has to pass some kind of enabling legislation. 
   Well, our most recent experience with something like this was the CHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which Congress passed in 1997. It took Governor Bush's home State of Texas over 2 years to implement the CHIP program.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I said, most State legislatures meet every 2 years. Governor Bush's own State didn't even implement the CHIP program for over 2 years. In addition, the States don't even want this block grant. In February of this year, the Governors rejected Bush's proposal. They said:  
   If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage for seniors, it should not shift that responsibility or its costs to the States.  
   That was the National Governors' Association. Republicans and Democrats said Bush's proposal won't work. So that won't be immediate. Bush's proposal takes years to get any effect for people.  
   Will it give a helping hand? Well, Bush's plan only covers low-income seniors. Middle-class seniors are told they don't need to apply. That is what Bush's plan is. It only helps low-income. For example, if you are a senior and your income is over $14,600 a year, you get zero, zip, no help at all, from Bush's Medicare proposal. 
   A recent analysis shows that the Bush plan would only cover 625,000 seniors, or less than 5 percent of those who need help. So his plan is not adequate and it is not Medicare. Seniors want Medicare, not welfare. 
   The other thing is that under the Bush proposal for Federal care, for his prescription drug program, seniors would probably have to go to the State welfare office to apply for it. Why is that? Because there is an income cutoff. The agencies in the States that are set up to determine whether or not you meet income guidelines for programs are welfare agencies. So that means that under the Bush program, every senior, to get prescription drugs, has to go down to the welfare agency 
   and show that they don't make over $14,600 a year. That is the first 4 years. Bush's program is for 4 years. States have not acted. As I pointed out, some State legislatures don't even meet except once every 2 years. 
   They have to go down to the welfare office. It only helps those below $14,000 a year. 
   Then what happens after 4 years? After 4 years, Governor Bush's plan becomes even worse because his long-term plan, after 4 years, involves privatizing Medicare. It would raise premiums and force seniors to join HMOs. 
   The Bush plan is the fulfillment of what Newt Gingrich once said when he wanted Medicare to ``wither on the vine.'' Bush's plan after 4 years will begin withering Medicare on the vine because after 4 years, Governor Bush's program leaves seniors who need drug coverage at the mercy of HMOs. 
   Under his plan, they don't get a guaranteed benefit package. The premium would be chosen by the HMOs, and the copayment would be chosen by the HMO. The deductible would be chosen by the HMO. The drug you get, again, is chosen by the HMO--not by your doctor, and not by your pharmacist, but by the HMO. 
   Even worse, the Bush plan would leave rural Americans in the cold. About 30 percent of seniors live in areas with no HMOs. In Iowa, we have no Medicare HMOs. There are only eight seniors in the entire State of Iowa who happen to live near Sioux Falls, SD, who belong to a plan with a prescription drug benefit--eight out of the entire State of Iowa. 
   HMOs are dropping like flies out of rural areas. Almost 1 million Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage just this year. 
   Under the Bush plan, first of all, it is not immediate. States would have to enact these plans. The Governors say they don't even want to do it. 
   Under the Bush plan, Medicare would ``wither on the vine.'' Premiums for regular Medicare would increase 25 percent to 47 percent in the first year alone, and seniors would be forced to join HMOs to receive affordable benefits.

   Mr. HARKIN. I know you switched from that to talk about our mutual enemy, Milosevic. But I wanted to, again, thank the Senator for his remarks and his strong support for the Violence Against Women Act. Hopefully, we will get it over here from the House and pass in due course. 
   But I want to ask the Senator this question. The Senator knows the person who heads the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice, the former attorney general of the State of Iowa, Bonnie Campbell. She is the first and only person to head this office in all these years. She has done a great job. I think both sides recognize that. 
   I ask the Senator from Delaware, not only is it important to pass the Violence Against Women Act, to get it reauthorized, but isn't it also equally important to get people on the Federal bench who understand this issue, who have worked on this issue, like Bonnie Campbell, whose nomination is now pending before the Judiciary Committee? 
   I ask the Senator, wouldn't it be a good thing for this country to have someone with Bonnie Campbell's experience and her background and leadership in that office on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals? We have had the hearings. She has been approved. We have had all the hearings. She is supported by the bar association, and by the Iowa Police Association. She has broad-based support from both sides of the aisle. 
   I ask the Senator, wouldn't her confirmation be good for this country? Wouldn't it be good to have someone in the Eighth Circuit like Bonnie Campbell to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act was thoroughly enforced and upheld in our courts?

   I did some further research. Again, I ask the Senator, he has a lot of institutional knowledge. I looked up the circuit court judges in 1992, to find out when they were nominated and when they were confirmed. If we look, here is one who was nominated in January of 1992, confirmed in September. Here is another one, January of 1992, confirmed in February of 1992. We come clear down here, there is one here, Timothy K. Lewis, nominated in September of 1992, hearing in September, confirmed in October, right before the election, nominated by a Republican President.

Mainstream Republicans are asking me that. Editorials are being written in Iowa papers saying the Senate ought to move on this nominee and not hold her up. No, not one person has come up to me and said she is not qualified, not one person. When you were chairman and we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, we had just the opposite of what we have now. Nine circuit court judges were nominated in 1992 who were confirmed the same year.

   Mr. HARKIN. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I had my staff look this up. I did remember Mr. Carnes, who was highly controversial, a very conservative assistant attorney general who was nominated that year, a lot of civil rights groups opposed him 
   because he was considered one of the nation's best attorneys in arguing for the death penalty. There was talk about him being insensitive to civil rights, regarding the death penalty. Even with all of that, we brought him out on the floor and he passed in September of 1992. This was a controversial candidate. But, Bonnie Campbell has bipartisan support. Senator GRASSLEY and I have been calling for a Senate vote on her confirmation. She also has the bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans from my state of Iowa who worked with her when she served as Iowa attorney general.

   Mr. HARKIN. You know what 415 votes says to me? It says that the House has given Bonnie Campbell an A-plus for her job in implementing the provisions of the Violence Against Women's Act, since it became law in 1994. If you had somebody who had done a terrible job and given a bad impression of what the law was about, no, you would not have had 415 votes. It is obvious to all that Bonnie Campbell has run that office in an exemplary fashion, in a professional manner, and has brought honor to the judiciary, to the Department of Justice, and to this law that we passed here. Yet people are falling all over themselves today talking about how the Violence Against Women Act needs to be reauthorized. It makes sense to put someone on the federal bench who understands this important law because she helped write it and implement it.

   Mr. HARKIN. She can help make sure that the law lives, that the Violence Against Women Act is enforced by the courts by being on the Eighth Circuit. Yet she is being held up here. I will tell you, it is not right. I hope when we take up the Violence Against Women Act, which I hope we do shortly, I will have more to say about this sort of split personality that we see here. They say: Yes, we are for the Violence Against Women Act, but, no, don't put a woman on the circuit court who is widely supported, who has headed this office and did it in an exemplary fashion. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation to update and bring America's child labor laws into the 21st century. This much-needed bill is titled the Children's Act for Responsible Employment of 2000 (The CARE Act of 2000). 
   As many of you know, I have been working to eradicate child labor overseas since 1992. At that time, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, which prohibits the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative child labor. Since then, we have made significant progress. 
   Let me cite just three examples. 
   In Bangladesh in 1995, a precedent-setting memorandum of understanding was signed between the garment industry and the International Labor Organization, which has resulted in 9,000 children being moved from factories and into schools. In Pakistan two years later, another memorandum of understanding was signed to the benefit of hundreds of children sewing soccer balls and to the benefit of their families. 
   In May of this year, it was a pleasure to go to the White House to witness President Clinton signing into law new provisions I authored to flatly prohibit the importing into the U.S. of any products made by forced or indentured child labor and to deny duty-free trade benefits to any country that is not meeting its legal obligations to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. 
   It is important to understand that when the growth of a child is stopped, so is the growth of a nation. In keeping with our nation's commitment to human rights, democracy, and economic justice, the United States must continue to lead the struggle against the scourge of exploitative child labor wherever it occurs. But to have the credibility and moral authority to lead this global effort, we must be certain that we are doing all we can to eradicate exploitative child labor here at home. 
   Sadly, this is not the case as I stand here before you today. This is why I am sponsoring this new legislation to crack down on exploitative child labor in America. I am also heartened by the fact that the Clinton administration and the Child Labor Coalition made up of more than 50 organizations all across our country endorse prompt enactment of this bill. 
   Consider the plight of child labor in just one sector of the American economy--large-scale commercial agriculture. 
   Just three months ago in June, Mr. President, an alarming report entitled ``Fingers to the Bone'' was released by Human Rights Watch. It is a deeply troubling indictment of America's failure to protect child farmworkers who pick our fruits and vegetables every day. As many as 800,000 children in the U.S. work on large-scale commercial farms, corporate farms if you will, often under very hazardous conditions that expose them to pesticide poisoning, heat illness, serious injuries, and 
   lifelong disabilities. The sad truth is that despite very difficult and dangerous working conditions, current federal law allows children as young children to take jobs on corporate farms at a younger age, for longer hours, and under more hazardous conditions than children in nonagricultural lines of work. 
   We must end this disgraceful double standard. 
   Furthermore, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), first enacted in 1938, allows children as young as 10 years old to work in the fields of America's corporate farms. In nonagricultural lines of work, children generally must be at least 14 years of age and are limited to three hours of work a day while school is in session. Truth be told, even those laws are inadequately enforced by the U.S. Labor Department where young farmworkers are concerned. The FLSA simply must be revised and improved to protect the health, safety, and education of all children in America. 
   I also want to call to the attention of my colleagues a five-part Associated Press series on child labor in the United States that was published in 1997. It dramatically unmasks the shame of exploitative child labor in our midst. For example, it graphically portrays the exploitation and desperation of 4-year-olds picking chili peppers in New Mexico and 10-year-olds harvesting cucumbers in Ohio. It documents how 14-year-old Alexis Jaimes was crushed to death, while working on a construction site in Texas when a 5,000 pound hammer fell on him. 
   This is outrageous and intolerable. Children should be learning, not risking their health and forfeiting their future in sweatshops. Children should be acquiring computer skills so we don't have to keep importing every-increasing numbers of H-1B visa workers from abroad, as we are being pressured to support now, and not slaving in the fields or street peddling and being short-changed on a solid education. At bottom, children should be afforded their childhood, not treated like chattel or disposable commodities. Not just here in the United States, but in every country in the world. 
   But we cannot expect to curb exploitative child labor overseas unless America leads by example, cracking down on exploitative child labor in our own backyard. 
   There is no national database on children working in America or the injuries they incur. But there is mounting evidence to suggest there is a growing problem with exploitative child labor in America, as underscored by the recently released Human Rights Watch study delivered to all of our offices and an excellent series of investigative reports from the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 
   At least 800,000 children are working in the fields of large-scale commercial agriculture in the U.S. 
   The FLSA's bias against farmworker children amounts to de facto race-based discrimination because an estimated 85 percent of migrant and seasonal farmworkers nationwide are racial minorities. 
   In some regions, including Arizona, approximately 99 percent of farmworkers are Latino. 
   Only 55 percent of the child laborers toiling in the fields will ever graduate from high school. 
   Existing EPA regulations and guidelines offer no more protection from pesticide poisoning for child laborers than they do for adult farmworkers. 
   Every 5 days, a child dies from a work-related accident. 
   Mr. President, one of the great U.S. Senators of the 20th century, Hubert Humphrey, used to remind all of us that the greatness of any society should be measured by how 
   it treats people at the dawn and twilight of life. By that measure, we clearly need to do better by America's children. 
   There is no good reason why children working in large-scale commercial agriculture are legally permitted to work at younger ages, in more hazardous occupations, and for longer periods of time than their peers in other industries. As GAO investigators have noted, a 13-year-old is not allowed under current law to perform clerical work in an air-conditioned office, but the same 13-year-old may be employed to pick strawberries in a field in the heat of summer. 
   And so I offer this legislation in order that we fight exploitative child labor here at home with the same resolve that we confront it in the global economy. This legislation will toughen civil and criminal penalties for willful child labor violators, afford minors working in large-scale commercial agriculture the same rights and protection as those working in nonagricultural jobs, prohibit children under 16 from working in peddling or door-to-door sales, strengthen the authority of the U.S. Secretary of Labor to deal with ``hot goods'' made by child labor in interstate commerce, and improve enforcement of our nation's child labor laws. 
   But it is not my purpose to prevent children from working under any circumstances in America. My focus is on preventing exploitation. Accordingly, this bill also preserves exemptions for children working on family farms as well as selling door-to-door as volunteers for nonprofit organizations like the Girl Scouts of America.  
   In conclusion, I want to remind my colleagues that a child laborer has little chance to get a solid education because he or she spend his or her days at work with little regard for that child's safety and future. But it becomes clearer every day that in order for an individual or a nation to be competitive in the high-tech, globalized economy of the 21st century, a premium must be placed upon educating all children. We can't afford to leave any of our children behind. 
   At the bottom, this is why I am sponsoring this legislation to strengthen our child labor laws here at the home and effectively deter and punish those who exploit our children in the workplace. It is time to bring our nation's child labor laws into modern times, so that we can prepare for the future. 
   It is totally unacceptable to me that upon entering the 21st century, the commercial exploitation of children in the workplace continues in our midst--largely out of sight and out of mind to most Americans. 
   It is time to give all of the children in the U.S. and around the world the chance at a real childhood and extend to them the education necessary to competing in tomorrow's high-road workplace.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for bringing this up, and for his earlier statement on the plight of our small rural hospitals and relief for them. He was talking about the smaller hospitals, but it is really the people in our small towns and communities who need the relief. I thank him for bringing that up. 
   I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I have been on it now for 15 years. I am ranking member on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee I also serve on a number of others--Agriculture, Foreign Operations, and others. 
   I was disturbed, I say to my friend, to read in Congress Daily this morning that Senate Majority Leader LOTT said our failure to pass these two bills yesterday ``increases the possibility of a lame duck session after the November elections.'' He told reporters: I always thought that was a possibility anyway. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman STEVENS told reporters: In my opinion, now we are ready for a postelection session. We just don't have time to get 11 bills through in 9 days. 
   I say to my friend from Minnesota, we have been here for 9 months, haven't we? What have we been doing? What has happened to the 9 months? We've done nothing. Eleven out of thirteen appropriations bills have not been passed--11. Here is what's going on: The Republicans in charge don't want to vote on a Patients' Bill of Rights. They don't want to vote on it. They don't want to vote on prescription drugs for the elderly. They don't want to vote on increasing the minimum wage. What do they want to do? Put it off until after the election, have a lame duck session. 
   I don't understand how this complies with what our responsibilities are, what the people elected us for, what we get paid to do around here. That is, to  enact legislation, to take the tough votes. 
   They don't want to do that. They want to put it off until after the election, for a lame duck session. What kind of sense does that make? What kind of a statement does that make to the people of this country? Nine months we have been here. This morning we are doing nothing. The Chamber is empty. Yet we could be bringing these bills on the floor right now. We are doing nothing around here. 
   I ask my friend from Minnesota, who gains the most from the lame duck session? Who gains the most by not having the votes now, but putting them off until after the election? HMOs, the gun lobby, the big drug companies. I bet they are just as happy as they can be after reading this morning that a lame duck session is likely because they know they can come in and control a lame duck. 
   I meant to engage in a colloquy with my friend from Minnesota, but I am so disturbed by this, I think this needs a complete airing.

   Mr. HARKIN. And we had the juvenile justice bill that included the school safety provision, the child safety gun locks and included a fix to close the gunshow loophole. Why are they only willing to vote on this important legislation after the election? 
   We have been denied--I don't want to say the Senator from Minnesota and I have been denied; the people of this country have been denied the right to have their Senators come on this floor and vote on these issues, denied because the majority leader won't bring it up. That is why they keep putting these conference committee bills together. They now want to put together the Commerce-State-Justice bill. I wanted to offer an amendment to restore funding to the Byrne grants for local law enforcement. The Byrne grant is $100 million short from last year's funding level. But I'm not allowed to do that because they want to skip the process and attach to another bill. 
   The VA-HUD and Transportation--again, we haven't voted on VA and HUD. Do you want to know why? Because we want to do something about veterans' health benefits. They want to vote on that after the election, too. They don't want the veterans of this country to know exactly how they vote on veterans' health benefits, I say to my friend.

Speaker Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, at the beginning of this year promised we would have all of the appropriations bills to the President before the August recess. We are at the end of September and we have only 2 out of 13 through. 
   I say to my friend from Minnesota, this is the first time--and I know how much he cares about education--this is the first time since 1965, when we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that we have failed to reauthorize. Because of time? No, we had plenty of time. Look at the Chamber this morning. The Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from Iowa are here. We are doing nothing out here.

   Let's take them up. Let's have a debate. Don't let anybody say with a straight face or with any credibility that it's the Democrats holding things up. Let's get to the bills. Let's get them done. Let's offer the amendments and move it along.  
   We are ready to debate. We are ready to offer amendments. We are ready to move the process--but we are denied. And again I say, the people of this country are denied the opportunity to have us vote on these measures.

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, it seems to me what we are facing is that the majority party, in charge of the Senate, in charge of the House, they want to replace the tough votes we have to take around here, that we should be taking around here--they want to replace the tough votes with slick 30-second TV ads to try to get through this election. That is breaking down, I think, the people's respect for the Senate. 
   How can you have respect for an institution when we don't get anything done around here? When we say the only time we want to take up the tough issues is after the election, when there will be people here voting on these issues who may have been defeated or maybe not running again, what kind of responsibility, I ask the Senator from Minnesota, is that? We are shirking our responsibility. I hear more and more people saying they are getting dismayed with how the Congress is operating. People ought to be dismayed with the way this place is running right now. We are shirking our responsibilities around here in this regard. 
   As I said, I have been on this Appropriations Committee for 15 years. I have been in the Senate for 15 years. I say to my friend from Minnesota, this is the most do-nothing Congress, the most do-nothing Senate I have seen in 15 years. It is really sad. 
   The Senator talked about visiting schools. I spent all my summer going around visiting elderly people in the State of Iowa and getting story after story about their costs of prescription drugs.

   Mr. HARKIN. It is not something they need help with 10 years from now. They need it now. That is why we need to bring that legislation out here and vote on prescription drugs, helping those people out. But we are precluded from doing so. I am hopeful perhaps--maybe we ought to start, I say to my friend from 
   Minnesota, maybe we ought to start asking unanimous consent to bring some of these bills out here. Let's bring them up. Let's see if the majority party will object to bringing up the bills on prescription drugs, on the juvenile justice bill, on minimum wage, Patients' Bill of Rights, Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Let's spend the next 9 days or whatever we have working on some of this legislation.

I am sure there is some history around here about what a lame duck session means, where that name came from. But it seems to me that a lame duck is a sick duck by definition. We don't need a sick duck around here doing the people's business. We don't need a lame duck session around here to be taking these tough votes. We ought to be standing up and doing it right now, not waiting for a sick duck to do it.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand another disturbing event has happened this morning. I am informed that the Senate Judiciary Committee has met this morning and has refused to report out any more judges--refused to do so; just stopped. Again, this flies in the face of what our responsibilities are supposed to be around here. If someone doesn't like a person, or they don't think they are qualified--I should not say ``doesn't like''--if they don't think they are qualified to assume a judgeship, let them vote against that person. But that doesn't give them a reason to hold someone up in committee. 
   I am speaking specifically of my Iowa constituent, Bonnie Campbell, former attorney general with the State of Iowa who is now pending in the Judiciary Committee for a vacancy on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-2-20000921</DOCNO>

   Mr. HARKIN. Exactly; the Senator is exactly correct. Bonnie Campbell has, for the last 4 years, directed the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice. I can't find one person on either side of the aisle who says she hasn't done a superb job. 
   She has received accolades from all over this country about guiding and directing that office. She is widely supported by the American Bar Association, by people on both sides of the aisle, the party in her home State of Iowa who know the kind of outstanding person she is, how bright she is, how capable she is, what a great job she did as attorney general in the State of Iowa, and now in the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice. 
   People on both sides of the aisle support her nomination, and yet the Senate Judiciary Committee refuses to report her out of committee. She has had her hearing. That has all been taken care of. All the paperwork is done. She has answered all the questions. 
   I say to the Judiciary Committee: Report her nomination out. If for some reason you think she is unqualified--I cannot imagine why--then you can cast your vote, but at least let's bring the nominee to the floor. 
   There are 22 vacancies on the appeals court. That is nearly half the emergency vacancies in the Federal court system. With the growing number of vacancies in the Federal courts, these positions should be filled as soon as possible with qualified people. Yet the Judiciary Committee refuses to move. 
   Ms. Campbell received a hearing this summer. She would serve this position on the Eighth Circuit with honor, fairness, and distinction. She has the solid support from me and my Iowa colleague, Senator GRASSLEY. Her nomination should be sent to the Senate floor. 
   Bonnie Campbell has had a long history in law, starting in 1984 with her private practice in Des Moines where she worked on cases involving medical malpractice, employment discrimination, personal injury, real estate, family law--a broadly based legal practice. She was then elected attorney general of Iowa in 1990, the first woman to hold that office in our State. She managed an office of 200 people, including 120 attorneys, again, handling a wide variety of criminal and civil matters for State agencies and officers. As attorney general, she gained high marks from all ends of the political spectrum as someone who was committed to enforcing the law, reducing crime, and protecting our consumers. 
   In 1995, she was appointed director of the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice. In that position, she has played a critical role in the implementation of the violence against women provisions of the 1994 Crime Act. Again, she has won the respect from a wide range of interests with different points of views on this issue. She has been and is today responsible for the overall coordination and agenda of the Department of Justice efforts to combat violence against women.  
   I have known Bonnie Campbell for many years. She is a person of unquestioned integrity, keen intellect, and outstanding judgment. She has a great sense of fairness and evenhandedness. These qualities and her significant experience make her an ideal candidate for this circuit court position. Her nomination has been strongly supported by many of her colleagues, including the present Iowa attorney general, the president of the Iowa State Police Association and, of course, the American Bar Association. 
   Finally, we need a judicial system that reflects the diversity of this Nation. We need more women and people of color on the bench. Only 20 percent of all federal judge position in the country are filled by women, according to the Justice Department. 
   We have a backlog of judicial vacancies. It is only fair to move them, and we ought to move all of them out, especially Bonnie Campbell. She has had her hearing. Her nomination is sitting in the Judiciary Committee. If the reports I just heard are correct, the Judiciary Committee is stonewalling, refusing to move her name out to the floor of the Senate. 
   As I said earlier, this is another indication of how the leadership in this Senate is shirking its responsibilities to the people of this country--to put it off, delay, stonewall, don't do 
   anything--when we have a crying need to fill these vacancies. 
   I am very dismayed. I had talked with the majority leader and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and others about this. And, Senator GRASSLEY and I had remained hopeful that her name would be reported out so the Senate could act on it, but it seems we have been led astray, that it is the intention of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to lock up this nomination and not report out Bonnie Campbell. 
   The women of this country ought to know that. The women of this country ought to know that a uniquely qualified, eminently qualified individual to take a vacant position on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals is being denied by the Judiciary Committee her right to have a vote. Is that what the Judiciary Committee is telling the women of this country--that they need to take a back seat, that they will not act on these judicial nominees if you are a woman, qualified as Bonnie Campbell is? 
   I am very upset about this. I had in good faith been reluctant to exercise my rights as a Senator to in any way inhibit or do anything that would stop the flow of legislation or anything on the Senate floor because I had, I guess mistakenly, been of the opinion, or at least advised, if we just waited a due length of time, Bonnie Campbell's name would be reported out. Again, I think I was obviously mistaken, that my faith--my good faith--was not responded to in kind. 
   This is not right. It is not right to treat a person like this. It is not right to block someone who has had their hearing and is widely supported on both sides of the aisle. It might be a different story if there were a lot of controversy about Bonnie Campbell, but there is none. As I said, Senator GRASSLEY, a conservative Republican, is openly supporting her. Republicans in my State have been supportive of her getting on the Eighth Circuit. 
   This is, I think, a black mark on the operations of the Senate, another indication of how the leadership of this Senate refuses to do the people's business, to let things come out on the floor so we can vote up or down. Bonnie Campbell is being denied her right, I believe, as a citizen of this country to have her nomination acted upon by the full Senate, and it is a bad mark on the Senate. 
   I am hopeful the Judiciary Committee will reconsider its action--rather, its inaction. The Judiciary Committee can meet tomorrow, they can meet Monday, they can meet any day the chairman wants them to meet and report out this nominee. I was under the impression that was going to happen today, but obviously I had the wrong impression of what the Senate Judiciary Committee was going to do. 
   I urge the chairman to convene the Judiciary Committee and report Bonnie Campbell's name out before this session is over. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate has just voted on one of the most significant and controversial bills of this Congress. I would like to take this opportunity to share my views on the issues involved and explain the process I went through in making my decision on how to vote on providing normal trade relations status to China. 
   I thought about this matter a great deal and examined the issues very carefully. I listened to the arguments made by my colleagues in this Chamber and to the intense public debate over the past months. Just this last month, along with my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG, I visited China. It was the first time I had been back since 1981. We were able to gain some valuable insights into the questions before us. 
   Having listened to the debate on China PNTR, especially in the media, one may have gotten the idea that this is a clear-cut question. If you listened to the proponents, you would think PNTR is a magic elixir for the American economy. If you listened to the opponents, you would think PNTR spells utter disaster. 
   After thoroughly looking into this matter, I concluded the claims of both sides were exaggerated. Passing PNTR was not a slam-dunk or a no-brainer, but neither was it a sellout or a surrender on the critical problems we face with China. It was a matter of judging how the scales tipped: not which side was absolutely correct but which of the alternatives seemed, on balance, the best course to take. This was not an easy decision for me. However, I believe the balance did tip, although not overwhelmingly, in favor of passing this legislation granting China normal trade relations status. 
   I would like to discuss briefly what the vote was really about and why I voted for PNTR. 
   We had a good deal of discussion over the past several days on the details and implications of this legislation and on the agreement between the United States and China regarding China joining the WTO. There is no need for me to spend any time going over that again. It is important, though, to be clear on what the vote was really about. 
   The vote on PNTR was not about whether China is going to join the WTO; China will. Nothing Congress can say, one way or the other, will make one bit of difference. 
   This vote on PNTR was really about whether the United States will benefit from the WTO's trade rules and enforcement procedures which hold China accountable to negotiated trade agreements. If we did not grant PNTR to China, other nations, our competitors, would be able to take advantage of WTO trade rules and enforcement procedures but we would not. 
   Why is that so? Because the WTO rules state that if we want the WTO to help us enforce fair trade rules, then we cannot treat one WTO member differently from another. We have to provide China the same continuous normal trade status we provide other WTO members. We cannot single out China for an annual review of normal trade status and still hold China to WTO rules and enforcement. 
   So that is what this debate really boiled down to--whether we should continue our annual review of normal trade relations with China or grant permanent normal trade relations; that is, would we gain more from a new trade relationship with China than we would lose by ending our annual review? 
   I firmly believe that the more we can do to bring China's behavior under the rule of law, the better off we are, the better off the Chinese people will be, and the better off the rest of the world will be. That includes our ability to use the WTO to settle trade disputes involving China. 
   Now, to be sure, we have had frustrations in the WTO dispute settlement  process. It is far from perfect. But overall it is in our best interests to have a multilateral means to settle trade disputes with China according to the rule of law instead of trying to go it alone. That approach clearly has not been effective. 
   U.S. trade negotiators did obtain substantial concessions from China in exchange for WTO membership. These concessions promise to lower tariffs, reduce trade barriers, and create new opportunities for selling U.S. goods and services in China. At the same time, the United States does not have to provide any new access to our markets. So the agreement should benefit U.S. workers, farmers, businesses, and our economy in general. 
   But let's be realistic. The November 1999 agreement is far from overwhelmingly. It only requires China to go part of the way toward really opening up its borders and its markets. As my colleague from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN, has repeatedly pointed out, even under the agreement, China's markets will be far less open than ours. 
   For example, according to the Congressional Research Service, the average U.S. tariff on all goods coming into the United States from China is 4.2 percent. That is the average U.S. tariff on all goods coming from China to the United States --4.2 percent. But after this agreement goes into effect, China's average tariff on U.S. industrial goods will be 9.4 percent, over twice as much. For agricultural products, China will only reduce its tariffs from an average of 22 percent to 17 percent. U.S. agricultural tariffs are only 6 percent on average, one-third those of China. 
   Or take automobiles. The U.S. tariff on autos is 2.5 percent. Under this agreement, China will have a 25-percent tariff on U.S. autos--10 times higher than ours. 
   I realize tariff rates are not the whole story and that China agreed to substantial opening of its markets. However, I am skeptical that our negotiators obtained as much as they could have. The United States had a lot of leverage in these negotiations. China needs our consent to join the WTO. And China had a lot at stake. The United States is the world's largest economy. We import nearly $100 billion from China. We run over an $80 billion trade deficit with China. 
   They need access to our market. Our negotiators should have used our leverage and China's needs to get a better deal on the core trade issues and on other issues involving human rights, workers' rights, and the environment. That our negotiators did not get better tariff reductions and better agreements on worker and human rights I believe is a deeply regrettable missed opportunity. I believe our negotiators were simply in too much of a rush to get this deal done rather than address those core issues. 
   In particular, let's be realistic about the benefits of PNTR for American agriculture. Some of the rhetoric I have heard regarding agriculture is wildly optimistic. We have heard that U.S. farmers will soon be feeding over a billion Chinese--a virtually unlimited market. The truth is, these claims are overstated. 
   Farmers are ill served by the myth that China is a boon market just waiting to buy up large quantities of farm commodities and food products. China is strongly determined to remain largely self-sufficient in food production, and it is adopting technology and following policies to meet that objective. 
   For example, I visited a hog farm in China in 1981, and I visited one again last month. In 1981, the hogs and their management did not even compare to those here in America. The changes I saw this August were dramatic. The hogs I saw in August were every bit as lean as ours. Their sows are having litters of 12 to 14 pigs. They are saving 90 percent of them. Their cost of production is low because wages are low. And the Government owns all the land. 
   I discussed the potential for agricultural trade with the Vice Minister of Agriculture and other Chinese officials. They made it clear they do not expect to buy much corn or pork from the United States. In fact, they are planning to increase their exports of corn. They exported corn last year. But they did believe there would be somewhat of an increasing market in China for U.S. beef and citrus as well as some pork organ meats and similar such products. 
   Certainly there will be opportunities for U.S. farmers and U.S. food and agribusiness companies, but, again, we have to be realistic. 
   While I strongly believe we should sell as much food to China as we can, it is irresponsible to give farmers false hope that China is going to reverse the current depression in commodity prices or bail out the failed Freedom to Farm policy. More than irresponsible, it is just plain wrong. 
   That isn't just my own opinion. In Doane's Agricultural Report in August, Dr. Robert Wisner, a professor of agriculture economics at Iowa State University, who spent 3 1/2 weeks in China in June assessed the prospects for food and agricultural trade with China. He wrote:  
   For the longer term we can be cautiously optimistic about U.S. soybean and soybean product exports to China. But optimism about U.S. corn, wheat and livestock product exports should be more tempered. * * * * * 
   While the jury is still out on the question Who will feed China? the Chinese answer is, ``China will feed China!''  
   I will add, in fact, they already do. 
   I now want to discuss the importance of human rights in our consideration of PNTR. As I see it, a key issue in PNTR is whether in relinquishing our annual review, the U.S. will lose important leverage that could be used to change China's behavior on human rights, workers rights, and child labor. Let us first be honest about this. China has a long way to go on religious freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of expression and association, political rights and the rights of workers. The China section of the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights for this year and for several years running are absolutely appalling. But I don't have to rely on that report. As I said, I visited China last month. 
   True, the human rights situation in many parts of China is not as bad as when I first visited in 1981. I could see some improvements, especially in the large cities. But the fact is, the state of human rights in China is still unacceptable. While in Hong Kong, we learned of a lawyer who was arrested and thrown in jail. His offense: He had set up a small table outside a factory to advise workers of their rights under Chinese law. To the best of my knowledge, he is still languishing in prison today. 
   There is also the case of the young man, Ngawang Choepel, who studied music in the U.S. at Middlebury College in Vermont. He was arrested by the Chinese authorities several years ago while studying music in Tibet and charged with espionage and counterrevolutionary sedition. I was told this young man was convicted of spying for the Dalai Lama. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. 
   I responded to the Chinese that this was a ridiculous charge. But even if it were true, I asked them, how many tanks does the Dalai Lama have; how many troops does he command; how many ships does he own? To me, this was a strong indication of the weak foundation upon which the Chinese political system rests. 
   We also know that forced labor and prison labor still exist in China. I had been told by both Chinese and U.S. Government officials that there are no serious child labor problems in China. But now, after meeting with reputable worker and human rights organizations in Hong Kong, I know there are certainly serious child labor problems inside China. Estimates indicate China has from 10 to 40 million child laborers. When we left Shanghai and went to Hong Kong, the very next day after we 
   were told by both U.S. authorities and Chinese authorities that child labor was not a very serious problem, this was the headline in the Sunday Morning Post, August 27, 2000, Hong Kong: ``Children Toil in Sweatshop.'' 
   This was in an area north of Hong Kong, mainland China, where kids as young as 12 years old were working making toys. This is again a part of the article: ``Childhood Lost to Hard Labor.'' 
   Also from the article:  
   Lax age checks open door to underage workers at Shenzhen factory producing toys for fast food chain.  
   They were producing toys for a company and that company was selling its toys to McDonald's. McDonald's gives these toys away, when you buy a Happy Meal for your kids. It is the kids who are making the toys. Yet we are  told that there are no serious child labor problems in China. Here was photographic proof, reporting proof that only a few miles across the border from Hong Kong, we had child laborers toiling to make these toys, working 16 hours a day and more. 
   This is a quotation from the story:  
   The youngsters admit they lie about their ages to get jobs in the factory, where workers estimate up to 20 percent of the employees are under the legal age of 16. But they say only rudimentary checks are done on their ID cards by the factory to make sure they are old enough to work. Asia Monitor Resource Centre, a labor monitoring body, said it was common for people to use fake ID cards to get work. Child labor is a common problem in China. It exists in rural small farms and big factories run by transnational enterprises.  
   Again, we do have the problem of child labor and prison labor, forced labor in China. So, clearly, there are serious human rights problems in China that cannot be denied or swept under the rug. But they raise the questions: What are the best ways to address those problems and to bring about real progress on human rights in China? And how should human rights considerations affect our decision on PNTR? 
   Before I go into these questions, I will take a moment to emphasize my long and strong commitment to human rights. My record speaks for itself. I have been working on human rights issues since I first took office in the House of Representatives 25 years ago and as a private citizen before then. In fact, the first legislation I authored in the House in 1975 resulted in the enactment of section 116(d) prohibiting U.S. foreign assistance to the government of any country which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. 
   I have worked to end child labor and prison labor and religious persecution in the former Soviet Union, Haiti, Central America, Chile, East Timor, India, and other nations. I have worked very hard to free political prisoners and to end political violence. 
   What have I learned from all these years? Frankly, I have learned there is no standard cut-and-dried approach when it comes to advancing human rights. Of course, there are established minimum standards for human rights, as outlined in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, which China has signed. 
   I am not talking about weakening those standards, never. But there is no set formula for achieving observance of the standards. We must tailor our methods to the particular situation and the particular society. 
   In the case of China, I am convinced that granting PNTR 
   will not hinder our efforts to improve human rights there. I believe, in fact, it will actually help us in that endeavor. 
   Some have claimed that passing PNTR will cause us to lose our leverage on human rights. The simple fact is, we have never effectively used the annual trade status review to influence human rights in China, and it is highly unlikely we would do so in the future. Annual renewal of normal trade status has become almost perfunctory. Even in the wake of Tiananmen Square, President Bush renewed China's normal trade status and Congress did not reverse that decision. 
   As I said, I believe passing PNTR and creating a U.S.-China relationship in the WTO should actually help to improve human rights in China. How much? It is far too early to tell. However, based on my examination of the issues and my experience in China, I concluded that the best way to move China forward is to be engaged with China. And in order to be fully engaged with China, we had to grant PNTR. 
   The simple fact is, we cannot simply wall China off. When I visited the Great Wall in China this summer, it reminded me how impossible such an effort would be. China could not be walled off centuries ago, and it cannot be walled off today. 
   Trade and economic ties alone, however, will never magically transform China's human rights policies. But I can tell you, there is a big crack in China's great wall against human rights reform. One day before long, that wall, too, will come down. Look at recent developments in China. There has been a huge influx of new products and services, but more importantly, the people of China are being exposed to new ideas and new influences regarding human rights, political rights, and religious freedom. 
   Now we have the Internet. I can say one thing I learned in China. The Chinese Government may be able to censor TV and to censor the radio and the newspapers, but no matter how hard they try, they will not be able to control or censor the Internet. Nearly every single person Senator LAUTENBERG and I talked with in China told us that we should support PNTR. We even met with dissidents and human rights activists in Hong Kong, people under no coercion from the Chinese Government, who had fled China, who can't even go back to China, who urged us to support PNTR. They said that anything that helps to open up China, that brings in people and ideas, is helpful. 
   Throughout my over 25 years in working on human rights, I have seen that they are right. We must expose countries to the influence of the rest of the world if we want them to change their policy on human rights.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk about an important issue--the critical need for Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act or VAWA. It has strong bipartisan support and it should be passed before the end of this session. 
   I was a proud cosponsor of this bill when it passed in 1994 and I am an original cosponsor of the reauthorization bill. This is a law that has helped hundreds of thousands of women and children in Iowa and across the nation. It has directed millions of federal dollars in grants to local law enforcement, prosecution and victim services. 
   Iowa has received more than $8 million in grants through VAWA. These grants fund the Iowa Domestic Violence Hotline. They help keep the doors open at domestic violence shelters, like the Family Violence Center in Des Moines. 
   VAWA grants to Iowa have provided services to more than 2,000 sexual assault victims just this year. And more than 20,559 Iowa students this year have received information about rape prevention through this federal funding. 
   The numbers show that VAWA is working. A recent Justice report found that intimate partner violence against women decreased by 21 percent from 1993 to 1998. This is strong evidence that state and community efforts are working. 
   But VAWA must be reauthorized to allow these efforts to continue without having to worry that this funding will be lost from year to year. 
   Congress should not turn its back on America's women and children. Reauthorization should be a priority. So, I urge my colleagues and the leadership to pass this legislation this session.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an important amendment and one that deserves careful consideration and debate by the Senate. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG and I just returned from China last weekend. I'll have a great deal more to say about our trip and its impact on my thoughts about our relationships with China later. But I do want to speak briefly to our efforts in China as they related to prison labor and directly to this amendment. 
   As my friend and colleague from Minnesota has pointed out, the U.S. and China entered into an official agreement on prison labor in 1992. Its intent is to prevent the importation of goods into our country made by prison labor in China--a practice made illegal here under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. 
   The agreement is officially titled the ``Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China on Prohibiting Import and Export Trade in Prison Labor Products.'' It was signed on August 7, 1992. 
   Let me read some of the key components. Under the terms of the agreement the United States and China agree to:  
   Promptly investigate companies, enterprises or units suspected of violating relevant regulations and will immediately report results. 
   Upon the request of one Party, meet to exchange information on the enforcement of relevant laws. 
   Will furnish the other Party available evidence and information regarding suspected violations. 
   Promptly arrange and facilitate visits by responsible officials to its respective enterprises or units.  
   In March of 1994 we entered into an accompanying statement of cooperation on the implementation of the MOU. This statement fleshes out the details of how our two governments were to carry out the agreement. 
   This is an important agreement. It aims to assure that U.S. workers aren't forced to compete with hundreds of prison labor factories in China. Factories that are filled at least partially with prisoners whose only crime is seeking democracy or formation of a true labor union. Prisoners who are held in so-called ``re-education facilities'' for up to 3 years without trials. 
   Unfortunateley, China's compliance with this agreement has been dismal. From 1992 to 1997 there were joint inspections, but usually only after great effort on our part and often only after long delays--not within 60 days of request as required under the MOU. 
   But since 1997 China has stopped all compliance with the agreement. They have denied all requests by our U.S. Customs to inspect prison labor facilities suspected of exporting products to the United States. 
   Let me read a portion of one of the recent letters sent by U.S. Customs to Chinese officials. 
   So when Senator LAUTENBERG and I went to China, we asked to accompany Chinese officials and our U.S. Customs officials on a visit to one of these 8 sites previously requested by Customs. 
   We raised this at every level. We first raised it prior to our visit with the Chinese Embassy here in Washington. Then we raised it with the Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, then we raised it with Vice Premier Quian QiChen. 
   We raised our concerns about the failure to abide by the MOU and asked that we be allowed to go along on a visit to see for ourselves that the Tariff Act of 1930 is not being violated. 
   At first we ran into a brick wall. We were simply told ``no.'' Then we were told they misunderstood our request. 
   Then they said it was very complicated and would take more time. 
   Then we had a breakthrough. 
   They refused to let Senator LAUTENBERG and I go on a visit to one of these facilities, but they have agreed to renew their compliance with the MOU. We got that assurance personally from Premier Zhu Ronji. 
   We got word last Friday--inspections resumed at one site. 
   So the first renewed inspection was completed Friday. Now we all see if the Chinese are serious about complying with this agreement. Their track record clearly does not inspire confidence. That is why I am supporting the Wellstone amendment. It would add to our leverage to ensure long-term compliance with this important agreement. 
   So I urge a vote for this amendment and commend Senator WELLSTONE for bringing it forward. 
   As I mentioned earlier, I will have a good deal more to say about my trip to China and on the underling PNTR legislation as the debate continues. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the memoranda of understanding and a letter to Wang Lixian in the RECORD.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to talk today about the need to move through a number of important judicial nominations. This process has been dragging on for too long. 
   Pending before the Judiciary Committee are dozens of federal appeals court nominations, including that of my Iowa constituent, Bonnie J. Campbell for the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. 
   There are 22 vacancies in our federal appeals courts. With the growing number of vacancies in the federal courts, these positions should be filled with qualified individuals as soon as possible. And so I urge the Republican leadership to take the steps necessary to allow the full Senate to vote up or down on these important nominations. 
   Ms. Campbell, who received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee in June, would serve on the 8th Circuit with honor, fairness, and distinction. 
   Bonnie Campbell has a long and distinguished history in the field of law. She began her career as a private practice lawyer in Des Moines in 1984. She worked on cases involving medical malpractice, employment discrimination, personal injury, real estate, and family law. 
   She was elected as Iowa's Attorney General in 1990--the first woman ever to hold that office in Iowa. During her tenure, she received high praise from both ends of the political spectrum for her outstanding work enforcing the law, reducing crime, and protecting consumers. 
   In 1995, she was appointed as the Director of the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice. In that position, she played a critical role in implementing the Violence Against Women provisions of the 1994 Crime Act. 
   Again, she won the respect of individuals with a wide range of views on this issue. She has been, and still remains, responsible for the overall coordination and agenda of the Department of Justice's efforts to combat violence against women. 
   Mr. President, I've known Bonnie Campbell for many years. She is a person of unparalleled integrity, keen intellect, and outstanding judgment. She is fair, level-headed, and even-handed. 
   These qualities, and her significant experience, make her an ideal candidate for this important position. 
   Her nomination has been strongly supported by many of her colleagues, including the current Iowa Attorney General and the President of the Iowa State Police Association. Her nomination has also been approved by the American Bar Association. And Bonnie Campbell has the solid support of both myself and my Iowa colleague, Senator GRASSLEY. 
   Mr. President, I view the Senate's ``advise and consent'' responsibility on judicial nominations in the Senate to be on par with our annual responsibility to move appropriations bills. And, as such, the Senate's schedule between now and adjournment should be adjusted to assure adequate time for their consideration. 
   We have the time if we have the will. 
   Again, Mr. President, we have a backlog of judicial vacancies, and it is only fair to push them through as soon as possible. I urge the leadership and the Committee to move them, including Bonnie Campbell, with all due speed. The American people and the people of Iowa's Eighth Circuit are ill-served by these vacancies.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the so-called NIF. I will use that acronym. 
   The National Ignition Facility is a massive research facility being built at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Labs in California. NIF supposedly--I use that word ``supposedly''--was a part of the Stockpile Stewardship Program which is supposed to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal without exploding any nuclear weapons. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, this is a deeply troubled program. The General Accounting Office recently issued a report that detailed management turmoil, cost overruns, slipping schedules, and unsolved technical problems. I am deeply concerned that we will pour more and more money into NIF, money that could be used for other scientific purposes. NIF appears to be mostly a jobs program for nuclear weapons scientists. That is the point. 
   Let me review the history of the cost projections for the National Ignition Facility. In 1990, a National Academy of Sciences panel estimated we could achieve ignition with a $400 million facility. They called it a reasonable cost. Then it went up to $677 million in 1993. Then it went up to $2.1 billion this past June for construction costs and another $1.1 billion for operation before it is completed. Then in August, the GAO found that the Department of Energy has still neglected to include the cost of targets and other parts of the program. They have now suggested a total cost of close to $4 billion. It is going up all the time. We were up to $4 billion in August. Outside experts, adding in operation costs for another 25 years, the uncertainties because research and development are underway, estimate the life-cycle costs are now somewhere upwards of about $10 billion and counting. This is not a reasonable cost; it is a massive public boondoggle. 
   I will say that at this point--and I will say it again and again until we finally resolve this issue of the National Ignition Facility--if you liked the Clinch River breeder reactor that we debated here almost 20 years ago, that we poured billions of dollars into before we finally got rid of it, if you liked the Clinch River breeder reactor, you will love this program. If you liked the Superconducting Super Collider, you would like this program. 
   Under Clinch River, we spent $1.5 billion before we finally killed it. It was projected to cost $3.5 billion. We thought that was outlandish. On the Superconducting Super Collider, we spent $2.2 billion. It was estimated to cost over $11 billion. We heard all the arguments; I remember them well. I was involved in both debates on Clinch River and on the Superconducting Super Collider: We have spent all that money; we are just going to let it go to waste. 
   We heard those arguments over and over again: Once we put that money in, we have to complete it. 
   I ask you, are we worse off as a country now because we did not build the Clinch River breeder reactor; we came to our senses in time? Are we worse off as a country because we came to our senses in time and did not complete the Superconducting Super Collider? Not at all. We are better off because we saved the money. Now we are down to the National Ignition Facility, another one of the big boondoggles of all time. 
   We have spent about $800 million, give or take a few. It is estimated to cost about $4 billion--slightly more than the Clinch River breeder reactor--and counting, as I said. Four 
   billion is just one of the most recent estimates. It is going to be more than that. Yet we are hearing: Well, we have spent the $800 million; we ought to keep spending the money. 
   As this National Ignition Facility continues, keep in mind the Clinch  River breeder reactor, keep in mind the Superconducting Super Collider. Ask yourselves if we didn't do the right thing by stopping those at the time and saving our taxpayers money. 
   We have had a lot of problems with NIF. They have repeatedly tried to hide the true costs of the project. In fact, DOE and lab officials told GAO that they deliberately set an unrealistically low initial budget because they feared Congress would not fund a realistic one. 
   This is directly from the GAO report:  
   DOE and Laboratory officials associated with NIF told us that they recognized it would cost more than planned, but that they accepted this unrealistic budget in the belief that Congress would not fund NIF at a higher cost.......  
   They lied to us. They simply lied to us. They admitted it to GAO. Now they want more money. Is this what we reward? Is this the kind of good stewardship we reward? 
   We had an independent review last year that was supposed to come to Congress. The lab and DOE officials edited it before we got it. They have hidden problems from DOE. When Secretary Richardson praised the project out at Livermore last year, he proclaimed it on cost and on schedule. But the lab officials knew it was actually over budget and far behind. They had known it for months. They simply just did not tell the Secretary of Energy. 
   So what is this NIF? Why is it necessary? NIF is a stadium-sized building in which they plan to place 192 lasers all pointed at one very small BB-sized, even smaller pellet. When all these lasers fire at one time, it is going to create a lot of heat, a lot of pressure, hopefully, as they say, to create nuclear fusion. These weapons scientists hope they will achieve ignition; that is, to get more energy from the fusion than they put in with the lasers. 
   The stated purposes of NIF: One, to simulate conditions in exploding nuclear weapons; two, to maintain a pool of nuclear weapon scientists at Livermore; and three, to conduct basic research towards fusion energy. 
   Let me take the last one first. In the House I was on the Science and Technology Committee for 10 years. We had a lot of dealings with Lawrence Livermore at that time on something called Shiva, a big laser project. It cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. They were going to prove they could develop inertial confinement laser fusion energy. We spent a lot of money on it. It is now on the scrap heap someplace. We wasted a lot of money on that project, too. 
   Again, let me talk about the stockpile stewardship. It may be true that NIF would provide useful data for simulating nuclear weapons explosions. But we don't need that data to maintain the nuclear arsenal we have today. For decades, we have assured the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons with a careful engineering program. 
   First of all, all the weapons we have in our stockpile were tested in more than 1,000 nuclear tests prior to the ban on nuclear explosions--1,000 of them. Secondly, in addition, every year, 11 weapons of each type are removed from the stockpile, taken apart, disassembled, and the components are carefully examined and tested for any signs of aging or other problems. All of the components can be tested, short of creating an actual nuclear explosion. If any problems are found, components can be remanufactured to original specifications. 
   So far, the evidence indicates that the weapons are not noticeably aging. These activities we have underway right now are low cost. Yet they provide a secure and tested way of maintaining our present nuclear stockpile. We don't need a $4 billion facility at Lawrence Livermore to do what we are doing right now. We can and will continue these surveillance activities of our stockpile. 
   The kind of detailed information on nuclear explosions that NIF could provide is needed only to modify weapons or design new ones. But we don't need to design any new nuclear weapons. Indeed, the more changes we make, the further we will move from the nuclear tests we have conducted and the less confident we can be that our nuclear weapons will work as intended. 
   In short, we have conducted over 1,000 nuclear explosions and tests. We have designed, redesigned, compacted, made smaller specifically designed nuclear weapons. We don't need the NIF for any more design, but that is what they intend to do with it. That is why scientists of widely divergent views on other issues agree we do not need NIF for stockpile stewardship. 
   Edward Teller, known as the father of the hydrogen bomb, when asked what role NIF would have in maintaining the nuclear stockpile, replied, ``None whatsoever.'' 
   Robert Puerifoy, former vice president of Sandia Lab, said, ``NIF is worthless ..... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period.'' 
   Seymour Sack, a former weapons scientist at Livermore, called NIF ``worse than worthless'' for stockpile stewardship. 
   Again, the NIF facility also cannot be justified for basic science or fusion energy research. About 85 percent of the planned experiments are for nuclear weapons physics. Most of the remainder are on nuclear weapons effects. So there is precious little left for any kind of basic or applied sciences. 
   What we are left with is a $4 billion full employment program for a few nuclear weapons scientists. We can do better than that. We certainly do need to maintain some nuclear weapons expertise as long as we maintain nuclear weapons. As I have said, there is a better way and a cheaper way than spending billions of dollars on construction contracts. It makes absolutely no sense to spend these billions when we have a well-settled, time-tested, proven way of making sure our nuclear stockpile is safe and is workable. 
   So not only is NIF not needed for this stockpile stewardship, but as the cost of this facility continues to escalate, it is going to steal funding from other stockpile 
   stewardship activities. Just as we found that the Superconducting Super Collider was going to steal from other basic physics research, and as we found the Clinch River breeder reactor would take other needed energy programs, NIF is going to do the same thing. 
   The administration has requested an additional $135 million for construction of NIF this year, and that is going to be taken from other stockpile stewardship activities, in addition to the $74 million that is in this bill. So if you think we are only spending $74 million on NIF, forget it. They have already requested to transfer another $135 million from other activities. 
   The administration has requested an even larger increase for fiscal year 2002, $180 million, and hundreds of millions of dollars more in future years. Again, I submit that we will be starving basic science programs and physics programs in order to get the money to build this project at Lawrence Livermore. 
   Even Sandia Lab has publicly expressed concern. They said in a statement earlier this year:  
   The apparent delay and significant increase in cost for the NIF is sufficient that it will disrupt the investment needed to be made at the other laboratories, and perhaps at the production plants, by several years. This causes us to question what is a reasonable additional investment in the National Ignition Facility.  
   Lastly--and I will end on this note--even if it is built, the National Ignition Facility may never achieve ignition. Even Lawrence Livermore's NIF project manager, Ed Moses, suggested, ``The goal of achieving ignition is a long shot.'' Physicist Leo Mascheroni is quoted in the August 18 issue of Science magazine as saying, ``From my point of view, the chance that this reaches ignition is zero. Not 1 percent. Those who say 5 percent are just being generous to be polite.'' Well, there you have it. 
   If it does work, the NIF may itself be a nuclear proliferation threat. The Lawrence Livermore Institutional Plan describes the main purpose of NIF:  
   To play an essential role in assessing physics regimes of interest in nuclear weapons design and to provide nuclear weapon-related physics data, particularly in the area of secondary design.  
   So that is what it is for--designing new nuclear weapons. But we don't need to. It is of dubious value in maintaining the stockpile when we already have, as I said, a time-tested, proven way of doing so. 
   Well, Mr. President, the amendment I offered basically leaves the $74.1 million that is in the bill. But it only says that was all they could use right now. My amendment says the administrators of the National Nuclear Security  Administration shall provide for an independent review of the NIF and the Inertia Confinement Review Program. This review shall be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   I have asked that the review address the following: whether it is required in order to maintain the reliability and safety of the stockpile; whether or not the alternatives could achieve the same objective; any current technical problems that we have; the likely cost of the construction; the potential effects of cost overruns; lastly, the cost and availability of scaling back the number of proposed beam lines at the NIF. 
   Basically, what I am saying is let's put the money in that we have now, but let's have the National Academy of Sciences do an independent study that would not be reviewed and edited by Lawrence Livermore, and this report would be submitted by September of 2001. That is really what this amendment does. I am grateful to the manager and the chairman of the committee for accepting the amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. I think what Senator KYL has said indicates why we need a little bit more robust debate on this issue than what we are having tonight. I know it is late. We are moving on. But I really think we need to have a pretty involved discussion and debate on this issue. Obviously, we have a disagreement on this issue. Again, I agree with the Senator from Arizona that we want our stockpiles to be safe and reliable. The question is, What is the best methodology to accomplish that at the cheapest cost to the taxpayers and that perhaps will not open the door to other problems down the road while we might agree upon the basis of how we get there? That is why I think we really need a more robust debate on this issue of the National Ignition Facility than what we have had in the past. 
   Businesses disagree on this. Scientists disagree on it. Obviously, politicians are disagreeing on it. That is why on this one, which is going to cost a lot of money, I hope that next year--we will not this year, but I hope next year--we can keep this study. I hope we do have the study, as the Senator from Arizona said, by some outside body. The amendment calls for the National Academy of Sciences to do it. I can't think of a more appropriate body to do an independent analysis of the study than the National Academy of Sciences, where they can call on a broad variety of different disciplines to have input. 
   I hope we at least have that and come back next year. Let's have a more robust and more involved debate on whether or not we really want to continue with the National Ignition Facility.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. I am introducing today legislation designed to address the extensive problems that have been caused by the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and to make appropriate revisions to the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program in the Clean Air Act. 
   It has become absolutely clear that MTBE has to go. Even in Iowa, where we are not required to have oxygenated fuels or RFG, a recent survey found a surprising level of water contamination with MTBE. So my legislation requires a phased reduction in the use of MTBE in motor fuel and then a prohibition on MTBE in fuel of fuel additives beginning three years after enactment. Retail pumps dispensing gasoline with MTBE would be labeled so that consumers know what they are buying. And in order to facilitate an orderly phase-out of MTBE, EPA may establish a credit trading system for the dispensing and sale of MTBE. 
   My legislation recognizes the benefits that have been provided by the oxygen content requirement in the reformulated gasoline program. Oxygen added to gasoline reduces emissions of carbon monoxide, toxic compounds and fine particulate matter. So my legislation continues the oxygen content requirement, but it does allow for certain actions that would alleviate concerns about whether alternative oxygen additives will be available after MTBE is removed from gasoline. The bill allows for averaging of the oxygen content upon a proper showing and it also would allow for a temporary reduction or waiver of the minimum oxygen content requirement in very limited circumstances. 
   The legislation also ensures that all health benefits of the reformulated gasoline program are maintained and improved. The bill includes very strong provisions to ensure that there is no backsliding in air quality and health benefits from cleaner burning reformulated gasoline. The petroleum companies would also be prohibited from taking the pollutants from gasoline in some areas and putting them back into gasoline in other areas of the country that are not subject to the more stringent air quality standards. Those are referred to as the anti-dumping protections. My bill places tighter restrictions on highly polluting aromatic and olefin content of reformulated gasoline. 
   My legislation also recognizes the important role of renewable fuels in improving our environment, building energy security for our nation, and increasing farm income, economic growth and job creation, especially in rural areas. The legislation creates a renewable content requirement for gasoline and for diesel fuel. 
   Overall, this legislation will get MTBE out of gasoline, maintain and improve the air quality and health benefits of the reformulated gasoline program and the Clean Air Act, and put our nation on a solid path toward greater use of renewable fuels.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the ADA, of course, ultimately is about our children. They will be the first generation to grow up with the ADA--the first generation in which children with and without disabilities play together on the playground, learn together in school, hang out together at the mall and the movie theater, and go out together for pizza. These children who will grow up as classmates and friends and neighbors will now see each other as neighbors and coworkers--no longer segregated. That is what the ADA is about. It has opened up new worlds for people with disabilities--where people with disabilities are participating more and more in their communities, living fuller lives as students, as coworkers, as taxpayers, as consumers, voters, and neighbors. 
   But we must never forget that prohibiting discrimination is not the same as ensuring equal opportunity. President Johnson understood this when he said: ``[Y]ou cannot shackle men and women for centuries, then bring them to the starting line of a race and say, `You see, we're giving you an equal chance.'" 
   That is why we all work so hard for the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act because we had to set the stage to change the employment rate for people with disabilities. That is why we all work so hard to defend the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, because there is no equal opportunity without education. 
   I am proud that this morning President Clinton announced a new effort by the Federal Government to open up an additional 100,000 jobs in the Federal Government for people with disabilities. That is leadership. I thank President Clinton for providing that leadership. 
   Again, that is why we have to fight against genetic discrimination. That is why we have to add people with disabilities to the Hate Crimes Act that passed the Senate, and to make sure it becomes law. 
   That is why we have to fight to make sure we don't lose in the Supreme Court what we gained in Congress. There is a case now pending before the Supreme Court in which a State has argued that title II of the ADA which applies to State governments should be held unconstitutional because the Federal Government does not have the power to enforce the ADA against the States in the way other civil rights laws are. 
   The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, applies to all the States and State governments. Now a State is arguing that the ADA, a civil rights law for people with disabilities, should not apply to States. They are saying: Don't worry. The State says: Leave it to us. We will make sure that people aren't subject to employment discrimination. We will make sure that people aren't forced to live inside institutions or carried up the steps in order to get into the local courthouse. 
   Some of us remember after the 1964 civil rights bill was passed that States were arguing the same thing: Leave it to the States; they will take care of civil rights; we don't need the Federal Government coming in. 
   What I think we are forgetting is that this is a civil rights law that covers the citizens of America. We are all in this together. We are talking about citizens'--Federal, national--constitutional rights to equal protection under the law. It is up to this Federal Congress to ensure that citizens with disabilities get that equal treatment. That is why we have title II of the ADA. 
   In sign language, there is a wonderful sign for America. It is this: This is the sign for America, all of the fingers put together, joining the hands in a circle. That describes America for all. We are all together. We are not separated out. We are all within one circle; a family--the deaf sign. It is not separate and apart. It is not one State and another State when it comes to civil rights and ensuring equal protection of the law. We 
   will not let the Supreme Court rewrite history and erase civil rights--the national civil rights for people with disabilities. 
   Finally, we have to close the digital divide to make sure that people with disabilities have full access to the new technologies. 
   Last night, Vice President Gore held a reception at the Vice President's house for literally hundreds and hundreds of people with disabilities from all over America. It was a great event to celebrate the 10th anniversary. In one tent, they set up a wide variety of new technologies to assist people with disabilities. I was particularly taken with one new device that had a cathode ray tube, CRT. It was hooked up to a PC. There was a little device under the net, a CRT that looked up at your eyes. You sat there for a second and it calibrated it. With your eye movement alone, you could turn on lights, turn off lights, make phone calls, talk to people, type letters, get on the Internet, only by moving your eyes. 
   Think about what that means for people who have Lou Gehrig's disease or severe cerebral palsy. There are a lot of disabled people who can't do anything but move their eyes. But their mind is perfect. 
   One perfect example that Vice President Gore always uses is Stephen Hawkins, perhaps the smartest individual in the world, who is fully immobile because of his disability. Yet here is a machine that will allow him to more rapidly access information and to write his wonderful books about the universe. That is what I mean when I say we ought to close the digital divide because there is so much out there that can help people with disabilities. 
   Lastly, I say that the next step we have to do is fight and win against the continued segregation of people with disabilities from their own communities. That is why we have to move forward on the bill called MiCASSA, S. 1935, a bill that is pending in the Senate right now--the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act--a bipartisan bill that will eliminate institutional bias in the Federal Medicaid program and give people with disabilities and the elderly a real choice to live in their communities. 
   Right now, Medicaid is biased toward institutionalization. 
   Why shouldn't we give a person with a disability the right to decide where he or she wants to live and how they want to live? Let them live in their own home, in their own community settings. That is what S. 1935 is about. The disability community all over this country understands personal attendants are sorely needed. No individual should be forced into an institution just to receive reimbursement for services that can be effectively and efficiently delivered in the home of the community. Individuals must be empowered to exercise real choice in selecting long-term services and supports that meet their unique needs and allow them to be independent. Federal and State Medicaid policies should be responsive to and not impede an individual's choice in selecting services and supports. 
   This bill eliminates the bias toward institutional care. It would help deliver services and supports consistent with the principle that people with disabilities have the right to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to meeting that individual's unique needs. 
   In last year's Olmstead decision, the Supreme Court found that to the extent that Medicaid dollars are used to pay for a person's long-term care, that person has a civil right to receive those services in the most integrative settings. Therefore, we in Congress have a responsibility to help States meet the financial costs associated with serving people with disabilities who want to leave institutions and live in the community. MiCASSA, as the bill is known, S. 1935, will provide that help. 
   A lot of people say this will cost money. Actually, it will save money. Medicaid spending on long-term care in 1997 totaled $56 billion, but only $13.5 billion was spent on home and community-based services. That $13.5 billion paid for the care of almost 2 million people. 
   In contrast, the $42.5 billion we spent on institutional care paid for just a little over 1 million people. 
   The average annual cost of institutional care for people with disabilities is more than double the average annual cost of providing home and community-based services. Right now, all across the country, hundreds of thousands of people are providing unpaid  support to sons and daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, to allow them to remain in the community. Yet when they turn to the current long-term care system for relief, all too often all they can do is add their name to a very long waiting list. That is not right. That is not just. That is not fair. These family care givers are sacrificing their own employment opportunities and costing the country millions in taxable income. 
   Lastly, I take a moment to remark on the surplus. Lately that is all we are hearing about is how much surplus we will have over the next 10 years. I hear now it is up to $2 trillion and counting. We have some very important decisions to make about what we do with the surplus. Everyone is lining up--tax breaks here, tax cuts here, tax breaks here, for business, for corporations, for this group, for that group--all lining up to get some of that surplus. 
   I believe we have to make some important decisions. I believe we have to use that money to pay down the debt, shore up Social Security, make sure that our seniors get what they need under Medicare. With all these groups lining up to get a piece of the action on the surplus, I am asking: What about the disability community? What about the Americans all over our country who want to live in their own communities, who want supportive services in their homes, who want personal assistance services so they can go to work every day? I believe we should use some of that surplus to make sure that all Americans have the equal right to live in the community--not just in spirit, but in reality. 
   As I said, our present Medicaid policy has an institutional bias. We need to use some of this surplus to get people in their 
   own homes and communities. There may be some transitional cost, but we know later on when these people start going to work, when their families and the family care givers who are at home now and underemployed, are employed, when they go to work they are working, making money, paying taxes. 
   Yes, when we are talking about what we are going to do with that surplus, let's not forget we have millions of Americans far too long segregated, far too long kept out of the main stream of society, far too long denied their rights as American citizens to full integration in our society. It is time we do the right thing. It is time when we make decisions about the surplus, we use some of that to make sure that people with disabilities are able to live and work and travel as they want. 
   ADA may stand for the Americans with Disabilities Act, but it stands for more than that. It really stands for the American dream for all. 
   In closing, as I said earlier, my brother, Frank, passed away last month. I miss him now and I will miss him forever. He was a wonderful brother to me. He was a great friend. He was my great inspiration. He was proud of what the ADA meant for people with disabilities. For 10 years he and millions of people across our country lived out its possibilities. So I thank my brother, Frank. I thank everyone else in the entire disability community who was an inspiration for me, who worked so hard for the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   I include in that many of my fellow Senators and Representatives. This was never a partisan bill. It is not now a partisan bill. It will never be a partisan bill. Too many good people on both sides of the aisle worked hard. Senator Weicker, who led the charge early on, before I even got to the Senate; Senator Dole, who worked so hard, so long, to make sure we got ADA through; Boyden Grey, Counsel to the President who worked with us every step of the way; Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, what a giant he was, hung in there, day after day, working to make sure we got it through. On our side of the aisle, Senator KENNEDY, who made sure we had all the hearings, got the people there, made the record, to ensure that ADA was on solid ground; Tony Coehlo from the House of Representatives, and Representative STENY HOYER in the House; Congressman Steve Bartlett, another great giant, Republican leader in the House at that time, later on became mayor of Dallas. He was there this morning, too. 
   At that time, there weren't Democrat and there weren't Republicans. 
   We were all in that same boat together, and we were all pulling together. We were, as I said earlier, Mr. President--the deaf sign for Americans is this (signing)--all of us together, fingers intertwined, all of us in that same family circle. That is what ADA is about. It is about this deaf sign. We are all in this together. 
   We want to make sure the ADA really does stand for the American dream for all. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to thank the managers of the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill for their cooperation in including the amendment for emergency methamphetamine lab cleanup funds that Senator HUTCHINSON and I had offered as part of the bill's FY 2000 supplemental package. 
   This amendment, also cosponsored by Senator BINGAMAN, Senator BROWNBACK, Senator NICKLES and Senator THOMAS--provides $5 million in emergency lab cleanup funds for state and local law enforcement. 
   A similar provision I had offered was included in the emergency package from June but it was dropped before it was attached to the Military Construction Appropriations conference, which gained final passage with a voice vote. There was strong support for this provision from both Democrats and Republicans. And it was included in both the House and Senate supplemental packages. 
   So, it didn't make sense why it was suddenly dropped--especially when we're talking about dangerous chemical sites that are left exposed in our local communities. 
   Senator HUTCHINSON from Arkansas and I last week sent a letter to the Appropriations leadership that was signed by 30 Senators, calling for this emergency funding. Our states desperately need this money or they will be forced to take money out of their own tight law enforcement budgets to cover the high cost of meth lab cleanup. 
   Over the years, Iowa and many states in the Midwest, West and Southwest have been working hard to reduce the supply and demand of the methamphetamine epidemic. But meth has brought another unique problem to our states-- highly toxic labs that are often abandoned and exposed to our communities. 
   The Drug Enforcement Agency has provided in recent years critical financial assistance to help clean up these dangerous sites, which can cost thousands of dollars each. 
   Unfortunately and to everyone's surprise, the DEA in March ran out of funds to provide methamphetamine lab cleanup assistance to state and local law enforcement. That's because last year, this funding was cut in half while the number of meth labs found and confiscated has been growing. 
   Last month, the Administration shifted $5 million in funds from other Department of Justice Accounts to pay for emergency meth lab cleanup. And I believe that will help reimburse these states for the costs they have incurred since the DEA ran out of money. My state of Iowa has already paid some $400,000 out of its own pocket in cleanup costs since March. 
   But, this is not enough to get our states through the rest of the fiscal year. 
   This $5 million provision will ensure that there will be enough money to pay for costly meth lab clean-up without forcing states to take money out of their other tight law enforcement budgets to cover these unexpected costs. 
   If we can find the money to fight drugs in Colombia, we should be able to find the money to fight drugs in our own backyard. We cannot risk exposing these dangerous meth labs to our communities. 
   Again, I appreciate the managers of this bill, Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for their cooperation on this important provision and I look forward to working with them to making sure it is maintained in conference.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry; I was under the mistaken impression that there was a time limit. I stand corrected. I want to talk for a few minutes about the pending amendment. 
   In some conversations I had last night and earlier this morning previous to coming to the floor, I found that there may be some misconceptions about my amendment and what it seeks to do. So I would like to take the time to try to clarify it. 
   I did not think there would be opposition to it. It was merely to clarify a situation that has arisen in a court case in Texas. So in the next few minutes I will try, as best I can, to try to outline it and clarify exactly what this amendment is and what it intends to do. 
   Everyone in the food chain, from the farm on through to the table, has a vital stake in the USDA food safety and inspection system for meat and poultry products. This goes back many years. As the years have evolved, and  as our processes for growing, slaughtering, processing, packaging, transporting, and the selling of meat and meat products and poultry products has changed, we have changed the way we do things. 
   As Secretary Glickman once I think so adroitly explained, the days of poke and sniff have to be over. We need new inspection standards because of the rapidity of the lines, the tremendous increase in the production of meat and meat products, which are good sources of protein for our people and for export. We need the change. So that is what we have done. 
   But the linchpin in all of this is consumer confidence. Our food safety system must adequately protect consumers. It must assure consumers that their food is safe. If consumers lack confidence in the safety of meat and poultry products, they will not be good customers. That means less demand and lower prices and income for livestock and poultry producers, as well as for our packers and processors. 
   On May 25, a huge cloud of uncertainty was cast over USDA's meat and poultry inspection system when the Federal district court for the Northern District of Texas held that USDA does not 
   have the statutory authority to enforce its pathogen reduction standards for salmonella in ground beef. 
   The pathogen reduction standards are a critical part of the new food safety system which was adopted by the USDA in 1996 in the hazard analysis critical control point and pathogen reduction rule. It is otherwise known by its acronym HACCP, something that many of us in the Senate and the House have worked on for many years to bring about. 
   That system was designed to protect human health by reducing the levels of bacteria contamination in meat and poultry products. I might add that the HACCP rule was broadly supported by consumer groups, by packers, by processors, by the meat and poultry industry, as being a step in the right direction from the kind of inspection procedures that we had before. 
   The HACCP and the pathogen reduction rule established a modern inspection system based on two fundamental principles. 
   First, the meat and poultry industry has the primary responsibility and the flexibility to design plans for producing safe products and then to follow those food safety plans. So the industry has the primary responsibility. And they should have the flexibility to design plans for producing safe products and then to follow those plans. That is the first principle. 
   The second principle is that the public health is best served by reducing the level of pathogens on meat and poultry products nationwide--a very commonsense principle. To accomplish this, USDA developed pathogen reduction standards using salmonella as the indicator bacteria. These standards set targets that plants have to meet for reducing microbial pathogen levels. If a plant repeatedly fails to meet salmonella targets, USDA may refuse to inspect the plant's products, thereby effectively shutting the plant down until the plant implements a corrective action plan to meet the pathogen reduction standard. 
   What happened was the district court in Texas held that USDA does not have the statutory authority to enforce its food safety standards designed to reduce pathogen levels in ground beef. 
   The court stated, in its June 13 final judgment, that the salmonella reduction standard ``is hereby declared to be outside the statutory authority of the United States Secretary of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture to the extent that it allows the Secretary and/or USDA to withdraw or suspend inspection services or withhold the mark of inspection on the basis of an alleged failure to comply with the Salmonella performance standard for ground beef. .....'' 
   That is the quote from the finding of the district court. 
   Keep in mind, if USDA cannot withdraw or suspend inspection, it is powerless to enforce the pathogen reduction standards. Refusing inspection is USDA's only enforcement tool. Again, the Texas decision was based on an interpretation of USDA's statutory authority to enforce the salmonella reduction standard. 
   I am aware there has been a lot of discussion about the legitimacy of the salmonella standard. Is it science based? Does it rationally relate to food safety? Those are legitimate questions to raise. But the court did not even get to those questions. It just ruled that the USDA did not have the statutory authority to enforce its standard designed to reduce pathogenic bacteria. 
   I believe the American public would be shocked to be told 
   that the U.S. Department of Agriculture does not have the authority, under our meat and poultry inspection laws, to require reductions in microbial contamination of meat and poultry. 
   If USDA lacks the authority to enforce pathogen reduction standards, then, surely, we stand at the edge of a food safety debacle, a chasm. I am going to repeat that. The American public would be shocked to find the USDA does not have the authority, under our existing meat and poultry inspection laws, to require reductions in microbial contamination of meat and poultry. Think about that. 
   Frankly, I have my doubts about the reasoning of the court in the Texas case. But the court has held that the USDA lacks this authority to enforce the pathogen reduction standards. 
   That decision has created an intolerable degree of uncertainty about USDA's authority to ensure the safety of meat and poultry products, not only in Texas but anywhere in the entire United States. 
   Plainly and simply, all my pending amendment does is to clarify that the USDA has the legal statutory authority to require reductions in pathogenic bacteria in meat and poultry products. 
   Let me explain why it is so critically important that we clarify this and that USDA has that authority. I have some charts to show that. This chart has some very sobering statistics. 
   In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foodborne pathogens are responsible for 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths every year. 
   That is an estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   The economic impact of foodborne illness for the United States is estimated to be $6.6 to $37.1 billion per year. Just to clarify, these statistics include all foods--not just meat and poultry but all foods. Meat and poultry are certainly a substantial portion of the cases; I don't want to mislead anyone. This covers lettuce, tomatoes, fruits, vegetables, and everything else. Again, these are not just illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths that result simply from the failure to reduce pathogens in the processing and packaging stream. This could come about from mishandling of food at the consumer level, at the purchasing level, storage, miscooking, and inapplicable storage of partially cooked food. 
   I want to illustrate the dimensions of foodborne pathogens in our country. Again, I am not condemning the meat and poultry industry. I am not trying to frighten consumers. Yet there is no denying that we have much more foodborne illness than we should. Consumers are paying attention. Consumers are concerned about the safety of their food. Again, I come back to the matter of consumer confidence. What industry can build markets if it fails to build confidence in its customers? If you support the meat and poultry industries, as I do, then you also have to support a food safety and inspection system that effectively assures the safety and quality of meat and poultry products. 
   The second chart shows some of the progress we have made since we established the new pathogen reduction standards which the USDA has been implementing. Salmonella levels on meat and poultry products have fallen. Salmonella rates in ground beef 
   have dropped 43 percent for some of our small plants, 23 percent for large plants. In fact, in the entire United States, only three plants have failed to meet the standard. I think this is strong evidence that the standard works and that it is reasonable. Yet the court in Texas says USDA does not have the legal authority to do what it has been doing to reach these dropping rates in salmonella levels. It says USDA does not have the authority to continue to do that. 
   The next chart indicates the success of the USDA new food safety system for meat and poultry. This chart shows the rate of foodborne illnesses has fallen from 51.2 per 100,000 people in 1996,  when the HACCP rule was implemented, to 40.7 per 100,000 people in 1999. That is a 20.5-percent decrease in total foodborne illnesses in the last 4 to 5 years. That is a major success story in food safety. But now the Texas court's decision has rejected USDA's authority to reduce pathogens on meat and poultry products which led us to this tremendous reduction. 
   The salmonella standard is not perfect, from what I am told by scientists and others. That is why I have carefully crafted my amendment so it does not codify or lock into place the existing salmonella standard. My amendment would do nothing to prevent changing, improving, or even challenging a pathogen reduction standard. I want to continue to work with producers, the meat and poultry industries, consumers, and the USDA to see that we have science-based, workable performance standards that protect the public health. Again, what my amendment does, and all it does, is to make certain that USDA has the legal, statutory authority to enforce pathogen reduction standards that are critically important to assuring food safety. 
   I am willing to engage in any colloquies about this amendment. Keep in mind, this court decision was only 2 months ago. Quite frankly, if we don't act soon, I think there is going to be great concern among consumers, customers in the export markets, about our commitment to reducing pathogens, reducing bacteria in our meat, livestock, and poultry products. 
   We are not trying to lock in a standard. As I said in my opening statement, times change, conditions change. We have to be able to do that. But the authority to do that, as it has been going back probably almost 70 years--80 years almost--the authority for meat and poultry inspection has been with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To be sure, during most of that time, they were not involved in the reduction of pathogens and bacteria. But with the new changes in how we do inspections, with HACCP, we decided, and the processors and the consumers decided, that we needed to do everything possible to reduce bacteria contamination on our meat and poultry products. 
   As I said, we have done a great job in that. We have reduced it. We are on our way. Most of the plants in America have met these requirements. They have used HACCP. They have been responsible. Only three plants in the entire United States failed to meet the standard. I think if the court had gotten beyond the statutory problem and gotten to the essence, the substance of it, the court, on the weight of the evidence, would have had to decide that the reduction standard is reasonable. Obviously, if all the plants in the country are doing it and only three have not met it, a reasonable person--and I believe the court is reasonable--would say, obviously, it has to be a pretty decent standard. But the court didn't even get there. They just said, sorry, you don't have the authority, which 
   really has opened up a chasm. 
   That is why it is so critically important for us to address this issue this year. The only vehicle we have that I can see right now is to do it on the Agriculture appropriations bill, which is a good bill and which I hope will make its way through and be signed by the President. I think it is critically important to give them that authority. That is all my amendment does right now. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman not moving to table right now. I listened as closely as I could, while conversing with my staff, to the comments made by my friend. I hope we can engage in a colloquy on this. We are talking past each other. 
   Obviously, the chairman had to leave the floor, but I hope we can engage in a colloquy on this because this is a very serious matter. I don't want there to be misperceptions out there. 
   The Senator from Mississippi just got through saying, more than once, that what we are being asked to do is codify a regulation. I would like the Senator from Mississippi to show where in my amendment it codifies a regulation. It is not there. I challenge my friend from Mississippi to show that. It is not there. I said explicitly in my statement that my amendment does not codify any regulation. It is not there. So if the Senator from Mississippi says that my amendment codifies a regulation, I challenge him to show where and how. I think that is a misperception. 
   Secondly, again, let's be clear on what we are talking about here. Is it reasonable, I ask, for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has the statutory power to inspect meat and poultry products, which it has for many years, is it reasonable for the USDA to also inspect and set some standards for the reductions of packaging bacteria that is on our meat and poultry products? 
   If the answer to that is no, it is not reasonable, then I guess you could vote to table my amendment because that is where we will be. We will be at a point where what we would be saying is that the U.S. Department of Agriculture should not have any authority to establish pathogen reduction standards nor any authority to enforce them. I suppose they could test them. But they could never enforce them. I think that is what we have to ask ourselves: Is it reasonable for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to set pathogen reduction standards and then to be able to enforce them? 
   I said in my opening statement, and I say again to my friend from Mississippi, my amendment does not codify any regulation. Yet, if I am not mistaken, I heard my friend from Mississippi state in his comments that we are being asked to codify a regulation. I carefully drafted the amendment not to do that. 
   If the Senator from Mississippi can show how we codify our regulation, we would be glad to change the amendment. It is not there. That is a misperception. All this amendment says is that the USDA has the statutory authority to both set a pathogen reduction standard and then to enforce it. That does not mean a packer or a processor couldn't challenge those standards as being unreasonable or not applicable. That still can be challenged. Any rule or regulation can be challenged in court. 
   Let's take the Supreme Beef case, I say to my friend from Mississippi, where the Supreme Beef packing plant had failed the salmonella standard reduction three times. They had failed it three times before the USDA stepped in and withdrew its inspection, thereby basically shutting the plant down. 
   Again, keep in mind that the plant did not go to court to challenge the standard. They went to court and said USDA 
   doesn't have the statutory authority to set the standard or to enforce it. The court found that USDA did not have that statutory authority. Here is a plant that failed three times to meet the salmonella reduction standard. They had been warned. They knew it. 
   Keep in mind that a lot of this ground beef from Supreme Beef goes into our School Lunch Program. Go out and tell the parents of America they can send their kids to school and they can eat ground beef in school but we are not going to enforce any bacteria reduction standards such as salmonella in our packing plants. Supreme Beef failed it three times. Now they can fail it four or five times. They will have no standards whatsoever--none, zero, zip--because the USDA will not be able to enforce its salmonella reduction standards. 
   I think what Supreme Beef should have done was challenge, if they wanted to, the reasonableness of that standard. They could go to court and get a stay to keep operating and then show the court that the standard that was imposed on them by USDA and by which USDA is shutting down their plant by refusing inspection is unreasonable, unwarranted, and inapplicable. Fair enough; let them do that. But they cannot even get there because they said USDA doesn't have the authority to do it. 
   That is where we are. If we take no action, that is where we are. Supreme Beef can go ahead and keep right on operating. They don't have to worry about any salmonella reduction. They can keep pumping that food right into the School Lunch Program. 
   The chairman indicated that there is a USDA scientific advisory committee that may review this standard this fall. I welcome that. Nothing in my amendment would prevent changes based on those recommendations. Nothing in this amendment would do that. 
   Again, one has to ask oneself, should the USDA have the authority under the HACCP program to issue pathogen reduction standards and then to be able to enforce those? 
   Again, I go back to my chart. Since the pathogen reduction standard for salmonella went into effect in 1996--it is so prevalent and makes people pretty sick--rates in ground beef dropped 43 percent in our smaller packing plants and 23 percent in our larger plants. 
   That is success. That is why plants all over America have not challenged this in court. They seem to be doing quite well with it. Only three plants in the entire United States have failed to meet this standard--three--Supreme Beef, of course, being one of them. 
   As I said, since the HACCP rule was implemented in 1996, 51.2 foodborne illnesses per 100,000 people went down to 40.7. It is working. Yet because of one plant in Texas that decided to thumb its nose at the salmonella reduction standard--obviously, they had a good attorney--they went to court and said USDA does not have the authority either to set the standard or to enforce it. The court said: You are right, they don't, because Congress never gave them that authority. 
   I want to clear up one other thing. I am told the USDA is not opposed to this amendment. They are not taking a position because of pending litigation because they are in the courts right now because of this pending litigation. 
   The USDA has a charge to ensure lower bacteria counts. Again, it is not the power to arbitrarily shut down a plant because of the appropriateness of a specific USDA standard. The 
   standard is still subject to review by a court. I want to make that as clear as I can. 
   No. 1, I challenge my friend from Mississippi to show me how my amendment codifies the regulation. I challenge my friend to show that. He has said that. I have carefully drafted it so that it does not codify any regulation. The regulations can change. The advisory committee can meet. Maybe they want to change these standards--I am speaking here regarding this amendment--but I don't know why they would want to change a standard that has been so successful, by which every  packing plant in America today is abiding, except three, one of them being Supreme Beef that brought this case. 
   It is not that technical. All we are doing is asking, through this amendment, to give USDA the authority to set the standard and enforce it--not what standard. This amendment does not give the USDA the authority to set a standard that I specify and to enforce that standard. It says to set pathogen reduction standards and to enforce them. Obviously, if they set a standard that is unreasonable, inappropriate, and inapplicable, that can be challenged in court. They can be challenged in the rulemaking process. That is the way it is done. 
   But if we continue as we are right now, there is no reason for any plant in America to abide by these salmonella reduction standards because USDA has no authority to enforce them. They could go into a plant and say: Gee, you know, you are right above salmonella; that is above our standard. The plant can say: So what. Get out of here. We don't have. I don't think that is what the American people want or the American consumers want. I don't believe it is what the vast majority of packers and processors in America want. They want the public to have the highest level of confidence that their meat and poultry and meat products and poultry products are wholesome and without bacterial contamination. 
   It is too bad because of one bad actor--one plant in Texas that failed three times to meet the standard, and on the fourth time, after having clear warnings, the USDA came in and withdrew the inspection, which effectively shuts down the plant--we have to throw the whole system out and say the USDA does not have the authority. That can open the floodgates for plants all over America. 
   I say to my friend from Mississippi, there is no codification of any regulation, none whatever. It is only giving the USDA the authority under which it has been operating for 4 years, which has been successful. Only three plants in America have failed to meet standards. I think that is a good success story. I don't think we ought to not give the authority to the USDA to continue on this pathway simply because of one bad actor in Texas and because of the fact that we failed in our statutory deliberations and in our statutory approach to give the USDA this authority. I am not pointing the finger at anybody. 
   We should have at some point statutorily given the USDA this authority. We did not do so. That is what this amendment seeks to do. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Thank you. 
   Mr. President, let's go back to where we were a few hours ago when I first offered an amendment this morning. That amendment would state clearly that the Department of Agriculture--the Secretary of Agriculture--had the authority to set standards for pathogen reduction in meat and poultry inspection. Again, the amendment was carefully drafted not to set the standard. That should not be our business. 
   The reason for the amendment was precipitated by a court case in Texas in May in which a Federal district court judge found that the Department of Agriculture--the Secretary of Agriculture--lacked the statutory authority to set and enforce pathogen reductions in meat and poultry inspection. 
   When the Department established its new inspection rules in 1996, the USDA adopted a new food safety system based on hazard analysis, critical control points, and pathogen reduction standards, otherwise known now as HACCP. The system was designed to protect human health by reducing the levels of bacteria contamination in meat and poultry products. It has been in existence now for 4 years. 
   What then happened was we had this plant in Texas, Supreme Beef. Three times they were warned by the inspectors that they were not meeting the salmonella reduction standards. Three times they failed. It is not that they weren't warned adequately; they were. On the third time when they failed it, the USDA did the only thing they could do under the authority they have, and that was to withdraw inspection from the plant, and, in effect, by withdrawing inspection from the plant, the plant had to shut down. 
   The plant hired attorneys and took the case to district court and got an injunction. They got an injunction against the USDA so that they could keep operating, and they did. Then the judge decided, after a hearing, that the USDA lacked the legislative and statutory authority to both implement the rule and to enforce it. That is why we are here today with this amendment. 
   We have worked long and hard on this. This is not something new. During the 1980s and 1990s, both the House and the Senate Agriculture Committees had numerous hearings. The Department of Agriculture, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, had numerous field hearings and rulemaking procedures. They eventually came up with this new program that blended the old inspection program with new flexibility for industry and new standards for pathogen reduction. 
   Why was this necessary? Because we have bigger plants now, faster assembly lines, meat and poultry go through the system faster; and we also found increases, according to the Centers for Disease Control, in a number of foodborne illnesses that we had not seen before in our country. So we wanted to have a system whereby we could assure consumers of the highest level of confidence that once that meat left the slaughterhouse, once it left the processor, it would be as safe as possible. 
   Here again are CDC's statistics on foodborne illness. I had this chart this morning. It indicates that there are 76 million illnesses every year because of foodborne pathogens, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths. 
   Now, since we established the rule in 1996, salmonella rates in ground beef have dropped 43 percent for small plants and 23 percent for large plants. 
   Since these performance standards were issued in 1996, we have had this big drop in salmonella in ground beef. The standard is working. But now a district court has said USDA lacks the statutory authority to enforce that standard. That was why I offered my amendment this morning. Not to set a standard but only to say USDA has the statutory authority to enforce a standard once it has been set. Adoption of my amendment doesn't mean that a packing plant or a processing plant couldn't still go to court and say: Your rule is arbitrary or it is onerous or it is inapplicable. But we never got to that in the Supreme Beef case. The Court just said they lacked the authority to set the rule. 
   So they have thrown overboard years and years of work by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, the House Committee on Agriculture, and the Department of Agriculture under both Republicans and Democrats, and Republican and Democratic Secretaries of Agriculture to make progress in improving food safety. 
   This morning, I tried to give statutory authority to the Secretary of Agriculture because without authority to enforce food safety standards, consumers are left exposed in this country. All we are trying to do is give them that authority. 
   There was a motion to table the amendment made by the Senator from Mississippi. The motion to table lost on a tie vote. The Senator from Mississippi then put a second-degree amendment on my amendment. We were taking a look at it trying to figure out exactly what it did. It only changes a few words in my amendment. My amendment says at the end, standards ``established by the Secretary''--not our standard but standards set by the Secretary. The amendment by the Senator from Mississippi strikes that ``established by the Secretary'' and says ``promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods.'' The key part of his amendment is ``and that are shown to be adulterated.'' 
   What do those words mean? 
   First of all, when they say ``promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods,'' the committee was were there when they first came up with the standards. They had input on the standards when they were established in 1996. There may be debate about the extent of consultation, but they were consulted. But the key words of the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi are these: ``that are shown to be adulterated.'' 
   What does that mean? If the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi is adopted, it will mean that the Department of Agriculture will have to go all the way back and again go through rulemaking to develop new performance standards. We, under the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi, are codifying a standard. 
   The Senator from Mississippi, this morning, was saying the amendment that I offered was codifying the standard. I challenged him to show where that was so. It is not so. We do not codify a standard. Yet the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi codifies a standard. What is that standard shown to be? Adulteration; that is the standard. 
   What does that mean? It means that USDA now can't just go into a plant and test for pathogen reduction and for salmonella and say they are not meeting the standard on salmonella--that they are failing to reduce pathogens. They now have to show that the meat is adulterated. That is what we have been doing for 70 years. A USDA inspector in a plant has had that authority for all of my lifetime, and for all of the lifetime of the Presiding Officer. They have the authority to go into a plant and withdraw inspection on the basis of adulteration. That is the old standard. 
   The Senator from Mississippi would turn the clock back to where we were before 1996. No longer will we be able to say to 
   parents: Your kids can have school lunches and not worry about pathogens because we have a pathogen reduction standard that is being enforced. No, we will have a gaping hole there because USDA will now have to show that the food is adulterated. It will have to show that the plant is unsanitary. That is what we tried to get beyond in 1996. 
   The key part of the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi is that it codifies the adulteration standard as the essential element of pathogen reduction standards. Yet the Senator  from Mississippi went after this Senator, just this morning, claiming that I was trying to codify a standard, which I wasn't. The judge in the Supreme Beef case said that for the USDA to take action, it had to show adulteration. That was the key part of the case. The judge said under the statutory law that exists, the only way the USDA can shut down an inspection line is if they show that it is adulterated--not that they didn't meet a salmonella reduction standard, not that they had pathogens in their food. They have to show that it is adulterated, that there are unsanitary conditions in the plant. 
   Based on that holding, the judge said the USDA lacked the authority to enforce the existing salmonella standards. This amendment takes the holding in the Supreme Beef case, and makes it the law of the land. It makes the standard ``adulteration''. This amendment would make it the law of the land--not just in Texas but all over the country. Why would we want to do that? If we have to go back to ``promulgate with the advice,'' we will be another 2, 3, or 4 years waiting for pathogen reduction standards. 
   What do we tell our consumers in the meantime? There is no standard. We go right back to where we were before. What do we tell the 325,000 Americans hospitalized every year because of foodborne illnesses? What do we tell the parents of kids eating school lunches? This amendment by the Senator from Mississippi would throw all of our meat inspection into a huge morass. It would basically say we are back now where we were 30 years--poke and sniff and have to prove that it is adulterated, or have to prove it is unsanitary. 
   What does that mean? Salmonella can enter meat, for example, anywhere. It can enter it in the livestock yards, slaughterhouses, transportation, processing facilities. The point is not to lay blame on anyone. It is not to have the processor say: Our plant is clean, it is sanitary, and if there is salmonella there, we are not to blame, go blame somebody else. 
   I don't care who is to blame. I want to stop it. We want to stop it. We want to make sure that there is a system in place so that if there are pathogens in meat and poultry, we find out where they are coming from and stop them. That is what HACCP is all about. But under the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi, USDA could go right back to Supreme Beef, and they could say: Guess what. 
   You are not meeting the salmonella pathogen reduction standard we set, you have failed too many tests. Supreme Beef could say: We don't care what you think because you don't have the authority to do anything about it. Is that the kind of message we want to send to our consumers? 
   I don't have any letters in my office, but someone told me there are some papers circulating that the American Meat Institute is opposed to my amendment and supporting the amendment by the Senator from Mississippi. I have worked many years for the American Meat Institute. I have a high regard for them. I have a lot of livestock production in my home State. I have slaughtering facilities and processing facilities in my home State. If it is true the American Meat Institute is taking the position that the USDA can only have a pathogen reduction standard based on adulteration, they are doing a disservice to my livestock providers, they are doing a disservice to my packers, and they are doing a disservice to my processors. 
   Why? Because the word will be out on the street, and it will be in every consumer report. It will be in every newsletter that goes out that you can't trust the meat and poultry products that are coming from our processors and our packers because we no longer have a pathogen reduction standard. 
   Let me be very clear. If the Cochran amendment is adopted, new rulemaking will be mandatory. It will take at least 2 or 3 years to set the rules because they will have to have hearings and public comment. They went through all that less than 6 years ago. The Cochran amendment means they have to go through it again. 
   What happens during the next 2 to 3 years while the rulemaking is in effect? There will be no standards in effect, no pathogen reduction standards in effect. I hope Senators who are here, who are listening in their offices, and staffs who are listening, understand this. The Cochran amendment will necessitate new rulemaking. It will take a long time, and during that period of time, there will be no pathogen reduction standards enforceable by the USDA. 
   If the Senator wanted to amend his amendment and just say that would be issued ``with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, period,'' that would be acceptable.

   Mr. HARKIN. I think we may have an agreement. 
   If I could ask the Senator from Mississippi, is it the Senator's intention to leave the existing standards in effect during the period of time that the committee would make recommendations? 
   My problem is ``promulgated.'' I had two issues with the Senator's language. One, my problem with ``adulterated'', has been taken care of; the other, what does ``promulgated,'' mean remains. If USDA promulgates new standards and in the meantime can't enforce the existing standards, we are going to have a 2- or 3-year period of time where we have no enforceable pathogen reduction standards. 
   I ask the Senator, Is it your intention that during this period of time we would leave the existing standards in effect?

   Mr. HARKIN. Again, I understand that. But I am concerned about the words ``promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods.'' I don't mind that. They were involved with the standards established in 1996. 
   If it is the Senator's intention that the Department of Agriculture should go ahead, go back and take a look at whether or not they should revise those rules and those standards, I don't have any problem with that. That is what rulemaking is all about. 
   I am worried that we will have a gap of time where we will have no enforceable standards. That is why I want to make sure that at least during the period of time when they may be revising those standards the existing standards remain enforceable. 
   My concern, again, is if someone were to raise a question about the extent at which the existing standard was set with the advice of the committee, I want to make sure that would  not bar enforcement. If we had a colloquy to clear that up, that standards would stay in place pending any changes in rulemaking, that would be fine. 
   I ask if that is the Senator's intention.

   Mr. HARKIN. As the Senator and I were talking earlier, lawyers can argue about words and what they mean. Still, the words that are used in the Senator's amendment seem to indicate to me we have to go through rulemaking. Again, I am concerned, if that is how it is interpreted, then we are going to have a period of time that we may not have any enforceable standards. That is what I want to clarify. 
   That is why I wanted to engage in the colloquy. I do not believe it is clear, on its face, exactly what it means. 
   If it means that the standards we have now were promulgated with sufficient advice that we would not need new rulemaking, then that is okay. That is why we need some legislative history on this. That is why I was trying to engage in a colloquy. 
   I ask the Senator from Mississippi: Does his language mean USDA will have to go through rulemaking again? Does this leave a gap in the standards? That is all I am trying to get to. Maybe if we can talk about it a little more, we will get to this thing. I don't know. Sometimes it is hard.

   Mr. HARKIN. I have no problem with that. If that is the intent, to say--I will repeat to make sure I do not misunderstand--that the Senator's intent by using the word ``promulgate'' is to say that any future rulemaking--I want to make sure the Senator hears my words, to make sure I am OK on this--that any future rulemaking done by the Secretary of Agriculture has to be done with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, and that during any rulemaking when they are seeking that advice, the present standards will stay in place and be enforceable, that is fine.

   Mr. HARKIN. All I want to be satisfied about is that there will be enforceable standards in effect. 
   From what I hear, I like it. I want the committee to be involved in advising the Secretary. If the Senator tells me that the present rules that have been promulgated are still enforceable during the pendency of that consultation, then I have no problem. But the language says USDA can only enforce a standard if it is ``promulgated with advice''. I am wondering what this means for the standards we have right now. I want to clear this up. 
   Can the rules we have now be enforced? Or can only rules that are promulgated in the future be enforced with the advice of the committee? That is where we are hung up over these words. Words do have meaning. 
   I will say again, if the interpretation is that the standards that are now in effect remain enforceable, and that any future rules adopted by the Secretary have to be done with the advice and consultation of the committee, I have no problem with that. Then we don't have a gap. And I hope 
   that is the meaning.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor. I was hoping there might be a reasonable outcome. As I said, the RECORD will show earlier I said there were two problems with the amendment. One was with adulteration, which the Senator took care of. The other was the word ``promulgated.'' 
   If the Senator will further modify his amendment to say that future rules must be promulgated with the advice of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, that would settle the issue once and for all. 
   That means any future rulemaking done by USDA would have to be done with the advice of this committee, but that the existing rules meanwhile will stay in effect and be enforceable. If the Senator will do that, we are done.

   Mr. HARKIN. I am proud to join my distinguished colleague, the Senior Senator from Utah, in supporting this endeavor. This proposed increase in FDA's Adverse Event Monitoring System for dietary supplements is an important component in the overall effort to implement fully the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. It also continues our mutual efforts to promote better public health and consumer safety. The FDA monitors adverse events related to dietary supplements. The dietary supplement sales have doubled in the past five years. In fact, surveys indicate that nearly half of all Americans use some type of dietary supplement, spending over $12 billion annually for these products. FDA estimates that the industry markets approximately 29,000 of these products, which are sold under 75,000 distinct labels.

Over the past several months, my staff and I have had the pleasure of discussing this collaboration between Iowa State University, New Mexico State University, and the Agriculture Research Service with representatives of the National Center for Genome Resources, and want to express my support for establishing this institute. It would bring research scientists from the State Agriculture Experiment Stations and ARS together with the expertise in bioinformatics and software platforms developed by NCGR and its work on the Human Genome Project. Through this combination of expertise, the institute would greatly reduce the chances of having to ``reinvent the wheel,'' so to speak, as genomic research continues to expand into greater numbers of agricultural plant species.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the State of Georgia and the United States of America lost a great, decent leader yesterday. PAUL COVERDELL was one of the quiet heroes of this Senate Chamber. He was not showy; he was not proud; he was not here for the credit or the prestige or the power. He was a gentle man in every sense of the word and in every aspect of his being. 
   He was here because he loved his State and loved his Nation. He was here because he wanted to improve education. It was a profound concern of his. He was here because he wanted to end drug abuse and the scourge of drugs among young people. He was here because he wanted to protect our national security and secure our children's future and open America's promise to all of those he served. He fought for all these things with a humble dignity and a quiet passion that touched each one of us. 
   In a way, PAUL was the Senate peacemaker. We get a lot of contentious issues around here. We are all human beings. Tempers flare. Voices rise. It seems as if you are never going to get together with people again across the aisles. PAUL COVERDELL could step in and work his way back and forth and calm things down. 
   Recently, we had the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education bill up. I am the ranking member on that subcommittee. The chairman is Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania. It seems that every year when that bill comes up the debate gets hotter. The decibel level goes up a little bit. We seemed to be locked in a week-long struggle on that bill, and I had a chance, once again, to watch PAUL COVERDELL at work in soothing the tensions on both sides, of reaching across to Democrats and his own Republicans to find that common ground and just calm things down. He was really good at that. I watched him work. I said once to Senator SPECTER: I am sure glad we have PAUL COVERDELL around here because he was able to keep things calm. 
   He helped us reach the compromises, as we must do around here, and to find a common ground between people. 
   I also served with PAUL on the Agriculture Committee. We shared a common love of farmers and rural people. Again, in his own quiet way, I saw the determination and the grit of PAUL COVERDELL in fighting for his farmers in Georgia during many deliberations on the Ag Committee and especially in the passage of the last farm bill. 
   A lot of people do not know this--but PAUL and I talked about it often--he was born in Des Moines, IA, not more than 10 miles from where I was born and raised. 
   It is an honor that I represent a State that produced someone as good and as decent as PAUL COVERDELL. He was one of the finest leaders this body has ever seen. 
   Standing here and looking over at his desk and looking at the black cloth and the flowers on the desk cannot help but remind each of us of the transitory nature of human life. Just last week--it seems like yesterday--I was on the floor talking with PAUL COVERDELL about an issue, asking for some help and seeing if he could work some things out. He was as alive and as vibrant and as engaged and committed to the smooth functioning of this institution as anyone else. 
   Four days later, he passed on. 
   Looking at his desk, and thinking about seeing him just a few days ago, being alive and vibrant and full of health, and looking forward, not only makes us think about the transitory nature of human life but it also should serve to remind us we should make every day count--make every day count in emulating the kindness and the gentleness and the caring nature of a PAUL COVERDELL. 
   One of my political heroes, Hubert Humphrey, once said: ``To be a leader means a willingness to risk--and a willingness to love. One must ask: Has the leader given you something from the heart?''

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his very eloquent and decisive statement. I think my friend has really put his finger on it. 
   I would add one other thing to what we attempted to do here with the future surpluses the Senator was mentioning, the various things we wanted to do to try to help average working people. I had offered an amendment a couple of weeks ago to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act so we could help the States help families with children with disabilities to send them to school to get them the best possible education. We were stymied by the Republicans. Most of them voted against it. 
   Yet they find it within themselves to give, as the Senator pointed out, to the top 1 percent of this country 43 percent of the tax breaks. The surplus we have coming in the next 10 years is being used up by these tax breaks. I might ask the Senator if that is not so. It is my information, just this year, up until right now, this Senate, under Republican leadership, has passed something over $1.3 trillion in tax cuts. Am I in the ballpark, I ask the Senator?

Yet we have not purchased one book; we have not reduced the size of one class, we have not hired one new teacher, modernized one school, brought one prescription drug for the elderly. Yet they spend $1.3 trillion of the surplus that is there because of hard-working Americans the Senator from Illinois is talking about.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator knows that next week we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. A recent court decision upheld the ADA, trying to get people with disabilities the right to live independently in their own communities. That is going to require us to make some changes in this country. It is going to require us to invest in making sure people with disabilities have the kind of support they need so they can get education and jobs and independent living and transportation. If we do that, they are going to be wage earners and taxpayers and not living in institutions. 
   I say to the Senator from Illinois, as we celebrate the ADA next week, we ought to think about that, where all the money is now going, because the Republicans are giving it all to the top 1 percent and there will not be anything left to help make our country more fair and just, and to make sure we live up to our obligation to people with disabilities so they are fully integrated into our society.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if we are for equal pay for women and men who do the same work, then this is the amendment to do it--the Paycheck Fairness Act, which was introduced under Senator DASCHLE's leadership. It provides stronger remedies in wage discrimination cases and provides resources to educate employers on wage discrimination. It ensures that women cannot be retaliated against for sharing their pay information with fellow employees. 
   It is time to stop giving America's women lipservice for equal pay for equal work, but to actually do something to make it happen. That is what this amendment does. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is the Paycheck Fairness Act, which was introduced under Senator DASCHLE's leadership. It addresses an important economic issue--an issue that affects women, working families, retirees and America's children. I'm talking about the wage gap between women and men and how this legislation would work to close it. 
   You might think since Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the wage gap wouldn't exist. But women are still paid only 73 cents for every dollar a white man earns. 
   Part of the problem is that we need to do a better job of enforcing that law. That's why I am a proud cosponsor of this bill that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act. 
   This legislation would allow those who win their wage discrimination claims in court, to collect punitive and compensatory damages. It would put new money into employer education and honor employers with best practices. And, it would ensure that women can not be retaliated against by their employers for sharing pay information. 
   Senator DASCHLE's bill is a modest but needed step in ending pay discrimination. It has received strong support from the Administration and from advocates for working women, such as the AFL-CIO and the Business and Professional Women, the National Women's Law Center, and the National Partnership for Women and Families. 
   This body also has before it, the Fair Pay Act, legislation that I have introduced which takes the next step to closing the wage gap. It targets female-dominated jobs that are routinely underpaid and undervalued. My bill would require wages be set based on responsibility, skill, effort and working conditions. 
   The simple fact remains--working families face the problem of wage discrimination every day and lose billions of dollars in wages because of it. The average working woman loses $420,000 over a lifetime due to the wage gap. 
   We cannot continue to short-change women and families. It is our hope that for working women today, that this Congress will pass the Paycheck Fairness amendment to help end the wage gap. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be temporarily laid aside.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, women in America have made significant strides for equality and fair treatment. They have more opportunities and face less discrimination. However, there are still gross inequities, and this is particularly true in Social Security. 
   The average Social Security benefit received by a man is modest, about $10,508 on average in 1998. But for the 21 million American women who depend on Social Security, their average benefit is over 25 percent less, just $7,836 a year. That is 25 percent less to pay for prescription drugs; 25 percent less to pay for food; and 25 percent less to pay for the rent and utilities. 
   Largely as a result of these lower Social Security benefits, elderly women are twice as likely to be poor than older men. Fully, 19 percent of single older women--those who have been widowed, divorced, or never married--live in poverty. 
   There are a number of reasons for this. Women live longer than men. Women earn less during their working years due to wage discrimination and other factors. And women reach retirement with smaller pensions and other assets than men. 
   Parts of the problem lie with the Social Security itself. Our amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator LEAHY, and Senator MURRAY, tries to fix two of these problems in Social Security. 
   First, under current law, when a man dies, his widow sees only 50 to 66 percent of the couple's previous combined Social Security benefit. In one day, her basic income is cut by as much as half. However, the official poverty rate for a single person is 79 percent of that for a couple. That means that experts have determined it takes about 79 percent of a couple's income for a single person to maintain a minimum standard of living. 
   So the current widow's benefit forces many older women into poverty upon the death of their spouse. Our amendment would change that by increasing the Social Security survivors' benefit to at least 75 percent of the combined benefits of the husband and wife. This simple change will provide a greatly needed boost to more than 3 million low- and moderate-income widows and widowers. 
   The second part of our amendment addresses the Social Security motherhood penalty. The motherhood penalty is just this. In Social Security, it provides lower benefits for women who take time off their jobs to raise their children or to care for a sick parent. Our amendment would eliminate this penalty by allowing people to take time out of the workforce to raise a child or to care for a dependent relative, and to eliminate up to 5 years of zero or very low earnings from those used to calculate their future Social Security benefits. 
   Social Security benefits are based on your average earnings over 35 years. This generally works for men who spend an average of 39 years in the workforce. When Social Security was established in 1935, most women stayed at home. It was assumed most women would get benefits through their husbands. The 35-year average formula fails to recognize that today an increasing number of women work but also take time off to raise children. Thus, the average woman is in the workforce 27 years today. The other 8 years are counted as earning zero dollars, resulting in lower benefits. Our amendment recognizes the importance of care giving, of women taking time out of the workforce to have children, and allows up to 5 years of zero or lower earnings to be exempted when calculating future retirement benefits. 
   I will just give a brief example. Suppose you have a woman who worked throughout her life but took time off to raise three children. She worked for a total of 30 years, retired at age 65. In those 30 years she averaged $20,000 a year in earnings. 
   But since she had 5 years with no earnings while caring for her children, her lifetime average earnings calculated on a 35-year formula is $17,142.  This entitles her to an annual Social Security benefit of $9,369. Under our amendment she would be allowed to erase those 5 zero-earning years, bringing her lifetime average back up to $20,000. As a result, her annual benefits would be increased by about $800, a significant and needed boost. 
   The motherhood penalty will become increasingly important as more women receive benefits based on their own earnings. Today, about 37 percent of women receive Social Security benefits based on their own earnings rather than getting the spousal benefit. But this is expected to rise to 60 percent over the next two generations, by 2060. 
   Finally, the third part of our amendment makes a major contribution to shoring up Social Security for the future. What we do is dedicate the interest savings from paying off the national debt to Social Security. By doing this, we are using good economic times to prepare for the future. These interest savings are substantial, totaling about $120 billion this decade, and growing to $250 billion a year by 2015. This simple step of locking away these savings for Social Security would assure Social Security's fiscal health for the next 50 years. What we are saying is when we buy down the national debt, the savings in the interest payments on that, which would normally go to general revenues, will go to Social Security and not to general revenues. 
   Again, our amendment offers a clear choice. If you want to make Social Security sound and secure for the next 50 years, you should vote for this amendment. If you want to do away with the motherhood penalty and make sure that women have their proper years counted so we do not discriminate against them for raising children, then I think you should vote for this amendment. If you think millions of moderate-income women deserve a financial boost, making sure they get at least 75 percent of their spouse's benefits rather than the 50 to 66 percent they get now, and get a lot of women over that poverty line, I think you should vote for this amendment. 
   There are three parts to this amendment: Do away with the motherhood penalty; second, make sure the spousal benefits are at least 75 percent of their spouse's upon death; third, use the savings from the interest payments to put into Social Security rather than general revenues. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will use it for a small rebuttal. I noticed my friends on the other side going after the Social Security trust funds. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. GRAMS, had an amendment to put money into the Social Security trust fund, and they all voted for it. So much for being consistent around here. 
   Quite frankly, I listen to the arguments on the other side, and I think my friends from the other side want to privatize Social Security. On top of that, they want to say you do not get Social Security until you are 70. They want to raise the retirement age. 
   Don't let all that fog over there cloud what we are trying to do. We are trying to change the motherhood penalty so women are not penalized raising children and getting Social Security. 
   Secondly, our amendment says widows ought to get at least 75 percent of their spousal benefit, rather than the 50 to 60 percent now. 
   Lastly, when we pay down the national debt, you are right, take the savings from that and stick it into Social Security so that money will be there for future generations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it seems as if we can take all kinds of time on the Senate floor--hours, days--talking about how we are going to benefit the richest people in America, many of whom inherited their wealth. After all, that is what estates are; they are wealth that is passed on from one generation to another. I do not have anything against that, but it seems to me we spend an undue amount of time talking about how we are going to help the richest, most well-off people in our country, who, by and large, can pretty well take care of themselves. 
   So I am going to diverge a little bit because I want to talk about a group of individuals in this country who do not fall into that Fortune 500 or 400 or whatever it is--the Forbes 400--people who have the big estates. I want to talk about a group of people who have been discriminated against in our society for far too long and with whom we in Congress had made a pact 10 years ago and President George Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act to say that we, as a nation, are no longer going to tolerate discrimination against any individual in this country because of his or her disability. 
   July 26--a couple weeks from now--will mark the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. As those of us who worked so hard for the ADA predicted, the act has taken its place among the great civil rights laws in our history. On July 26, 1990, we, as a country, committed ourselves to the principle that a disability in no way diminishes a person's right to participate in the cultural, economic, educational, political, and social mainstream. 
   By eliminating barriers everywhere--from education to health care, from streets to public transportation, from parks to shopping malls, and from courthouses to Congress--the ADA has opened up new worlds to people with disabilities. People with disabilities are participating more and more in their communities, living fuller lives as students, coworkers, taxpayers, consumers, voters, and neighbors. 
   As part of the anniversary celebration--the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act--I recently announced the ``A Day in the Life of the ADA'' campaign. I am asking people across the country to send stories about how their lives are different because of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We are going to be using these stories to celebrate our accomplishments and to learn more about what we still must do to give all Americans an equal opportunity to live out the American dream of independence. We already have received many  wonderful stories that show how the ADA is changing the face of America. I look forward to receiving many more. 
   I ask the people to either send these stories by e-mail to adastories@harkin.senate.gov or send them to ``A Day in the Life of the ADA,'' c/o Senator TOM HARKIN, 731 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC, 20510. 
   We want to tell these great stories in the celebration that will take place on July 26. There will be ceremonies at the White House. We will take time here in the Congress to talk more about the Americans with Disabilities Act, what it is, what 
   it was meant to do, and what it has accomplished. 
   The ``A Day in the Life of the ADA'' campaign will create a historical record of the profound impact the ADA has had on the daily life of people with disabilities. I will share with you a couple stories I have already received. 
   I spoke with a woman in Des Moines, IA, who told me that not only had the ADA helped her son, who has a disability, get a job working at a restaurant, but that because of the fact he has that job he has become a role model for other kids with disabilities, to show them that they, too, can get jobs and work. 
   I recently met and spoke with Theresa Uchytil from Urbandale, IA. Theresa is this year's Miss Iowa and hopefully will be next year's Miss America. She was born without a left hand. She told me that the ADA has given her and other people with disabilities confidence to pursue their own dreams. 
   I received a letter from a woman in Waukegan, IL, who is blind, who wrote:  
   The ADA has allowed me to receive my bank statements in braille. This might seem like a small victory to some. Obviously such people have never been denied the ability to read something so personal as a bank statement.  
   I heard from a man in Greenbelt, MD, just outside Washington, DC, who is deaf. I will quote him. He said:  
   When I turn on the TV in the morning, I can watch captions and public service announcements because of the ADA. When I go to work and make phone calls, I use the telecommunication relay services enacted by the ADA. In the afternoon I go to the doctor's office and am able to communicate with my doctor because the ADA has required the presence of a sign language interpreter. After the doctor's office, I decide to go shopping and am able to find a TTY (as required by the ADA) in the mall to call my family and let them know that I will be a bit late in arriving home. ..... In short, the ADA has had a major impact on almost every facet of my life.  
   I heard from a man in Berkeley, CA, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. He said:  
   The ADA has made me able to live independently. I can now get into most every restaurant, movie theater or public place. The ADA has put me on a level playing ground with the rest of society. I realize that if I had been born any other time before I was, I would not be able to lead the life I do. I am going back to school in the fall. I hope to educate people by either being a teacher or a lawyer. I do not think that this would have been possible without the ADA.  
   These are only a few of the many stories we are receiving. I encourage others to send in their stories, again, to create a historical record of the profound impact the ADA has had on the daily lives of people with disabilities, their families and friends, and every American. I encourage everyone to share their stories, their family stories, about how the ADA has improved their lives. 
   For example, I would like to have stories about how the ADA has eliminated segregation in education and health care and the workplace, how the ADA has increased the accessibility of schools and colleges and government and the workplace for people with disabilities. I would like to hear stories about how the ADA has made it possible for people with and without disabilities to enjoy the smaller things that many of us take for granted--going out to a birthday party dinner as a family, 
   going to a movie with a friend, a loved one, or a family member, going to a museum with friends on a Sunday afternoon, or just plain going out to the grocery store to shop for groceries. 
   The ADA has improved people's lives. I need stories that show how the ADA has improved people's lives in any other way, maybe some I have not even thought about. 
   We will share these stories to show how the ADA has benefited people with disabilities and how it has benefited all of American society--by integrating and pulling people from all walks of life into every facet of our lives in America: in education, in the workplace, travel and transportation, and government services. 
   Again, during this time of debate on the estate tax bill, and what we are going to do to help some of the richest people in America, I want to take this time to let people know there are a lot of Americans out there who, because of what we did 10 years ago in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act, are leading fuller, richer, more independent lives. 
   We celebrate that this year on the 10th anniversary on July 26. I ask everyone to help build this record of the ADA successes, again, by sending their stories either by e-mail, at adastories@harkin.senate.gov, or ``A Day in the Life of the ADA,'' c/o Senator TOM HARKIN, 731 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510. 
   By doing this, we will build a historical record. We will show how the ADA has indeed made us a better country, how the ADA has made it possible for people from all walks of life, regardless of their disability, to work, to travel, to enjoy their families and friends. This is what we ought to be talking about in the Senate. This is what America is about, not about helping the few at the top who already have too much but by helping those who have been discriminated against for so many years, shoved into nursing homes, into dark corners, discriminated against in every aspect of their lives, people with disabilities, and how we as a society came together 10 years ago, Republicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion to say we are going to end this kind of discrimination once and for all. 
   That was one of the great bipartisan victories I have seen in my 24 years in the Congress. These are the kinds of things we ought to be debating and doing. 
   I take this time to encourage these stories to be sent in, so when July 26 rolls around and we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, we will have personal stories about how it has helped people from all over the country.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to correct an absurdity in our application of important secrecy policies. This issue would be a laughable example of bureaucratic intransigence except that it is harming workers who may have gotten sick from working on our nuclear weapons. 
   I'm sure that by now all my colleagues are aware that many of our citizens were exposed to radioactive and other hazardous materials at nuclear weapons production plants in the United States. While working to protect our national security, workers at places like Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were subjected to severe hazards, sometimes without their knowledge or consent. We recently passed an amendment to provide compensation to some of those who became seriously ill because of their dangerous work at nuclear weapons plants. 
   The dangers at these plants thrived in the darkness of government secrecy. Public oversight was especially weak at a factory for assembling and disassembling nuclear weapons at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant in Middletown, Iowa. I first found out about the nuclear weapons work there from a constituent letter from a former worker, Robert Anderson. He was concerned that his non-Hodgkins lymphoma was caused by exposures at the plant. But when I asked the Department of Energy about the plant, at first they denied that any nuclear weapons work took place there. The constituent's story was only confirmed when my staff saw a promotional video from the contractor at the site that mentioned the nuclear weapons work. 
   The nuclear weapons production plants were run not by the Defense Department but by the Atomic Energy Commission, which has since been made part of the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy has since acknowledged what happened, and is now actively trying to help the current and former workers in Iowa and elsewhere by reviewing records, helping them get medical testing and care, and seeking compensation. I was pleased this past January to host Energy Secretary Richardson at a meeting with former workers and community members near the plant. The Department specifically acknowledges that the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant assembled and disassembled nuclear weapons from 1947-1975. And their work has helped uncover potential health concerns at the plant, such as explosions around depleted uranium that created clouds of radioactive dust, and workers' exposure to high explosives that literally turned their skin yellow. 
   But at the Iowa nuclear weapons plant the Defense Department was inseparably intertwined with the AEC. The AEC operations were located on the site of an Army ammunition plant. The workers at both sides of the plant actually worked for the same contractor, workers often switched between the plant parts, and workers on both sides of the plant were even exposed to 
   many of the same hazardous materials, including beryllium and depleted uranium. Thus former workers at the plant do not always clearly distinguish the Army from the AEC. 
   And while the Department of Energy is investigating what happened and seeking solutions, the Army is stuck, still mired in a nonsensical policy. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to ``neither confirm nor deny'' the presence of nuclear weapons at any place at any time. They could not admit that nuclear weapons were assembled in Iowa without admitting that there were nuclear weapons in Iowa. So they write vaguely about ``AEC activities,'' but don't say what those activities were. 
   There have been no nuclear weapons at the Iowa site since 1975, but it's well known that weapons were there before that. The DOE says the weapons were there. A promotional video of the Army contractor at the site even says the weapons were there. But the Army can't say it. This makes the Army look ridiculous. 
   But worse, it sends the wrong signal to the former workers. These workers swore oaths never to reveal what they did at the plant. And many of them are still reluctant to talk. They are worried that their cancers or other health problems were caused by their work at the plant. But they feel that they can't even tell their doctors or site cleanup crews about the materials they worked with or the tasks they did. They don't want to violate the oaths of secrecy they took. One worker at the Iowa plant said recently, ``There's still stuff buried out there that we don't know where it is. And we know people who do know, but they will not say anything yet because they are still afraid of repercussions.'' Instead of helping those workers speak out, the Army is forced to share their silence. 
   And Mr. President, to make the position even more indefensible for my workers in Iowa, the Pentagon is not even consistently applying the ``neither confirm nor deny,'' or ``NCND,''  policy. A document recently released by the Pentagon stated that the U.S. had nuclear weapons in Alaska, Cuba, Guam, Hawaii, the Johnston Islands, Midway, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. After the document was released, a Department spokesman said on television that the U.S. never had nuclear weapons in Iceland. Why can the Pentagon talk about nuclear weapons in Iceland but not in Iowa? 
   Mr. President, for the health of our workers, it's time for the Pentagon to come clean. No one is more concerned with keeping real nuclear secrets than I am. But the Pentagon must not hide behind inconsistent policies when workers' lives may be at risk. 
   This amendment is narrowly targeted to require the Defense Department and Energy Department to review their classification and secrecy policies and change them if they prevent or discourage workers at nuclear weapons facilities from discussing possible exposures with their health care providers. The amendment specifically recognizes that this must be done within national security constraints. It also directs the Departments to contact people who may have been exposed to radioactive or hazardous substances at former nuclear weapons facilities, including the Iowa plant. The Department is to notify them of any exposures and of how they can discuss the exposures with their health care providers and other appropriate officials without violating secrecy oaths or policies. 
   I hope all my colleagues will support this common-sense change for government consistency and worker health.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on the Friday before the July 4 recess, the Senate passed the military construction appropriations bill, which included the supplemental spending package, by voice vote. Although there were a number of meritorious items in that bill, if there had been an up or down vote, I would have voted against it for a number of reasons. 
   I was extremely disappointed in the Conferees' decision to drop the $5 million in emergency methamphetamine cleanup funds from the supplemental package. 
   There was strong support for this provision from both Democrats and Republicans. And it was included in both the House and Senate supplemental packages. 
   So, it doesn't make sense why it was suddenly dropped--especially when we're talking about dangerous chemical sites that are left exposed in our local communities. Without this provision, the bill provides hundreds of millions to help a foreign country fight a drug war, but turns a blind eye to one of the biggest drug problems right in our own back yards. That is unacceptable. 
   Our failure to fund the cleanup of these labs is all the more disappointing because this bill is bloated with pork. There is $700 million here for the Coast Guard alone, including $45 million for a C-37A aircraft for the Coast Guard. The C-37 is a Gulfstream V executive jet. It's not even your average corporate jet, but one of the most expensive, top-of-the-line crafts 
   Why should the American taxpayers pay $45 million so the Coast Guard officers can fly in luxury, when the military has trouble keeping its planes aloft because they lack spare parts? There is a drug crisis in this country and an immediate need for funds for peacekeeping operations, but that's no reason to buy luxury jets in an emergency spending bill. 
   Mr. President, without the meth funding, states and local communities will have to bear the burden of cleaning up these highly toxic sites that are found every day in Iowa and throughout the Midwest, West and Southwest. 
   In recent years, the Drug Enforcement Agency has provided critical financial assistance to help clean up these dangerous sites, which can cost thousands of dollars each. 
   Unfortunately, in March, the DEA ran out of funds to provide methamphetamine lab cleanup assistance to state and local law enforcement. That's because last year, this funding was cut in half while the number of meth labs found and confiscated has been growing. 
   In late May, the Administration shifted $5 million in funds from other Department of Justice Accounts to pay for emergency meth lab cleanup. And I believe that will help reimburse these states for the costs they have incurred since the DEA ran out of money. My state of Iowa has already paid some $300,000 of its own pocket for cleanup since March. 
   However, we've got months to go before the new fiscal year--and the number of meth labs being found and confiscated are still on the rise. My $5 million provision in this emergency spending package would have provided enough money to pay for costly meth lab cleanup without forcing states to take money out of their other tight law enforcement budgets. 
   If we can find the money to fight drugs in Colombia, we should be able to find the money to fight drugs in our own backyard. We should not risk exposing these dangerous meth sites to our communities. 
   So I urge the Senate to support adding the $5 million in emergency meth cleanup funds to the FY 2001 Foreign Operations spending bill or another appropriations vehicle. It is unfair to force our state and local communities to shoulder this financial burden alone.

   Mr. HARKIN. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Pension Participant Advocacy Act.'' A similar measure is being introduced by Congressman ROB ANDREWS in the House. 
   It is no secret that the elderly population in America is growing at an unprecedented rate. In 1996, about one in every eight Americans was age 65 or older--that amounts to 33.9 million Americans. That number is expected to double by 2030. 
   Generally, people work for three main benefits, their salary or wages, their health care and their pensions. Of the three, most people tend to focus least on their pensions, at least till they near retirement. But, pensions are not only very important, they are highly variable in their generosity. 
   Ideally, retirement is a three-legged stool. One leg is Social Security. It is  run by the federal government. Almost all employees and their employers are required to pay into Social Security. Appropriately, there is a great deal of legislative concern about Social Security, the only funds available to many retirees. Another leg is regular personal savings generally outside of Congress' purview. And, the third is pensions. Millions receive pension benefits and unfortunately millions of others do not. 
   In the United States, there is no mandatory requirement that an employer provide a pension plan. But, the federal and state governments offer very significant tax benefits to both companies and individuals to entice them to save in a dedicated way for retirement. 
   Ensuring a secure retirement for all Americans is more than just a goal. It's a fiscal necessity. We know from experience that a strong pension system drastically eases the demands on our social safety net. So, year after year, our government invests a large chunk of taxpayer money, revenues not collected, to promote pensions. 
   But while the Federal government has invested huge sums by forgiving and deferring taxes to entice investments in pensions, there has been limited review of how well the system is treating average workers and retirees. But, unfortunately, there are not comparably large and sophisticated groups who speak for average workers. 
   Another problem is the very structure of the federal pension bureaucracy. Nobody has the assigned job of generally looking out for the pension participant. Yes, the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation does provide benefits to participants when their plans go bankrupt. The Treasury and the IRS have the responsibility to make sure that the pension laws in the Tax Code are fairly followed. But that is not their focus. The Department of Labor has considerable pension responsibility. But, their first focus is on the proper management of pension plans' funds. And, the needs of the participants are sometimes in conflict with the financial health of pension plans. In recent years, the Congress has funded programs where pension participants, employees or retirees, can ask some basic questions. But, there is a lack of any systematic effort to uncover unfortunate or abusive practices. 
   Let's look at two pension problems I have recently tried to resolve. 
   Mr. President, as I wrote to the Department of Labor and Treasury this past January, lump sum payments continue to deplete Americans' pension payments by up to 50% with very little disclosure. Employers give new retirees a sheet of paper with two numbers on it--a small, monthly amount and a large, lump sum payment. Imagine getting that piece of paper. Which one would you take? Despite our disclosure law, many employers will not tell you that the larger number actually equals half the value of the smaller number over time. 
   This has been going on for years, and who has spoken up for the participants? The Departments of Labor and Treasury took four months to respond to my letter. If that is the kind of response a Senate office gets, where can pension participants turn when their livelihood depends upon getting answers? Let me tell you the story of Paul Schroeder, a 44-year old engineer who has worked for Ispat Inland, Inc, an East Chicago steel company, for 19 years. When the company converted to a cash balance plan, Paul calculated that his benefits would level off for as long as 13 years. The company would be putting no money into his pension for over a decade. 
   Meanwhile, new workers at the company would get added pension benefits with each pay check. This is called the ``wear away'' system. It is the period in which the cash balance benefit catches up to the value of the old plan benefit. Apparently, this practice is legal because of one sentence that was quietly inserted into an unrelated Treasury regulation just before it was approved in 1991. The EEOC is just now undergoing a detailed study to see if these plans violate age discrimination laws. After almost a decade of older employees having their pension assets frozen indefinitely, I ask you: who advocated on their behalf? 
   I only learned about this issue from a group of IBM employees who spent months clamoring to get our attention here in Congress. Those employees told their story to anyone who would listen. But when pension proposals don't affect the well-connected, who speaks for the participants? 
   I have introduced legislation that has received 47 votes in the Senate to provide for payments and I will try to pass it again. But, we should not need to pass a new law. The existing laws against age discrimination should have clicked in. For years, nobody was looking. 
   The bottom line is that no government agency is really looking out for the interests of pensioners. There are a few private organizations that are desperately trying to protect pension rights. But they're underfunded, scattered around the country, and easily overpowered by the better funded, better organized groups. 
   That is why I am proposing legislation to create an office whose specific function is to advocate for the rights of pensioner participants, both when they are employees and when they are retired. Our nation's seniors depend on their pensions to keep them afloat in retirement, and Social Security was never meant to do it alone. As the elderly population grows, it is in our nation's economic interest to ensure that pension legislation focuses on the best interests of participants. 
   Mr. President, The Office of Pension Participant Advocacy created in this bill would: 
   Actively seek out information and suggestions on pension policies and on Federal agencies which affect pension participants. 
   Evaluate the efforts of Federal agencies, businesses and industry to assist pension participants. 
   Identify significant problems faced by employees and retirees, 
   Make annual recommendations documenting significant pension problems and recommending legislative and regulatory solutions. 
   And examine existing pension plans and determine the extent to which current law serves pensioners in those plans. 
   Mr. President, we have a strong economy. But we also have an obligation to save a place at the table for those who made it strong. Our nation's pensioners deserve a say in the policies that determine their livelihood. They deserve the right to have their interests represented. 
   In the last 25 years, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, commonly known as ERISA has been extremely successful, but it has created a complex web of pension law that gives authority to multiple agencies with no central place people can turn to for help. Time and time again, the needs of pension participants are ignored, and the pensioners who don't have the time or the resources to navigate the web of pension authority are weeded out. 
   We need one central place where pension participants can turn to when problems arise. We need one place in government whose sole obligation is to look out for the general pension interests of employees and retirees concerning their pensions. We need an office that will be an advocate for pension participants. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let's make it clear. We are not talking about an abortion bill. What we are talking about is a contraceptive pill a young woman would get, the morning after she may have been the victim of rape or incest. This amendment does not deal with RU-486, it clearly states it is about denying contraceptive services, and it has no exception for young victims of rape or incest. 
   Right now, under existing law, some localities have chosen to provide minors access to contraceptive pills through community health centers and other programs that are based in the school. The decision to provide school-based contraceptive services is a local decision under current law. A local decision. Not a federal one. But this amendment would change that. 
   This amendment says if a young woman has unprotected sex, or even if she is the victim of rape or incest, and is panic stricken the next morning, she cannot take a contraceptive pill the next morning, not knowing whether she is pregnant or not, in order to prevent a pregnancy from occurring. 
   That is what this is about. 
   And I want to reiterate that the Helms amendment has no exception for the victims of rape or incest.

   This body has gone on record in vote after vote that we should fully fund IDEA. If we can't fully fund IDEA now with the budget surpluses and the economy we have, when will we do it? I do not believe anyone can rationally argue that this is not the time to fulfill that promise.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the increase in funding for the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) enforces civil rights laws in health and human services settings. OCR oversees hospitals, managed care organizations, nursing homes, social service agencies--literally any state, local, or private agency that receives HHS funding, to ensure compliance with civil rights laws. 
   In the next year, OCR will be responsible for enforcing several initiatives of real importance to me and to health care consumers across America. First, OCR will be responsible for enforcing the landmark health information privacy regulations. These regulations will provide consumers with protections against the inappropriate disclosure of their health information. Indeed, Americans are concerned about  who gets to see and use their personal medical information. Privacy is the first defense against discrimination on the basis of health status--an issue I know a lot about through my work on the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   One of OCR'S other top priorities in the coming year is to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by working with states and advocates to develop programs to enable people with disabilities to live in community-based settings, as required by the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision. Just last year, in L.C. v. Olmstead, the Supreme Court held that state Medicaid programs must comply with the ADA's integration mandate. The Court held that under the ADA, people with disabilities have the right to be included in our communities, not segregated behind the closed doors of institutions and excluded from the mainstream. This decision means that unjustified isolation now properly is regarded as discrimination when it is based on disability. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services has already taken steps to ensure that states comply with the Supreme Court's decision. The Department sent a letter to state Medicaid directors and others emphasizing the Court's suggestion that states develop a comprehensive plan for placing qualified individuals with disabilities in less restrictive settings and ensure that their waiting lists for community-based services move at a reasonable pace that is not controlled by the state's endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated. 
   This so-called ``Olmstead Letter'' is a great first step. However, a law is only as effective as its enforcement, and that is why OCR is so important to the civil rights of people with disabilities. This new funding will help OCR to ensure that as we approach the ADA's 10th anniversary next month, the ADA will continue to have a very real effect on the daily lives of people with disabilities and their ability to live and participate in their communities.

   Mr. HARKIN. I am very concerned about the proposed $50 million funding cut to the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) approved by the House Appropriations LHHS Subcommittee. The Senate has recommended that MIP be funded at $680 million, the amount authorized in HIPAA. 
   In 1999, Medicare contractors saved the Medicare Trust Funds nearly $10 billion in inappropriate payments--about $18 for every dollar invested. Any funding cut to MIP is tantamount to the government throwing money out a window. In fact, I believe, because of the tremendous need to reduce an estimated $14 billion in Medicare waste, we  should increase MIP funding. Therefore, I will work hard to ensure that the Senate funding level for this important program is not compromised. It should be higher, not lower.

   Mr. HARKIN. I agree wholeheartedly with you on the importance of ensuring that all students are exposed to challenging courses that lead them on a positive track towards further education, and that teach critical skills that can be practically applied even if the student does not continue their education immediately. While it is certainly just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to strengthening the academic offerings and outcomes for all students, including disadvantaged students, the AP program is something I think we should all be able to agree on supporting.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for sharing your knowledge on this research-proven method of educational reform. As we make the difficult decisions about what should be funding priorities for the Federal government in the vast expanse of options, we certainly do need to be acutely aware of what has been demonstrated as having measurable positive impact on real students. As we move to conference on this appropriations bill, I will encourage everyone to consider the good that smaller learning communities can do for all students, including those for whom just a little extra attention and sense of belonging can mean the difference between violent outbursts as a cry for help and successful completion of high school with goals for the future.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in all the years I have been on this committee and also on the subcommittee, which now numbers 16, this is the earliest we have ever gotten this bill finished. If I am not mistaken, this may be the first time that this was not the last bill to be acted on, whether it has been Republican leadership or Democratic leadership. 
   I thank Senator SPECTER for his great leadership. I thank him for working in such an open and bipartisan fashion with us on this side. I have never had a case where something was done on the Republican side that I didn't know about and that we weren't consulted with every step of the way. I want Senator SPECTER to know how much we really appreciate that. 
   The working relationship has been great with our staff: Bettilou Taylor, Jim Sourwine, Mark Laisch, Mary Dietrich, Jon Retzlaff, Kevin Johnson, Ellen Murray, and Lisa Bernhardt. Our staff has a great working relationship. 
   Again, as we now go into conference with the House, I make a commitment to my chairman that we will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion, as we have always, to make sure we can bring back a strong bill. 
   I think we can be proud of the amount of money we have in education. We have more money in this bill for education than asked for by President Clinton. I believe we are making moves in the right direction. Maybe we vote and disagree here and there in little bits and pieces, but, by and large, what is in the bill for education I think should be a mark and a source of pride for all of us. 
   I thank Senator SPECTER for his leadership on that side.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we have before us is a genuine lockbox amendment by the Senator from North Dakota, and we have a ``box'' amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. Now, notice I said ``lockbox.'' A lockbox is what has been offered by the Senator from North Dakota; no lockbox by the Senator from Missouri. That really is the difference. 
   What do I mean by ``lockbox''? What I mean is that we are trying to treat Medicare as we treat Social Security; that we are going to say that in the future, the Medicare trust fund should be off budget, should not be counted in budget totals, that it should be off budget and should not in any way be able to be tapped into by this Congress or any succeeding Congress to pay for any deficit, to pay for any tax cuts, to pay for any other kind of spending in which this Congress or any future Congress wants to engage. 
   That is really what a lockbox is. You take funds and you set them aside; you put them in a box and you lock it. That means you cannot tap into it. 
   That is what the American people want us to do with Medicare and with Social Security. This is money that they have paid into out of payroll taxes. This is money that has been set aside for them for Medicare--and for Social Security, if we are talking about Social Security. We are only talking about Medicare here. 
   The American people believe very deeply about this; that no Congress ought to be able to say: We want to give a tax cut to the wealthy, and we are going to pay for it by taking it out of the surplus. And if the only surplus we have is Medicare, we will take it out of there, or, if the only surplus we have is Social Security, we will take it out of there. 
   What we are saying on the Democratic side is, no, no deal. We are going to take Social Security and Medicare off budget, lock the money away, you cannot tap into it for tax cuts or spending or anything else. 
   The Senator from Missouri may think that is what he is doing. I heard him describe his amendment as a lockbox, taking it out, but that is not what his amendment does. His amendment does not do that. It does not protect the Medicare trust fund from procedures that might be used by a future Congress to pay for spending or tax cuts totally unrelated to Medicare. 
   I could get into the jargon used around here by talking about points of order and sequestration and stuff such as that. Who understands what all that means, unless it is just a few of us around here. And I am not certain all of us understand it either. 
   But just to put it in simple lay terms that the American people can understand, the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri sort of puts the Medicare surplus in a box. It closes the lid. That looks pretty good, but the next Congress or two Congresses from now may decide: Hey, we have had a downturn in the economy. We might want to give a tax cut to a group. We might want to do some spending. We don't have enough of a surplus in our budget, but we do have a big surplus in that box. In that box there is a big surplus. We will just go open the lid and scoop a little bit out. 
   That is what the Ashcroft amendment allows. It allows a future Congress to open the lid on the box, put the scoop in there, and dig some money out for whatever that Congress wants. 
   What the Conrad amendment does is take the Medicare money our people have paid out of their payroll taxes and puts it in a box, just as Ashcroft does, closes the lid, locks it, and throws the key away. That is the difference between the Conrad amendment and the Ashcroft amendment. What the Conrad amendment says to a future Congress is, if you want a tax cut for the wealthy, if you want to spend on some programs, go somewhere else to get the money. You can't pry open the box in which we have Medicare and Social Security funds; that is to be used only for Medicare and only for Social Security. That is what the Conrad amendment does. 
   Don't be misled that these two amendments are the same. They are not the same. The American people should not be misled. If your goal is to set aside Medicare funds and put them in a box but if a future Congress wants it can go in and open the lid and scoop some money out, vote for Ashcroft. Maybe some people think that is legitimate. Maybe some people say: Well, we should not tie the hands of future Congresses. If they want to take some of that Medicare surplus and use it for something, let them open the lid on the box and take the money out. 
   Maybe some people here believe that. I don't believe that. Senator Conrad does not believe that because it is his amendment. What he says is, we will put it in that box and lock it. The only thing you can use that money for is Medicare, just as we should only use Social Security for Social Security.

   If you want to secure Medicare funding and you want to lock it away, you have to vote for the Conrad amendment. If, however, you want to take Medicare funding and put it in a box and say that future Congresses can go in there, open the lid and take the money out for other things, then vote for Ashcroft. It is that simple. 
   I yield back whatever time I have remaining.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am supporting the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota because I have been involved in this issue for a long time. In 1989, when I was chairman of the subcommittee that my good friend, Senator SPECTER, chairs now, we started funding for the Human Genome Center at NIH. So I have been involved in this effort for a long time and am very supportive of it. 
   I could not have been happier with the announcement that came out this week that we have now completed the map, and they will be completing the sequencing of the human genome. With that, we are going to have a very powerful diagnostic tool that will allow medical practitioners to more accurately assess the health of an individual and their proclivity to come down with an illness or a disease, or to be more predictive of what kind of illnesses to which a person might be subject. 
   Well, that is a very powerful diagnostic tool, and it is going to do a lot to help millions of people all over this world. There may be other spinoffs in terms of gene therapy, and things such as that, but I wish to focus on the diagnostic tool that will help people get better control over their health care. That is the upside. 
   The downside is that in the hands of the wrong person this information could then be used to discriminate against a person who may have a genetic predisposition toward a certain illness. As I understand it, both of the amendments we have before us--the one by the Senator from Vermont and the one by the Senator from South Dakota--prohibit discrimination when it comes to insurance. Well, that is all well and good, but that is only a part of it. 
   Why the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota is the one we need to adopt is that it also prohibits discrimination in the workplace. Why is that important? I understand that earlier my friend from Vermont said we didn't have to be too concerned about this because the Americans With Disabilities Act covered the workplace. Well, as the chief sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act, and one who has lived with it since its inception back in the 1980s, I say to my friend from Vermont that some lower courts have ruled, for example, that breast cancer is not a disability, so the ADA really does not cover the workplace when you come to genetic discrimination. Some lower courts have held that breast cancer is not a disability and not covered by the ADA. If they rule that, are they then going to rule that the gene for breast cancer is covered? Hardly. 
   So that is why I wanted to take this time to make it clear that genetic predispositions and disorders should be covered in employment, because of some of these lower court rulings regarding the Americans With Disabilities Act. So that is why it is so important that we have it in the workplace. 
   Secondly, we need to have better enforcement. The penalties that are in the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont are toothless--$100 a day. Well, a large business concern can factor that into their cost of doing business. That is not really a stiff enough penalty. 
   It seems to me that if I am discriminated against, under the law, I ought to have a private right of action; I ought to be able to go to court and say, wait a minute, my rights are being abused, my civil rights are being abused. And if we have 
   this law that says you can't discriminate against someone because of their genetic predisposition, that person ought to have a right of action. That person ought to be able to go to court and seek redress. So that is why I say the Daschle amendment is the only one that really protects people both in the workplace and in insurance.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It is very straightforward. It does not include a lot of pages of text. All it does is fully fund the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. By passing this amendment, we meet our goal of paying 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure. 
   For years, many on both sides of the aisle have agreed that the Federal Government should increase our support for States' efforts to provide children with disabilities a free and appropriate public education. With this amendment we can do just that. 
   Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which is now known as IDEA, for two reasons. To establish a consistent policy of what constitutes compliance with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment with respect to the education of kids with disabilities, and to help States meet their constitutional obligations. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator WELLSTONE as a cosponsor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of misperception about IDEA. That misperception is amplified in statement after statement until it almost becomes a state of fact that IDEA is a Federal mandate on the States. I hear it all the time: a Federal mandate that is not fully funded. 
   IDEA is not a mandate of the Federal Government on the States. The fact that the Federal courts have said if a State provides a free and appropriate public education to its children--and States don't have to do that--but if a State provides a free and appropriate public education for all of its kids, it cannot discriminate on the basis of race, it cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, or national origin, and in two court cases the court said it cannot discriminate on the basis of disability. 
   Simply because a child has a disability doesn't relieve the State of its obligation under the equal protection clause to provide that child a free and appropriate public education. 
   In 1975, the Congress said because this would be such a burden on the States, we will pass national legislation to help the States meet their constitutional obligation to educate kids with disabilities. That is what IDEA is. The Federal Government said, OK, if you meet these certain requirements, you will be eligible for IDEA for this money. If we had no legislation at all, if there were no Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the States would still have to fund the education of kids with disabilities--not because the Federal Government says so, but because the Constitution of the United States says so. As long as a State is providing a free public education to other kids, they have to provide it to kids with disabilities. It is not a Federal mandate. It is a constitutional mandate. 
   We have said in the Federal Government, when we passed IDEA, we will help. Furthermore, we said in the authorizing legislation, that it would be a goal of the Federal Government to provide for 40 percent of the cost of the average per pupil expenditure for all other kids. We have never reached that 40 percent. It was a goal then. It is still a goal. Senators on both sides of the aisle talked about meeting this goal. Now we have the opportunity to do so. 
   My amendment is a win-win situation for everyone. We are able to fully fund both the IDEA and our general education priorities so that all kids, with and without disabilities, get the education they deserve and they are guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. 
   Over the past 5 years, I have worked hard with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to more than double the appropriation for Part B of IDEA. This year we have included an additional $1.3 billion. Senator SPECTER and I, in a bipartisan fashion, worked very hard to get this increase. Because of the amendment offered by Senator JEFFORDS yesterday and the statements made on the floor, it became clear to me that there is a strong will on both sides of the aisle to fully fund IDEA to meet that 40-percent obligation. 
   Now we can step up to the plate and do it. This week the OMB informed us  that the non-Social Security surplus will reach up to $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. I believe we ought to use these good economic times to prepare for the future. 
   So, Mr. President, as I said, OMB has informed us we are going to have $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years in non-Social Security surplus. That means we can use some of this for a lot of different things: Pay down the national debt, shore up Social Security, Medicare, and make appropriate investments in education. One of the most appropriate investments we can make is to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. But there are a lot of other ways we can help pay for this. For example, we could save dollars by cracking down on Medicare waste fraud and abuse. The HHS Inspector General said last year, Medicare made $13.5 billion in inappropriate payments. Eliminating that waste alone would more than pay for the entire IDEA expenditure. Yet the House-passed Labor-HHS bill actually cuts the funding for detecting waste, fraud and abuse. I hope we can take care of that in conference. My point is we have a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare we can cut out to help pay for this. 
   We have a lot of other things we can do also: Cutting out Radio Marti, and TV Marti; spending by Government agencies on travel, printing and supplies and other items could be frozen. This could save $2.8 billion this year, about $12 billion over 5 years. Pentagon spending could be tied to the rate of inflation. This would force the Pentagon to reduce duplication and other inefficiencies. This change would save taxpayers $9.2 billion this year alone; $69 billion over 5 years. Enhancing the Government's ability to collect student loan defaults would be $1 billion over 5 years. 
   The reason I cite these examples is to show there is a lot of waste and a lot of spending we can tighten down on to help pay for IDEA. We have the surplus, however. All this money that we found out there--as we go through this year, you wait and see, transportation will take a little bit of that money; housing will take a little bit of that money; defense will take a big chunk of that; the Finance Committee will have tax provisions--they want to do away with all the estate taxes now. That will take away a big chunk. I hope we don't pass it but I assume something will come through. 
   There is a big surplus out there and bit by bit special interests are going to come and take some of it away. Now is our time to get in there and say we are going to take enough to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We can do it. We have the money to do it. And, if I listened correctly to my friends on both sides of the aisle, we seem to have the will to do it. 
   I just point out a range of organizations fully support full funding. It is one of the National Governors' Association top priorities. The Education Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities advocates full funding. The National School Boards Association just sent me a letter last week requesting an increase in funding for IDEA. 
   In January of 1997 the majority leader, Senator LOTT, announced that fully funding IDEA was a major component of the Republican agenda. Later, Senator GORTON said that failure to fully fund IDEA is fundamentally wrong--CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, May 13, 1997. 
   In January of 1998 the majority leader and other Republican Senators held a major press conference to announce they were going to introduce a bill, S. 1590, that would, among other things, fully fund IDEA. 
   Senator COVERDELL said the resolution of the issues in that bill were:  
   As important a battle as the country has ever dealt with.  
   On his Web site, Senator GREGG from New Hampshire, who has always been a proponent of fully funding IDEA said that:  
   He will continue to lead the fight to have the Federal Government meet its commitment to fund 40 percent of the special education costs. 
   On his Web site, Senator SANTORUM of Pennsylvania supports full funding for IDEA. 
   Last night, Senator VOINOVICH of Ohio said it is about time we paid for 40 percent of IDEA. That was last night. 
   And last night Senator JEFFORDS, with whom I have worked many years on this issue, said:  
   This body has gone on record in vote after vote that we should fully fund IDEA.  
   Senator JEFFORDS also said:  
   If we can't fully fund IDEA now with budget surpluses and the economy we have, when will we do it? I do not believe that anyone can rationally argue that this is not the time to fulfill that promise.  
   The reason I opposed the JEFFORDS amendment last night, and I said so openly last night in debate, is because his amendment would have taken money out of class-size reduction and out of funding for school modernization and construction to fund IDEA. I said we should not be robbing Peter to pay Paul. We need to reduce class sizes. We need school construction money. 
   In fact, some of the biggest beneficiaries of school construction and modernization are kids with disabilities. 
   Now we have an opportunity to fully fund IDEA because we have these big surpluses, as I said, $1.5 trillion on-budget surpluses over the next 10 years, not counting Social Security. To fully fund IDEA would amount to less than 6 percent of that over the next 10 years. And, like I said before, we wouldn't have to touch the surplus if we just implemented one of my proposals to close up special interest tax loopholes, eliminate wasteful government spending, including Pentagon waste, or deal with Medicare waste, fraud and abuse. If you want to give a gift to the States this year, if you really want to help our local school districts, this is the amendment with which to do it, to fully fund IDEA once and for all. 
   I yield for any comments or suggestions my colleague from Minnesota might have.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his words of support, not only tonight but for all the time I have known him and all the years he has been in the Senate for making kids and education, especially special needs kids, one of his top priorities. 
   I could not help but think when I was listening to the Senator speak, this vote on this amendment--I do not mean to puff it up bigger than it is. We are going to be faced the remainder of this year with vote after vote on what to do with that surplus. We may disagree on whether it is the estate tax cut or marriage penalty--whatever it might be. There might be other things coming down the pike, and we will have our debates and disagreement, but it seems to me that before we get into all that, we ought to do something for our kids with disabilities and we ought to do something that is right and is supported broadly, in a bipartisan way, and supported by our States. 
   I can honestly say to my friend from Minnesota, if every Senator voted for this amendment, they would not get one letter, one phone call taking them to task for their vote in support of this amendment. I believe I can say that without any fear that I would ever be wrong; that no Senator, whoever votes for this amendment, would ever get one letter or one phone call from anyone saying they voted wrong. I believe that because it is so widely supported. 
   Then we can go on with our other debates on tax cuts and other issues with the surplus and how we will deal with it. 
   At this point in time, let us say we are going to take this little bit and invest it in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and, once and for all, meet that 40-percent goal, and we will not have to be talking about it anymore. 
   As I said, this is a very simple and very straightforward amendment, but I will admit, for the record, it is going to take 60 votes. I understand that. It will take 60 votes, but I believe if Senators will just think about what they have said about IDEA and fully funding it and think about that big surplus we have and all of the demands that will be made on that surplus in the future, they just might think: Yes, we ought to carve out a little bit right now and put it into IDEA. It would help our States and our schools and, most of all, help our families who have special needs children who may not have all of the economic wherewithal to give their kids the best education. 
   As I understand it, this is the first vote up or down vote on fully funding IDEA ever. Let's make it our last. 
   I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his support. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Thank you. 
   Mr. President, the figures we just heard from the Senator from Texas really are quite phony. They include all kinds of advanced funding and everything else to come to that figure that the Senator threw out on the 20 percent. 
   But you have to ask yourself: Why are we facing this now? What the Senator from Texas is trying to do is to save one day. It is one day, I tell my friend from North Dakota. 
   This provision was put in there not by me and not by the minority. It was put in there by Senator STEVENS in order to allow us to do the legitimate work we have to do to meet the obligations we have in education and in health and NIH, and all of the other things in this bill which has pretty wide support. It wasn't us. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee put it in. 
   The Senator from Texas--let's be clear about it--is moving the outlays for SSI paychecks from one day to the previous day--that is all he is doing--one day. But that one day will cause about a 6-percent across-the-board cut in NIH, cancer research, Alzheimer's research, education funding, Pell grants, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, IDEA, you name it--a 6-percent across-the-board cut because the Senator from Texas wants to move by one day the payment of SSI. He wants to move it to one day later. Last year, we moved it one day forward. He wants to move it to one day later. 
   Who cares about one day? Why is it such a big deal to go from September 30 to October 1? But if it means that it allows us to move forward with this bill and to have the adequate funding in this bill when we go to conference, it means a lot. 
   This really is a mischievous point of order because it really doesn't do anything. It doesn't save us any money. The money we will spend on SSI will either go out September 30 or it will go out October 1. It is going out. The Senator from Texas is not stopping that money. It is going to go out. It is either going to go out on one day or the next day. He is not saving a nickel. But by doing this, he is causing all kinds of problems on this bill. That is why I say it is just simply a mischievous motion. 
   Of course, I support my colleague, the chairman, in the motion to waive. Hopefully, we will hear from Senator STEVENS on this. But there is really no substance. I guess what I am trying to say is that there is no substance to the motion--none. You don't save a nickel. You don't help anybody. You don't hurt anybody. You just move the payment from one day to the next. That is all. But you sure hurt this bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Montana, who is a strong supporter on the Finance Committee of the permanent normal trade relations with China--and he has worked very hard on this issue--I know he desires, as many others, to get on with that, debate it, have a vote and move on. 
   The Senator is asking this Senator a question on which I do not feel qualified to make an answer. I am not involved in this issue or on the Finance Committee. Right now my interest is getting this bill through. I am trying to help and do what I can to get the amendments through and get adequate funding for education, for NIH, for health care, for human services, to try to educate our kids, and attend to the human needs of our people. We are trying to get this through. 
   I have not had time now to consider when the PNTR should be brought up. I know my friend from Montana is obviously well versed in this subject. I probably would accede to his knowledge of this issue and when it ought to be brought up. As to my own view, I don't think this Senator is qualified to respond.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, back to the point at hand, I want everyone to understand what this mischievous motion is all about. All it does, in order to save the money, is move the date from October 1 to September 30. Last year, we moved it up to October 1; we moved it back to September 30. 
   The motion of the Senator from Texas says, no, you can't do it September 30; you have to do it on October 1. In fairness and in reality, the SSI checks should go out at the end of the month. If the Senator has an objection, he should have filed it last year because we moved it from September 30 to October 1. SSI checks are to go out the end of the month. All we are doing is bringing it back to where it really ought to be, at the end of the month. 
   Be that as it may, we are only talking about 1 day. I don't think too many people are hurt by 1 day. The Senator moves it back to October 1 when it ought to be September 30. 
   What does his motion do if it is upheld? We will have almost a $3 billion cut in education, a $1.4 billion cut in NIH, a $210 million cut from the Centers for Disease Control, a $300 million cut from Head Start, a $77 million cut from community health centers. 
   I heard some talk earlier about going to conference and taking care of it there. The House bill is lower than ours. If we cut these numbers here, when we go to conference, we will be locked into the lower numbers. So it has a great impact. 
   We have a lot of amendments that have been filed--not only on the Democratic side but the Republican side as well--from Senators COLLINS, DEWINE, SMITH, LOTT, HUTCHISON, COVERDELL, ASHCROFT, HELMS, NICKLES, SMITH, GRAMM, and a whole bunch on our side, too. 
   How can we debate these amendments in any kind of a legitimate fashion, if, in fact, we don't even know what kind of money we are talking about? Some of the amendments add money; Some take it away; Some modify. 
   If we go ahead and have the amendments, we don't know whether the motion from the Senator from Texas is going to hold or whether it will be waived, so we will be debating these amendments in a vacuum without the full knowledge of exactly what dollar amounts we are looking at. Are we going to cut it by 6.75 percent across the board or not? We don't know that yet.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a couple minutes. I heard the Senator from Texas talking about there is never enough. Of course, he just talked about Democrats on this side offering amendments to increase funding. I thought what is good for the goose is good for the gander. 
   There are Senators on that side of the aisle who have amendments to increase spending in this bill: Senator COCHRAN, Senator COLLINS, Senator DEWINE, Senator INHOFE, Senator JEFFORDS. Those are the only ones I have right now from their side that I know of who add money to the bill. It is not only Democrats; Republicans, too. There are some on that side of the aisle, as well as on this side of the aisle, who understand we have unmet needs in this country when it comes to dealing with education, health, human services, and research. 
   I point out there is all this talk about how much this budget has increased. It all depends on how you look at it. It depends on your baseline. It depends on your numbers. The Senator from Texas probably knows that as well as anybody around here. So we can look at it a different way. 
   Let's look at it this way, for example: Twenty years ago, the share of the dollar that went for elementary and secondary education in this country that came from the Federal Government was a little over 11 cents. In other words, 20 years ago, 11 cents out of every dollar that was put into elementary and secondary education came from the Federal Government. Today, that is down to 7 cents. We are going backwards. We put the burden on our property taxpayers around the country. It is an unfair tax, a tax that can be highly regressive, especially in an area where there are a lot of elderly people who may not be working and live on Social Security, but they still have to pay the property taxes. When one looks at it that way, one can say we are shirking our responsibility. If we had just kept up that 11-percent level for the last 20 years, we would not be having all these amendments. 
   Second, the figures they are throwing out about a 20-percent increase is about as phony as the piece of paper it is written on because that takes into account a lot of things that are not figured into how much we are actually increasing programs. If one looks at the program increases--education and the other program increases--this year over last year, it comes in at a little over 9 percent, somewhere between 9 and 10 percent.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Vermont. I want to make it clear I am not rising in opposition to his goal. Senator JEFFORDS' goal is the same goal I have. We both want to do everything we can to fully fund, on the Federal level, our stated goal of paying 40% of the costs of special education. We should do it. So I agree with the Senator on that. Senator JEFFORDS has been a stalwart supporter of that goal. I believe I have been, too. So I do not rise in opposition to what my friend from Vermont is trying to do Just like me, he wants to educate kids with disabilities and ensure the Federal Government meets its authorized funding goal that was stated in the bill, in IDEA, when it was passed 25 years ago. 
   I do, however, feel compelled to clarify once again, as I have every year that this issue has come up, usually presented by the Senator from New Hampshire, the terms of the 40 percent. The stated assumption that the Federal Government is to fund 40 percent of the cost of educating children with disabilities is not correct. You must look at the legislation. The authorizing legislation of 25 years ago authorized the maximum award per State as being the number of children served times 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. It was not 40 percent of the cost of educating kids with disabilities.

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator asks me a legitimate question. As I understand it, under the Voinovich amendment, IDEA is an allowable use under title VI. I believe that is well covered in the Voinovich amendment. 
   Again, the Senator wants to restrict the use of the construction and modernization money. A lot of it will be used for accessibility. Some may not be. Some may be used to repair a ceiling. A ceiling is leaking, and they need to repair it. It might not just help kids with disabilities, it would help all kids. I would not want to narrow it this way.

   Mr. HARKIN. I just heard my friend from Vermont say some magical words with which I totally agree. I wrote them down as he said them: ``Take budget surpluses and meet our commitments.'' I agree with that. 
   Do you know what? Just this week we now found out we are going to have $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years we didn't know we were going to have in surplus. 
   If my friend from Vermont wants to offer an amendment to fully fund IDEA, and to take it out of the surpluses, I am with him 100 percent of the way because he would be right on. The Senator just said that: ``Let's take our budget surpluses.'' I agree with that. 
   That is not what my friend is doing. He is taking it out of school modernization and construction. 
   I say to my friend from Vermont, if you want to rewrite the amendment and take it out of surpluses in the future, I am with you.

   Mr. HARKIN. We should not be taking it out of school construction and modernization--not at all. Our local school districts need this money. Go out and talk to your school districts. The people who are paying our property taxes are getting hit pretty darn hard. Ceilings are falling down. They are leaking. They need this help from the Federal Government. We have the wherewithal to do it. And that is what we ought to stick with. 
   If the Senator wants to offer an amendment to fully fund IDEA, take it out of the $1.9 trillion budget surplus--``take it out of the budget surpluses,'' as my friend said, I am in lockstep with him because that is what we ought to be doing with that surplus. We ought to be meeting this basic goal of our Federal Government. 
   Of course, while I believe some of the surplus should be 
   invested in quality education, we don't need to touch the surplus to meet the goal of fully funding IDEA. There are many savings we could achieve that could more than pay for the investment. 
   For example, look at Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. While we've cut it over the last few years, the HHS IG testified before our Subcommittee this March that last year Medicare made $13.5 billion in inappropriate payments. Eliminating that waste alone would more than pay for IDEA. Yet, the House passed Labor-HHS bill actually cuts funding for auditors and investigators. That means we would lose hundreds of millions more to fraud and abuse. 
   In addition, I've introduced The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1999 to promote greater fiscal responsibility in the Federal government by eliminating special interest tax loopholes, reducing corporate welfare, eliminating unnecessary programs, reducing wasteful spending, enhancing government efficiency and requiring greater accountability. This bill would result in savings of approximately $20 billion this year and up to $140 billion over five years. 
   For example, by enhancing the government's ability to collect defaulted student loans, the bill would save $1 billion over five years. By ending tax deductions for tobacco promotions that entice our children to smoke, we'd save $10 billion. And by limiting the foreign tax credit that allows big oil and gas companies to escape paying their fair share of royalties, we'd save about $3.1 billion.

If we are going to do that, then I have no objection to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. But if we are going to pick and choose, well, then, maybe we ought to think about which amendments and how we are going to balance these off between maybe amendments on that side and amendments on this side. 
   Are we going to have a $100 million cutoff or a $150 million cutoff on administrative costs and say we will take the first ones out of the block up to that point? Where do we draw the line?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me a little bit of time. I appreciate what the Senator from Minnesota said a while ago. He is absolutely right. We are blaming these kids. 
   Title I: Do my colleagues know how much each kid gets from title I? Somewhere between $400 and $600 a year. Go to the best schools in America in high-income areas where they have nice houses and high incomes. Do my colleagues know what they are spending on kids there? Six to eight thousand dollars. Yet we are going to put $400 to $600 into some of the kids who have the poorest lives. 
   As the Senator said, they move around a lot. They have been denied the opportunity since they have been born, and we expect all these great results from $400 to $600 per student. 
   If the Senator from New Hampshire wants to propose we spend $6,000 on each one of those poor kids, then maybe we will see them start to advance more rapidly, but on $400 to $600 we are not going to do it. The Senator's amendment would only get that up just a little bit more. We are still way behind in what we ought to be doing in this country to help low-income students attain the same opportunity in education as kids from better, higher income areas are getting. The Senator from Minnesota is right on with this amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. To this Senator, it makes eminently good sense. We are talking about education and safety in education. Senator LAUTENBERG has an amendment on gun safety. That is what the Republicans do not want to vote on. Yet the Senator from New Hampshire said: Relevant amendments. I am looking at the list of amendments we have. They all deal with education in one form or another.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I find it interesting, my friend from New Hampshire making this argument. Four years ago, when the Senator from Texas offered a gun amendment on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I didn't hear a peep from my friend from New Hampshire, not a word. But now, when we want to address the issue of school violence and guns, the Senator from New Hampshire says: Oh, well, now we can't discuss that. It is not relevant. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire knows, as well as I do, there is no rule in the Senate that demands relevancy. That is the House. That is why we are the great deliberative body that we are. We can debate and discuss things. If the Senator wants to go back to the House, where they have a Rules Committee, and they only discuss issues that the Rules Committee says are relevant--that is the House of Representatives. This is the Senate. We do not have such a rule. Thank God we do not because it allows us, as Senators, to have the kind of open and free debate and discussion that I think distinguishes the Senate from the House of Representatives. That allows us a time to cool things down, as Thomas Jefferson said. 
   We are willing to bring up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and agree to a time limit. We could be done in 1 day. But the Republicans do not want to vote on the gun issue. 
   They don't want to have to belly up to the bar and vote to keep guns out of the hands of kids. They don't want to have that amendment. Therefore, all of the rest of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is held hostage by the refusal on the Republican side to allow even 1 hour of debate and an up-or-down vote on the Lautenberg amendment. That is the essence of it right now. As my friend from Nevada said, we are willing to go to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act right now with a time limit, debate them, vote them up or down. It is the other side that won't let that happen.

I am checking to find out whether or not that is going to be standard fare for the remainder of this bill. I support the Senator's amendment, but if we have a unanimous consent where some don't get an opportunity to offer second degrees and others do--we ought to play under the same rules is what I am saying. I ask the minority whip whether or not we are going to do that.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to speak about S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999. I urge the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, to act quickly to bring this bill to the floor. We have no excuse for delay in providing life-saving treatment to women who have been diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. 
   As many of you in this body know, this is an issue I take very seriously. My only two sisters both had breast cancer and died from the disease. Sadly, they contracted breast cancer at a time when regular mammograms and improved treatment methods were not widely used or available. 
   Over the past several years, we have made a great deal of progress against breast cancer, but there is still a long way to go. In particular, we've been able to secure significant increases in funding of research to understand the causes and find treatments for breast cancer. 
   Look how far we have come. Almost a decade ago, when I looked into the issue of breast cancer research, I discovered that barely $90 million was spent on breast cancer research. 
   That is why in 1992, I offered an amendment to dedicate $210 million in the Defense Department budget for breast cancer research. This funding was in addition to the funding for breast cancer research conducted at the National Institutes of Health. My amendment passed and--overnight--it doubled federal funding for breast cancer research. 
   Since then, funding for breast cancer research has been included in the Defense Department budget every year. 
   Today, I am proud to say, between the DoD and NIH, over $600 million is being spent on finding a cure for this disease. 
   Scientific researchers are making exciting discoveries about the causes of breast cancer and its prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and control. These insights are leading to real progress in our war against this devastating disease. We know better than ever before how a healthy cell can become cancerous, how breast cancer spreads, why some tumors are more aggressive than others, and why some women suffer more severely and are more likely to die of the disease. 
   For example, discovery of the BRCA1 gene has led us to better identify women who are at risk of breast cancer, so the disease can be caught early and treated. And of course the development of cancer-fighting drugs like tamoxifen owes a great deal to our federal research investment. 
   But our success in building our research enterprise will be pointless if breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and cures are not available to the public. 
   That is why, a decade ago, as chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked to create a program, run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to provide breast and cervical cancer screening for low-income, uninsured women. 
   This program is run nationwide and is tremendously successful. In Iowa, almost 9,000 women have been screened. 
   Nationally, more than one million low-income American women have been screened. Of these, more than 6,000 were diagnosed with breast cancer and 500 with cervical cancer. 
   This program is a great success. But it is only the first step. Congress must now provide the next critical piece: funding for treatment services once a woman has been diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. Too often, women diagnosed through this program are left to scramble to find treatment solutions. 
   I recently heard about this terrible problem from one of my constituents. Her name is Barbara. Five years ago, Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer through the CDC's program. Uninsured, she struggled to find treatment. Several doctors refused to treat her because she lacked insurance. Eventually, through a hodgepodge of sources and some volunteer services in Iowa she was able to receive chemotherapy. But today, she owes over $70,000 in medical bills. She writes, ``My bills are so high I often wonder if I should quit treatment so I will not saddle myself and my family with so much debt.'' 
   Barbara is one of the lucky ones. Many women who have been diagnosed through this program do not get treated at all. 
   The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act has 70 Senate cosponsors from both parties. 
   Its companion bill, H.R. 4386, has passed the House of Representatives with a vote of 421-1. There is no excuse for any further delay in the Senate. 
   We should get this legislation through, combine it with the House bill, and get it to the President for his signature as soon as possible. 
   I note for the record, the original cosponsor of this bill was our now departed colleague, Senator John Chafee. He was the original sponsor. It has 70 cosponsors. Those who worked so long with John Chafee admired him so much. I think it would be a fitting tribute to him to get this bill through as soon as possible and get it to the President for his signature. 
   This is S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999. As I said, its companion bill passed the House 421-1. I think we should pass it as soon as possible. That is why I am taking this time to talk about it, to encourage our distinguished majority leader to bring it to the floor as soon as possible.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, this morning I was invited to the White House for a truly historic announcement. Through the collaboration of government and private sector efforts, scientists have completed the first rough map of the human gene. I believe history will prove this the most significant scientific development of our generation. Its implications for improving the health and well-being of people are truly astounding. 
   Today's announcement was especially fulfilling for me. In 1989, when I served as chair of the subcommittee responsible for this bill, I began the funding for the Human Genome Center at NIH, and the race to map the genome began in earnest. At that time, many criticized the move, saying it was a waste of time and money and couldn't be done in our lifetimes. 
   I listened very carefully to Dr. James Watson, the Nobel Prize winner who first discovered the double helix of our DNA, and he was the first director of the genome center. He talked to us at great length about the possibilities of not only mapping the human genome but sequencing the entire human genomic code. At that time a lot of us were captivated by this concept, that we could actually have the blueprint of  life that hitherto has been known to no human being, but only to the Almighty. 
   By breaking down this human genetic code, sequencing every one of the 3 billion pairs that every human has, it would, as Dr. Watson said, provide more than a blueprint, but it would provide the source of research that could very rapidly bring to a close our search for an end to some of the more debilitating diseases that have afflicted mankind for thousands of years. Knowing the genetic code, researchers will now be able to more precisely determine the genetic markers that people have that predispose them to one disease or another. 
   It was Dr. James Watson who really got the policymakers here in the Congress excited about and interested in this human genome project. I happened at that time to be the chair of the subcommittee. As Dr. Watson explained to us what this would do, I had probably just enough engineering background and mathematics background to get a feel for what this could possibly mean. As a result, we began to fund the human genome project and center. 
   Today's announcement also demonstrates the importance of our drive to double funding for medical research. Senator SPECTER and I are committed to this effort. The bill provides the third installment of a $2.7 billion increase, the largest ever of a 5-year plan, to double funding for NIH. The completion of mapping the human genome will yield tremendous advances in the search for medical breakthroughs in heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's. We are on the way to learning more than we ever thought possible to cure human diseases. The reward will be reflected in the faces of MS, multiple sclerosis, patients who may live longer and better lives because research isolated the gene that causes their dread disease. We will see it in the faces of Parkinson's patients who will experience an improved quality of life from a drug targeted to their individual genome type. And we will see it in the faces of cancer patients whose lives may one day be saved by gene therapy. 
   Yet as we celebrate this great milestone, we must be looking to the challenges ahead. I, of course, look forward to the day when genetic discrimination will be illegal, both at the workplace and in insurance. Genomic technologies have the potential to lead to better diagnosis and treatment and ultimately to the prevention and cure of many diseases and disabilities. But without antidiscrimination protections, Americans will forego early diagnosis and treatment for fear of discrimination in health insurance and employment. 
   So we cannot let discrimination or the fear of discrimination threaten our ability to conduct the very research we need to understand, treat, and prevent genetic diseases. That is why Senator DASCHLE, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DODD, and I have introduced the Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act. Our legislation would provide greatly needed protections against genetic discrimination in both employment and insurance and prohibit inappropriate disclosure of that information. I urge all my colleagues to 
   join in passing anti-genetic-discrimination legislation to allow the research of the human genome project to reach its full potential. 
   In conclusion, I offer my heartiest congratulations and appreciation to every individual who worked on this project. There is no higher calling than this work, saving human lives. These outstanding scientists and researchers made this historic day possible. Not only did they meet their timetable, they beat it, and that is what I call real success. 
   In that vein I want to pay special tribute to Dr. James Watson whose pioneering efforts made today's breakthrough possible and who, at one critical point in this human genome project several years ago, made the decision with the new types of supercomputers we had to ratchet up the number of base pairs that they would be investigating and sequencing, to a much higher level than was ever done before. Because of that, we were able to complete the sequencing of the human gene now rather than 10 or 15 years from now. 
   I also commend Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the human genome project at NIH. His brilliant and charismatic leadership of the project has been the engine driving this effort. 
   I might say Dr. Collins headed not only the effort here in the United States, but this has been a multinational effort, and this morning, at the White House, we had Prime Minister Blair on closed circuit television. He was in London. He had his scientists around him. They had provided great support for our project, as had the French and the Germans, the Swiss, the Chinese, the Japanese, and a number of others. They had all provided help and support for sequencing this human gene. Dr. Francis Collins led this international effort. 
   Finally, I also pay tribute to Dr. Craig Venter, a former NIH scientist now the head of a private entity called Celera Genomics. It is the private sector firm that has been central to today's breakthrough. Dr. Venter, again, at a critical point, came up with a new way of discovering and sequencing more base pairs in a shorter period of time than had ever been done before. Again, because of his insight and his leadership and efforts, and his own private enterprise, he was able to help us reach this day a lot sooner. 
   I think that also points out the benefit of the tremendous relationship we have had in this country between public-sector-funded basic research and private-sector-funded research. Most--I would not say all--of the basic research done in this country is funded publicly by our taxpayers through the money that we appropriate here in the Congress. There is some basic research done by the drug companies, that is true. But in most of the research done in the private sector they take the basic research that is funded publicly and determine whether or not there is something there that can be made into a drug or therapeutic or intervention or diagnostic tool that can be used in the private sector, in the real world, to help either to stop the onset of a certain illness, to cure it once it has onset, or to make the illness less invasive and less detrimental to the normal life of a person. 
   With this marriage, we have in the United States cultivated a very unique body of health research. Today's announcement, with the public and private sector together, illustrated that. 
   Again, my congratulations to Dr. Venter for his leadership in the private sector.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his kind words. I was thinking as he was talking on this specific project, the human genome project, it is true I happened to be chairman at that time and we started funding it because of what Dr. Watson was able to get across to us when he explained what this would mean down the road. I must say, when I turned over the gavel to Senator SPECTER in 1995, there was not even a bump in the road. We always worked together on this. When he took over as chairman, we continued our strong support for NIH and our strong support for the human genome project. 
   As the Senator from Nevada said, it has truly been good bipartisan teamwork. I do not mean to say only the two of us. The members of the committee have been very much involved in this through the years. 
   Looking back now and seeing what has happened gives me goose bumps because when we first started this I checked with some people to find out what it would mean to sequence the human genes. We knew we could map it, but to sequence the 3 billion base pairs of genes, of cold human genome, I asked them how long: Maybe 25 years; maybe we will get it done in 25 years, maybe longer. 
   Even then they did not know if they could really get them all sequenced. So I would talk with Dr. Watson about it, and he would say: No, it may take us that long, but we should start on it; we should not put it off any longer; we should start on it. 
   I thought when we first started this it was going to take literally 20 years, as an outside estimate. As I said in my remarks, there came a time when Dr. Watson and some of his team figured out a better way of sequencing these genes, and that collapsed the timeframe right there. It took money. The whole effort in the human genome project has been people and money. If one has the people and the money, one can get it done. It took people to do it, but it took money to buy the big computers. The faster the computers got, the better it was. And along came Craig Venter with a different concept on how to do this, and that again collapsed the timeframe. 
   To think we started this project literally a decade ago, in 1990, and here we are 10 years later. Having the entire human genome sequenced is just mind boggling. It really is the Rosetta stone. Before that, they did not know how to read the Egyptian hieroglyphics. When they found the Rosetta stone, they could break the code. 
   That is what this is. It is going to provide the best tool researchers all over the world have ever had. The beauty of it is that any scientist anywhere in the world can go on the Internet right now and get all the information they need. Every sequence is now in the public domain. It is not being held privately. Any researcher can get access to it. 
   I say to my friend from Nevada, I cannot wait for the next 10 years to see what is going to happen. We are going to see an explosion of new findings researchers are going to come up with that are truly going to be mind boggling. 
   In the next 10 years, mark my words--I probably will not be here; maybe the Senator from Nevada will be here--by gosh, we are going to look back and say the first decade of the 21st century was the decade when we truly understood disease and illness, the things the Senator from Nevada talked about--Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease. Not only will we understand it, we will know how to go right in there and fix it 10 years from now. Mark my words.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this side has no objection to the amendment. In fact, we wholeheartedly support the amendment. I compliment the Senator from Missouri for his leadership, and I also compliment Senator HOLLINGS on this issue. 
   Community health centers are really the last sort of backstop for so many people in this country who don't have health insurance--44 million people in America don't have health insurance. Mainly, these are the ones who, right now, for their health needs really need the community health centers. We have about seven in our State of Iowa. We are opening another one this summer. About 66,000 people are served per year in the State of Iowa by our community health centers. 
   The really good thing--and the Senator from Missouri knows it--about community health centers is they are engaged in preventive health care, keeping people healthy in the first place, not just coming in when they are sick. They do a lot of outreach work with low-income people. They help with their diets, lifestyles, and with the medicines they need to keep them healthy. That is one of the great services they provide. 
   We increased the funding for community health centers over last year by $100 million. This would add another $50 million on to it. The need is actually even more than that, but as the Senator from Missouri knows, we have all these things we need to balance in the bill. This is a welcome addition to our community health centers. 
   Again, I compliment the Senator from Missouri for his leadership. We happily accept the amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here as the ranking member on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, which is pending this morning. We had hoped Senators would come over and offer amendments. We had a good amendment earlier by Senator BOND from Missouri. I thought we could move ahead on that, but it looks as though we have diverged to other issues. 
   As long as that is the case, I feel constrained also to talk about the problems we have with high gasoline prices in the Midwest. 
   I was listening to my colleague from Alaska speak. Quite frankly, I got to thinking about what is happening in the Midwest and upper Midwest with high gasoline prices. It occurred to me there are all kinds of rumors going around about why this is happening: There is a broken pipeline; there is a shortage of crude oil; reformulated gasoline, with ethanol is the problem--there is all this talk swirling around out there, everybody blaming everybody else. 
   No one knows the answers. That is why yesterday I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources asking him to hold emergency public hearings to subpoena the heads of the major oil companies, bring them to Washington and put them under oath, and then start asking them the tough questions. Then I believe we might get to the bottom of it. 
   I say to the chairman of the Energy Committee, use the powers of subpoena. Bring the heads of the oil companies to Washington. Maybe they do have an answer. Maybe there are logical reasons why the price of gasoline is so high. I doubt it, but let them have their say. I say put them under oath, just as we did with the tobacco company executives a few years ago. Let's put them under oath and ask them the tough questions. Let Senators from both sides ask them the questions about why we have these high and divergent gasoline prices in the upper Midwest. Maybe we can get somewhere and find answers. 
   I also asked the head of the Federal Trade Commission to do the same thing: subpoena records and subpoena the oil company executives to come to Washington in an open, public hearing so that the public can hear for themselves the answers to these questions. 
   I want to talk for a moment about all of the claims and assertions going around that reformulated gasoline and ethanol are the cause of the increase in prices in the upper Midwest. I just heard the Senator from Alaska allude to reformulated gasoline being part of the problem. If reformulated gasoline is the problem, then why is it that we have reports that of instances where reformulated gasoline, including where ethanol is used, is actually below the price of conventional gasoline. 
   That has happened in Louisville, KY, and St. Louis, MO, where they have an RFG requirement, according to EPA. 
   EPA has said that RFG with ethanol would not be more than a penny a gallon higher than RFG without ethanol. Even that may be high. Yesterday, in Chicago, the price of conventional gasoline at wholesale was $1.24 a gallon. The price of reformulated gasoline with ethanol was $1.24 a gallon. It was the same price at the wholesale level. And said, in some markets, we found that reformulated gas is at a lower price than conventional gasoline. That makes sense because ethanol is now actually cheaper than gasoline. 
   The Senator from Alaska talked about an energy policy. One of the energy policies of this administration has been to promote the use of ethanol and renewable fuels. I know the Presiding Officer is a big supporter of ethanol, too. So is this Senator. But every time we try to promote ethanol, we are stymied by the oil companies. They have some reason why they cannot use ethanol. I will tell my colleagues why they do not want to use ethanol: Because they cannot control it, and if we continue to produce more ethanol in this country, it is going to provide an alternative to gasoline which will keep the price of gasoline down. 
   That is purely and simply why the oil companies do not want ethanol. We have been through this battle going clear back to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and earlier. 
   Years ago, the oil companies put lead in their gasoline. We found out lead was causing all kinds of problems, physiological problems in kids and adults. So we had to force them to take the lead out. In order to keep the octane up, then they said: We are going to use these aromatic and toxic compounds, such as toluene, benzene, and xylene. They put that witch's brew together in the gasoline to keep the octane up. 
   Then we found out many of these compounds were air polluting, toxic, and carcinogenic. About that time, around 1990, we passed the Clean Air Act. We in the Senate mandated an oxygenate requirement of 3.1 percent for gasoline to clean up the air and to meet clean air standards. 
   That is what the Senate adopted. It went to conference. I thought we had it settled that we were going to have 3.1 percent. The oil companies weighed in. They got that knocked down to 2.0 percent. 
   We may not have appreciated what they were up to. Two percent oxygen is better than nothing so we went with 2 percent. But the oil companies had something called methyl tertiary butyl ether, which they could use as an oxygenate and also that would help meet the clean air standards, at the 2-percent level. MTBE would not have been so heavily used at the 3.1 percent level because MTBE has a much lower oxygen content than ethanol. 
   Ethanol could do it at the 3-percent level but not MTBE. So the oil companies got back in, knocked it down to 2 percent, and guess what happened. The market was flooded with MTBE, and because the oil companies have control over it, it has kept the production of ethanol down for the last decade. 
   Then what did we find out? First of all, we had the lead that the oil companies pushed off on us. Then we had the aromatics and toxics which they pushed off on us. Now we have MTBE which they pushed off on us, and it is polluting water supplies all over the country. State after State is beginning to ban MTBE, such as California and other States. I assume that presently, or very shortly, we are going to have a ban on all MTBE in the United States. 
   They fooled us once, they fooled us twice, and they fooled us three times. Are we going to let them fool us again? Now they say they can come up with something else. Now they have something else they are going to try to put in the gasoline to meet the Clean Air Act. They want to get rid of the oxygenate requirement in fuel totally and do it their way. Then ethanol does not have a role. That is the oil companies for you. They stymied everything we have ever tried to do to provide for alternative source fuel, especially ethanol. 
   It costs basically the same amount of money to take oil out of the ground today as it did a year ago or a year and a half ago. It does not cost any more. Yet we see the price going up. 
   The International Energy Agency has pointed out we have a greater supply, than demand of oil by about 3 million barrels a day. I have always thought, if supply exceeds demand, the price goes down. The oil companies have stood that on its head. We have an excess of supply over demand by 3 million barrels a day and the price is way up. 
   The Senator from Alaska said that over the next--I don't know what timeframe he was using--that the oil companies would need $1.5 trillion for new infrastructure, $1.5 trillion for new pipelines, new refineries, new infrastructure for oil and gas. Yet we try to get a few million dollars to help ethanol production, to help biomass fuels which are renewable. We need to get a few million dollars in for the use of hydrogen in fuel cells and for fuel cell research, which would be a tremendous  alternative to burning gasoline in our cars--where you could take solar energy, in the form of direct solar energy or biomass, or hydroelectric, use that power to separate hydrogen from oxygen, take the two atoms of hydrogen off of the water, separate the hydrogen off, use that hydrogen--you can compress it, you can store it, you can pipe it--you can even liquefy it; that is a little expensive--and then you can put that through a fuel cell. As it goes through a fuel cell, it combines again with oxygen, and it makes electricity. And you use that electricity to power lights, to drive a car, to drive a bus. That is being done today. 
   We have buses running in Vancouver, British Columbia powered only by fuel cells. We have the technology. It is a little expensive right now, I grant that. But the more we mass-produce it, the cheaper it is going to become. 
   The future for energy production and energy use is not bleak; it is very bright. It is clean, it is renewable, and it is plentiful. If we can get out from underneath the grip that the oil companies have on America, if we can move ahead, instead of $1.5 trillion for new infrastructure for oil and gas, if we just take a fraction of that amount of money and put it into fuel cell production, put it into biomass fuels and solar energy and the production of ethanol, we could have a blend of fuels in this country that would offset the increases we would need over the next 20 to 50 years. 
   But this Congress will not invest in it. This Congress--will not invest nor have other Congresses invested--in what is needed for clean, renewable energy in the form of hydrogen extraction for fuel cells. 
   As I said, we have two paths to go. We can go down that same path we have been going down with the whole carbon cycle, using more and more oil, refining it, trying to clean up the air, trying to clean up oil spills, or we can go for clean, renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel, and hydrogen for use in fuel cells which are much more efficient, too, by the way. 
   So, no, we do not have to continue to pay obeisance to the oil companies. I think maybe now, with what is happening in the upper Midwest, what we see happening around the country, maybe now Congress can start to move and make some changes in our energy policy. 
   The bottom line: Get the oil company executives here. Put them under oath. Ask them the tough questions. Then we will begin to get to the bottom of this. 
   I did not mean to really talk on energy, but I heard the Senator from Alaska talking about it and thought I should respond because I believe there is another side to this story other than just going down the pathway of promoting oil and more oil use in this country and around the world. 
   But as I said in the beginning, we are here because of the Labor-HHS bill and the impact it has on our society in all of its forms: education, health, job training, medical research. 
   I believe one of the crucial aspects of our bill that we fund here every year on Health and Human Services is the need--the great need--we have in this country to ensure that our elderly citizens have access to quality health care. That is why the administrative costs of medicare and the running of the program fall under our jurisdiction. The actual levels of Medicare and Social Security fall under the Finance Committee. But we are charged with the responsibility of making sure it runs and that the elderly get the kind of quality health care accessibility that they need. 
   One of the items impacting the elderly the most in that regard today is the extremely high price of prescription drugs. 
   Last night, we had a crucial vote in the Senate on that issue. We had the first real vote this Congress on whether our seniors should get help with the high cost of prescription drugs. That is what the vote was about. Unfortunately, all but two of our colleagues on the Republican side joined together to defeat Senator ROBB's motion and to deny seniors the help they desperately need with high prescription drug costs. 
   It is too bad it fell along partisan lines. This is not a partisan issue. I have had town meetings with seniors in my State. I don't ask them whether they are Republicans or Democrats. They all come to the meetings. It tears my heart out to hear their stories of $4,000, $5,000, as much as $6,000 a year that they are paying out of pocket every year for prescription drugs with no help. It should not be a partisan issue. It is too bad that all of our colleagues on the Republican side joined together to defeat it except two. 
   I hope it is only a temporary setback. I challenge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us, to join our seniors, to join the overwhelming majority of Americans who support a Medicare drug benefit. Our seniors need real help. They don't need the kind of sugar pill that is being prescribed by the House Republican leadership. 
   The House Ways and Means Committee this week passed a prescription drug benefit. Quite frankly, it does not answer the problem. It is an insurance program that reimburses insurance companies, not our seniors. It is not affordable. It is not an option for seniors in all regions of the country. It is not universal. There is no guaranteed access to needed drugs and local pharmacies. There are no protections against high drug costs. Who benefits from what the House did? The drug companies and the insurance companies. The House basically said that if you are a single person and you make over $12,500, there is no assistance to you. They are saying to the seniors of this country, if you make over $12,500 a year, tough luck. You have to pay for it all out of pocket. A lot of the people who have incomes under $12,500 qualify for Medicaid anyway; they get help with their drug costs. 
   What the Republicans in the House did only answers a need for a very narrow band of seniors--the very poor. What about the elderly who are making $15,000 a year? They are left out in the cold. Seniors making $20,000 a year who may still have payments on a house, maybe they have their property taxes to pay, they have heating bills, food bills, they have clothing bills. We would like to have them enjoy a little bit of their retirement years, maybe take a little vacation once in a while. They can't do that. They won't be able to do that under the House-passed bill because they will have to have an income of less than $12,500 a year. If it is over that, even with that, the benefits go to the drug companies and insurance companies and not to the seniors. 
   I think our seniors have waited long enough. They have been in the waiting room long enough for this. When our seniors see the vote that was taken last night, they are going to be mad, and they have every right to be. That is the first time we voted on this. We will continue to try. We will reach across the aisle and hope to make this a bipartisan effort. Senators will have another chance to vote again on the issue of prescription drug benefits for our elderly. Hopefully, the next time we do it, we will have a different result. We can provide meaningful help for our seniors to pay the extremely high cost of drugs they are having to pay today. So many of our seniors are being forced to choose between food, heat in the wintertime, maybe even air conditioning in the summertime, a choice between that and paying for prescription drugs. It is a choice they should not have to face. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   June 23, 1999: 
   Abdalla Al-Khadra, 23, Salt Lake City, UT; 
   Khari Bartigan, 18, Boston, MA; 
   Joseph Coats, 26, Chicago, IL; 
   Wendell Gray, 22, Chicago, IL; 
   Derwin K. Harding, 21, Oklahoma City, OK; 
   Hosey Hemingway, 27, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Teresa Hemingway, 30, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Steven Henderson, 17, Baltimore, MD; 
   Jim Johnson, 31, Dallas, TX; 
   Monique Trotty, 22, Detroit, MI; 
   Nichole Vargas, 18, Chicago, IL; 
   Unidentified male, San Francisco, CA. 
   These names come from a report prepared by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The report includes data from 100 U.S. cities between April 20, 1999, and March 20, 2000. The 100 cities covered range in size from Chicago, IL, which has a population of more than 2.7 million, to Bedford Heights, OH, with a population of about 11,800. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Labor-HHS bill has reached the floor relatively early this year. In the past few years, we have been sort of on the caboose end of the train. 
   It is an extremely important bill. It addresses many issues that are vital to the strength of our Nation--our health, education, job training, the administration of Social Security and Medicare, biomedical research, and child care, just to name a few. 
   Given its importance, I think it should be one of the first appropriations bills considered. But this is certainly the earliest this bill has gotten to the floor in many years. I am thankful for that. 
   At the outset, I thank my chairman, Senator SPECTER, and his great staff for their hard work in putting together this bill. As usual, Senator SPECTER has done so in a professional and bipartisan fashion. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his patience. 
   This is always one of the most difficult bills to put together. This year the job has been especially difficult. I also thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator STEVENS, and the ranking member, Senator BYRD, for their support this year. Their help has been invaluable. 
   Before I say a few words about the contents of the bill, I think it is important to briefly discuss this year's budget resolution because we operate within its framework. 
   I believe this year's budget resolution shortchanged funding for important discretionary activities, including education, health, and job training. The funds were, instead, used to give tax cuts to the wealthy and to give the Department of Defense more money than it even requested. Our subcommittee's inadequate allocation was the inevitable result of that ill-advised budget resolution. 
   But that allocation forced our subcommittee to reach outside its normal jurisdiction to find mandatory offsets to fund the critical programs in this bill. Some may criticize the bill for that reason. Some of those criticisms are valid. 
   For example, I hope to work with my colleagues--hopefully when we get to conference--to reverse the reductions in social services block grants. 
   There are many good provisions in this bill. It increases funding for NIH, as Senator SPECTER said, by a historic amount, $2.7 billion. Education programs are increased by $4.6 billion. Head Start is increased by $1 billion. 
   The $2.7 billion increase for NIH will keep us on our way to doubling NIH funding over 5 years. We are on the verge of tremendous biomedical breakthroughs as we decode the mysteries of the human genome and explore the uses of human stem cells. We are doing the right thing by continuing to support important biomedical research.  
   The bill increases funding for child care from the $1.2 billion level last year to $2 billion this year. The availability, affordability, and quality of child care are major concerns for working families, and they desperately need these funds. Only about 1 in every 10 eligible children is served by this program. These dollars will go to working Americans who really need the help. 
   Again, I want to make sure the record reflects that last year, during our negotiations, our chairman, Senator SPECTER, guaranteed that we would have this increase this year. He lived up to that commitment. We had a tremendous increase in the child care program, and we thank Senator SPECTER for his commitment and for keeping his word to get that increase for child care this year. 
   I am proud we could also increase funding for education programs by, as I said, $4.6 billion. That includes a $350 increase in the maximum Pell grant to $3,650, the highest ever. 
   In this year that we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the bill includes a $1.3 billion increase in funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. 
   We have also funded a new Office of Disability Policy at the Department of Labor. At HHS, we were able to add funds for several other programs funded under the Developmental Disabilities Act. 
   This bill also places great importance on women's health and includes over $4 billion for programs that address the health needs of women. I again might add that Senator SPECTER and I worked together on a women's health initiative that is part and parcel of this bill, and that is what that $4 billion is for. 
   The bill also includes a $50 million line item to address the issue of medical errors and to help health care practitioners and health care institutions, hospitals, and other health care facilities, to begin the process of developing methodologies and ways of cutting down on medical errors. 
   Medical errors are now the fifth leading cause of death in America. As we have looked at this, we found it is not just one person or one institution or one cause; there is a whole variety of different reasons. Quite frankly, I think our institutions and our practitioners have not kept up with the new technologies of today which in most of the private sector have helped us so much with productivity and which I believe in the health care sector can really help us cut down on medical errors. But that is what that $50 million is there to do. 
   The bill is not without its problems. As I mentioned, we do have a problem with the social services block grant. Hopefully, we will get this bill to conference and we will be able to fix that at that time. 
   Also, the provisions in the bill that have the money for school modernization and for class size reductions are not targeted enough. They are just broadly thrown in there. Again, we had this battle last year. When it finally came down to it, the Congress agreed with the White House, in a partnership, that we needed to put the money in there for class size reduction. I believe the same needs to be done for school modernization. 
   We only put in 7 cents out of every dollar that goes for elementary and secondary education in America. We only provide 7 cents. A lot of that goes for, as I said, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. A lot of that goes for title I programs to help low-income areas. When it is all over with, we have just a penny or two left of every dollar that we can give out to elementary and secondary schools. 
   So when we put in money for school modernization, we ought to make sure that is what it goes for. Schools desperately need this money. Our property taxpayers all over this country are getting hit, time and time again, to pay more in property taxes, which can be very regressive, to help pay for modernizing their schools. 
   As we know, most of the schools need to be modernized; they have leaky roofs, and toilets that won't flush, water that is bad, and air conditioning--a lot of times they don't even have air conditioning--heating plants that are inadequate. As I pointed out, one out of every four elementary and secondary schools in New York City today are still heated by coal. And again, these tend to be in the lowest income areas. So we need to target that money. It is not in this bill. That is one of the problems with it. Again, I hope we can work that out as we go to conference. 
   It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our children see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most run down places they see are their public schools. Again, we have to fix these in conference. 
   I thank Senator SPECTER, once again, for being so open and working with us in a very strong bipartisan fashion. 
   We worked together to shape this bill. Overall, it is a good bill, with a few exceptions that we have to fix once we go to conference. 
   I want to make clear, I support the bill in its present form. I hope we get a good vote on it as it leaves here and goes to conference. I reserve my right, however, on the conference report, when it comes back. I am hopeful we can get it to conference with a strong vote, sit down with our House counterparts, and work out our differences. Hopefully, we can come back to the floor having fixed the class size, school modernization, and social services block grant problems we have in this bill. 
   I thank Chairman SPECTER for working in a bipartisan fashion. I hope we can get through this bill reasonably rapidly today, hopefully get to conference next week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in my State of Iowa, Sioux City, seniors regularly take bus trips to Mexico to get their drugs. Drugs that cost $68 in Sioux City are $7 in Mexico. Seniors in Waterloo, IA, are being bussed to Canada to buy their drugs. Seniors in Cedar Rapids, IA, are being forced to declare bankruptcy because they have run up their credit care debt so high just to pay for the drugs they need. Mr. President, $5,000 to $6,000 a year is being paid out of pocket by seniors who cannot afford it and are being forced into bankruptcy. 
   We are told this is not the time to do this, that we have to wait longer, that this baby is not ready to be born. The elderly have waited long enough, and they have been gouged deep enough, too deep, to pay for their prescription drugs. Now is the time to stand up for the seniors in our country and to vote aye on the Robb motion.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to briefly discuss two important provisions regarding child soldiers and methamphetamine lab cleanup that are included in this supplemental spending package in the Foreign Operations bill before us. 
   Over the years, Iowa and many states in the Midwest, West and Southwest have been working hard to reduce the sale and abuse of methamphetamine. But meth has brought another problem that we must address: highly toxic labs that are abandoned and exposed to our communities. 
   We know that it can cost thousands of dollars to clean up a single lab. Fortunately, in recent years, the Drug Enforcement Agency has provided critical funds to help clean up these dangerous sites. 
   However, last year, the DEA funding was cut in half, despite evidence that more and more meth labs have been found and confiscated. Because of these cuts, in March, the DEA completely ran out of funding to provide meth lab cleanup assistance to state and local law enforcement. 
   Last month, the Administration shifted $5 million in funds from other Department of Justice Accounts to pay for emergency meth lab cleanup. This action will help reimburse these states for the costs they have incurred since the DEA ran out of money. My state of Iowa has already paid some $300,000 out of its own pocket for clean up since March. 
   However, we've got another five months to go before the new fiscal year--and the number of meth labs being found and confiscated is still on the rise. 
   The bill before us contains $10 million I added in Committee to ensure that there will be enough money to pay for costly meth lab clean-up without forcing states to take money out of their other tight law enforcement budgets. 
   If we can find money to fight drugs in Columbia, we should be able to find money to fight drugs in our own backyard. We cannot risk exposing these dangerous meth labs to our communities. 
   Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee also adopted an amendment I offered to provide $5 million provision in the Colombia package to address one of the most alarming aspects of the drug conflict in Colombia--the use of child soldiers. 
   Human Rights Watch estimates that as many as 19,000 youths--some as young as eight--are being used by the Colombian armed forces, paramilitary groups and guerrilla forces. Up to 50 percent of some paramilitary units and up to 80 percent of some guerrilla units are made up of children. Children are used as combatants, guides, and informants. They may be forced to collect intelligence, deploy land mines, and serve as advance shock forces in ambushes. Guerrillas often refer to them as ``little bees,'' because they sting before their targets realize they are under attack. 
   These children are forced to carry arms and are enticed by false promises or threats to their families. They are often tortured, drugged, sexually abused, and permanently traumatized by the horror and brutality of war. Children who are turned into soldiers lose their childhood. 
   They lose their innocence and their youth. They become instruments of destruction and atrocity. And the longer they remain under arms, the harder it is for them to heal and return to any semblance of a normal life. 
   Some of the funds included in the supplemental for Colombia are intended to support judicial reform, human rights protection and peace negotiations. Indeed, protecting human rights and rule of law is central to the overall success of Plan Colombia. The use of child soldiers is a serious human rights abuse prohibited by numerous international treaties and conventions, including ILO Convention 182 on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor--and by the Colombian government itself. The International Criminal Court makes the recruitment or use of children under age 15 in military activities a war crime. I can think of no better use for these funds than to assist the demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers. 
   The current generation of children in Colombia is the fourth generation to grow up surrounded by conflict. The $5 million in the Human Rights part of the Colombia package will help some of Colombia's children regain their fundamental right to life and peace. The money will be used by NGOs working to provide humanitarian assistance to affected children and their families. These NGO's will support programs providing counseling, education and reintegration services to former child  soldiers; safe houses for escaped child soldiers; and public awareness and recruitment-prevention campaigns. Although $5 million represents less than one-third of 1 percent of the total supplemental funds for Colombia, this money may be the most well-spent of all.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Microbiological Performance Standards Clarification Act of 2000. Passage of this bill is vital because on May 25th, the District Court of the Northern District of Texas struck down the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) authority to enforce its Microbiological Performance Standard for Salmonella. The District Court's decision in Supreme Beef v. USDA (Supreme) seriously undermines the sweeping food safety changes adopted by USDA in its 1996 Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and Pathogen Reduction (HACCP) rule. 
   The District Court's decision in Supreme says that USDA does not have the authority to enforce Microbiological Performance Standards for reducing viral and bacterial pathogens. 
   The Pathogen Reduction Rule recognized that bacterial and viral pathogens were the foremost food safety threat in America, responsible for 5,000 deaths and 33 million illnesses. To address the threat of foodborne illness, USDA developed a modern inspection system based on two fundamental principles. 
   The first was that industry has the primary responsibility to determine how to produce the safest products possible. Industry had to examine their plants and determine how to control contamination at every step of the food production process, from the moment a product arrives at their door until the moment it leaves their plant. 
   The second, even more crucial principle was that plants nationwide must reduce levels of dangerous pathogens in meat and poultry products. To ensure the new inspection system accomplished this, USDA developed Microbiological Performance Standards. These standards provide targets for reducing pathogens and require all USDA-inspected facilities to meet them. Facilities failing to meet a standard are shut down until they create a corrective action plan to meet the standard. 
   To date, USDA has only issued one Microbiological Performance Standard, for Salmonella. The vast majority of plants in the U.S. have been able to meet the new standard, so it is clearly workable. In addition, USDA reports that Salmonella levels for meat and poultry products have fallen substantially. The Salmonella standard, therefore, has been successful. The District Court's decision threatens to destroy this success and set our food safety system back years. 
   Congress cannot let a court's unfortunate misinterpretation of USDA's authority undermine our efforts to provide the safest food possible and the strongest food safety system available. Whatever the ultimate outcome of the Supreme Beef case, it is intolerable to have so much uncertainty about USDA's authority to enforce food safety regulations. The public should not have to worry about whether the products on their table have met food safety standards. This legislation provides the necessary clarification and assurance that if a product bears the USDA stamp of approval, it has met all of USDA's food safety requirements. 
   I plan to seek every opportunity to get this language enacted. I think it is essential, both to ensuring the modernization of our food safety system, and ensuring consumers that we are making progress in reducing dangerous pathogens. 
   I hope that both parties, and both houses of Congress will be able to act to pass this legislation before the July 4th weekend. The public's confidence in our meat and poultry inspection system is at stake.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for this amendment. I am a cosponsor because I believe that our society must enforce a message of tolerance--not hate. State and local law enforcement should not have to shoulder the burden of investigating and prosecuting hate crimes alone. This amendment allows the Federal Government to stand behind them in their effort to put a stop to hate-motivated violence. 
   This amendment would authorize the Department of Justice to assist law enforcement officers across the country in addressing acts of hate violence by  removing unnecessary obstacles to federal involvement and, where appropriate, by providing authority for federal involvement in crimes directed at individuals because of their race, color religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability. 
   Because of my long involvement in the area of disability rights and the fact that this year marks the Tenth Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I want to focus my remarks on hate crimes' impact on Americans with disabilities. Prejudice against people with disabilities takes many forms. Such bias often results in discriminatory actions in employment, housing, and public accommodations. Laws like the Fair Housing Amendments Act, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act are designed to protect people with disabilities from such prejudice 
   Sadly, disability bias can also manifest itself in the form of violence. It is imperative that the Federal Government send a message that these expressions of hatred are not acceptable in our society. 
   For example, a man with mental disabilities from New Jersey was kidnaped by a group of nine men and women and was tortured for three hours, then dumped somewhere with a pillowcase over his head. While captive, he was taped to a chair, his head was shaved, his clothing was cut to shreds, and he was punched, whipped with a string of beads, beaten with a toilet brush, and, possibly, sexually assaulted. Prosecutors believe the attack was motivated by disability bias. 
   In the state of Maine, a husband and wife were both living openly with AIDS, struggling to raise their children. Their youngest daughter was also infected with HIV. The family had broken their silence to participate in HIV/AIDS education programs that would inform their community about the tragic reality of HIV infection in their lives. As a result of the publicity, the windows of their home were shot out and the husband was forcibly removed from his car at a traffic light and severely beaten. 
   Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have included people with disabilities as a protected class under their hate crimes statutes. However, state protection is neither uniform nor comprehensive. The Federal Government must send the message that hate crimes committed on the basis of disability are as intolerable as those committed because of a person's race, national origin, or religion. And, federal resources and comprehensive coverage would give this message meaning and substance. Thus, it is critical that people with disabilities share in the protection of the federal hate crimes statute. 
   This legislation will also provide local and state law enforcement officials with the resources necessary to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. In consultation with victim services organizations, including nonprofit organizations that provide services to victims with disabilities, local law enforcement officials can apply for grants when they lack the necessary resources to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. The amendment also includes grants for the training of law enforcement officials in identifying and preventing hate crimes committed by juveniles. Again, so often hate crimes on the basis of disability go unrecognized. These grants will help police identify crimes committed because of disability bias in the first place. 
   Mr. President, for this reason and others, this amendment is vitally important. Millions of Americans would benefit from its passage. And the public clearly recognizes this. 
   This amendment is a constructive and sensible response to a serious problem that continues to plague our Nation--violence motivated by prejudice. It deserves full support, and I am hopeful that the President will have an opportunity to sign this legislation into law this year.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, July 26 will mark the 10th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In the next few weeks we'll be holding a number of events here in Washington and around the country to celebrate the ADA. And right now it looks like we can start our party a little early. 
   I just found out that yesterday, Susan Sygall, a woman with a disability, received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. Each year, the MacArthur Foundation awards 20 or so unrestricted $500,000 grants to, and I quote, ``talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication. . . .'' These so-called ``genius grants'' are among the most prestigious in the world. 
   Susan is the Executive Director of Mobility International USA. Mobility International's mission is to empower people with disabilities, particularly women, through international exchange, and by providing information, technical assistance, and training to ensure the inclusion of people with disabilities in international exchange and development programs. 
   Right now, Mobility International is, among other things, facilitating a program to develop relationships between the disability communities in Vietnam and in the United States. Some of Susan's genius must have rubbed off on us in the Foreign Operations Committee because we encouraged USAID to fund disability rights programs in Vietnam. I hope that we can help the program again this year. 
   I strongly believe that for all of America's economic and military might, our greatest strength will always be our democratic principles. Those principles have served as the foundation for aspiring democracies everywhere. As our own democracy matures, and the ADA is a testament to that, it is essential that we export the lessons we have learned. 
   I have seen personally how the ADA has fostered disability rights activism around the world and as the 10th Anniversary approaches I can think of no better person to honor than Susan Sygall. A civil rights law is only as great as the people who bring it to life every day. That's why when I hear about people like Susan, I know that the ADA's future is in good hands.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am offering a bipartisan amendment with my distinguished colleagues, Mr. LUGAR and Mr. LEAHY. This amendment would simply change the rules on eligibility of overseas troops for the supplemental nutrition program to be the same as the rules for troops in the United States. It corrects an inequity that would otherwise harm thousands of our troops overseas. 
   We have had much discussion of the disgrace that some of our men and women in uniform, who are risking their lives to serve our nation, have to rely on welfare to feed their families. Thousands of our troops are eligible for food stamps and WIC, the supplemental nutrition program. This is an outrage, and I will continue to work to increase the pay of our enlisted men and women, the real solution to this problem. 
   But it is even more outrageous that some of our troops who need this assistance cannot get it, just because of where they are stationed. WIC is administered by the States. Since our troops overseas are not in a State, in the past they have not received any  support from WIC. When they are stationed here, they can get the food they need to feed their families; they get transferred overseas, and suddenly they are ineligible, and the assistance on which they have come to rely disappears. No wonder it's so hard to convince them to sign up for another tour. 
   Last year this body passed an amendment I proposed to end this unfairness by having the Defense Department provide WIC assistance to troops overseas. The amendment simply required the Defense Department to set up a WIC program similar to those run by the states that would serve Department personnel who are overseas. The Department is proceeding to implement that program. In fact the Department is uniquely situated to efficiently run such a program because of the network of medical treatment facilities and commissaries that is already in place. But in conference a significant change was made to the provision. A sentence was added that requires the Department to include the value of on-base housing in calculating income to determine eligibility for the program. That one sentence knocked more than half of those who should be eligible from the program. 
   It also failed to correct the fundamental unfairness. The regulations governing WIC specifically prohibit states from counting in-kind housing and other in-kind assistance in appplicants' income when determining eligibility. They bar states from doing what we required the Pentagon to do. That makes no sense. It means that people who were receiving food stamps in the U.S. still may be kicked out of the program when their period of eligibility is up, even though their income and expenses have not changed, just because they were transferred out of the country. And when my staff talked with the Defense Department officials who are setting up the program, they agreed that the rules should be changed so that eligibility overseas would match eligibility in the U.S. 
   So this amendment strikes the one sentence, leaving the overall principle that the Secretary of Defense should seek to apply the eligibility rules in the regulations governing state implementation of WIC. 
   Those regulations leave one ambiguity, however. I have talked about in-kind housing, that is housing on military bases. Troops who live off-base instead receive a basic housing allowance to help them pay for their own housing. As directed in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the rules on WIC state that states have the choice in determining income eligibility of whether to count the basic housing allowance received by military personnel living off the base. I understand that as of 1994, the last time states were surveyed, not one of the fifty states had chosen to include the housing in income. That only makes sense. It would be patently unfair to let troops living on-base receive support, but withhold it from troops living off-base whose real income is no higher. In fact the troops off-base usually have higher expenses because the housing allowance usually does not fully cover their housing expense. 
   So this amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to follow the current practice of the states in excluding the basic allowance for housing when determining income eligibility. Thus it would allow the Secretary to restore full fairness by treating troops overseas the same as troops at home, and troops who live on-base the same as troops who live off-base. And most importantly it would allow thousands of troops to receive the food they need to keep their families healthy. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their favorable consideration and am glad that this correction has been accepted as a manager's amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proposing a very simple amendment. All it says is the Department of Defense thoroughly test its trailers and the trucks that pull them before they spend more money to modify them or to buy new ones. 
   I understand there is a rule XVI point of order against the amendment. So I will ask that it be withdrawn. But I wanted to take the time to at least let Senators know about and become aware of a very interesting problem in the Department of Defense which I think is indicative of some larger problems that we have in terms of testing and making sure that our weapons systems actually work before we spend our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to buy them. 
   For the next several minutes, I would like to tell the story of the Army trailers and why this amendment basically just says we ought to test them to make sure they work before we buy them. 
   You would think this would be common sense. But 6,550 trailers that the Army has purchased for more than $50 million are sitting in storage right now. That is right, 6,550 trailers are now in storage because the Army never bothered to make sure they worked. The fact is that this amendment, which I think is necessary, says a lot about how waste and abuse continues to thrive at the Pentagon. I get nervous about some of these skyrocketing procurement budgets when I think about how some of the money gets thrown away. Let's go through the story of the trailers. 
   Most of what I am about to relate is in a GAO report, which I requested last year and which was published last year. 
   In the 1980s, the Pentagon decided it needed some trailers. I am talking about trailers that you load up with equipment, goods and stuff, and you pull them behind a truck. In 1980, the Pentagon decided that it needed some trailers for its high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles, otherwise known to all of us as humvees. That is all these are--trailers to be pulled behind some all-terrain trucks. I wouldn't think that would be too difficult. The Army found that the older M101 trailers they had were unstable with the humvees. So they set out to buy some new trailers. In 1993, they signed a contract for $50.6 million to buy 7,563 new trailers. 
   In 1995, after a couple of years, they tested the trailers and found a serious problem. The trucks, as it turns out, were never designed to pull trailers. When they tested the trailers, the rear crossmembers of the trucks tended to crack. They refer to this as ``catastrophic failure.'' Despite this problem of the trucks' rear crossmembers cracking, the Army decided that the trailers had successfully completed testing. 
   You may wonder: How could that possibly be? Well, it was because they met the contract performance requirements. Mind you, they didn't work. They destroyed the trucks that pulled them. But they met the contract performance requirements. So the Army agreed to pay the contractor for the trailers and to pay for the modifications that would be needed. You would think in the contract specifications they would have said that the trailers should not damage the trucks pulling them. But evidently they didn't. 
   Then in late 1996, the Army faced a dilemma. The contractor was more than a year behind schedule in delivering them, and the Department decided not to buy more trailers in fiscal year 1997--not because they didn't work, which they didn't, but because they said they were now a lower priority. 
   In the contract that the Army negotiated, there was an escape clause which provided that during the fourth and fifth years, if the Army didn't want any more trailers, all they had to do was pay $1 million in liquidated damages and they would be out of the contract. Did the Army pay the $1 million and get out of the old contract? No. They renegotiated the contract and extended it another year. Not only that but the Army also agreed to pay the increased costs of the contractor and agreed also to increase the profit margin of the contractor in spite of the poor performance of these trailers. The net result was a 57-percent increase in the cost of the trailers. Instead of getting the 7,563 trailers for $50.6 million, which was agreed upon in the contract, the Army ended up getting 6,700 trailers for $57 million--$6 million more for 900 fewer trailers. 
   That is not the end of it. From there, the story continues downhill. 
   In 1997, the Army modified the truck crossmembers--the one that was cracking all the time, and the bumpers--so the trucks could pull the trailers. But as they were modifying the truck, the trailer drawbar broke. They discovered that the drawbar design had no margin of safety; it bent every time the humvee went over a bump. Nonetheless, since the Army had already accepted the design, the Army figured it was their own problem and they let the contractor off the hook. 
   The Army continued to accept more of these trailers that they couldn't use. They couldn't use them. So the contractor kept making them and the Army kept accepting them; and they just put them in storage. 
   In 1998, they tested the trailers a third time with a new steel drawbar.  But now they found that the new, stiffer drawbar damaged the brakes on the trailers and again damaged the trucks. 
   In 1999, they made more modifications and tested the trailers a fourth time. Again, the trailers didn't work. Meanwhile, the units still don't have the trailers they have needed for more than a decade. 
   Now, the Army thinks they finally have the solution. They will use the steel drawbar on the trailers. They will install a more durable brake actuator on the trailers, and they will modify the trucks with reinforcement for this towing pintle. But they haven't even tested these modifications yet. So they don't even know if they will work. 
   Furthermore, their ``conservative cost estimate'' for the modification is $22 million. 
   Let's add it up. We were going to pay $50 million. We have already paid $57 million. Now we are going to pay $22 million on top of that. That would pay to modify only 6,700 trucks, one for each of the trailers. 
   I can only assume that the Army does not want to dedicate a truck for each trailer. That means the Army will have to modify all 19,564 trucks that are in the units to get the trailers. 
   The 22 million they want is only for 6,700 trucks. But they are going to need another 13,000 trucks modified. 
   So are we looking at another $44 million, maybe another $50 million on top of it? I don't think they will dedicate one truck to each trailer. That would be foolish. I don't think we are through with the price increases yet. Somewhere down the line, the Army says, they will need another 18,412 high mobility trailers on top of the 6,700 they already have. 
   This is a story of mismanagement, a story of misprocurement, a story of whacky contracts, a story of piling one mistake upon another, a story of letting contractors off the hook, all at the expense of taxpayers and the expense of readiness and mobility for our troops in the field. 
   My amendment simply requires that before we dump more money down this rathole, before we modify the trailers and trucks or buy more trailers, we test them. We test the final product to see if it will meet the requirements for the all-terrain vehicles that are pulling them. We should make sure that they work, that they are safe, that they don't damage the truck, and that they can perform their intended mission. 
   I don't know when the end is in sight. We have already spent $57 million. They want another $22 million. That is $79 million. If they are going to modify all the trucks, we are probably looking at another $44 million on top of that, and they say they want 18,000 more of them. I don't know if there is an end in sight. Whether $57 million or $79 million or $100 million, that may not in a $300 billion budget for defense seem to be a lot but it is a lot of money to me. It is a lot of money to the taxpayers in my home State of Iowa. 
   I am afraid it is a symptom of a larger problem. If we cannot design a simple trailer that works, and test it adequately, how can we expect to build an advanced fighter plane that works or a missile defense that will hit a bullet with a bullet? 
   We never seem to learn our lesson. Today we are buying 10 F-22 fighter planes, the most advanced and most expensive in the world, even though they haven't been fully tested and have shown problems in the tests that have been done. We are talking about spending $1 billion a year for national missile defense, even though it has had only two flight tests--one lucky strike and a near miss--and has never been tested against countermeasures that it would surely face. 
   If we are going to spend all this money, the public should at least demand weapons that work. My amendment would set that demand in writing for the trailers. I am not getting into the fighter planes and missile defense. I am only talking about simple trailers, so that never again will we pay three times for trailers--once to buy them, again to store them, and a third time to try to make them work right. 
   I wanted to take this time to talk about the trailer problem. I have been involved in this for some time. I think it is indicative of a larger problem. We should make sure we test all of our systems, make sure they work and are safe and meet the requirements we need before we shell out our taxpayers' dollars to buy them.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator BOXER for yielding me this time. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of her amendment. We have worked hard on this over the last couple of years to try to bring sense and rationality to this procurement of luxury jets for the military. 
   I was going to ask my friend from California if we might engage in a little colloquy to let our fellow Senators know where we are coming from. It is not the intention of the Senator from California, nor mine, to say that there should be no smaller corporate-type jets within the Department of Defense. We are not trying to say ``none.'' We are not trying to cut them out. There are 364 support aircraft in the inventory right now. 
   I ask the Senator, is it, the intention of the Senator to do away with all these types of jets?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator is correct, the request for proposal that delineated the requirements, the GAO said there is no real basis for those requirements. They just plucked them out of thin air. They devised, if I am not mistaken, an RFP to get the jets they wanted. But there is no basis for the RFP requirement. 
   That is what I read in the GAO report. For example, I say to the Senator from California, in the GAO study on page 7, ``One military officer involved in the 1995 study said that using an assumption of four flights a day yielded a requirement deemed to be too high and that using an assumption of two flights a day yielded a requirement deemed to be too low.'' So it came out at three. 
   Listen to this: ``Operational support airlift requirements are significantly affected by this single assumption of how many flights a day you have. For example, our review of support aircraft found that 55 fewer aircraft were required when assumptions of two flights a day were used rather than three for overseas theaters.'' 
   Again, the GAO is saying there is no real rational basis for this. They say four is deemed too much, two is deemed too little. So, voila, they decided on three. But again, there is no rational 
   basis for why they needed three flights a day. 
   We didn't have this study last year. This study just came out in April of 2000. Last year, we offered the amendment that dealt with six aircraft, and our worst fears were realized. They put out an RFP, limited to the most luxurious jets. So we requested the study. In light of the fact that we have the GAO study that basically says we have no basis on which to procure these aircraft, now we will lease nine aircraft. 
   Let's get this straight. Last year, we did not have the GAO study. Our amendment was defeated. The bill said they could lease up to six aircraft. This year, we have the GAO study that says there is no basis for the requests, but now nine are requested this year. 
   Please, someone tell me what kind of sense this makes. 
   Again, I have been a pilot all my life. I enjoy flying. I know airplanes pretty darned well. We are not trying to say that commanders in the field, theater commanders, don't need long-range airplanes. They do. What I am saying is we are playing a game here. It is sort of a game of, I am a general and guess what. I have got a nice big fancy jet to ferry me around. Well, Admiral Smith over here looks at General Jones and says, hey, he's got a big old jet that flies him around. How come I don't have one? And then the general over in the Marine Corps says, well, I have to have one, too. I am as high ranking as that other general or admiral. And the Air Force general says, I have to have one, too. 
   Come on. There is a lot of this game involved here. I don't mind some perks for our military officers. They don't get paid a lot of money. They do a  great job of defending our country. We call upon them in wartime and they lay down their lives. If you are just honest about it, this is a perk, a perquisite. 
   But how much of a perk? Do they really need a Gulfstream V that can carry up to 19 passengers so they can put four or five people on board and travel in luxury? No, they don't need that. CINCPAC operates out of Hawaii and needs a longer range plane to go from Hawaii to Guam, Okinawa, Japan, or Korea. I understand that. But commanders in the United States don't need those. They can land at any airport in the United States and get refueled. They don't need those longer range planes. You may need one for Europe. Already in the inventory we have 13 Gulfstream III's that have a 3,500-mile nautical range. Now the Gulfstream V has a 5,500-mile nautical range. 
   We already have one of those in inventory. I don't know where it is. I don't know who operates it. But we already have one. We have 13 Gulfstream III's with a 3,500-mile nautical range. That is not too shabby. And a Gulfstream III is a very luxurious plane, I can assure you. The GAO says it can carry up to 26 passengers, but that is maximum loading. Actually, a Gulfstream III would probably carry about 10 or 12 people at most on any flight. 
   They already have 13 of them. Is that enough? We don't even know. The GAO says we don't even know if that is enough. 
   I am not saying we do not need some of these planes. But I think we need a really thorough study of these inventories, to justify the requirements. 
   The GAO said:  
   The Department of Defense has not clearly explained the basis for the key assumptions it is using to justify the requirements or identified the assumptions that should be updated in each succeeding review.  
   What does it mean? The Pentagon has no clue about how many planes they need; no clue.

   Mr. HARKIN. Let me just finish this. 
   The GAO found there is no justification for how many times a day airports are connected. There is no criterion for why some airports are key airports and others are not. There is no consideration of how large different planes need to be. Nobody could even tell the GAO whether the requirement for 85 aircraft in the continental United States had been considered in the 1998 review or who was supposed to look at it in the current review. So how do they come up with their assumptions? Here is what GAO said. I will repeat it:  
   One military officer said using an assumption of four flights a day yielded a requirement deemed to be too high, using an assumption of two yielded a requirement deemed to be too low by the commanders in chief.  
   What does that mean? They cooked the books. That is all they are doing, they are cooking the books. They are saying I would like to have this Gulfstream V, so write it up so that I need it. That is all that is happening. 
   I am glad to yield to my colleague.

   Mr. HARKIN. Frankly, I say to the Senator from California, if we have to swallow this, they ought to at least buy the airplanes, not lease them. The taxpayers are going to get stung, big time, for leasing these aircraft, but it looks as if it is less in the beginning. Over the years, we are going to pay probably, what would the Senator say, three to four times as much for these aircraft? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-14-20000613</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. That is if we lease them rather than buying. So we are compounding it, adding insult to injury. The taxpayers are getting socked for airplanes the military doesn't really need, and then they are leasing them, which means we are paying even more money for airplanes we do not even need. Again, you would think with this GAO study we would say: Wait, we don't need these nine. Let's wait until we see what the requirements really are. 
   The requirements are always couched in terms of wartime necessity. We are not at war. It doesn't look as if there is anything bubbling up on the horizon that is going to be a major war for the United States in the next couple of years. So we have time to do an assessment to find out what our requirements really are. Does Admiral or General so-and-so really need a Gulfstream V? We don't know that. Maybe they could get by with a C-21. 
   I want to be perfectly honest. I have used these aircraft. As Senators, sometimes we travel to remote areas of the world. Because of time requirements and when we have to go, we have to utilize these aircraft. Last year, Senator REID and I utilized a C-21. We flew commercially to Jakarta, Indonesia, and then we flew a C-21 from Jakarta to East Timor. There were no commercial flights we could take over there at that time. Then we had to fly back. Then I went in that up to Okinawa, Okinawa to Shanghai, and over to Japan, all on routes that would have been very difficult commercially to do. 
   This is a C-21. You are cramped. There is no bathroom. You can't stand up; you can't stretch out, and there  was room for about five passengers on that and we were loaded. Flying those long distances, we would have to land and refuel, and get up and go, land and refuel. 
   I am saying, if that is good enough for a Senator, why can't 
   a general do that? I didn't say I have to have a Gulfstream V with all the luxury and the bathroom and a chef on board and a glass of champagne--no, we don't need all that stuff. I just need basic transportation to get me from point A to point B to C to D to E. 
   Yet I come back to the United States and look around, and I see nice luxury jets being used by generals and admirals, people flying around the United States in these luxury aircraft. I wonder, do they really need to travel that way? Why don't they fly in a C-21? It is cheaper. We have a lot of them. Lord knows, we have a lot of C-21s. We have probably 71 of them. They are cheap. They are efficient. They are fast. They are not very comfortable, but they serve the purpose. 
   So I just say what we have here is a game of one-upmanship. General so-and-so has a nice plane. Admiral so-and-so wants one, too. Another general wants one. 
   Again, I say to my friend from Alaska, I am not saying we don't need a number of these aircraft. Some of them we do. Some of them have to be larger for longer flights, as in the Pacific, maybe the European theater. But we do not need them here in the continental United States, and that is what we are getting stung with. 
   We ought to come to our senses. This is waste, pure and simple. I do not even mind, as I said earlier, a little perk of office for the generals, if they have to get in a plane and fly someplace. But they don't need this kind of perk. A C-21 is fine enough to fly around the continental United States for any general or admiral, for any member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And a Gulfstream III is more than adequate for any Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or any admiral or general to fly from here to Europe. 
   I would say to the Senator from Alaska, a Gulfstream III can fly from here, land in Gander, land in Iceland, it can refuel, or it can land over in Shannon, Ireland, and refuel and make any city in Europe with one-stop refueling--one stop. They do not need the Gulfstream V. Corporate executives fly all the time from the United States to Europe in Gulfstream IIIs. They don't need Gulfstream Vs. 
   Of course, some of the bigger corporations, may have a Gulfstream V, but that is the private sector. If they want to do that, that is fine. We are talking about public servants here. Generals and admirals are no more or less public servants than the Senator from Hawaii, Iowa, Alaska, or California. They do not need to be mollycoddled. They do not need to be babied and pampered like some corporate executive. 
   If a corporate executive wants to be babied and pampered, that is up to their board of directors and their stockholders. The American people are the stockholders of the Department of Defense. I do not believe our constituents want to spend their hard-earned tax dollars so some general or admiral can fly around in a Gulfstream V in luxurious comfort while we have troops on food stamps and while we are trying to raise the pay of those on the bottom. 
   So I say let's take a little time here. Let's take a breather. They do not need to lease the nine aircraft right now. 
   Let's take a look at the GAO report. Let's give the Department of Defense 1 year to come back, and let's see their justification. 
   I ask the Senator from California again for that justification for the RFPs that just went out:  
   Aircraft should be able to fly no-wind range of 5,000 nautical miles.  
   Why?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take 4 minutes, but I appreciate the Senator from California yielding me time. 
   Why? Why 5,000 miles? That is the threshold. The objective is the ``Aircraft shall be able to fly no-wind range of 5,000 nautical miles carrying a full passenger and crew complement, plus their baggage.'' Why? We do not know why, but that is what they said. 
   The GAO report says, as the Senator from California said, there is no justification for it. They plucked the numbers out of thin air. They cooked the books, and I do not like it.

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to anyone who is watching this debate, get on your computer, get on the Internet and dial up www.gulfstream.com. Dial up gulfstream.com and take a look at the Gulfstream V and Gulfstream III, I say to my constituents, or anyone who is watching--gulfstream.com. Dial it up and take a look at the Gulfstream V and ask yourself: Does a general or an admiral or anyone who is a public servant really need this kind of luxury? The answer, I think, will be obvious. 
   I reserve any remaining time.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I stand in support of this amendment. I am a member of the conference committee on the Patients' Bill of Rights. When we began the conference, I had high and great hopes for this because my colleagues on the Republican side told us how committed they were to meaningful HMO reform. Let us look at the history and the record. 
   This passed the Senate almost a year ago, in July of 1999. It passed the House in October. The first meeting we had was on March 2 of this year, and we conducted no business. Then there was another meeting on March 9 that lasted a little while. Not much was done. Then we had two more reduced meetings, not of the entire conference but just a few members of the conference behind closed doors in Senator NICKLES' office off the floor. There were four meetings. We have heard about 400 hours and all this hard work. Four meetings? That is tough work. 
   Maybe they have been talking with each other for 400 hours. I do not know. It reminds me of a story about a car stuck in a snowbank. The guy spends 10 hours in the car spinning the wheels going nowhere. Someone shows up and he says: I spent 10 hours trying to get my car out of the snowbank. He is sitting there gunning the gas pedal, spinning the wheels, and going nowhere. If he had just gotten out of the car with a shovel, he would have been out of there. 
   That is what this conference committee is doing; it is spinning its wheels. Since we started meeting, we finalized agreement on two provisions--out of 22 in disagreement, 2 provisions. 
   These were noncontroversial provisions to which both sides easily agreed. The first was on access to pediatric care. That took about 30 seconds to decide. The next issue was provider nondiscrimination. That was identical in both the House and the Senate bills. That is what we have agreed on. That is all we have to show for 400 hours? Four hundred hours, that is what we have to show for it? 
   As I said, we are spinning our wheels. Slowly, over time, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that our Republican Senate colleagues are not serious. They do not truly want a Patients' Bill of Rights. But I believe it is critical that we pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation this year. They did it in the House, and they showed it can be done in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Mr. President, 160 million of our family members, friends, neighbors, and children are paying good money for health care with no guarantee of proper and appropriate treatment. We all know too many stories about patients who cannot see their doctor in a timely manner, who cannot get access to the specialists they need, patients who could not get the coverage for the type of care they thought was covered under their plan. 
   It is very simple: Insurance either fulfills its promises or it doesn't. We are hearing enough to know in too many cases it does not. Employers and patients pay good money for health care coverage, only to find that the expected coverage evaporates at the time they need it. 
   So we have a choice to make here, a choice between real or illusory protections, a choice between ensuring care for millions of Americans or ensuring the profit margins of the managed care industry. 
   The Norwood-Dingell bill, the amendment before us, passed on a bipartisan vote in the House. It is commonsense patient protections by which the managed care plans must abide. Over 300 organizations representing patients, consumers, doctors, nurses, women, children, people with disabilities, and small businesses support the Norwood-Dingell bill. 
   Unfortunately, I cannot help but think that if Members of Congress--Senators sitting right here in this room today--were in the same health care boat as the average American family, this bill not only would have been made law, it would have been made law years ago. 
   We have all the protections that are in the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is good enough for us, but it is not good enough for the American people, according to my friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   The Senate majority pretends their bill offers real protections. But when you read everything below the title, the bill offered by the Senate Republicans sounds more like an ``Insurers' Bill of Rights'' than a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   It is my hope that this amendment will spur our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle to renew their commitment to this conference committee and to do it in a bipartisan fashion. Spinning your wheels for 400 hours is not getting the job done.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I concur with what the Senator from Minnesota said. I defy anyone to explain in any rational context whatsoever, any kind of rational terms, why we make payments to farmers based on what they did 20 years ago. There is absolutely no rational basis for that. I will talk about that in my comments a little bit later.  
   I understand there is a unanimous consent request we are operating under, is that right?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself on my time such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the Senator from Montana for his strong support and input into this bill, as he said over a couple of years, trying to make sure we get a crop insurance bill that helps farmers manage risks. I appreciate his input and his kind words. Hopefully, we will adopt this conference reports this afternoon and farmers in Montana and Iowa, and all points in between, will at least have some assurance they can help manage their own risks.

   Mr. HARKIN. There are a lot of points in there, that is true. 
   Mr. President, I express my support for the conference report to the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 which we conferenced yesterday. 
   I thank Senator LUGAR, our chairman, for his hard work and persistence, as I said, over a couple of years in crafting the crop insurance title in this conference report which will provide significant benefits to farmers across the country. 
   This accomplishment is bipartisan, one of which we can be proud. I thank Senator LUGAR again for his persistent and strong leadership. I thank both Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY who really were the impetus for these changes in the Crop Insurance Program. I know the two of them worked long and hard to put together this bill. In the beginning stages, they worked with us on both sides of the aisle to meet the needs of various parts of our country. I especially thank Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY. 
   In this regard, Mr. President, this is probably the last agriculture bill we will have this year. There may be some bits and pieces that come along later. I think it is safe to say this may be the last, and probably will be the last, major ag bill this year. 
   In that regard, I pay my respects and thank our departing colleague, Senator KERREY from Nebraska. He has been an invaluable member of the Senate Agriculture Committee for all of these years. He has always given great input and great insight into our deliberations and discussions on all facets of American agriculture. He has been an invaluable member of our committee. I know I will miss him greatly on our side of the aisle. 
   He has always worked in a bipartisan fashion to help move legislation. I take this time to thank my friend and colleague from across the Missouri River and to wish him well in the future and again thank him for his work in getting this legislation through. It is a fitting tribute to his work through the years in the Senate. His fingerprints are on this crop insurance bill we are passing today. 
   The point of the bill is to help farmers obtain better crop insurance; that is, to help them buy up their coverage. The final structure of the premium subsidy schedule provides higher discounts at both lower and higher levels of buy-up coverage. The improvements at the highest levels, 80 and 100 and 85 and 100, will benefit Iowa farmers who typically face low risk of loss. 
   The bill also provides equivalent subsidies to farmers buying revenue insurance policies such as CRC, which is the crop revenue coverage, a product which is very popular with Iowa farmers. This change spurred development of new insurance policies and products. 
   In addition, the bill will offer reimbursement to private developers of new plans of insurance. Again, that will be good for our farmers. 
   Another major provision maintained was the elimination of the area loss  trigger for the program for noninsured crops, such as hay and forage crops or horticulture fruits and vegetables. 
   This change is important to Members in the West and Northeast, one which we fought very hard to maintain in conference. 
   The bill will also protect farmers by allowing them to maintain their insurable yields, despite significant crop loss, by limiting how much of a loss affects future insurance coverage. 
   This feature could be very helpful to Iowa farmers, especially those facing potential drought this summer. At some point today we will be talking a little bit more about that drought. But this will also be very helpful, again, to other farmers, too, in the Dakotas and other places where they have had some very severe losses for 1 or 2 years in a row, which, if not balanced out, could unduly affect their rates and their coverage in future years. So we protected those farmers in those areas in those circumstances. 
   I also want to note some other positive provisions in this bill, in the economic assistance package. 
   First, there is $50 million for conservation, $10 million for the Farmland Protection Act, and $40 million for EQIP. 
   I am disappointed, however, that an amendment that I had offered in the Senate, and which was adopted by the Senate, that would have linked conservation compliance to the provisions of crop insurance, was rejected by the House conferees. 
   In every other Government farm programs, there is a provision that mandates that a farmer has to follow conservation compliance to be eligible for those programs. We had it for crop insurance until 1996. It was taken out. I and others desired to put that back in this crop insurance bill. 
   As I said, it was adopted on the Senate side, but the House conferees refused to go along with that. And in the interests of getting the crop insurance bill through, we acceded to the unanimous consent request to go ahead and remove that provision. I am hopeful to come back with that again at some point in the future on some other piece of agricultural legislation. 
   But other than that, there is $50 million for conservation. That is good. 
   Secondly, there is $15 million in this bill to assist farmer-owned cooperatives, and other farmer-owned ventures, to help develop the value-added crops and processing for our farmers. 
   Third, there is $7 million in this bill to further fund vaccines for pseudo-rabbies eradication program for hogs. It is very important in our area of the country. 
   Fourth, in the nutrition assistance programs, there is $110 million for school lunch commodity purchases. Again, we have a lot of surplus crops out there, a lot of surplus commodities. I think it is beneficial, both for the health of our children, and the school lunch program, the school breakfast program, and the summer feeding program, that we purchase these commodities and get them out to our young kids. 
   Also, we have reformed the Child and Adult Care Food Program to guard more against fraud which has come up repeatedly. 
   Also, there is a provision in this bill--that is also a small provision--but I think it is going to be very important, which is going to permit us to get more children into health insurance for low-income families. 
   Right now, under the provisions in this bill, if you qualify for reduced-price school lunches, or free school lunches, a provision in the bill will then say the people in the school have to inform your families that since you qualify for free or reduced lunches, you will probably qualify for things such as the CHIP program, to make sure, through Medicaid, your children are in a health insurance program. That is another way of reaching low-income families to make sure that their children are indeed covered by health care. That is another good provision in this bill. 
   Lastly, there is a biomass research and development title in this bill that Senator LUGAR has worked on for a long time. He is a real champion of it. I have been a cosponsor of it, but it is 
   Senator LUGAR who has pushed this bill to help make more fuel and industrial raw materials from biomass. And this bill is part of this. Again, another good provision of this bill is the biomass research and development bill that has been championed by Senator LUGAR. 
   So there is much that is good in this bill. That is why I will support it. That is why I was reluctant in the conference committee to take any more time than we did yesterday, in just a few hours, to get this bill through. 
   But I am compelled to speak for a little bit about what is in this bill that I think is detrimental to our family farm structure in America and to ensuring that we have a diversified and widely spread system of agriculture. 
   The $7.1 billion in emergency assistance that is included in this report, I believe, is misapplied, misdirected, and in many cases will be misspent. 
   It is clear that our farmers are going to need aid. There is no doubt about that. But how this final package looks, I think, does not really meet those needs. This is the third year in a row that we have had additional AMTA payments--payments to farmers based on emergency help in the farm economy. The farm economy is still in shambles. For 3 years in a row, it has been in shambles. Every year, we come back and do the same thing year, after year after year, after year. Someone once defined ``insanity'' as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Every year we keep doing the same thing over and over, and we expect some different result; and we do not get a different result. The only result we get is fewer and fewer family farmers, more stress in rural areas, and more and more of our money going to the larger concerns who are driving out our family farms. 
   But I want to recite for the RECORD where this money is going, these billions of dollars that we are taking from taxpayers and putting out there. 
   During the first 3 years of our Freedom to Farm bill--1996 to 1998--the top 10 percent of payment recipients, or about 150,000 individuals, got 61 percent of the payments. Ten percent of the recipients got 61 percent of the money. Their annual payments from AMTA, the supplemental AMTAs, we passed every year, and the loan deficiency payments averaged $95,000. That is for the top 10 percent. 
   The other 90 percent averaged only $7,000 in payments. 
   I have a chart that illustrates this. It shows the average Government payments by farm size in 1997. The average was $7,378 for all farms. But those farms that had sales greater than $1 million averaged $33,699. For those farms that had sales of $250,000 to $500,000, they averaged $16,524--and on down. 
   As you can see, the bigger you are, the more you got. And I daresay, it is usually those bigger farmers that were better able to protect themselves with insurance and other methods, who may not have needed that kind of assistance. 
   It is the farmers down here in the lower end that needed the assistance and the help. But they were left stranded. 
   On a State-by-State basis, the lopsided nature is even more striking. I will talk about Iowa, too, but the top 10 percent of recipients in Mississippi received 83 percent of the payments. In Alabama, the top 10 percent received 81 percent of the payments. In my own State of Iowa, lest anyone think that I am singling out other States other than my own, the top 12 percent, in terms of income, received 50 percent of the payments in my State of Iowa. 
   I do not think that is fair. The inequities of the current system have been exacerbated during the current economic crisis in agriculture. 
   The last 2 years have shown that when prices are low, regular AMTA payments do nothing to keep an ad hoc disaster package under control. More importantly, they are not an effective mechanism in targeting aid to those who need it. 
   We have had the AMTA payments. We come along every year, and we have a disaster program. They are a very poor method of response to our current farm crisis. 
   While it is important to get needed aid out to producers, it is imperative that we get it out to help mostly family farmers who are really hurting, 
   not to help the bigger farms bury the smaller ones. 
   The data indicates just the opposite is happening. The lion's share of this additional aid will go to the largest  producers, while small producers receive almost nothing. Under the current scheme, a recipient at the high end of the spectrum may qualify for as much as $240,000 in AMTA payments this fiscal year. Under the current law, a person ``may be eligible'' to receive the payment maximum of $40,000 for each round of AMTA payments, the original payment plus the supplemental payment we have in this bill. That adds up, of course. Then they already received the supplemental payment that is in the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill. So that is $120,000. If they structure their operations to fit under the three-entity rule, each person can receive payments from three entities. That, in effect, doubles that $120,000 up to $240,000. And that is not the end of it. As much as $300,000 in loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains can go to that farmer. One farmer in this country this year can get up to $540,000 of taxpayers' money. I don't believe that is right; I don't believe that is fair. 
   I was going to offer a provision in the conference committee. I didn't. The reason I didn't is that I thought it was important to get the crop insurance bill through. As I said in the conference committee yesterday, we should have a crop insurance bill before us. 
   The budget resolution that was passed here, that allowed us to have additional spending this year for supplemental payments to farmers, provided for the authorizing committee to authorize it by June 29, which means we had until the end of June to have a debate in our committee to talk about the policy implications of what we have been doing the last couple years and whether or not we want this policy structure to continue. 
   Do we want to really continue to put our AMTA payments out like this? 
   Well, we did not have that debate, so here we are confronted with this on a crop insurance bill, which should not be. This should be a separate bill from the Agriculture Committee on the floor where we could debate this. 
   Maybe it would be the will of the majority of the Senate to continue to give large payments to large farmers, to continue the three-entity rule to allow some farmers to get hundreds of thousands of dollars. That could have been the outcome. But at least we should have been debating it. It should be here in a manner in which it would be debatable and amendable. We don't have that. 
   I was going to offer an amendment to limit to $100,000 the most anyone could get through the AMTA system. I heard all kinds of talk from different people saying this would be terrible. That would have affected five-tenths of 1 percent of all the recipients; 6,700 farmers would have been affected by that if we would have capped it at $100,000. 
   I have always thought I was here to fight for the vast majority of the family farmers who are out there, not just the top one-half of 1 percent who, by and large, have the economic wherewithal to protect themselves. Many of our smaller farmers simply don't. Again, the data indicates that it is those at the top of the spectrum who are getting the most money. 
   I have another chart. This chart illustrates how we are going in the wrong direction. As we continue down this pathway of AMTA payments, supplemental AMTA payments, loan deficiency payments built on each other year after year, without addressing the underlying provisions of the Freedom to Farm bill, what is happening is we are creating a bigger gap between the big farmers and the smaller farmers in our country. This chart illustrates that. 
   As one can see by Government payments here on the left side, $20,000, $40,000, $60,000, $80,000, $100,000, and producers who 
   receive those payments, if they look at this block, they will see that those producers who received about $50,000 or more in payments in the last 3 years almost doubled the amount of money they were getting from the Government--almost doubled it. 
   Look here at our smaller, family-sized farmers, who only got maybe $2,000 or $3,000 in payments. They just went up a very small amount. These doubled in size, doubled in payment; these hardly went up at all. What kind of policy are we pursuing here? 
   I am not talking about farmers just getting big on their own and making more money. If these big farmers are more efficient and can do a better job and get this money in the marketplace, God bless them. We are talking about taxpayers' money going from here to these farmers. The big ones almost doubled in the amount of money they are getting from the Government; the smaller ones barely got any increase at all. I wish someone would explain to me how this is sound public policy. 
   I have the figures right here. Recipients who averaged $50,000 or more in Government payments from 1996 to 1998 received $42,337 more in 1998 than in 1996. In contrast, if you were at the bottom of the payment spectrum, these little ones down here at the bottom, you averaged between $5,000 and $10,000 per year, which is the bulk of the farmers in my State; you received a mere $740 more in 1998 than you did in 1997. 
   I will repeat that. In my State--just talking about my State; I don't want to pick on anybody else's State--in my own State of Iowa, if you received an average of $50,000 or more in Government agricultural payments from 1996 to 1998, in 1 year you got more than a $28,000 increase, from 1997 to 1998. You got $42,000 more over the 2 years. That is if you were at the top of the heap. If you were at the bottom and you only got $5,000 to $10,000 in Government payments, you got $740 more. 
   Someone please tell me how this is good public policy, that we give Government money out like this to the biggest, those who can protect themselves. Do you know what they are doing with that money? They are buying more land. They are getting bigger, because our smaller farmers are going out of production and the bigger farmers are buying their land. 
   Again, if this were a free market approach, I would say fine, but it is Government payments going out to large farmers who are providing for the extinction of our family farmers--Government policies, right now, allowing these bigger farmers to get these massive Government payments, squeezing the smaller producers, and the bigger producers are buying up the land and getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It isn't because of any free market approach, it is because of governmental policies. Again, the disparities are not just size related, they are based on planting history. 
   When I opened my remarks earlier today, I said someone please explain to me how it is good public policy that we pay farmers AMTA payments, Government payments, this year based on what they did 20 years ago. That is right. I try to explain this to people, and I get blank stares. It is a fact. If you have two farmers out there, one who has a 20-year history of planting and the other who maybe only has a 5-year history of planting, the one who has the 20-year history of planting may be planting nothing this year, but guess what, you are going to get money. 
   Yet if you were a farmer out there planting for the last 3, 4, or 5 years, you don't have that 20-year history, you won't get anything. Again, please explain to me how this is good policy. It is not tied to what farmers are producing today. It is tied to what they produced 20 years ago. 
   Two farmers in Iowa, with half their production in corn and half their production in soybeans, can be paid markedly different levels because of past planting history. When you figure the AMTA payment level, the farmer with a 50-percent corn base and a 50-percent soybean base will be paid half as much in AMTA payments as the farmer who has a 100-percent corn base. What sense does this make? It makes no sense. Farmers all over my State recognize that. 
   Now, as if all I have said isn't bad enough, the prospects for drought this year will even cause this program to be worse than it is. If a drought of the proportions that is predicted actually occurs, the disparity between the haves and the have-nots will grow even more. Why is that? Because let's say we have a drought--and it looks as if we are going to have pretty severe droughts in some parts of the country and other parts of the country will not--that means that the price, say, of corn is going to go up. But you, who are in a drought area, may only get a certain portion--you may get an AMTA payment, but you won't get anything out of the market because you won't have  a crop. If, however, you are in an area where you haven't had a drought, you are going to get high prices for your crop and an AMTA payment. Those who have no crop to sell will have their incomes plummet; they will get no adjustment in their AMTA payment to address those losses. They will get absolutely no more than the farmer who has a huge crop because they were not in the drought area. Again, these payments will exacerbate again this disparity between the large farmers and the small farmers in America. Again, I think that is bad public policy. 
   Now, maybe if we have a big drought, we will come rushing in here with some kind of a disaster package. But, again, I wonder who is going to get the benefits of that. So throughout all of this, the mantra has been that there is no other viable mechanism, that AMTA payments are our best means of getting aid to our producers. Well, if this is the best we can do, I would hate to see what the worst is. 
   There is a better way. I believe both sides should come together to figure out a better way of getting payments out to farmers. This idea of giving more and more to the biggest is not right, not good for our country; it is not good public policy. I have urged the Senate to have a frank and open discussion about the failures of the current system and on ways to improve it. We have not been afforded that opportunity in a meaningful way. 
   As I said, this is in no way disparaging of my friend and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I know he was more than willing to have this discussion and this debate. But the powers that be insisted that we have this AMTA payment provision on the crop insurance bill. So here we are with it, without any provision for our authorizing committee to discuss and debate, and perhaps modify. As I said, I don't know if the will of the majority would have been there to do that, but at least we could have had an open and frank discussion about whether or not we wanted to go in that direction. Hopefully, we will have that opportunity in the future. 
   So, again, I hope we will have this type of debate. I think our farmers and our taxpayers deserve that type of debate. In the meantime, I have no problems with the underlying bill. It is a good bill. The crop insurance bill is a good bill. It is going to go a long way toward helping our farmers manage the risk. As I said, there are other good provisions attached onto it. I am just sorry we had to attach on the payment provisions to this bill without having the committee do its job. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished chairman, thanking all the staff who worked so hard on this and hammered out all the agreements over a long period of time on both sides of the aisle. All the Members of our committee and their staffs did a great job. I join our distinguished chairman in thanking them. 
   Let me also thank our chairman, our leader, Senator LUGAR, for his persistence and doggedness in getting this bill through. I think it has been at least 1 1/2 years, if I am not mistaken, since we started on this road. It has had a lot of twists and turns and ups and downs.  Senator LUGAR stayed in there. He knew how important this bill was to our farmers. It is a great bill. It is one that is really going to help our farmers manage their risks. 
   I again compliment him and thank him for his leadership but also for being so kind and generous, to always work with me and be open and aboveboard. I have never had an instance where I thought in any way that my chairman was ever keeping anything hidden, going behind the door or anything such as that. It has been a great working relationship. I thank my friend and my chairman for having that kind of good working relationship with this side of the aisle.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator FRIST today to introduce the ``WISEWOMAN Expansion Act.'' This bill will help thousands of women have access to basic preventive health care they may otherwise not receive. The legislation builds on a successful demonstration program and expands screening services and preventive care for uninsured and low-income women across the nation. 
   Beginning in 1990, I worked as Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to provide the funding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), run through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Iowa alone, the program has successfully served 8694 women through 618 provider-based breast and cervical cancer screening sites. 
   Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently run the WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women in Massachusetts, Arizona and North Carolina) program through the NBCCEDP as a demonstration project. The program has successfully built upon the framework of the NBCCEDP to target other chronic diseases among women, including heart disease, the leading cause of death among women, and osteoporosis. The programs address risk factors such as elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and smoking and provide important additional intervention services. 
   This demonstration project has been successful. It is now time to expand the program to additional states, and eventually make it nationwide. As the brother of two sisters lost to breast cancer and the father of two daughters, I know first hand the importance of making women's health initiatives a top priority. The first step to fighting a chronic disease like cancer, heart disease or osteoporosis is early detection. All woman deserve to benefit from the early detection and prevention made possible by the latest advances in medicine. This bill ensures a place for lower-income woman at the health care table. 
   Mr. President, the majority of Americans associate cardiovascular disease with men, but the American Heart Association estimates that nearly one in two women will die of heart disease or stroke. In fact, cardiovascular diseases kills nearly 50,000 more women each year than men. In my own state of Iowa, cardiovascular disease accounts for 44 percent of all dealths in Iowa. Close to 7,000 women die annually in Iowa from cardiovascular disease. Each year, nearly half a million women lose their lives as a result of heart disease and stroke. Sadly, with appropriate screening and interventions, many of these deaths could have been prevented. 
   Osteoporosis is also a preventable disease and affects 1 out of every 2 women over the age of 50. Fortunately, some of the preventive measures women can take to reduce their risk for cardiovascular diseases, such as eating more nutritious foods and exercising, can also reduce their risk for osteoporosis. 
   Mr. President, our bill would do the following: 
   Expand the current WISEWOMAN demonstration project to additional states; 
   Add flexibility to program language that would allow screenings and other preventive measures for diseases in addition to cardiovascular diseases; 
   Allow flexibility for the WISEWOMAN program to grow and adapt with the changing needs of individual states and our better understanding of new preventive strategies; and 
   Ensures continued full collaboration of the WISEWOMAN program with the NBCCEDP; 
   Authorizes the CDC to make competitive grants to states to carry out additional preventive health services to the breast and cervical cancer screenings at NBCCEDP programs, such as: screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol, and osteoporosis; health education and counseling; lifestyle interventions to change behavioral risk factors such as smoking, lack of exercise, poor nutrition, and sedentary lifestyle; and appropriate referrals for medical treatment and follow-up services. 
   In order to be eligible for this program, states are required to already participate in the NBCCEDP and to agree to operate their WISEWOMAN program in collaboration with the NBCCEDP. 
   Mr. President, this bipartisan legislation has the support of the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the American Cancer Society and the Komen Foundation, among others. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical legislation.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my colleagues, Senator THOMAS, Senator CRAIG and Senator FEINGOLD, to introduce the ``Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act of 2000.'' This legislation addresses the terrible unfairness that exists today in Medicare payment policy. 
   According to the latest Medicare figures, Medicare payments per beneficiary by state of residence ranged from slightly more than $3000 to well in excess of $6500. For example, in Iowa, the average Medicare payment was $3456, nearly a third less than the national average of $5,034. In Wyoming the situation is worse, with an average payment of approximately $3200. 
   This payment inequity is unfair to seniors in Iowa and Wyoming, and it is unfair to rural beneficiaries everywhere. The citizens of my home state pay the same Medicare payroll taxes required of every American taxpayer. Yet they get dramatically less in return. 
   Ironically, rural citizens are not penalized by the Medicare program because they practice inefficient, high cost medicine. The opposite is true. The low payment rates received in rural areas are in large part a result of their historic conservative practice of health care. In the early 1980's rural states' lower-than-average costs were used to justify lower payment rates, and Medicare's payment policies since that time have only widened the gap between low- and high-cost states. 
   Mr. President, late last year I wrote to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and I asked them a simple question. I asked their actuaries to estimate for me the impact on Medicare's Trust Funds, which at that time were scheduled to go bankrupt in 2015, if average Medicare payments to all states were the same as Iowa's. 
   I've always thought Iowa's reimbursement level was low. But HCFA's answer suprised even me. The actuaries found that if all states were reimbursed at the same rate as Iowa, Medicare would be solvent for at least 75 years, 60 years beyond their projections. 
   I'm not suggesting that all states should be brought down to Iowa's level. But there is no question that the long-term solvency of the Medicare program is of serious national concern. And as Congress considers ways to strengthen and modernize the Medicare program, the issue of unfair payment rates needs to be on the table. 
   The bill we are introducing today, the ``Medicare Fairness in Reimbursement Act of 2000'' sends a clear signal. These historic wrongs must be righted. Before any Medicare reform bill passes Congress, I intend to make sure that rural beneficiaries are guaranteed access to the same quality health care services of their urban counterparts. 
   Mr. President, our legislation does the following: 
   Requires HCFA to improve the fairness of payments under the original Medicare fee-for-services system by adjusting payments for items and services so that no state is greater than 105% above the national average, and no state is below 95% of the national average. An estimated 30 states would benefit under these adjustments, based on 1998 data from the Ways and Means Green Book. 
   Requires improvements in the collection and use of hospital wage data by occupational category. Experts agree the current system of collecting hospital data ``lowballs'' the payment received by rural hospitals. Large urban hospitals are overcompensated today because they have a much higher number of highly-paid specialists and sub-specialists on their staff, while small rural hospitals tend to have more generalists, who aren't as highly paid. 
   Ensures that beneficiaries are held harmless in both payments and services. 
   Ensures budget neutrality. 
   Automatically results in adjustment of Medicare managed care payments to reflect increased equity between rural and urban areas.  
   This legislation simply ensures basic fairness in our Medicare payment policy. I urge my Senate colleagues, no matter what state you're from, to consider our bill and join us in supporting this common sense Medicare reform. Thank you.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I take a back seat to no one in being a legitimate hunter. I hunt every year. I have hunted since I have been a kid. I will take on anyone over there in trap shooting. That is not what this is about. It is not about law-abiding people who like to hunt and own guns to hunt with, or somebody who needs one for self-protection in their home. That is not what this is about. 
   That's why I have to take issue with those who are always misinterpreting the Constitution of the United States--misinterpreting it. When you look at the Lott amendment before us, the first thing he says is the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right of each law-abiding U.S. citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-defense or recreation. 
   Please tell me where in the second amendment and the Constitution it says that. You can go out to the NRA building, and on the side it says, ```The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' the second amendment to the Constitution.'' Anybody can take anything out of context, Mr. President. You can prove there is no God by reading the Bible. All I ask you is to open the Bible to Psalms 14:1. Guess what it says; ``.....there is no God.'' I ask my friend from Idaho if he has ever read Psalms 14:1. It says there is no God, in the Bible. But what does it say right before that? ``The fool said in his heart there is no God.'' 
   What relation does that have to the second amendment to the Constitution? Everybody has this book in their desk. It is not that big a deal to read this. It says:  
   A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  
   So what do they do? They take it out of context. I suppose somebody could take the Bible out of context, too. You have to put it into contextual framework. The framers of the Constitution knew they didn't want a standing army. They wanted a militia, like the National Guard, for people in their homes to keep arms for protection. Read your history books. These people out here who want to reinterpret the Constitution for their own ends are doing our people a great disservice. 
   Now, take another look at the Lott amendment. The Lott amendment has a finding in the end. Here is the sense of the Senate that--get this:  
   The right of each law-abiding United States citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-defense or recreation, should not be infringed.  
   The right of each law-abiding United States citizen. It doesn't have an age limit. Does that mean a kid 13 years old can have an Uzi for recreational purposes? It doesn't say that there. There is no age limit on it. It could be a 5-year-old kid or a 10-year-old kid. I will say one other thing. ``For any legitimate purpose,'' it says. Does that mean--

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. Read the language of the 
   Lott amendment. ``The right of each law-abiding United States citizen.'' No age limit; 10-year-old kids or 14-year-old kids can own any amount of guns they want. 
   ``For any legitimate purpose, including recreation.'' Does that mean if I want to own 50 Uzis, the Government can't have anything to say about it? Maybe that is my recreation and I want to blow down a lot of things in my backyard. This doesn't make any sense. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution makes no sense. It misinterprets the Constitution. 
   Secondly, it opens the door wider than we have ever seen it before. Keep in mind, when you vote on the Lott substitute, what you are saying is that anyone in the United States who is a citizen--no age limit--can own any amount of guns that person wants. There are no restrictions. Is that what we want in this country? If so, have the guts to stand up and say so. Stand up and say that you want 10-year-old kids owning Uzis and machine guns. Go ahead and say it if that is what you want because that is what the language of the Lott amendment says. 
   All you have to do is read the language of what is in front of us. Look at this chart. This says what we ought to do is ``start them young; there is no time like the present'' for a little kid like that on this chart. This is an ad. Under the Lott amendment, that kid could be carrying 10 Uzis. Keep that in mind when you vote for it. 
   Mr. President, I do support Senator DASCHLE's resolution. We had one million mothers, their families and friends on Mother's Day demanding their elected lawmakers take final action on the Juvenile Justice bill and the gun measures that bill included. For ten months since we first passed the bill--despite numerous gun tragedies at schools, workplaces and even places of worship all across America--the Republican leadership has refused to move forward on these common sense provisions. 
   What is almost as senseless as these tragedies is the fact that Congress refuses to act on this legislation that would prevent many of these shootings. 
   What are the so-called controversial measures we're talking about? Measures--ironically--that would not affect law-abiding citizens who want to own a gun. Let me take a moment to list  them: Requiring gun manufacturers to provide child safety locks with their guns, giving the owners the option to install them. Closing the gun show loophole that allows sales at gun shows without background checks. Right now, 40 percent of all gun show sales go without a background check. Under this provision, all potential buyers at gun shows will use the Instant Check computer system--which normally takes a few minutes. For the small percentage of potential buyers--less than 5 percent--they may have to wait up to three days so records can be checked manually on the closest business day. And the bill would ban juvenile possession of semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. These are reasonable measures. 
   But, I also believe we need to do a better job at enforcing current laws. I support the Administration's budget request for new funding to hire more ATF agents and prosecutors. I also support their request for research funding to develop ``smart-gun'' technology which could limit a gun's use to its owner and authorized users to help prevent accidental shootings. 
   Opponents of common sense gun safety laws set up a false choice between prevention and enforcement. Any successful policy will have to have both of these elements.

   Mr. HARKIN. I want to ask the Senator another question. The decisions they make today are behind closed doors. Does the Senator know how long it will be before we will be able to look at the detailed books to find out why they made those decisions? I will answer it. It will be 5 years before we will fully know why they made the decisions. Maybe if we knew tomorrow, or next week, or next month why they made the decision, we might want to make some changes around here in the way we operate. They make the decisions, and we will not know the full picture for 5 years why they did it.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator KENNEDY and others for getting this time to talk about the bankruptcy bill. 
   I must at the outset admit that due to the press of business around here, and I am not on that committee that formulated this bill, I had not really looked at the bankruptcy portions of it in depth. A lot of people I admire and have respect for have supported the bill. I supported a number of amendments. When the bill finally passed, I had some qualms about it. I voted against it. But I had not really delved into it in very much depth until a week ago, last week, when Time magazine came out with one of the longest stories I have ever seen Time magazine do. It has been mentioned by the previous two speakers, a story called ``Soaked By Congress.'' It is 12 pages or more long. 
   I read it. When I read it, some memories started coming back to me of my days when I was a legal aid lawyer before coming to Congress. I was thinking about the people we represented at the low end of the economic spectrum who could not afford to get another attorney from a private law firm, and the people we took through bankruptcy. These were people at wit's end. I remember them. Often it was a woman with a couple of children, her husband  took off, there was illness in the family, she racked up a lot of bills, and she had nowhere to go. 
   At that time in Iowa, we were also debating a bill in the Iowa Legislature to limit the amount of interest that could be charged on a credit card. The Iowa Legislature in fact at that time passed a limit of 15 percent. It did not hurt the State at all. I remembered that, reading this article. 
   When you heard the debate out here on the bankruptcy bill, you would think these were people out living high on the hog, going to the best restaurants, taking foreign vacations, driving Mercedes Benz cars and BMWs, they have beautiful homes and stuff, and all of a sudden they decide they have been living the life of Riley and they do not want to pay their dues, so they go into bankruptcy court. That is the image of the average person filing bankruptcy that came out here on the Senate floor during that debate. That is a very bad misrepresentation. 
   As the Time magazine article pointed out, the median characteristics of a person discharging chapter 7 bankruptcy: Gross income, $22,800--gross; reported expenses, $20,592; total debt, $42,000, of which miscellaneous debt--medical bills is about $10,000; unsecured debt, credit card, about $23,000; and secured debt, a car, about $9,000. 
   Another thing I remembered from my days as a legal aid lawyer: Most of the people going into bankruptcy were women. It has not changed. As the Time magazine article points out, 497,000 single women filed for bankruptcy last year compared to only single 367,000 men. 
   What are the reasons? Because of a job loss, 51 percent; 46 percent because of medical reasons; 19 percent because of a family breakup. The reason that adds up to more than 100 percent is that people said: I lost my job and my family broke up. That is why most people are going into bankruptcy court today, not because they have been living high on the hog and they are out there trying to get away. 
   We heard statements made on the floor that bankruptcy is not as shameful as it used to be. I beg to differ. Most of the people who go into bankruptcy court are embarrassed, they are ashamed. I remember them from my days as a legal aid lawyer. They fell on hard times, the interest charges keep piling up and piling up, and they could never get ahead of it. They have kids to care for, and they have expenses they have to keep up just to take care of their families. That is who is going into bankruptcy court. It is not 
   because of living high on the hog. 
   The real deviousness of the expected final version of the bill, what is really bad, is, for example, as Time magazine pointed out, an individual who had made millions of dollars sort of scamming the system on investments--Villa, his name is. James Villa is a 42-year-old one-time stockholder who lives in a $1.4 million home in Boca Raton. They contrasted him to 73-year-old Allen Smith, a retired autoworker with throat cancer who lives in an $80,000 home in Wilmington, DE. 
   They go through the whole story. I do not have the time. You can read it. But Villa profited handsomely, he bought Ferraris, he bought a $22,000 Rolex watch for his wife, a 3-carat $44,000 wedding ring, $9,000 diamond earrings. In October 1988, Massachusetts securities authorities ruled he had been engaging in fraudulent and unethical practices. They revoked their broker-dealer registration. He packs up, moves to Florida, takes his money, and buys this huge $1.4 million house. Guess what. It is beyond the reach of his creditors thanks to the homestead exemption in Florida. 
   How about 73-year-old Allen Smith of Wilmington, DE? He served in World War II, worked hard all his life as an auto mechanic, and, guess what. He lost his job, then his world started falling apart, and now he has cancer. He has filed chapter 13, and now they can take his house away from him. 
   We stopped that abuse in the Senate version of the bill. But, unfortunately, I am told that the loophole filled provision in the House that will allow this practice to continue is likely to be in the final measure. This bill is bad, it is getting worse.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to, first of all, support enthusiastically the Trade and Development Act of 2000 known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act. 
   I thank Chairman ROTH, Senator MOYNIHAN, and the staffs for their hard work to retain the amendment I offered on child labor. This is an important piece of legislation not only for the trade benefits it promises to African and Caribbean countries, but for the benefits it promises to another important and often neglected group, the world's children. 
   This bill includes a provision I introduced last year in the form of an amendment when we first considered this trade measure. As many of you will recall, my amendment, cosponsored by Senators HELMS and WELLSTONE, sought to ensure that beneficiaries of U.S. trade preferences fulfill their commitments to eliminate the use of abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   My amendment passed the Senate by a resounding vote of 96-0. The provision contained in this conference report is very simple and straightforward. 
   It builds on the international consensus that came out of the ILO conference in Geneva last June in which the delegates unanimously adopted the Convention to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 
   This provision simply states that in order to be eligible for the trade benefits in this bill, the Generalized System of Preferences, the Caribbean Basin Initiatives, the African Trade Preferences, a country must implement its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor as established by ILO Convention 182 for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor--it is that simple.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Labor and Education Committee and also as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee that appropriates money for the Department of Education, including title I, I would like to correct the record. I have the greatest respect and friendship for my colleague from Iowa. However, sitting here listening to his remarks and comments, I certainly wish the Senator, my colleague, had talked to me before he made those comments. Maybe I would not have to stand up to correct them. Because, frankly, what my colleague just said simply does not comport with the facts. 
   The chart that Senator Coats sent out this morning, and used this morning, it is like that old saying: In the Bible it says `There is no God.' It says that in the Bible. 
   But the sentence before it says, `The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.'  
   So, if you take things out of context you can prove the Bible says `There is no God.' That is what Senator Coats did this morning. 
   Senator COATS sent this notice around to our offices this morning, ``Urgent, Members Attention Only,'' and it says, ``Senator Harkin: Reasons to Vote No on Elementary-Secondary Act; Iowa Would Lose $9.95 a million.'' I assume that is where my colleague got that figure. 
   Senator COATS is only telling half the story. He is sort of saying it says, in the Bible, ``There is no God,'' but he does not tell you what the sentence before it says. 
   I tried to get the floor this morning to correct it. We were under a time agreement, the time ran out and I could not get the floor. Fortunately, I was able to talk to Senators as they came to the well to let them know that the figures that Senator Coats was putting out were wrong. 
   Let me correct that record now. Iowa does not lose $10 million. I happen to chair the Appropriations Committee that funds the money. There is no way this would have gotten through if my State was going to lose $10 million, I can tell you that, Mr. President. No, what we did and what is not being said here and what is not understood--and I say this to my friend from Iowa, my colleague--there are two parts to this formula on title I. There is the targeted grant formula. That is what Senator Coats is using. If you only look at the targeted grant money, yes, Iowa and a lot of other States lose money. But what we added in conference was another portion of the formula called effort and equity, something I feel very strongly about. I debated it on the Senate floor. So when we went to conference, in trying to strike a deal with the House, they only wanted targeted grants, but I insisted that we also have a second formula for effort and equity, and that is what we did. 
   So under the bill itself, there is money that goes for targeted or for effort and equity. New moneys that we will appropriate can be split by the Appropriations Committee. Some can go to targeted, some can go to effort and equity. The Appropriations Subcommittees will decide. First of all, next year we have already appropriated the money for fiscal year 1995. That is already done. For fiscal year 1996, there is a hold-harmless clause. So no States are going to lose money in 1996, not Iowa nor any other State can lose money in 1996. So, again, Senator Coats used this from fiscal year 1996 to 1999. You cannot use 1996 because there is a hold-harmless clause. 
   Beginning in fiscal year 1996, the Appropriations Committee, under the authorization of this bill, is allowed to use whatever new moneys we appropriate, up to $200 million in 1996, for effort and equity. Beyond that, such sums as are necessary. 
   Senator Coats used a figure from CRS of $400 million. I can show you the record in conference. They were talking about $400 million increases in title I. I said, I don't know what you are talking about. The average over the last 5 years has been $275,000, and under the budget caps and the ceilings we have, there is no way over the next 5 or 6 years that we are going to have a $400 million increase in title I. I would like to see it. If you are asking me if we can get the money, would I like to put $400 million in title I, absolutely; but we are not going to have that kind of money. 
   So in title I then, assuming we can get a $200 million increase, the Appropriations Committee can put all of it into effort and equity, 75 percent of it into effort and equity, half of it into effort and equity--whatever we want to do. 
   So what we did is we prepared a chart showing what would happen to the States if just half of the money went into the effort and equity or if all of it went into effort and equity. 
   Under either one of those scenarios, Iowa, instead of losing money, makes money. In fact, I do not have the runs for anything other than $400 million, but even under $400 million, Iowa would gain about $400,000 a year; and if we put the whole thing into effort and equity, Iowa would gain about $1.8 million a year.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the question. I will try to respond to it. The figures I am using come from the Congressional Research Service. What I am saying is that Senator Coats only took one column.

   Mr. HARKIN. If you look at the chart, what he did was he took the second column over, which just says $400 million under targeted formula. Senator Coats used that column. He did not take the other two columns. The other two columns add effort and equity; the third column over showing what would happen if we split it in half; the last column showing if we put it all into effort and equity. 
   I cannot in any way tell my colleague how much we will put in. I can assure him it will be a minimum of 50 percent. I suggest, knowing the members of the Appropriations Committee and that 33 States will be helped by effort and equity, it stands to reason that the bulk of the money will go into effort and equity. So I would say we are probably close to the column on the right-hand side, which shows Iowa getting $54 million. 
   Keep in mind, that is based on $400 million. There is no way we are going to get $400 million, but it gives you an idea of what happens under this thing. 
   So what Senator Coats did is he simply took out of context what CRS came up with. He took one column, and that is why I tried to get the floor this morning to explain that is not so. That is just not the way the Appropriations Subcommittee is going to operate, and that is why we put the effort and equity thing in there. 
   In no way is Iowa going to have their moneys reduced under this effort and equity formula. That is the point I tried to make this morning and I tried to make it in the well to the Senators. As I said about my Biblical example, about taking something out of context, sure you can take one column, but that is not what we are operating under. 
   I hope that clears it up. Does my colleague have any further questions on that?

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chairman, and I commend him again for his work on this important legislation, and in particular this provision. The problems of youth violence and drug abuse are no longer contained within urban school districts, and are rapidly spreading to suburban and rural communities. By making a program available for statewide distribution, we can better ensure that each student in a State will be reached by a program, and that students throughout the State will receive the same messages. 
   I was extremely impressed by Jonathan Kozol's ``Savage Inequalities,'' and I know the Senator from Utah has also done considerable research on school equalization. Is it  his view that the concept of equalizing resources among school districts as public policy is supported by experts in the field?

   Mr. HARKIN. I would respond to the Senator from Utah that yes, I believe the equalization of resources is consistent with the premise of the title I program which is to give disadvantaged students additional help by directing supplemental resources to them. If federal resources are not supplementary, then States have absolutely no incentive to deal effectively with education financing problems in their own States. The Federal Government should not subsidize this kind of inaction.

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Utah is correct. I share his commitment to education finance reform and I favor the establishment of this effort and equity incentive in title I of ESEA. 
   The Senator from Utah mentioned that he was proud of the efforts his State has made to equalize resources among schools. The State of Iowa revamped its State aid formula to equalize funding in the 1970's. I am equally proud of efforts in my State to provide a quality education for all students. 
   I will do what I can as chairman of the Labor, Health, and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee to support this new authorization.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator MURRAY for yielding me this time on the debate of this most important issue, of whether or not our kids are going to learn in a better environment by reducing class size, or whether we are going to go into some opposite direction. 
   I must say this debate on class size sort of reminds me of the movie ``Ground Hog Day.'' We keep having this debate over and over and over again, even though we know what the reality is. 
   We have already had 2 years of funding, and 1 year of the money has gone out. All you have to do is go out and ask the teachers. Just go out to your schools, where they have used the money for class size reduction, and simply ask them: Do you like it? Is it working? That is all you have to do. It is very simple. If you do that, you will find that teachers and principals and superintendents like this. They want our assistance to reduce class sizes. 
   What we did is we set a goal of no more than 18 students in grades 1 through 3. We have already provided funding for the first 2 years. Are we going to stop now and turn the clock back? That is what the Republicans want to do. 
   I must say that I listened to the remarks made by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. HUTCHINSON, when he was talking about this issue. Quite frankly, the more I listened to him, the more I came to realize his argument is not against what we are doing, his argument is against local control because, obviously, it was either the principal or the superintendent who made the decision to float a teacher from class to class to class at 90-minute periods of time. That is certainly not in our legislation. They have the flexibility to do that. 
   I have visited many schools in my State and have talked about reducing class sizes. The teachers, parents, and students are thrilled with the results they are seeing after just 1 year. But instead of my talking about it, let me read what some of my constituents had to say.  
   I visited Starry Elementary School in Marion, IA. I spoke with Reggie Long, a first grade teacher for 30 years. She told me she appreciated the smaller classes. She said:  
   It's nice because I can give individual attention to the kids. We just give them so much academically now. If you don't give them individual help, they can't succeed and we can't succeed as teachers.  
   The superintendent of this school district said:  
   The key to effective teaching is getting to know the students and parents.  
   William Jacobson said that it is easier when teachers have fewer students in their classes. 
   Last year, Angie Borgmeyer, a teacher in Indianola had 27 students in her second grade class. This year she has 21. She said 27 was too many. She said:  
   It's very difficult with that many students. When you're trying to teach them to read and give them basic arithmetic, you need to be able to do it in a small group and give them individual attention.  
   So this program is simple. It is eminently flexible. It is very popular. It is time to stop playing politics with it. We heard about there being problems with applying for it, and the burdensome paperwork. 
   I have here in my hand an application from the Des Moines Independent Community School District, for an application they sent in for class size reduction. It has 1 page, 2 pages, a signature page and a letter. That is burdensome? For that they got $854,693.56 to reduce class sizes. 
   In closing, I will share some comments from students. I thought this was illustrative. I visited the McKinley Elementary School in Des Moines and Mrs. Kloppenborg's second grade class. These kids already know what is going on. I thought I would bring these. I will leave them on my desk. These are pretty pictures. Last year there were 34 students in each second grade classroom. This year, they have about 23. So this is what the second grade kids were saying about how they felt about their new class size. I am going to read just some of the letters they wrote. They drew these wonderful pictures. 
   This one by Alicia says:  
   I can spend more time with the teacher.  
   Leydy says:  
   I can learn more about reading in a small group.  
   Daniel says:  
   We learn more and get better grades.  
   He has a great picture. There is a kid in a desk saying, ``Hi, Senator HARKIN.'' I guess that is me saying hi because I have a necktie on. There is a kid in front of the teacher's desk and he is kneeling--it looks like with a report card. If I could, I would tell him it didn't work for me in the old days, and it is not going to work for him today, either. 
   Here is another one, but there is no name on this. It says:  
   I can make friends.  
   Another one says:  
   We have more space to do things like reading.  
   It is a nice picture of the bookshelves with all the books on there. 
   This one by Jessica says:  
   I can learn more because the teacher can help me.  
   This next one says:  
   I can learn more because I get more help.  
   He drew a picture of his hand on here. 
   If you look at all these, every kid they draw is smiling. Every kid is smiling. So, you see, these kids--and I visited this class--they know it. They can sense it. They feel it. They have more space and more time with the teacher. They get more individual help, and the kids love it. 
   When I was there, a few parents came over to the school. What they said to me was amazing. ``The difference between my child this year and last year is incredible,'' they said. ``They are getting more work done and learning better and they are happier; they come home happier.'' 
   So, for the life of me, I can't understand what the argument is on the other side against our involvement in sending money out, no strings attached, with a lot of flexibility for teacher training. We have districts in Iowa that got the waiver because they already had class size reduction; they had reduced classes down to about 20, close to 18. They applied and got a waiver for teacher training. That is precisely what the Murray amendment does. 
   So it seems to me all of the arguments on the other side just boils down to politics. For some reason--perhaps because this was started under a Democratic administration, or perhaps because the amendments were offered by a Democrat--they are opposed to it. That should not be the way it is around here. It should be judged on the merits. We know from experience in the field that the merits justify this amendment to reduce class size and make sure our kids get the attention and education they need. 
   I commend Senator MURRAY, especially, for her long and stalwart support in class size reduction. I must say, Mr. President, around here a lot of times we defer to those who are experts. A lot of times when we have medical issue that come up, we defer to BILL FRIST because he is a doctor. I say to my friends, let's defer to a teacher. Senator PATTY MURRAY is a teacher. She was a teacher before she came here. Quite frankly, I think she knows a lot about what we need in public education. So I commend Senator MURRAY for her leadership on this issue.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator PAUL WELLSTONE, for having the foresight and the intelligence to have Mike Epstein on his staff for all the years he has been here in the Senate. 
   I say to you, Mike, you could not have picked a better person to work for in the Senate. PAUL is in the great tradition of those you have worked with before in the Senate. 
   I also want to thank you, Mike, for all of your work in the Senate over all these years. When I heard the other day that you were home battling cancer, I said, it is impossible; I saw him right back here just the other day, in back of the balustrade over here. Many times I would be sitting here when debate would be going on, and I would go over and say, ``Mike, tell me what is happening,'' or ``What is going on here on the floor?'' or ``What is the amendment? What is our strategy?'' 
   Mike would fill me in. I thank you, Mike, for keeping me up to speed as to what was happening on the floor a lot of times. Mostly, I also want to thank you, Mike, for all the times we rode back and forth on the subway cars together. It seems around here that sometimes you just kind of meet certain people at certain times. It is unplanned and it sort of happens. I don't know why, but you and I, Mike, seemed to be on the same schedule to ride the subway. I don't know what the subway ride is, a couple or 3 minutes. There was always time for me to get a 3-minute briefing from you, Mike, on what we were doing and what we were fighting for. It revolved around I think what I would like to say is the liberal cause. 
   If there is one thing I would like to really thank both Mike Epstein and PAUL WELLSTONE for, it is for fighting for the liberal cause. I can't think of anyone who embodies more of what I believe is the real face of liberalism in this country than you, Mike. I think of what President Kennedy once said. I may get the words a little wrong because I am reaching into my memory bank now. But President Kennedy was  once asked--I believe when he was running for President--about being a ``liberal,'' whether he was a liberal or not. President Kennedy responded by saying: Well, if by liberal you mean someone who 
   is soft on defense, someone who is not concerned about ethics and morals, someone who doesn't believe in responsibility and accountability--if that is what you mean by liberal, that is not me. But if by liberal you mean someone who cares deeply about the health and the welfare and the happiness of our people, and if by liberal you mean someone who fights for the education of all of our kids, even the most disadvantaged, and if by liberal you mean someone who will fight for the elderly and their rights in our society, if that is what you mean by liberal, then I am one, and I am proud to be one. 
   So, Mike, I think you embody exactly what President Kennedy was talking about. In all the years I have known you, that has really been your mantle. In all the strategies we had here in fighting for legislation, I think you, Mike, really represented those who didn't have a high paid lobbyist pushing for them, such as children in poverty, working parents who needed some help, and even my people living in rural areas--a lot of times you helped them. 
   I just wanted to take this time to thank you, Mike, for always fighting for what I believe is in the best traditions of liberalism in this country. It is the liberal attitude that I believe makes us more compassionate and understanding toward one another, and you have embodied that during the entire time I have known you for all these years. 
   Again, I thank you for that. You have been a great person, a remarkable person. For as long as I am here, I am always going to turn back to the balustrade and look for Mike Epstein to tell me what is going on and what our strategy is and to keep me focused on what really matters around this place, and that is what we do to enhance the lives of people at the bottom of the ladder. That really is the mark of what we are about and should be about as a Senate. 
   Mike, I thank you, and I thank PAUL for getting us together this morning to pay tribute to you. I know you are struggling right now, and I just want you to know that you are always in my thoughts and you are always in my prayers. I can just tell you that all the things you have fought for and believed in so strongly in the Senate, believe me, we are going to keep on going with them. So take care of yourself and just know that we are with you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the issue before us really is whether or not we are going to change gears on education. The Republican bill changes gears in reverse. It puts us in reverse. The Democratic alternative offered by Senator DASCHLE puts us in a forward gear and moves us ahead into the 21st century. 
   I want to cover basically one issue that is encompassed in the Democratic alternative. If that alternative is not adopted--I assume by the party-line votes that are being held on education this year it probably will not be--I will be offering an amendment, hopefully tomorrow or the day thereafter, on an issue about which the American people are really concerned when it comes to  elementary and secondary education. That is the issue of our crumbling schools and what is going to be done about them. USA Today the other day pointed out that 89 percent of the American people ranked education as the most important issue. That is why this debate is so important and why the elementary and secondary education bill is so important. 
   When you talk to the American people about what their concerns are, they talk about things such as smaller class sizes, better qualified teachers, better paid teachers, better accountability--all the issues we talk about in our alternative. But the one that comes up every single time is the state of our schools, how bad they are and how they are crumbling down around us. 
   Two years ago, in 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers--not a political body--issued a report card on the status of our physical infrastructure in this country: The roads, the bridges, mass transit, aviation, waste water, dams, solid waste, and schools. Schools was the only one to receive an F. It is the worst part of our physical infrastructure in America according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Three out of four, 74 percent, of our schools were built before 1970. Here it is right here; 74 percent were built before 1970. Half our schools were built over 40 years ago. 
   You have to wonder. When the nicest things our kids see as they are growing up are shopping malls, movie theaters, and sports arenas, and the worst things they see are the public schools, you have to wonder what kind of message we are sending to them about the value we really place on their education. 
   We have had, in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, since 1994, title XII. That was put in with bipartisan support, I might add, in 1994, to provide for grants to local school districts to repair, rebuild, and modernize their schools. I have been fighting on this issue for 7 years. Finally we had gotten the attention that this was a national problem--not just a local problem, a national problem. It is national because in some of the poorest school districts where they do not have the tax base to raise the local revenues, that is where you have the real problems. So it is a national issue, not just a local issue. 
   It is one where we can help local school districts without being involved in curriculum or taking over local control. This 
   has nothing to do with that. I will tell you this: If you talk to local property taxpayers in any school district, talk about how burdened they are, and ask them if they want another increase in their property taxes to rebuild and modernize their crumbling schools, they will tell you they cannot do it. That is why it is a national problem and needs a national answer. 
   We had title XII and guess what. When we finally got the bill to our committee, title XII had been struck, just done away with. That is what we were faced with--no more title XII, no more authorization to provide grants to schools, while at the same time President Clinton sends the budget down earlier this year and there is $1.3 billion in the President's budget for grants to our local schools to rebuild and modernize. 
   The President requested $1.3 billion, and the Republican bill we have before us strikes the authorization to allow us to do that. 
   So I will tell you, at about this time President Clinton is in Davenport, IA, to continue his push for legislation to modernize our crumbling schools. But the pending bill cuts that effort off at the knees by repealing title XII. The amendment we have before us, the Daschle amendment, reauthorizes and amends title XII. It authorizes $1.3 billion to make grants and zero-interest loans to enable public schools to make urgent repairs, to fix the leaking roofs, repair the electrical wiring, or fix fire code violations. 
   What I am about to tell you has happened in the State of Iowa I am sure is true in almost every State in this Nation. The Iowa State Fire Marshal reported that fires in Iowa schools have increased fivefold over the past several years. Why is that? Because they are old schools. The wiring is old. They are catching on fire. It is true in every State in the country. 
   Here is something else. I say this to my friend from New York. Most people say this cannot be so, but it is so. Twenty-five percent of the schools in New York City are still heated by coal. One out of every four public schools in New York City is heated by coal. Talk about old fashioned. Talk about the need to modernize and upgrade. 
   In closing, we have a lot of needs for elementary and secondary education, but one need that must be met on a national basis is fixing, repairing, and modernizing our crumbling schools. The Daschle amendment does that. That is why it needs to be supported. 
   If the substitute amendment is not adopted, I will be back with an amendment to amend title XII to provide the $1.3 billion President Clinton asked for in his budget. Our local school districts need this national help. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as we enter the 21st century, the American people have their eyes firmly focused on the future, and they know education is the key to that future. This morning's USA Today newspaper reported that of all the issues the American people care about or they want their Presidential candidate speaking about, education is No. 1. Eighty-nine percent rank it as the most important issue in determining their vote for President. 
   That is why this debate is so important. It has been 6 years since we had the elementary and secondary education bill on the floor and I am delighted that we are finally having this debate. I am hopeful it will be a full and open debate with amendments that address the broader issue of education in this country. 
   Yesterday, there was a lot of discussion about the failure of Federal education programs. We heard a lot of talk yesterday about how the achievement gap has widened and U.S. students are near the bottom of international assessments, teachers are not qualified, too many students can't read, and on and on. We heard all of these horror stories yesterday. 
   I wish to state at the outset, first of all, that, like so many of my colleagues, I have traveled around the world. I have visited education systems in other parts of the globe. I wouldn't trade one education system anywhere in the world for the public education system we have in America. I wouldn't trade this public education system we have in America for anything anywhere else in the world because we invest in public education so that every child, regardless of how rich, or how poor, no matter where that child is born or raised, has a chance to fulfill his or her dreams. It is not so in other countries. 
   You might say the math scores are higher here or there. But, then again, in some other education systems they take the brightest kids through testing and put them in mainstream schools. They may take other kids who maybe don't test as well and put them in technical schools. When it comes to some of these international assessments, some countries are only testing the kids who are the brightest. 
   We don't believe in that kind of a structured education system in America. We don't have one set of kids here, another set of kids here, and another set of kids here. We believe in universal education so that every child has the ability to learn, to grow, and to develop. Yet even kids with disabilities have the ability to learn, to grow, and to develop. We have expanded the concept of public education time and time again to include more under that umbrella. 
   When I was a kid growing up and going to public schools, you would never see a kid in a wheelchair in school, or a kid on a respirator, or someone who had a mental disability in a school, or a kid with Down's syndrome, for example. But today it is commonplace. And I say we are a better country because of it. 
   When my daughter was in public grade school recently there were kids in school with disabilities right in the classroom. I used to visit her in the classroom. I thought it was good for the kids with disabilities, and it is good for the kids without disabilities. It brings people together. You won't find that in very many foreign countries. Why don't talk about that as a source of pride in this country, and what we do for all of our kids in this country? Listening to the speakers yesterday you would think we had the worst education system in the world; that it is just the pits. I beg to differ. 
   We have great teachers, we have great schools, and we have great kids. We have come a long way in this country in making sure that universal education is the right for all. 
   Does that mean we don't have problems? Of course, we have problems to fix. Just as we opened the doors with kids with 
   disabilities and said that you can't keep kids out of school, you can't keep kids out of school because of race, you can't keep kids out of school because of sex. 
   Again, I hear these terrible stories about schools. I wonder where the people are coming from who I heard speak so much yesterday. What do they want? Do they want to privatize all of American education? Do they want to have a system of education as some foreign countries have where the brightest kids at an early age when they are tested get put into special schools, and maybe kids who don't have the intellectual capacity of others are put in technical schools? They just learn a trade, and that is all they do. Is that what people want around here? If so, why don't they have the guts to get up and say so if they want our education system to be like some foreign countries, where their national governments, not local school districts control education. 
   After listening to the debate yesterday, you come to the conclusion that the Federal Government is solely responsible for public education in this country, and it is the Federal Government that is solely responsible for the failure of our schools. 
   Let's set the record straight. Right now, of all of the money that goes to elementary and secondary education in America, only 6 percent comes from the Federal Government. 
   That 6 percent of the money that comes to the Federal Government has ruined all of the kids in America, has ruined our schools. Forget that a lot goes for Title I reading and math programs, forget a lot of the Federal help goes to IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and other programs such as that. For some reason, that small amount, 6 percent, has ruined our schools. That is an odd case to make for those arguing that the Federal Government is to blame for this. 
   Second, education is only 2.3 percent of the Federal budget. Out of every $1 the Federal Government spends, only 2.3 cents goes for education. 
   I make the opposite argument. I think it ought to be more than that. I think on a national level we need more of a national commitment to our public schools. Because our investment in public education is so small--only 6 cents out of every dollar--we have to be careful where it goes. 
   First, we ought to make sure every child is educated in modern public schools connected to the Internet. Schools that have the best technology. 
   Second, we must make sure every child has an up-to-date teacher who is an expert in the subjects he or she is teaching. 
   Third, we must make sure every child has a chance to learn and be heard. You cannot do that in overcrowded classrooms. We need to make our class sizes smaller. 
   Fourth, we have to make sure children have a safe place to go during the hours between the end of the school day and the time their parents come home from work. 
   People talk about safety in schools. We are all concerned about safety in schools. However, we need to keep our focus on where the problem is. Schools are one of the safest places for our children, most of the problems happen after they leave school in the afternoon, in the evening, and on weekends. 
   We all decry the tragedy at Columbine, and tragedies at other schools. Those incidents capture our attention; they cry out for some kind of involvement and some kind of a solution. But keep in mind that only 1 percent of the violence done to kids is in school. We need to make sure we have an after school program to help keep these kids safe and secure. 
   Fifth, we have to continue to expand our help to local school districts to help kids with special needs in special education and for Title I reading and math programs so that students can master the basics. 
   Finally, we must demand accountability for our investments. 
   I think this is a clear, comprehensive, and accountable national education agenda. 
   But the pending legislation before the Senate does not establish this clear agenda. In fact, the bill retreats on our national commitment to education. It does not answer the tough questions. It simply says we are going to throw it back to the States; we will not provide any kind of leadership on the national level. 
   Finally, as has been said before by Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, and others, this is the first time this reauthorization is coming to the floor as a partisan bill. The first time since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in the 1960s that we have not had a bipartisan bill on the floor. It came out of committee on a straight party line vote. 
   This bill gets an A for partisanship, but it gets an F for educational progress. The centerpiece is the Straight A block grant. It sends the dollars back to the States for any educational purpose they see fit. 
   As was stated in the committee, one of our Senators, Mr. GREGG on the other side, admitted this could mean private school voucher programs if the State has such a program. In return for the blank check, the State has to show improvements in student achievement 
    after 5 long years. It is a risky proposal and will not guarantee any improvements in education. 
   We heard a lot of talk yesterday about the burden of filling out all these forms that schools have to fill out to get Federal grants. First we are told the Federal grants are not any good. Then we are told it is too burdensome. Do they want to make it easier or cut it out? We don't know the answer to that. 
   I have a Federal Class-Size Reduction Program application from the Marion Independent School District in Marion, IA. This is for class-size reduction. It is one page, two pages, three pages. Three pages is burdensome? Anyone could fill this thing out in no time flat. To hear some people on the other side talk, one would think it necessary to sit down for a whole week and hire consultants to complete this paperwork. 
   This administration, under the leadership of President Clinton and Vice President GORE, in reinventing government, have simplified and clarified a lot of the processes. To hear some of my colleagues talk about it, you would think we were back 20 or 30 years ago under the Reagan administration, or even before that, when you did have to fill out volumes and volumes of material. 
   Here is the bill, S. 2. We hear the talk on the Republican side about all the mandates, local control, and the reporting requirements. Here is an amendment that takes up a page, section 4304: Disclaimer On Materials Produced, Procured Or Distributed From Funding Authorized By This Act.  
   All materials produced, procured, or distributed, in whole or in part, as a result of Federal funding authorized under this Act shall have printed thereon--

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator pointed out the disparity in teacher salaries and the amount of money spent per student. It raises in my mind this question, again, of why that is. Why is it? I ask the Senator, where is it in the Constitution of the United States that public education in America is to be funded by property taxes? Why is this so? I asked a rhetorical question. Obviously it is not in the Constitution of the United States.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for bringing up these points again. We tend to get into these debates, and we really forget what is at essence here. What is at the essence of our problem is the big disparity, as Jonathan Kozol has pointed out time and time again, between those who happen to be born and live in a wealthy area and those who are born and live in a poor area.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to depart from the debate on the issue before us, which is an important issue. I appreciate the remarks made by my colleague from North Dakota. I listened intently to what he had to say, and I can understand his deep feelings about this issue. 
   I want to talk about another issue because today, across the street from where we sit in the Halls of the Senate, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on a case involving the so-called partial-birth abortion law of the State of Nebraska. That law, passed by the Nebraska Legislature, is quite similar to the version the Senate and the House have debated over the years. In fact, it is very similar to the one passed by the Senate last October.  
   However, the real issue in the case before the Supreme Court and in the legislation before Congress is not about banning late term abortions. The real issue is about a systematic effort to overturn Roe V. Wade and to criminalize all abortions. The real issue is about whether we trust women, in consultation with their faith and their family, to make this very difficult, personal decision or do we put that trust in politicians? That is what this is really all about. 
   Last October 21, during debate on the so-called partial-birth abortion bill in the Senate, I, along with Senator BOXER, offered a resolution to this so-called partial-birth abortion bill. Our resolution was very simple. It stated that it was the sense of the Senate that Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and should not be repealed. 
   Let me read for the record the entire text of that resolution because it was very simple and very straightforward.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California for her long and strong support for the decision in Roe v. Wade. The Senator from California has been one of the most persistent and enlightened voices in the Senate--indeed, in the country--on protecting a woman's basic right to choose. I follow in her footsteps in many of these issues. 
   The Senator from California has really put her finger on it, the point I was trying to make today. This partial-birth abortion law that the Supreme Court is reviewing today, as well as the legislation before Congress--is just a smokescreen. Its a smokescreen which anti-choice Members and groups are hiding behind in order to get their eventual goal, which is the total repeal and overturn of Roe v. Wade, to take away the essential and basic fundamental rights about which the Senator just spoke. 
   Without Roe v. Wade and without that constitutionally protected right of women to have control over their own reproductive health, many of the things about which the Senator just spoke would be gone. There wouldn't be any right for women in the military, there wouldn't be any right for women in the District of Columbia or anywhere else, to have the kind of health coverage that would protect them in dire need when they need help, when perhaps a pregnancy has gone terribly wrong and they need immediate and very intensive medical help. 
   That was why I wanted to talk about it today. I don't want to interfere in the Supreme Court decision. That is for them to decide over there. What I wanted to point out was that in conjunction with that, here in the Halls of Congress there is a very dangerous game being played out where proponents of so-called partial-birth abortion really have want to overturn the basic right to choose for women. That is why the two of us joined together last fall to offer that amendment. 
   I say this because the Senator and I worked together on this amendment. We offered the amendment in good faith, thinking we were going to get an overwhelming vote of the Senate saying, yes, we support Roe v. Wade. I think both of us were shocked at how close we came.

   Mr. HARKIN. Again, I appreciate the Senator's very lucid and clear delineation of exactly what is going on here. It was a gag rule in the House. That is what they did. Under their rules, the Republican leadership would not allow a vote on our amendment. Again, I think it is because they don't want their veil of moderation lifted. They want to say this is only about partial birth. It is not, and we know it. It is about Roe v. Wade. Yet they don't want to have their people out there voting on it. 
   I think the American people have a right to know where we stand on this most fundamental right of women in this country. 
   Again, I thank my friend from California for her long and strong leadership on this issue. It is vitally important to all of us in this country that the basic, fundamental, constitutional rights that were enumerated in Roe v. Wade for the women of this country remain, and remain strong, and not be undermined in this body. So I thank the Senator for her strong leadership in this effort.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 7 years ago we ended a failed economic policy of trickle down economics. It brought ballooning deficits, a quadrupling of the national debt, high interest rates, and low growth. But we made some tough decisions and tough votes. We changed the course of the new economic policies that invested in people and imposed needed fiscal discipline. 
   The results are in: 21 million new jobs, 4 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 30 years, the fastest growth rate in 30 years, and the lowest crime and welfare rate in 30 years. There is the highest home ownership ever, 108 months of straight economic growth, productivity-breaking records, and inflation outside of energy is tame. Why do we want to change this? Why return to the days of risky tax schemes, the days of trickle down economics, and fiscal irresponsibility? 
   That is exactly what the conference report budget before the Senate does. This budget resolution before the Senate provides $175 billion to tax cuts, skewed to the wealthiest of Americans. The Congressional Budget Office, however, projects $171 billion in non-Social Security surpluses over the next 5 years. Add the higher interest we have to pay on the public debt because we did tax cuts instead of paying down the debt, and what does that add up to? This budget conference report before the Senate means we will have to tap into the Social Security surplus in order to pay for these tax cuts. 
   It is fiscally irresponsible. We ought to take a different course and follow the adage that when times are good, prepare for the future. That means the budget should put the highest priority on paying off the debt, securing Social Security and Medicare for the future. 
   I have said time and time again on this floor, if you want to save Medicare and cut down on Medicare expenses today, invest in medical research. To that end, 3 years ago, the Senate, in a unanimous vote, went on record as saying we ought to double NIH basic medical research in 5 years. Last year, we had a historic increase of $2.3 billion to keep on the track of doubling NIH research in 5 years. This next year would require $2.7 billion. Keep in mind the Senate voted unanimously to double NIH funding. 
   When the budget came out of committee, it was short by $1.6 billion for NIH research. Senator SPECTER, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on health and human services that funds NIH, offered an amendment that I supported to add back the $1.6 billion to medical research. Nine Republicans joined the Democrats, and it passed 54-46. 
   As anyone who has even opened the newspapers lately knows, we are on the verge of many breakthroughs in biomedical research, stem cell research, and the human genome, which is being mapped and will be done shortly. Now we need to push ahead to invest in medical research, to find the causes, the cures, and the preventions for many of the illnesses that cost Medicare so much today. Yet this conference report ignores the bipartisan vote in the Senate. It completely obliterates the $1.6 billion that was added by the Specter amendment. It has been wiped out. 
   Let's bring it to concrete terms. What does it mean? The conference report that took out that $1.6 billion, when spread over the different research being done by NIH, means, for example, that in AIDS research, $179 million less than what we 
   had in the Senate; cancer research is $261 million less than what we had in the Senate; prostate cancer is down $21 million; arthritis is down $24 million; Alzheimer's is $41.8 million less than what we had in the Senate. 
   If the conference report had kept in what we had voted for in the Senate, we would have an additional $261 million for cancer research; we would have an additional $179 million for AIDS research; we would have an additional $111 million for mental health research; we would have an additional $14 million for Parkinson's; we would have an additional $13 million for osteoporosis; we would have an additional $1.9 million for multiple sclerosis; we would have another $24 million for kidney disease; we would have another $38 million to study infant mortality; we would have another $47 million for diabetes research if this budget report has the $1.6 billion added by the Senate. 
   I thought the budget we passed was inadequate before; it is woefully inadequate now. For the life of me, I don't understand why the $1.6 billion was taken out of this critically needed part of meeting our obligations of the future for NIH basic research. 
   There is another point. The Senate resolution had increased Pell grants by $400, bringing them up to $3,700. We have needed to do that over the last 20 years. The purchasing power of Pell grants went down 25 percent. A poor student in college today can spend 25 percent less with the maximum Pell grant than 20 years ago. The education was also dropped in conference. That is deeply, deeply disappointing. 
   This budget needs to be sent back to the drawing board. It targets fiscally irresponsible tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans. It shortchanges the critical investments we need: First, in medical research; and, second, in investment in education to keep our economy and our people healthy and strong. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan effort to provide more funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. As I've said time and again, disability is not a partisan issue. We all share an interest in ensuring that children with disabilities and their families get a fair shake in life. And the 25th anniversary of IDEA is the perfect year to improve the capacity of school districts to meet their responsibilities to children with disabilities. 
   Currently, the State grant program within IDEA receives $5 billion. Estimates by the Congressional Research Service suggest that the program needs to be funded at $15.8 billion each year to meet the targets established in 1975. Our amendment would increase funding for IDEA annually in roughly $2 billion increments over the next five years and would put us on track to meet our goal of 40 percent funding. 
   I know many of you have heard this speech before. Every year I stand on the Senate floor at least once or twice and give a short history lesson around IDEA. Well, this year is no different. 
   In the early seventies, two landmark federal district court cases--PARC versus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Mills versus Board of Education of the District Court of Columbia--established that children with disabilities have a constitutional right to a free appropriate public education. In 1975, in response to these cases, Congress enacted the Education of Handicapped Children Act, the precursor to IDEA--to help states meet their constitutional obligations. 
   Congress enacted PL 94-142 for two reasons. First, to establish a consistent policy of what constitutes compliance with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment with respect to the education of kids with disabilities. And, second, to help States meet their constitutional obligations through federal funding. The Supreme Court reiterated this in Smith versus Robinson: ``[EHA] is a comprehensive scheme set up by Congress to aid the states in complying with their constitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped children.'' 
   I strongly agree with the policy of this amendment and the infusion of more money into IDEA. A Senator JEFFORDS has explained, this is a win-win for everyone. Students with disabilities will be more likely to get the public education they have a right to because school districts will have the capacity to provide such an education--without cutting into their general education budgets. 
   However, as much as I agree with the policy of our amendment, I disagree with some of the rhetoric around this issue. 
   As I see it, a mythology has been created around the 40 percent figure. Some people describe it as a ``promise'' or ``pledge'' on the part of the federal government to fund IDEA at 40 percent. Well, the 40 percent figure is simply a funding formula, just like the funding formulas found in lots and lots of other statutes. 
   In 1975, the EHA authorized the maximum award per state as being the number of children served times 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure--known as the APPE. The formula does not guarantee 40 percent of national APPE per disabled child served; rather, it caps IDEA allotments at 40% of national APPE. In other words, the 40 percent figure was a goal, not a commitment. 
   As the then ranking minority member on the House Ed and Labor Committee, Representative Albert Quie, explained: ``I do not know in the subsequent years whether we will appropriate at those [authorized] levels or not. I think what we are doing here is laying out the goal. Ignoring other Federal priorities, we thought it acceptable if funding reaches that level.'' 
   The important point in the Congressman's statement is that we cannot fund IDEA grant programs at the cost of other important federal programs. That is why historically the highest appropriation for special education funding was in FY 1979, when allocations represented 12.5 percent APPE. During the Reagan years, the appropriation went back down. 
   But, over the last five years, as ranking member on the Labor-H Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues across the aisle to more than double the IDEA appropriation so that we're back up to over 12.5 percent. 
   And, today, we are in an even better position to do the right thing. We are presented with a non-Social Security budget surplus. Our economy is in great shape. We have the opportunity to pay off the public debt. We will continue to protect the Social Security trust fund. And--even better--we can use money from the non-Social Security surplus to ensure that seniors get prescription drugs, school kids benefit from smaller class size, and students with disabilities get the services they have a right to. 
   All of these proposals make more sense than providing wealthy Americans with tax cuts that will eat up the non-Social Security surplus. 
   Last year's Supreme Court decision regarding Garret Frey of Cedar Rapids, Iowa underscores the need for Congress to help school districts with the financial costs of educating children with disabilities. While the excess costs of educating some children with disabilities is minimal, the excess costs of educating other children with disabilities, like Garret, is great. 
   Under our amendment, my home state of Iowa would receive a total increase of over $346 million over the next five years. 
   Of course, lots of places are already doing a great job of educating all of our kids. I just found out about a school district in Iowa--a district that includes my hometown of Cumming--that's delivering on IDEA's promise of full inclusion ..... on budget! According to the superintendent, IDEA works for everyone. For example, a girl with cerebral palsy takes home economics and French in the regular classroom. Just imagine varsity football players working on home-ec projects with a girl in a wheelchair. Each student learns about their value as individuals and their value as members of a team and community. 
   These new dollars would go a long way toward making a real difference for both children with disabilities and their families. I've heard from parents in Iowa that their kids need more qualified interpreters for deaf and hard of hearing children and they need better mental health services and better behavioral assessments. And the additional funds will help local and area education agencies build capacity in these areas. 
   We must redouble our efforts to help school districts meet their constitutional obligations. We need to increase dollars to every program under IDEA, not just the state grant programs. 
   And, of course, by receiving federal dollars, states take on certain responsibilities. IDEA dollars are intended to provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity to public education. States must use this money in a way that builds their capacity to deliver necessary educational and related services to students with disabilities and meet their obligations under the law. 
   As I understand it, one of the National Governors' Association's top priorities is to get more funding for special education. And that's just what our amendment does. The Education Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities strongly supports this amendment, along with the National Association of Directors of Special Education, the National School Boards Association, and American Association of School Administrators. 
   As I said at the beginning, we can all agree that states should receive more money under IDEA. And, today, we have the incredible opportunity to fund IDEA--at no real cost to other national programs. I thank Senator JEFFORDS and Senator DODD for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to join us in support of the amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank our minority whip for yielding me this time. I do speak strongly in favor of the underlying Robb amendment of which I am a cosponsor. 
   Senator ROBB has it right when he tries to invest in rebuilding and modernizing our public schools. States and local communities are struggling right now to renovate existing schools. School construction and modernization is necessary for our kids in the 21st century. 
   The average school in America right now, as Senator ROBB said, is 42 years old. Technology is placing new demands on our schools. As a result of increased use of technology, many schools must install new wiring, telephone lines, and electrical assistance. The demand for the Internet is at an all-time high, but in the Nation's poorest schools only 39 percent of classrooms have Internet access. 
   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report on our Nation's infrastructure. The report found many problems with a lot of our infrastructure, but the most startling finding was with respect to our Nation's public schools.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, because of increasing enrollments and aging buildings, local and State expenditures for school construction have increased dramatically by 39 percent in the last several years. However, this increase has not been enough to address the needs. 
   The National Education Association recently surveyed States about their need to modernize public schools and upgrade education technologies. According to their preliminary report, $254 billion is needed to modernize school facilities; $54 billion is needed to upgrade education technology. In my State of Iowa, for example, $3.4 billion is needed for school facilities and $540 million for education technology. 
   It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our children see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and some of the most rundown places they see are their public schools. What kind of a signal does that send about the value we place on them, their education, and their future? How can we prepare our kids for the 21st century in schools that did not even make the grade in the 20th century? 
   This amendment by Senator ROBB provides a comprehensive two-pronged response: $1.3 billion each year to make grants and no-interest loans for emergency repairs to schools. 
   The second part of this strategy is to underwrite the cost of building nearly $25 billion of new school facilities. This amendment provides the tax credits to subsidize the interest on new construction projects to modernize public schools. 
   Last year, six Iowa school districts received grants to underwrite the cost of building new school facilities. Over and over, school officials said the availability of the Federal grant was responsible for convincing local citizens to support a school bond issue to finance the bulk of the project. Modern, up-to-date school buildings are essential for student achievement. 
   Studies show students in overcrowded schools, or schools in poor fiscal condition, scored significantly lower on math and reading than their peers in less crowded conditions. 
   This is a very serious national problem. In Iowa alone during the 1990s, there were 100 fires in Iowa public schools. During the previous decade,  there were only 20. The wiring is getting old, schools are catching on fire, water pipes are bursting, and they do not have the new technology our students need. 
   If there is one thing that cries out for our intervention on a national level, it is this issue: to upgrade and modernize our schools and to build new schools where needed. All one has to do is read Jonathan Kozol's book ``Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools'' to understand in this system of ours in America where schools are financed by local bond issues, that if you have an area with high-income residents, high property values, you get pretty darn good schools. But go to areas where there are low-income people and low property values; that is where we find the poor schools. 
   Yet a child educated in one of those poor schools does not stay in that local school district. That child moves to Iowa, California, Virginia, Georgia, or anywhere else and becomes a burden on all of society. That is why this cries out for a national solution. 
   To hear my friends on the other side, they say leave it up to the local school districts and let them handle it. Sure, if you live in a rich school district, you are fine. 
   But if you live in a poor area of America--rural or urban--you do not have the wherewithal to build those new schools and to get the wiring and the upgrading that you need. 
   That is why it is a national problem. It requires a national solution. That is why I hope the Coverdell amendment will be defeated and that we could get to the underlying Robb amendment and let the kids of this country and their parents and their families know that this national effort is going to go forward to rebuild our schools. 
   I compliment the Senator from Virginia for his amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by Senators CHAFEE and GRAHAM to introduce the ``KIDS Deserve Freedom from Tobacco Act of 2000.'' 
   Just over 2 years ago, on March 31, 1998, Senators HARKIN, CHAFEE and GRAHAM teamed up to introduce the first comprehensive bipartisan legislation to reduce teen smoking. Today, I am pleased to announce that Senators HARKIN, CHAFEE and GRAHAM are teaming up again with the same goal. This bill is the first bipartisan Senate effort to restore the Food and Drug Administration's authority to protect our kids from tobacco. 
   We feel it is absolutely critical to show bipartisan support for picking up the ball the Supreme Court dropped in our lap just two weeks ago. We hope that our announcement today will be the beginning of a bipartisan push to get this type of common sense legislation passed. 
   The need is clear. As the Supreme Court recognized, tobacco use among children and adolescents is probably the single most significant threat to public health in the United States. A new study released just yesterday shows how the tobacco industry continues to successfully target our children. Seventy-three percent of teens reported seeing tobacco advertising in the previous two weeks, compared to only 33% of adults. And 77% of teens say it is easy for kids to buy cigarettes. 
   That is why 3,000 kids start smoking every day and fully 1,000 of them will die prematurely because of it. That's the equivalent of 3 jumbo jets packed with kids crashing every day. And that is why cigarette smoking among high school seniors is at a 19-year high. There is no question we face a public health crisis of unmatched proportions and we have the opportunity this year to stop it. 
   Passing comprehensive legislation that would dramatically reduce the number of American children hooked on this deadly habit is a once and a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, though, the tobacco debate in Washington has so far been largely partisan. That's why we've joined arms across party lines behind the KIDS Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act, the KIDS Act. We hope and believe that the introduction of our bipartisan bill will change the debate and significantly increase the odds that reforms will be made this year. 
   Let me be clear. Nicotine is an addictive product and cigarettes kill. Even the tobacco companies are starting to admit it. In fact, Big Tobacco has known this for so long, they deliberately manipulate the nicotine in cigarettes to get more people addicted. 
   The FDA regulations, struck down by the Supreme Court two weeks ago, were about stopping kids from smoking. These regulations were an investment in the future of our kids. 
   Our legislation will re-affirm the FDA's authority over tobacco products. It will classify nicotine as a drug and tobacco products as drug delivery devices. It will allow FDA to implement a ``public health'' standard in its review and regulation of tobacco products. By codifying FDA's regulation of 1996, our legislation will also allow for continuation of the critically important youth ID checks. It will provide needed youth access restrictions such as requiring tobacco products to be kept behind store counters and ban vending machines. It will also include sensible advertising limits as well as other important provisions of the original FDA rule designed to reduce teen access to tobacco. 
   For the sake of our kids and the public health, we have a responsibility to act quickly on this. Today, we begin that important effort. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to examine our legislation and give us their comments. We should not leave this year without taking this type of common sense step to protect our kids.

   We have the lowest unemployment rate in decades, the number of families on welfare has declined and new jobs continue to be created at a record pace. 
   However, we know that despite the longest economic boom in history, some Americans have been left behind. As we look to the future, one of our challenges will be to make sure the rising tide lifts all boats. In addition, we also face the challenge of keeping the prosperity going. 
   The pending budget resolution jeopardizes our prosperity. It jeopardizes the economy, threatens the Social Security surplus, and shortchanges Medicare. The resolution does not provide an adequate prescription drug benefit, provide sufficient debt reduction or invest in education. 
   The budget resolution undermines the public's priorities and will impose deep cuts in domestic programs. Fewer children will be served by Head Start, there will be fewer new teachers to reduce class size and no additional officers for community policing. 
   Instead, the budget proposes a risky tax scheme that jeopardizes our nation's future prosperity and productivity. 
   The GOP's budget plan squanders the entire non-Social Security surplus on a reckless tax cut and provides no funding for national priorities such as school modernization. It rejects the President's proposal to provide $25 billion in bonds to underwrite construction of 6,000 new schools. It also rejects $1.3 billion in grants and loans for emergency repairs to public schools. 
   This budget sets the wrong national priorities. It chooses tax cuts for the wealthy over modernizing our children's schools. The Robb-Harkin amendment corrects this serious shortcoming by providing a comprehensive national strategy to repair, renovate and modernize our public schools. 
   States and local communities are struggling to renovate existing schools and build new ones to alleviate overcrowding. School construction and modernization are necessary to equip classrooms for the 21st Century, improve learning conditions, end overcrowding, and make smaller classes possible. 
   Our school buildings are simply wearing out. Nearly three-quarters of all U.S. public schools were built before 1970. 
   According to the National Center for Education Statistics, when a school is between 20 and 30 years, frequent replacement of equipment is necessary. 
   When a school is between 30 and 40 years old all of the original equipment should have been replaced, including the roof and electrical systems. 
   After 40 years of age, a school building begins to deteriorate rapidly and most schools are abandoned after 60 years. 
   The average school building is 42 years old and technology is placing new demands on schools. As a result of increased use of technology, many schools must install new wiring, telephone lines and electrical systems. The demand for the Internet is at an all-time high, but in the nation's poorest schools, only 39% of classrooms have Internet access. 
   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report card on our nation's infrastructure. The report found many problems. However, the most startling finding is with respect to our nation's public schools. 
   ASCE reports that public schools are in worse condition than any other sector of our national infrastructure. This is an alarming fact and should be our call to action. 
   The need to modernize our nation's public schools is clear, yet the Federal Government lags in helping local school districts address this critical problem. 
   Because of increasing enrollments and aging buildings, local and State expenditures for school construction have increased dramatically--by 39% from 1990 to 1997. However, this increase has not been sufficient to address the need. 
   The National Education Association recently surveyed states about the need to modernize public schools and upgrade education technology. According to their preliminary report, $253.9 billion is needed to modernize the school facilities and $53.7 billion is needed to upgrade education technology. For Iowa--$3.4 billion for school facilities and $540 million for education technology. 
   It is a national disgrace that the nicest places that our children see are shopping malls, sports arenas and movie theaters and the most run down place they see is their public schools. What signal are we sending them about the value we place on them, their education and future? 
   How can we prepare our kids for the 21st century in schools that did not make the grade in the 20th century? 
   This amendment provides a comprehensive, two-prong response to this critical national problem. 
   First, we would provide $1.3 billion each year to make grants and no interest loans for emergency repairs to public schools. The Public School Repair and Renovation Program would help local school districts fix the roof that is leaking, repair fire code violations and put in new electrical wiring. 
   Mr. President, 25% of schools in New York City are still heated by coal and 46% of U.S. schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. Sixteen million children attend schools without proper heating, ventilation or air conditioning. Twelve million students attend classes in schools with defective plumbing. These grants and loans would make it possible to install the modern heating systems, plumbing, and new electrical wiring that are desperately needed in schools across America. 
   In addition, these grants and loans could be used to remedy violations of state or local fire codes. The Iowa Fire Marshal reported a five-fold increase in the number of fires in schools over the past decade. During the 1990's there were 100 fires in Iowa schools. During the previous decade there were 20. 
   It is clear that public schools have an urgent need to make repairs now and these grants and no-interest loans will finance up to 8,300 repair projects in 5,000 schools. We will install modern heating systems, upgrade the electrical wiring, and repair the fire code violations. 
   These grants and loans will address problems that literally endanger the lives and safety of our children.  
   However, some buildings have simply outlived their usefulness and need to be replaced. In addition, enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at an all time high of 53.2 million and will continue to grow over the next 10 years. Therefore, it will be necessary for the United States to build an additional 6,000 schools to educate the growing number of students. 
   The second part of our comprehensive strategy is to underwrite the cost of building nearly $25 billion of new school facilities. Our amendment provides tax credits to subsidize the interest on new construction projects to modernize public schools. School districts would be able to replaced outdated buildings or add more class rooms so they can reduce class size. The school modernization bonds would finance modernization projects for 6,000 schools. 
   Our amendment provides a modest national investment to modernize our nation's schools and will make a big difference for millions of children. Further, the amendment is fully offset by reducing the ill-conceived tax scheme in the Budget Resolution. 
   I know this kind of approach will work because it is working in Iowa. Iowa is in the second year of a school modernization and repair demonstration project. 
   Like the Robb-Harkin Amendment, the Iowa demonstration also takes a two-prong approach toward solving this critical problem. First, the Iowa project provides grants for the repair of fire code violations. Secondly, the Iowa project provides grants to subsidize the cost of constructing new school facilities. 
   In a relatively short period of time, we have already begun to see a difference in Iowa. Over the past two years, 138 grants have been awarded for projects to repair fire code violations. The federal government provided $6.5 million to install fire alarms, upgrade electrical systems and other repairs to make Iowa schools safer. 
   Last year, six Iowa school districts received grants to underwrite the cost of building new school facilities. Over and over, school officials said the availability of the federal grant was responsible for convincing local citizens to support the school bond issue that finance the bulk of the project. 
   Several school districts passed school bond issues after several tries. One superintendent said, ``In the past, our school district ran three bond issues unsuccessfully and it is a credit to the Department of Education ..... for providing this Iowa Demonstration Grant funding as an incentive to help voters pass bond issues.'' 
   Another Superintendent said, ``It is our opinion that both of these grants played a very important role regarding the successful passing of the bond issue.'' 
   The most recent competition was just closed and applications for the second year of funding are being reviewed. 
   The Iowa School Construction Grant is beginning to show the kind of major impact a modest federal investment can have on improving the safety of schools and spurring construction of new school facilities. The school modernization provisions mirror the Iowa Demonstration and will spur the same kind of activity across the nation that we are witnessing in Iowa. 
   The Iowa School Construction Grant is beginning to show the kind of major impact a modest federal investment can have on improving the safety of schools and spurring construction of new school facilities. Our amendment mirrors the Iowa Demonstration and will spur the same kind of activity across the nation that we are witnessing in Iowa. 
   Modern, up-to-date school buildings are essential for student achievement. Studies show that students in overcrowded schools or schools in poor physical condition scored significantly lower on both math and reading than their peers in less crowded conditions. 
   The General Accounting Office reports that 14 million American children attend classes in schools that are unsafe or inadequate. This is a serious national problem. And, it demands a comprehensive national response. The Robb-Harkin Amendment provides that effective national response. I commend Senator ROBB for his leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our economy is in great shape: 108 months of economic growth; unemployment has been near 4 percent for some time; economic growth is doing very well; productivity is breaking all recent records; incomes of average Americans are finally growing again, and inflation, outside of gasoline, is low. I think we ought to take advantage of our situation by paying off the publicly held debt while times are good. 
   The President proposes that we should plan on doing that by 2013, just the point when large numbers of the post-World War II baby boomers are reaching 65. That way we shore up the capacity to be able to repay the bonds that have been going to the Social Security trust fund. 
   I also believe we should use the surplus to put the Medicare trust fund on a sound footing for the long term. We should also be providing for a prescription drug benefit. It is wrong that many modest-income seniors do not have the ability to buy the drugs they need for their health care. 
   I would also like to see the expenditures made to cover the costs of our veterans' health, increased medical research, increased funds for education, and for day care. These are some key priorities. 
   Clearly, however, the No. 1 priority presented by the majority in the budget resolution before us is to cut taxes for the wealthy. When you add the interest costs from failing to reduce the debt, the $150 billion cut in taxes that is in the budget resolution before us uses up 98 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. That assumes cutting some nondefense discretionary spending. If you take the $150 billion tax cut 
   that is in the budget, and if you don't cut spending on the discretionary side, that tax cut actually eats up over 100 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. So in order to get the $150 billion cut in taxes, the Republican majority on the Budget Committee actually had to cut spending in a number of areas. Even with that cut, that $150 billion tax cut uses up 98 percent of that surplus. There is virtually nothing left over for improving the health of the Social Security trust fund or the Medicare trust fund. There is very little chance to provide for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to provide increases for education, medical research, veterans' health, money to fight crime, and other priorities without eroding the Social Security surplus. 
   Personally, I would like to see us give some tax relief to younger families with modest incomes trying to raise their children, to families with considerable child care expenses, to families who have expenses caring for aging parents. I would like to reduce the penalty of higher taxes when two people marry and both work. 
   The Democratic budget we have offered provides for many of those targeted tax cuts while still meeting the other needs such as for health care and fighting crime and medical research. 
   I would like to pay for tax cuts by eliminating some of the outrageous loopholes in the Tax Code that allow huge multinational corporations to escape paying their fair share of taxes. I would like to see some loopholes closed that allow some of the wealthy to escape paying their fair share. That, unfortunately, does not appear to be the will of the Republican majority on the Budget Committee. It certainly was not their will when they passed out the budget resolution on a straight party-line vote. 
   So I will be offering an amendment that says if we are going to enact--if we are, and if it is the will of the majority party to enact the $150 billion in tax cuts mandated by the budget; and that was the same sum agreed to in the House by, I might add, a narrow 4 vote margin--I want to have the Senate go on record that whatever tax cuts are passed follow a very simple rule: that those at the highest level of income--the top 1 percent--not receive more than 1 percent of the tax cuts. I will be offering an amendment that essentially says it is the sense of the Senate that if we do have a tax cut, no more than 1 percent of the tax cut benefits can go to the top 1 percent income earners. 
   Doesn't that sound fair? If you are in the top 1 percent, maybe you ought to get 1 percent of the cuts. Who is at that level of income? Well, those who are making what is now estimated to be more than $317,000 per year. This group, on average, makes $915,000 a year. So the average income of the top 1 percent income earners in America is $915,000 a year. I believe it is clear that people at this income level do not need a large tax cut, while many working families are in far greater need. 
   So I hope the Senate will go on record saying that we have a limit on any tax cut, that those at the very top are receiving no more than 1 percent of the benefits, and let's give the middle class their fair share of the tax break. 
   I have a chart that I think provides some illustration. First, we have the George Bush tax cut proposal. Let's look at how the benefits of that proposal work. It is a very large cut. But under this Bush plan, as estimated by Citizens For Tax Justice, the bottom 20 percent of the taxpayers get 0.6 percent of the tax cuts, less than 1 percent. The next 20 percent get about 3 percent of the tax cuts. The next 20 percent get about 7.4 percent of the tax cuts. The fourth one--those who make, on average, about $50,000 a year--gets 15.4 percent of the tax benefits. But here is where we really have to look, out here on this end. Those in the top 1 percent, making over $319,000 a year--and they average about $915,000 a year--these folks in ``need'' get about 37 percent of the benefits. They get a higher percentage than anybody else and, in dollar amounts, they get about $50,000 a year in tax breaks. 
   So, again, this is what we are facing. Why do people in the upper 1 percent need this kind of a tax break? I don't hear it from them. I must admit, I know some people in that bracket. I have some good friends who make that kind of money. They are good Americans and they invest a lot of money. A lot of them work very hard, and they employ people. I have yet to have one of them tell me they need this tax cut. In fact, I have had a number of them say: What are you doing? Pay off the public debt; don't give us a tax break. Pay off the public debt. That would do more for ensuring the economic health of this country than giving the top 1 percent that kind of a tax break. 
   Well, that is why I want to offer this amendment. It is very simple. It provides that the top 1 percent of taxpayers should not get any more than 1 percent of the tax cuts--net. After all, the bottom 20 percent gets less than 1 percent of the tax cuts. Why should the top 1 percent get 37 percent? 
   So my amendment says if you are in that top 1 percent, you should not get more than 1 percent of the tax breaks. So if you are for tax fairness, if you want to give the middle-class Americans their fair share of tax relief, then I ask for your support of this commonsense amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud the U.S. is the world leader in the advancement of technology, providing businesses and consumers faster and better ways to work and to communicate. But even though we have made great progress in technology, much of rural and small town America has been left behind. In the small town of Cumming, IA, where I was born and still have a house I live in when I am not here, we do not have access. We do not even have cable yet. So a lot of people are putting up satellite dishes as the only way of getting adequate information through television. 
   I joined a Senate rural telecommunications task force last year to address these issues and to work, as a group, to pass legislation to help rural communities catch up. Just as cable and telephone companies say it does not make good business sense to provide service to a few customers in Cumming, IA, for example, we know that without this access rural America will suffer and will be left behind in the new digital age. You talk about a digital divide. There is a digital divide and rural America is on the short end of that divide. 
   We are not just talking about high-speed Internet access or reliable telephone lines. We are talking about the lack of access to basic local TV programming--local weather, local news, local school information for rural residents and farm families. You would think it is easy; if you live on a farm or in a small town in rural Iowa, you just put an antenna on your house and get the local weather and news from a local TV station. Once again, it is not that easy for rural and small town residents. An antenna just doesn't reach that far. Weather conditions interrupt, for example. Cable will not extend lines outside of metropolitan areas because of the high cost. As I said, in my hometown, we do not have cable yet. We live fairly close to a metropolitan area. 
   The satellite dish came along and provided relief and access and they sprouted up like mushrooms all over rural Iowa and rural America. But the satellite also has its problems. It does not include what is called ``local-into-local'' programming, into small and rural TV markets. The satellite dish companies say they do not have the capacity in their existing satellites. That is what they say. 
   I happen to have a satellite dish on my house in Virginia, 12 miles from here. I can turn that thing on any time and get hundreds of channels--many of which are, I think, kind of ridiculous, but they are there. So they can provide hundreds of channels to customers in metropolitan areas, but they cannot transmit local TV to the 60 million customers who live outside the big TV markets, they say, without launching more multimillion-dollar satellites. 
   Last year, we fought hard to keep in the satellite bill a rural loan guarantee program, one that would make it easier for companies or nonprofit cooperatives to provide local TV to rural customers. Unfortunately, it was taken out at the last minute before the bill was passed and signed into law. Senator GRAMM, the Chairman of the Banking Committee, has drafted a rural loan guarantee bill, similar to the one I cosponsored last year, that will go a long way to ensuring that rural residents receive the benefit of local television. 
   However, I am concerned about the provision in the bill that requires all potential lenders in the Loan Guarantee Program to be Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured. That  language would exclude several qualified lenders who have previously provided financing under the Rural Electrification Act. These institutions include the Cooperative Finance Corporation, the CFC, and other lenders that have the financial strength, the expertise, and the ability to participate in this program for rural citizens. These institutions have had years of experience. They have had a strong record in lending to rural and electric cooperatives. 
   I urge my colleagues to approve the Johnson-Thomas bipartisan amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, to allow qualified lenders with experience, expertise, and a strong reputation in these types of programs, to participate in the funding subject to approval. The cooperatives use lenders such as CFC because it means lower interest rates, resulting in a more affordable and workable project. 
   Again, I don't want to say I am favoring cooperatives or any one over another providing local TV in rural areas. I favor any institution and any technology that would be willing to provide local service to most customers in unserved areas; however, without the Johnson-Thomas amendment, we are effectively, legislatively shutting out a potential participant interested in extending local TV to rural America. They might win, they might not, but why should we shut them out of this process. 
   I would also like to mention Senator DORGAN's Rural Broadband Enhancement Act, introduced yesterday--again of which I am a cosponsor. This important legislation would help ensure that rural and small town America are not left behind by the revolution taking place in the technology industry that I mentioned earlier. The Dorgan bill would authorize $3 billion for a revolving loan fund over 5 years to provide capital for low-interest loans to finance construction of the needed broadband infrastructure. I am an original cosponsor of this bill because we cannot sit around waiting for this important technology to come to rural and small town America on its own. We know from past experience that we need to help make it happen. I believe the Dorgan bill will provide the incentives for companies to expand beyond their urban markets. 
   The Rural Broadband Enhancement Act and the Rural Loan Guarantee--LOCAL TV bill that is being considered on the floor today, are sorely needed in rural America. They both are akin to what happened in the 1930s with the Rural Electrification Act when we started to electrify rural America. I at one time did some research on that. I read the Senate debates when the Senate was debating whether or not to pass the Rural Electrification Act to provide the long-term, low-interest loans through cooperatives to build rural electric lines to families such as mine in rural Iowa. 
   At that time there was more than one Senator who got up and said this is a free market. If private companies do not want to go out there and build these electric lines to rural America, that is the marketplace. If people living in rural America don't like it there because they don't have electricity, they can move to the cities. 
   Fortunately, those voices were in the minority. The majority recognized that because of the sparse population in rural America, it was going to cost a little more for the initial installing of those rural electrification lines. What happened after that, of course, was because of the electrification of rural America we saw new schools go up. We saw new factories and plants go up to buttress the farm economy in our rural areas. We saw colleges being built. 
   So all of rural America expanded and became financially more sound because of the investment we made up front in rural electrification. We face that same kind of frontier right now both in broadband access and also in access to local television broadcasting. 
   That is why I feel so strongly that these are synergistic. The Dorgan bill introduced yesterday for broadband access and the Johnson-Thomas amendment which is before the body will provide the same kind of long-term, low-interest loans that could be made available through cooperatives and through other institutions to provide for a better possibility that we will get direct, local-to-local satellite broadcasting in rural America. 
   I hope the Senate will review this history. I hope the majority of this body will support the Johnson-Thomas bipartisan amendment so that rural America can have the same kind of satellite dish reception that we get in rural Virginia 12 miles from here. We can get on our satellite dish in our home ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, all local from Washington, DC. It costs about four or five bucks a month. I believe people all over rural Iowa and rural Kansas would be willing to pay four or five bucks a month to get that kind of local television service from their local stations' satellite so they can know when tornadoes are approaching, bad weather, when schools are closed, and other local information they need which they otherwise do not get. 
   I urge adoption of the Johnson-Thomas amendment. I yield the floor.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to express my congratulations to and praise for the outstanding performance of both the men's and women's basketball teams at Iowa State University and the women's basketball team at Drake University this year. Drake concluded its season with a 23-7 record, while winning its fourth Missouri Valley Conference championship in the last six years and another automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Carla Bennet was named to the MVC All-Tournament team along with junior guard Kristin Santa. This year was Drake's seventh appearance in the tournament. The Bulldogs have advanced to the tournament four  times in the last six years, with appearances in 1986, 1984, and 1982 as well so they continue a long, proud tradition. 
   Both Iowa State teams finished as regular season champions of the Big XII conference, then followed up that feat with convincing wins at the conference championship tournament, entitling each team to an automatic bid in the 2000 NCAA basketball tournaments. The men's championship was the university's first since 1945, when the conference was still the Big 6, while it was the first women's conference title since varsity women's basketball started at Iowa State in 1973. So these are great accomplishments. 
   Their achievements are exemplified by the selections of Marcus Fizer as a first-team All-American from the men's program and Stacy Frese as a second-team All-American from the women's program, but each team is much more than just its stars. Both All-Americans are complemented by strong position players throughout their respective teams, and neither team would have reached this pinnacle without the enthusiastic support of Iowa State's fans. On the weekend of the Big XII championships, held in Kansas City, a substantial portion of the city of Ames migrated south for that event, filling the arenas with loyal wearers of cardinal and gold, the team colors. 
   As an Iowa State graduate myself, I want to salute their accomplishments, including their fine performances in the NCAA tournaments. Both teams were active in the tournament through last weekend, the men losing in the regional finals and the women in the regional semifinals. We have a long, proud tradition of excellent basketball teams in the state of Iowa at the high school and college level, and Iowa State's 1999-2000 men's and women's basketball teams and the Drake women's team have shown themselves worthy of joining that pantheon. They're both great teams, and they did Iowa proud.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the pending amendment, which, as I understand, is the Wellstone amendment, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution commending the many farmers--the thousands of farmers and their families--who came to Washington over the last few days to rally in support of what I would call a sensible, sane, rational, and compassionate farm program that would support our farm families throughout this country. 
   We had farmers from every State. In fact, I listened to one farmer from Alaska who was here, a dairy farmer. So the rally actually was a national rally, one that encompassed all parts of our country. 
   What I heard, in talking to these farm families from across America, was a plaintive cry for us to have a farm policy in America that recognizes the essential worth, the essential importance, of having a structure of agriculture based upon family farming--widely dispersed, broadly based--rather than having a vertical structure characterized by conglomerates and huge vertical integrators that does not respond to the needs of local areas. 
   What these farm families were expressing was a frustration, a frustration borne out of their life experiences in knowing that what they have done and what their parents and grandparents before them had done in agriculture, knowing that this had benefited not only our Nation but had benefited the areas in which they lived. Because we had a lot of farm families in rural areas, we had prosperous small towns and communities. We had businesses in those communities. We had good schools and churches. We had a sense of community in rural America. Out of this structure in rural America came the sons and daughters who went on to colleges--land grant colleges, many of them--and who then became some of the great leaders of our country. 
   I need not remind those in this body of some of the great leaders in our own Senate who came from rural America, small towns and communities, farm families. I just saw our distinguished former majority and minority leader, Senator Dole, come across the floor. He comes from Russell, KS. You can't find a much smaller town than that. He has dedicated his life to public service. He is a great friend of mine and was a great leader in the Senate. I wonder how many more leaders we will get in this country coming from small towns and rural America when all these small towns have dried up, when there are no more opportunities there. 
   I think what I heard at this rally was this frustration. The farm families know what they have contributed to the well-being of our country and our communities. Yet now they are being decimated. They see their neighbors, one by one, being driven off the farm because of the economic structure we have in America. In 1998, two Iowa State University economists reported that as many as one-third of Iowa farmers would face serious financial problems if the farm economy did not improve. They would either restructure their operations or go out of business entirely. That was one out of three estimated in 1998. 
   Earlier this year, an updated study by the same economists concluded that as many as half of all Iowa farmers are classified as financially weak or severely stressed; that is, every other farmer in the State of Iowa is in real trouble. 
   A couple of farm families spoke to me when I was at the rally on the Mall in response to something I had heard, saying that their churches, which used to be packed on Sunday morning--all the pews were filled--are now half empty, that they can't even afford to pay their own minister any longer. They have a circuit rider who rides to three or four churches a week. So they lack that kind of pastoral counseling upon which families have come to rely. Indeed, we are seeing a wholesale selling out of our farm and ranch families and our rural communities. The stakes are very high. 
   I heard this great frustration from all of these farm families. Their question to us is: What are you going to do? Is this just some inevitable, invisible hand that is doing this, or are the laws of our country structured so they discriminate unfairly against family farmers? I think the latter is true. There is no invisible handwriting that farm families are a relic of the past, that our farmers have to get bigger and bigger and bigger, that our small towns have to dry up. I think it is because of policies we set in the Congress. I think those policies have to change. 
   The farm bill we have now, the so-called Freedom to Farm bill, has been a wreck. There is only one good part of it, and that is planting flexibility. That is all. The rest of it has been a wreck. The Federal Government has sent out over $15 billion in emergency money in the past 2 years. That is not counting what we sent out under the regular farm bill itself. Of course, that money was needed by the bankers, by the chemical and fertilizer dealers, by the repair shops, by the fuel dealers, by the landlords. A lot of that money went out not to save the farmer but to save  the very people about whom I speak: the bankers, chemical and fertilizer 
   dealers, repair shops, and the landlords. In fact, a lot of that money went to farmers who didn't even plant a crop last year. Tell me if that makes sense. 
   The bailout packages we have had over the last couple of years have been bailouts for the Freedom to Farm bill and not for our farmers. That was a record amount of money we sent out last year. What did it get us? Is the farm economy any healthier? No. 
   USDA tells us if we don't pass an emergency package again this year, net farm income is going to fall by 17 percent compared to last year. Tell me what farmer can afford to take another 17-percent cut. That is net farming; that is not gross. That is what they used to clothe and feed their families and buy some new equipment, pay the mortgage, and hopefully set aside a little bit for the children to go to college. 
   So it looks as if we will have to come up with another emergency package again this year. That is not a farm program. That is not a farm bill. That is lurching from one emergency to the next. Again, our farmers are the victims. 
   I was hopeful that this year we could have some hearings and a debate on the Freedom to Farm bill to see what changes we could make in it to get to a rational system of farm supports, a farm program combining conservation, storage payments, better loan rates, some shorter term set-aside programs, so we would have a balanced package, the prices at the farmgate would be higher, so the farmers could get their money from the marketplace and not from a Government paycheck. That is the debate we need. Yet that debate is not going to happen this year. We are not going to have the hearings, and we will not have the debate. 
   Quite frankly, the frustration felt by most of these farm families is going to continue to fester and grow. I think we will see even more frustration in rural America because we lack the will and, quite frankly, we lack the leadership to redress the failed Freedom to Farm bill. 
   I compliment the Senator from Minnesota for his sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I believe the farm families who took money out of their own pockets, which they could ill afford to do--they got on buses; they came here and endured rain and cold weather, slogging around in mud and water to make their case known to Congress, exercising their first amendment rights to petition their Government--did what is in the best tradition of America. I hope their voices and the frustration we heard will not go unheeded. I hope we can understand that we have an obligation in this body and in the other body to address the plight of what is happening in rural America today. 
   I come from a small town of 150 people. I remember growing up as a child when we had an elevator, we had a grocery store, a hardware store, and a small implement dealer. They are all gone now. They are all gone. I am not saying we have to save every town of 150 people. But it is not only those towns. It is those towns of 2,000, 3,000, or 5,000 people that are also going under, because I believe we don't have an adequate farm program that will enable our farmers to get a better price in the marketplace. 
   Again, I support this resolution. I commend the farmers who came here. I hope and trust we can hear their plea and do something about changing the failed Freedom to Farm bill. 
   I also wish to say I hope after this vote at 11 o'clock we can have a resounding vote in support of the crop insurance bill that is before us. We need to fix the Crop Insurance Program. 
   I commend Senator ROBERTS from Kansas and Senator KERREY from Nebraska for their leadership in this area. 
   The Crop Insurance Program needs to be changed. We put $6 billion in the budget last year for that. I believe it will be a very strong part of helping farmers get through some of these tough times that we have right now. It is not the answer to all of the problems in the farm communities, but it is a part of it. 
   Hopefully, with this modified crop insurance bill, we can go to conference with the House right away and get it to the President by May. I will for my part do everything I can with the conferees on our side to expedite the conference. There are not that many differences between the House and the Senate bill--a few, but nothing we can't work out in a timely manner. 
   I hope we can get this crop insurance bill through. I hope we can get a resounding vote for it, and at least send some hope to our family farmers that at least in the area of crop insurance and revenue insurance coverage we are going to pay some attention. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman for his leadership and work with all of us on the Agriculture Committee and in the Senate as a whole to bring this bill along to this point. It is a good bill and it will provide a lot of needed help to our nation's farmers and rural economy. I also want to thank and congratulate my colleagues, especially Senator KERREY and Senator ROBERTS, for their fine efforts. I too express my gratitude for the hard work and dedication of all the staff as mentioned by Chairman LUGAR, who have contributed to crafting this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate is going to take an important and long overdue step to stop penalizing older workers in our Nation--eliminating the Social Security earnings penalty. This is a change I have advocated for many years. So I am very pleased we are taking this important step. 
   This legislation, H.R. 5, is an important step for a number of reasons. First, it is simply the right thing to do. There should not be a penalty for working. 
   Second, we are now facing and will continue to face tight labor markets. In my State of Iowa, this is an acute problem in some areas. By eliminating the earnings penalty, experienced workers who were discouraged from continuing in or rejoining the work force will have a new incentive to work. The emergence of the Internet and home computers offers tremendous opportunities for seniors to work at home. Marrying these new job opportunities with a repeal of the earnings penalty will become even more important as the Baby Boomers retire. 
   Third, a large number of older Americans need the income. Over half of today's workers have no pension plans  outside of Social Security. They are going to need additional sources of income to maintain their standard of living. 
   Some critics have expressed concern that this change would have a negative budgetary impact. I believe that by attracting more Americans back into the work force, either on a full-time or part-time basis, it will strengthen Social Security and the federal budget. And I believe they will add to the productivity of our nation. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has been able to come together on a strong bipartisan basis to pass this bill. The President has indicated his support and so it should become the law of the land in the next few weeks. That would be a good step forward for our Nation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership and graciousness on this bill and for working hard to get it out on the floor in a timely manner. I am hopeful that we can dispose of it fairly rapidly today and move on. 
   We are here considering passage of a crop insurance reform bill that we just reported out of the Agriculture Committee on March 2. It has been a long and difficult journey to get to this point, not the least because we had a lot of good ideas from Members of this body and of the committee. I think there were no fewer than six comprehensive bills introduced on this issue. I would like to think the bill we will have at the desk shortly incorporates the best provisions of each of them. I am sure our colleagues in the House are eager for us to finish our work on this because they passed their crop insurance bill last September. So hopefully we can get this passed and get to conference and get this thing wrapped up. 
   The bill we are going to have before us shortly, S. 2251, takes advantage of the opportunity offered by last year's budget resolution to apply $6 billion to a reform of the Federal crop insurance system. This effort probably has taken on some added urgency recently due to the low commodity prices faced by our farmers. But I caution my colleagues not to place too much emphasis on the potential role of crop insurance in remedying those problems. When the last set of crop insurance reforms were passed in 1994, this program was complemented by a number of others which together comprised what was called the farm safety net. Much of the countercyclical element of that safety net was removed by Freedom to Farm, laying the foundation, I think, for some unreasonable expectations about the ability of crop insurance to offset the effects of an agricultural economy that went south. I do not mean geographically. 
   Aside from problems in the general farm economy, which crop insurance was never intended to deal with, the last few years have exposed other weaknesses in the program, which this bill does attempt to address. First of all, although the program currently covers about two-thirds of acreage for eligible crops, much of that coverage either represents catastrophic policies or policies at the lower levels of buy-up coverage. This bill offers enhanced subsidies for the purpose of buying crop insurance. Under the current system, the percentage subsidy peaks at the 65/100 level, making farmers eat a 35-percent loss of crop value before they qualify for any relief. We want to encourage farmers to insure their crops at a higher level of buy-up, which we hope will have the effect of reducing the probability of future ad hoc disaster relief programs. We are also equalizing premium subsidies for revenue insurance coverage, which Iowa farmers have eagerly adopted. In 1999, Crop Revenue Coverage and other revenue products covered more than 60 percent of insured acres in my State of Iowa, I might add, the highest percentage in the country. The revenue insurance concept was one of the best things to come out of the 1994 reform, and I want to thank those at USDA and the private sector who did the hard work to make it available. 
   In addition, this bill includes provisions which fixes APH problems associated with multi-year natural disasters, makes the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program more attractive, and offers greater support and flexibility in conducting research and development of new crop insurance products, especially for specialty crops. On the administrative side, it strengthens oversight of the industry and penalties for noncompliance and fraud, clarifies reporting requirements, makes changes to the structure of the Board of Directors of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and requires USDA to pay more attention to regions of the country where crop insurance is not viewed as an attractive option. 
   Chairman LUGAR offered a competing vision for addressing concerns about crop insurance and risk management for farmers. His approach was to encourage farmers to adopt a wide range of risk management practices, rather than focus just on crop insurance. In the spirit of compromise, this bill included a $500 million risk management pilot within the substitute amendment offered and passed in committee, and I look forward to what USDA learns from implementing this program for 3 years, assuming it will be implemented into law. 
   I am pleased that the committee adopted an amendment I offered during markup which restores the conservation compliance requirement for crop insurance, which passed by voice vote. I do not believe it is unreasonable to treat crop insurance and risk management payments in the same way as we treat FSA loans, disaster payments or any other USDA benefits. For all those other benefits, farmers do have to comply with conservation programs. That is especially so considering that crop insurance is already a substantial USDA program, costing nearly $2 billion a year. With this legislation, we will add about $1.5 billion a year in additional spending for crop insurance and risk management programs. It seems only right that for some $3.5 billion a year, we should be doing all we can to ensure the programs are also promoting conservation of our precious soil and water. 
   We also worked to strengthen the risk management program by adding resource management practices and organic farming as eligible options, and instructed the Risk Management Agency to view scientifically sound sustainable and organic farming practices as good farming practices. 
   All in all, I think this crop insurance bill is a good piece of legislation. I especially want to compliment my colleagues, Senator KERREY of Nebraska and Senator ROBERTS from Kansas, for their strong leadership in a bipartisan manner on this bill. I believe they have engineered and built a good bill, a bill that will help us in all parts of the country in those things I just spoke about--everything from specialty crops in one area to the big wheat and grain crops in other parts of the country--with the provisions in there that mandate that USDA is to find new ways of making crop insurance more attractive in those areas of the country that have low sign-up rates. Finally, I think the  vision of both Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY in getting the subsidies for the buy-up--that really is the heart and soul of this bill to ensure that farmers will have a better deal when they buy up their risk coverage for their crops and their crop insurance programs. 
   It is a good bill. It deserves the support of the Senate. Hopefully, we can get it up, and hopefully get it through in due course yet today. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I look forward to working with my good friend from Indiana and Massachusetts to pass strong hunger relief legislation this year. In my work on the Agriculture Committee, the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have been dismayed not only to see the reports of increasing hunger among children and working families that Senator KENNEDY describes, but also to hear scientists explain how inadequate nutrition limits children's ability to learn at school and adults' ability to concentrate at work. I join my colleagues in urging the Budget Committee to report a resolution that includes a reserve fund of $2.5 billion over five years to alleviate hunger in America.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of the Family Opportunity Act of 2000. I commend my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, for his work on this important piece of legislation. I also thank Senator KENNEDY for his continued leadership on these issues. This bill would help many children across the country get the services they need to grow up and become independent and productive members of society. And, it will help their families stay afloat financially. 
   I am always encouraged when issues affecting individuals with disabilities and their families rise above partisan lines. Disability is not a partisan issue. President Bush understood that. Bob Dole understands that. And I am glad to see that my fellow senator from Iowa has joined me in the fight to ensure that children with disabilities and their families get a fair shake in life. 
   Just last year the Congress and the President agreed that we should remove barriers to work for people with disabilities in our national programs when it passed the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 into law. The Family Opportunity Act builds on that bipartisan agreement and says that we should also remove barriers to work for families of children with disabilities. Right now, many families are forced to spend down their savings and earnings on specialized services for their children because their private insurance won't cover them. Other families give up jobs and promotions so that they continue to qualify for Medicaid. 
   This is wrong for two reasons. First, it's the child that suffers if appropriate services aren't available due to high cost and lack of insurance coverage. Second, if a family is forced to pay for expensive services time and again or forced to give up an employment opportunity, the entire family is pushed to edge financially. As a result, the family can become impoverished or forced to give up custody of their child in order to secure appropriate Medicaid services. 
   This bill provides a commonsense solution to the problem. The bill allows States to offer Medicaid coverage to children with severe disabilities living in middle-income families through a buy-in program. children will get the right early intervention services, rehabilitation and long-term therapies, and medical equipment they need to keep pace and grow into adulthood. And, parents will no longer have to sacrifice a job, a raise, or overtime so they can stay inside the income bracket that qualifies their child for SSI/Medicaid. 
   Perhaps most importantly, this bill will ensure that children get the services they need to stay at home with their families. Keeping families strong is the best therapy for everyone--the child, the family, and the entire community. 
   Finally, the Family to Family Health Information Centers included in the bill will ensure every family knows what about the services and opportunities that are available to them. I know this type of information exchange works because I've taken the lead to fund similar programs in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. 
   Ten years ago, as the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I said on the Senate floor that I wanted every child and individual with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of American life. 
   Since that time, I have worked hard to ensure that every national program encourages independence and self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities. Each step we take to live up to the promise of the Americans with Disabilities' Act is progress. Last year's Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement was a big step toward equality. The Family Opportunity Act builds on that legislation. 
   In my mind, the Medicaid Community Attendant Services Act (MiCASSA), introduced by myself and Senator SPECTER last fall, takes the next big step toward fulfilling the promise of the ADA. Given a real choice, most Americans who need long-term services and supports would prefer to receive them in home and community settings rather than in institutions. And yet, too often decisions relating to the provision of long-term services and supports are influenced by what is reimbursable under Federal and State Medicaid policy rather than by what individuals need. Research has revealed a significant bias in the Medicaid program toward reimbursing services provided in institutions over services provided in home and community settings (75 percent of Medicaid funds pay for services provided in institutions). 
   Long-term services and supports provided under the Medicaid program must meet the evolving and changing needs and preferences of individuals. No individual should be forced into an institution to receive reimbursement for services that can be effectively and efficiently delivered in the home or community. Individuals must be empowered to exercise and real choice in selecting long term services and supports that meet their unique needs. Federal and State Medicaid policies should facilitate and be responsive to and not impede an individual's choice in selecting needed long-term services and supports. 
   MiCASSA would eliminate the bias in Medicaid law toward institutional care by providing that stats offer community attendant services and supports as well as institutional care for eligible individuals in need of long term services and supports. The legislation also assists states develop and enhance comprehensive statewide system of long-term services and supports that provide real consumer choice consistent with the principle that service and supports should be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to meeting the unique need of the individual. 
   I look forward to building further bipartisan agreement on both pieces of legislation. This is an exciting time for disability policy.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased with the provisions of the conference report concerning slots that provide for a two-step process for the elimination of airline slots, landing and take off rights at O'Hare, Kennedy, and LaGuardia Airports. Senator GRASSLEY and I proposed a similar method for the elimination of slots at those three airports over a year ago. 
   I am very pleased that we have been able to work closely with Chairman MCCAIN, Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator HOLLINGS, and others on the development of this proposal. I am proud of the support that we have received from a majority of the attorneys general led by Iowa's own Attorney General Tom Miller. The U.S. Department of Transportation deserves special praise for its initiative calling for the elimination of the anticompetitive slot rule that was the starting point of our proposal. Chairman SHUSTER and the House also deserve considerable praise for their proposal to eliminate the slot rule at these airports last June. 
   I want to especially commend Chairman MCCAIN and his staff for working so closely with us on this issue. He held a field hearing in Des Moines on April 30 last year to hear firsthand how the current system effects small and medium-sized cities. He has worked hard to move forward a proposal which I believe will significantly increase competition. That was not an easy task. 
   I also want to especially thank Senator ROCKEFELLER and his staff for their considerable efforts. Both Senators have shown a keen interest in the problems unique to smaller cities where adequate service is the paramount issue. 
   The phasing out of the slot requirements at these airports is an important step toward eliminating a major barrier to airline competition. And, by doing so in this two step process mitigates against some of the long-term effects of the government-imposed slot rule. Under current rules, most smaller airlines have, in effect, had a far more difficult time competing, in part because of the slot rule. 
   The conference report allows small airlines to expanded access to all four slot controlled airports to some degree. Not as much as our original proposal. I would have liked to have seen a longer phase in of the rule at O'Hare and broader provisions for limited incumbent--that is newer and usually smaller airlines to provide additional, often competitive service which will hopefully result in lower fares and improved service in many markets. The final provisions are not as broad as Senator GRASSLEY and I initially proposed. But they are a genuine and substantial improvement. This will help stimulate increased competition and lower ticket prices. Unfortunately, at LaGuardia, smaller airlines will not be able to establish service between their hubs and LaGuardia. The number of flights to O'Hare by newer airlines is limited. But, the measure provides some real opportunities to newer often low cost carriers during the phase in period. 
   The measure allows a carrier to establish new service to O'Hare without any restriction starting 
    in May so long as the new service is with aircraft with fewer than 70 seats. Cities like Sioux City in Iowa and other small and medium sized cities around O'Hare will hopefully be able to see service to O'Hare, important to many businesses and those cities economy. And, an airline can also increase the frequency of service to smaller cities so long as aircraft with fewer than 70 seats are used. Recently, Burlington IA, was facing the loss of an important round trip to O'Hare purely because of the slot rule. The Quad Cities lost service by American Airlines last year because, in part, a limited number of slots were available. There is some chance that both decisions may be reversed now that slot restrictions will no longer impact those decisions. 
   Timing of service to smaller cities will be more efficient and carriers will be able to increase their frequency. I am very pleased that the conferees approved a two for one rule, giving an additional slot to airlines that upgrade an existing round trip turbojet service to smaller cities with a regional jet. This provides an incentive to provide improved service to smaller cities when it makes sense to do it. 
   In the final step, after a shorter period than I would like at O'Hare and a longer period than I think is best at  the New York Airports, the slot rules would be ended at O'Hare, Kennedy, and LaGuardia Airports. In both cases I am hopeful that competitive airlines might get a change to establish a foothold and smaller cities would have established better service that will continue in the long term. 
   Access to affordable air service is essential to efficient commerce and economic development. Americans have a right to expect it. Airports are paid for by the traveling public through taxes and by fees charged by the Federal Government and local airport authorities. 
   Unfortunately, when deregulation came along in 1978, there was no effective framework put in place to deal with anticompetitive practices. Many of these practices have become business as usual. The result has been increased air fares and decreased service to mid-size and small communities. 
   The slot rule, originally put in place because of the limitations of the air traffic control system has been an effective competition. The DOT, improperly, I believe, literally gave the right to land and take off to those who used these airports on January 21, 1986. That effectively locked in the current users of those airports and locked out effective competition. It gave away a public resource. Finally, this bill phases out the slot rule and its anti-competitive effects and its negative effects on smaller communities. 
   Lastly, I wanted to say a few words about the budget. Our airways system has some very real problems. Capacity is limited. There are many pressure points that create bottlenecks, slowing down traffic. We need more gates, more runways and taxiways. We need better equipment and computers as well as additional flight controllers in order to increase the capacity of the system at a number of points. Long delays at our nations airports decrease the efficiency of our entire economy. This bill does provide for considerable increases in funds. 
   While many very necessary things are costly, some of the things that can be done with the airways systems do not cost large sums. For example, if pilots received written comments from flight controllers rather than verbal commands, the efficiency of the system would improve and the chance of errors would decrease. But, the culture of the system is slow to change. This step is now moving toward a multiyear test and then a multiyear implementation. Changes like this one should be implemented more quickly. 
   If we are able to provide the considerable increases in funding the airways system needs and for which this bill provides, we must see reasonable levels of funding for domestic discretionary spending over the coming years or the sums provided in this measure are not likely to occur.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the pending amendment with my colleague from Virginia, Senator ROBB. Senator ROBB has been a great advocate for improving education for many years. 
   The facts about the need for this amendment to help modernize and upgrade our nation's public school facilities are well known. 
   The average school building is 42 years old. Nearly three-quarters of all public schools were built before 1970. 
   Fourteen million American children attend classes in schools that are unsafe or inadequate and the General Accounting Office estimates it will cost $112 billion to upgrade existing public schools to overall good condition. 
   Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. 
   Enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at an all time high and will continue to grow over the next 10 years, making it necessary for the United States to build an additional 6,000 schools. 
   It is a national disgrace that the nicest places that our children see are shopping malls, sports arenas and movie theaters and the most run down place they see are their public schools. What signal are we sending them about the value we place on them, their education and future? 
   How can we prepare our kids for the 21st century in schools that did not make the grade in the 20th century?  
   Last year I visited Hiatt Middle School in Des Moines. This school opened its doors in 1925 and students spend all but a few hours a week in classrooms built during a time when Americans could not imagine the technological advances that would occur by the end of the century. 
   In 1925, Americans were flocking to movie theaters to see--and hear--the first talking motion picture--Al Jolson's ``The Jazz Singer.'' The students who walked through the doors of the brand new Hiatt school that year could not imagine IMAX theaters with surround sound where a movie goer actually becomes a part of the film. 
   In 1925, consumers were lining up in department stores to buy novelties like electric phonographs, dial telephones, and self-winding watches. CD's, DVD players, cellular telephones, or palm pilots were unthinkable. 
   And, the introduction of state-of-the-art technologies like rural electrification and crop dusting were revolutionizing the lives of families and farmers alike. 
   There have been incredible technological and scientific advances in the past seven decades. Yet, our schools have not kept pace with the times. We continue to educate our children in schools built and equipped in bygone eras. 
   We must make sure that every child and every school can facilitate the technology of the 21st century. However, Iowa State University reports that we need at least $4 billion over the next ten years to repair and upgrade school buildings in Iowa and make sure they can effectively utilize educational technology. 
   The amendment we are offering is a comprehensive, two-prong response to this critical national problem. 
   First, we would authorize $1.3 billion to make grants and loans for emergency repairs to public schools. 
   Mr. President, the Iowa Fire Marshall reported a five-fold increase in the number of fires in schools over the past decade. During the 1990's there were 100 fires in Iowa schools. During the previous decade there were 20. 
   It is clear that public schools have an urgent need to make repairs now and these grants and no-interest loans will finance up to 8,300 repair projects. We will fix the roofs, upgrade the electrical systems, and repair the fire code violations. 
   The second part of our comprehensive strategy is to provide $25 billion in tax credits to modernize our nation's schools. These tax credits will subsidize the interest on new construction projects that will enable school districts to build new schools to replace outdated buildings or add more class rooms so they can reduce class size. 
   A few weeks ago I visited a school in Des Moines where students attend class in closets because there is no room. This is simply unacceptable. 
   In closing, I would like to share a few words from Tunisia, Washington, D.C. fifth grader in Jonathan Kozol's book, ``Savage Inequalities.''  
   It's like this. The school is dirty. There isn't any playground. There's a hole in the wall behind the principal's desk. What we need to do is first rebuild the school. Build a playground. Plant a lot of flowers. Paint the classrooms. Fix the hole in the principal's office. Buy doors for the toilet stalls in the girl's bathroom. Make it a beautiful clean building. Make it pretty. Way it is, I feel ashamed.  
   Our amendment will make it possible to rebuild her schools. It will make it possible to fix the hole in the wall, put doors on the bathroom stalls and paint the classrooms. By modernizing and repairing Tunisia's schools we will make her feel a little less ashamed of herself and her school. 
   This is a serious national problem. And it demands a comprehensive national response. Our amendment is that response and I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the pending amendment with my colleague from Virginia, Senator ROBB. Senator ROBB has truly been one of the educational leaders over his tenure in the Senate. He has shown great leadership especially in this area that is so important as we are reducing class sizes around the country. I have visited schools in Iowa and other States recently where, because of the reduction of class sizes, they are out of room; they need more space. And we know the average school building in this country is 42 years old; 74 percent of our schools were built before 1970. 
   The Robb amendment addresses this very critical need in our country. I am proud to be a cosponsor. I congratulate him for his very strong leadership in the whole area of education but especially in the area of modernizing and rebuilding our schools.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we will be introducing the Public School Repair and Renovation Act. This legislation will authorize $1.3 billion in grants and no interest loans to enable school districts to make urgent repairs at our nation's public schools. I am pleased to be joined by Senators ROBB, BINGAMAN, FEINSTEIN, KENNEDY, WELLSTONE, and DODD in cosponsoring this legislation in the Senate. 
   The facts about the condition of our nation's schools are well known. The average age of the schools in this country is 42 years. 14 million children attend classes in buildings that are unsafe or inadequate. The General Accounting Office reports we need $112 billion to just bring our schools up to overall good condition. How can kids prepare for the 21st century in schools that didn't even make the grade in the 20th century? 
   It is a national disgrace that the nicest thing our kids see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown place they see is their school. What signal are we sending them about the value we place on them, their education and future? 
   I was disturbed by the comments of Tunisia, a Washington, D.C. 5th grader in Jonathan Kozol's book, ``Savage Inequalities.'' This is what she said.  
   It's like this. The school is dirty. There isn't any playground. There's a hole in the wall behind the principal's desk. What we need to do is first rebuild the school. Build a playground. Plant a lot of flowers. Paint the classrooms. Fix the hole in the principal's office. Buy doors for the toilet stalls in the girl's bathroom. Make it a beautiful clean building. Make it pretty.

   The legislation we are introducing would make it possible to fix the holes in the walls of Tunisia's school, put doors on the bathroom stalls and paint the classrooms. These repairs would make Tunisia feel a little less ashamed of herself and of her school. 
   This legislation is part of a comprehensive two-prong strategy to modernize our nation's schools. This bill complements our continuing effort to provide tax credits for new construction and modernization projects. We have advocated school modernization tax credits that would finance $25 billion in new construction or major renovations. The Public School Repair and Renovation Act will complement that effort and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator SPECTER, as primary cosponsor of a sense of the Senate resolution, introduced yesterday, that puts the Senate on record that funding for NIH should be increased by $2.7 billion in Fiscal Year 2001. NIH is the premier medical research institution in the world--research funded by NIH is key to maintaining the quality of our health care and key to finding preventive measures, cures and the most cost effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that strike Americans. 
   Two years ago, our Appropriations Subcommittee provided NIH with a $2 billion increase to set us on a five-year course to double NIH funding over five years. Last year, our Subcommittee was able to secure a $2.3 billion increase for NIH--continuing on the course to double NIH funding over five years. A $2.7 billion increase for NIH in Fiscal Year 2001 would keep us on track to double NIH in the five years. 
   I was disappointed that the President's budget which we received today only requested a $1 billion increase for NIH. Funding biomedical research is especially important now when research on stem cells and progress made on the Human Genome project offer such promise. I hope to work closely with Senator SPECTER this year to build on last year's increase for NIH as we move to doubling funding for NIH by 2003.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator SPECTER, in the introduction of the Medical Errors Reduction Act of 2000. Senator SPECTER just outlined the major provisions of the bill. I will not go back over that; only suffice to say our bill addresses a critical problem facing America's health care system, a problem that places millions of Americans at risk of serious injury or death every time they seek medical attention. 
   Again, I thank my distinguished chairman, Senator SPECTER, for putting this bill together in such a timely  fashion. This is something we have to address, and we have to focus on this immediately. 
   Many of my colleagues are aware of the recently released Institute of Medicine report which describes a health care industry plagued with systems errors and provider mistakes. If you are familiar with the report, then you have discovered something I do not think a lot of people are aware of and of which I was not aware, and that is, we are more likely to die from a medical mistake than diabetes, breast cancer, or a traffic accident. 
   The report found that deaths due to medical errors are the fifth leading cause of death in this country. This chart is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. It shows medical errors as the fifth leading cause of death. Some say it is the eighth leading cause of death. More people die from medical errors than pneumonia, diabetes, accidents, or kidney disease. 
   Whether it is the fifth or eighth, we have been given a wake-up call. The cost to our health care system and national economy from medical errors is enormous. 
   The total cost, we are told by the Institute of Medicine, of injuries due to medical errors is $17 billion to $29 billion annually. This estimate cannot accurately reflect the true personal cost to patients and their families when a diagnostic test is misread, a drug that is known to cause an allergic reaction is prescribed, or a surgery goes awry. 
   One does not have to look too far for stories. I know some personally in my own family. Another came from one of my staff members who told me about the disastrous outcome of a conventional gall bladder procedure performed on her father in 1991. 
   It seems he went in for a laparoscopy and came out with a severed bile duct. The gall bladder was removed surgically, and the patient was sent home to recuperate. Within days, he experienced great abdominal pain, could not eat, and began to lose weight. His wife is a nutritionist and could tell something was very wrong. They kept going back to the doctors who performed the surgery only to be told they could not find anything wrong and that his problems were probably psychological. 
   Finally, in great frustration, the man and his wife turned to a neighbor, an old-fashioned country doctor who sent them to a surgeon friend of his. Sure enough, this doctor discovered the problem and it was corrected, but only after several months of pain and frustration. 
   Deaths from medication errors total more than 7,000 annually. These errors erode the trust Americans have in their health care system. 
   Let me be clear, most medical errors that occur in our health care system are not the fault of any one individual or 
   institution. We have the best trained, most sophisticated health care workforce in the world. Thousands of highly skilled and conscientious doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other medical professionals operate under tremendous pressure and time constraints. 
   It is a complex problem which must be addressed with comprehensive solutions and rigorous changes that will help providers better perform their jobs and prevent medical errors from happening in the future. It is a problem that is systemic, not personal. 
   Again, we must work together, in a bipartisan way, because all Americans enjoy the right to be free from accidental injury, accidental death, and medication-related errors when they need care. 
   Again, I thank my distinguished chairman for his leadership on this issue, for putting this bill together. I am proud to be his chief cosponsor. 
   In closing, this Congress now has an opportunity to join together to address a problem that has the potential to impact the life of every citizen who seeks health care. I hope all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join Senator SPECTER and me in supporting this important legislation. 
   I yield the floor to my distinguished chairman.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to talk on the issue of agriculture and rural America, and the administration's proposal announced by Secretary Glickman yesterday for improving the farm safety net. 
   At the outset, I am pleased that the administration has recognized that the Freedom to Farm bill has failed. The proposal the administration came up with is an impetus for change, and I think it will do a good deal to remedy the shortcomings of the Freedom to Farm bill. 
   I think the administration proposals of yesterday are a good step forward. I will go through a number of those. However, I want to forewarn my colleagues, while I think there is a lot in the administration's proposal that is good and positive and moves us ahead, I believe there are some shortcomings in it also. 
   First, on the conservation end, I believe the administration's proposal is a good step forward. It has some very positive features. The administration is proposing, for example, that we extend the conservation reserve program by 3.6 million acres up to 40 million acres. I believe that is a good proposal. That will do a lot to help conserve land and water and take some land out of production. It will help our wildlife. I think this is a good step. 
   There is a proposal for $600 million for the conservation security program. This is a program that is designed after a bill I authored to set up a conservation security program whereby farmers and ranchers could, on a voluntary basis, carry out certain conservation measures on their land, and then they would receive payments for doing so. This program would be administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Again, this is fully voluntary, but it is another means whereby farmers could, by engaging in certain conservation practices, shore up their income. 
   The wetland reserve program has a cap right now of 975,000 acres. The administration would enroll an additional 210,000 acres in 2001 and another 250,000 acres in each subsequent year--again, a very positive step forward, to enroll land in the wetland reserve program. 
   There are several other conservation proposals: new funding for the farmland protection program, the wildlife habitat incentives program, and the environmental quality incentives program. All of these are extremely good measures that will both help conservation but also improve farm income. 
   The risk management provisions are positive. The administration is proposing about $640 million for a premium discount program for farmers and ranchers who take buy-up levels of crop insurance. That would help them reduce the cost and get better coverage. The administration also is proposing $100 million annually to develop a policy that covers multiyear losses. In places such as North Dakota, South Dakota, some parts of Minnesota, and others, we have had areas where they have had 3, 4, 5 years of drought, floods, crop disease or other damaging conditions. We need a risk management program that covers those multiyear losses. I am glad to see the administration taking a step to address this problem in the budget. 
   The administration is also proposing to establish a pilot program for insuring livestock. Currently there is no such insurance program. I hear a lot from livestock producers in Iowa that there should be some form of a risk management program, an insurance program for livestock production. Half of all our farm receipts come from livestock or livestock products. The administration is proposing a pilot program of $100 million annually to provide livestock producers with some form of price protection. I believe that is another good provision in the administration's proposal. 
   There is another area I am very pleased to see the administration addressing. That is using $130 million in the next couple of years to establish new cooperative development programs to provide equity capital for new livestock and other processing cooperatives. This proposal would address concerns about market concentration by encouraging new entrants into the livestock processing market. It would also provide an additional source of 
   income for farmers through the ownership of value-added processing. This is key. We have to help farmers to form more cooperatives, both for the marketing of their grains and livestock and also to develop value-added processing plants and enterprises that would help farmers obtain more of the value added to the livestock and crops they produce. Again, this is a good proposal. 
   The administration is proposing to develop a new bioenergy program to encourage greater use of farm products for production of biofuels. Again, by supporting ethanol and other bioenergy feedstocks, we can use some of our land, perhaps even some of our conservation land, to produce energy sources such as switch grass, which can then be used to generate energy. We have a project ongoing in Iowa right now that will do that so we can use land set aside in the conservation reserve program. We can grow products such as switch grass. We can cut that switch grass and burn it for energy. So we get conservation, plus the farmer will get some additional income, plus it will cut down on our need for imported energy into this country. I am delighted the administration is moving ahead on that. 
   Lastly, the area I am concerned about with the administration's proposal is sort of the heart and soul of it, which is farm income support. Again, the administration recognizes that we need some kind of countercyclical type of support. That is true. That is what we need. That is what Freedom to Farm does not provide. It does not provide an adequate safety net. It does not provide for countercyclical help. Nevertheless, the administration proposal misses the mark. They are proposing that under this program they are going to have supplemental government payments, in addition to the AMTA payments under Freedom to Farm, to eligible producers if projected gross income for the crop falls below 92 percent  of the preceding 5-year average. Gross income would include gross market revenues for the crop plus government payments, including AMTA payments, marketing loans, and loan deficiency payments. 
   That is where I have a problem with the administration's proposal. First of all, they are going to use a 5-year average. That is fine. But what are they using? They are using gross income over 5 years. They are throwing into the gross income all of the government payments, loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, everything. Farm income should not be looked upon as government payments. Farm income ought to come from the marketplace. That is where the farmer ought to get a better share of the marketing dollar. If you are going to use gross income for 5 years, what about the farmer's costs? Seed goes up in price; fertilizers go up; fuel costs are sky-rocketing; machinery and equipment continue to go up. And, thanks to the Federal Reserve System, interest rates are going up. So if you are just going to take gross income over the last 5 years and not take into account the cost to the farmer, you are already downgrading the net income farmers get. 
   A farmer can tell you--I don't care how much gross income they get--they have to know what their bottom line is. You might say a farmer has a gross income of $100,000. That sounds great. But you add up all the costs of feed, seed, fertilizer, machinery, fuel, equipment, interest rates and the like; if his costs are $92,000, the farmer has made $8,000. That is what we are seeing happening out there. To use gross income over 5 years, I think, is inadequate, ineffective, illogical, and not in the best interest of trying to get net income up to farmers. 
   That is what I am interested in--net income. I don't care about gross income. I want to know what the net income of farmers is. What are they going to have left afterward to put away for a rainy day, to help their bottom line, to help put their kids through school, to keep a roof overhead, to help buy some better machinery in the future, to help provide for their retirement, to pay off their land costs? This is what we ought to be thinking about. 
   I am disappointed that the administration would use gross income over 5 years and average it out that way. Again, that is better than the Freedom to Farm bill, which is fixed and declining payments based upon acreages and yields from 20 years ago. That is totally illogical. So is this better than Freedom to Farm? Yes, a little bit, but it still shortchanges farmers. Quite frankly, I think we are going to have to modify that. I am disappointed, I must say, in the administration for using gross income figures over 5 years. That is not the right way to base the income support. 
   Again, they have tried to target the payments to family-size farms. I am all for that principle, and, quite frankly, the way they have figured it, most of the income support would go to the bulk of the farmers who need the help. I won't get into the mechanics of that, but it basically looks that way at this point. The idea of sending the bulk of the support to family farms who need the help is good, but they are basing it over income of 5 years--gross income--and farmers would be getting shortchanged. 
   Secondly, the administration, in establishing and sort of outlining and coming up with this program, said in their release:  
   Rising crop surpluses, continued low prices and declining incomes will contribute to increasing farm financial stress in 2000, indicating a need for further Federal assistance. However, added assistance should not be made in the form of emergency legislation with the bulk of the payments in the form of Agricultural Market Transition Act payments. That approach, taken the past two years, is not in the best interests of farmers and taxpayers, as the assistance is ad hoc and ineffectively targeted.  
   Well, that is partially true--certainly about the AMTA payments. Listen to this again:  
   Rising crop surpluses, continued low prices, and declining incomes will contribute to increasing farm financial stress in 2000, indicating a need for further Federal assistance.  
   There is nothing in their program--the administration's proposal--that will tend to reduce crop surpluses. A little bit of the land taken out for the CRP, or WRP, that is fine. That is mostly marginal land anyway. But there is nothing in here that will tend to get our surpluses down and thus, increase the market price, or the price farmers get when they sell their crops. That is the problem. 
   It seems to me that the administration has sort of bought into the idea that we are going to plant fence row to fence row, we are going to continue to produce everything we can produce--the sky is the limit--and we are going to come in with some kind of targeted Federal assistance. On the one hand, I believe we do need some Federal assistance. On the other hand, we need to get out of the mindset we are in; we need to have a different mindset, one which says we can shape programs that will help get the surpluses down and thus increase the price at the farm gate. 
   I would hope that we can put some money into a shorter-term reserve program, something that would be 2 years, or maybe a 3-year program, to facilitate taking some land out of production and putting it into conservation use for a while. I am talking about land we will not get into the 10-year CRP. Farmers will not tie up relatively productive land by agreeing to take it out for 10 years. You can't pay them enough to do it. But I believe they will take some land out in this period of very low commodity prices for maybe 2 years. That should help alleviate the surpluses and improve market prices. I would think we would have a target of saying we 
   want to enroll a certain number of acres in a short-term program, which would tend to get some of our surpluses down. So I hope we can come up with the funding to attract land into a shorter-term reserve or paid set-aside program. 
   Lastly, there is nothing in the administration's proposal that will provide farmers the assistance they need to store grain so they can market their grain in a more orderly fashion. The Farmer Owned Reserve was taken away by the Freedom to Farm bill. It was one of the best programs we ever had. Right now, farmers harvest grain and they can put it under loan for a time, but there are no storage payments. And then they have to sell their crops even if the price is very low. Well, we need a program for on-farm storage, where they can store it at the farm or in an elevator, but the payments ought to go to the farmers. 
   There is nothing in the administration's proposal that would do that. Now, there is a provision--and I haven't looked at it that closely--which says:  
   Using existing authorities to implement a new on-farm storage loan program to facilitate farmers' marketing opportunities.  
   Well, I don't know exactly what that is, a loan program. I am talking about storage payments to farmers, which we had before, and not some kind of a loan program just for the facilities. So I think while there are some good things in their proposal in terms of the conservation programs that are in there, the new amount of money for cooperatives, to encourage cooperatives for marketing--I ask unanimous consent for another 3 minutes.

   Mr. HARKIN. There is a good proposal in there on the bioenergy. But when you get to the heart of it, and what we are going to do to get away from this mindset of the Government supplying the income to the farmers--that is the heart of what the problem is--and get to the mindset of how do we get the prices up at the farm gate, this is where the administration's proposal falls short. I am hopeful as we move ahead we can convince the administration to get off of that mindset, to provide for perhaps some increased loan rates for farmers, to provide for storage payments to farmers, and to provide for a shorter-term paid set-aside program. Again, as the administration said in their proposal:  
   Rising crop surpluses, continued low prices, and declining incomes will contribute to increasing farm financial stress in 2000, indicating a need for further Federal assistance.  
   We have to get off of that mindset. We have rising surpluses. Well, let's get them down and provide for the kind of programs that will get the surpluses down. Continued low prices--get those low prices back up at the farm gate--that is the mindset we have to get on, and I hope we can take the good things  in the proposal, but get to the heart and soul of it, which is getting farm income up--not from Government payments, but from the prices farmers receive for their products. That is what we have to do. 
   I see my friend from Minnesota is here to speak on this. Again, we have talked about this, and we share the same strong feelings that this is not adequate, this needs some additional work in the Congress. I hope we can get the administration to help us on that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. It is exactly what we are talking about. I point out that in the administration's proposal for their farm support this year, they will use a 5-year average of gross income--gross income. Look, what about the increased price of fuel, machinery, fertilizer, seed, and, thanks to the Federal Reserve System, increased interest rates? I said before and I say to my friend again that the farmer has a $100,000 gross income averaged over 5 years. But if his costs are $92,000, what does that mean? It doesn't mean anything.

   Mr. HARKIN. We have to get away from thinking that agriculture is some sort of a minor entity out there, some kind of a sidebar issue. Agriculture is still, if I am not mistaken, something like 20 percent of our gross national product. I think we are up from 20 percent, if I am not mistaken. People still have to eat. Food is one thing we can't do without. Yet we sort of treat agriculture as sort of--well, it is sort of a sidebar, sort of a side item. We have to think of agriculture as a central, integral part of our entire economic structure in America.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his statement on the floor, pointing out that what this interest rate increase is is a tax on hard-working Americans, a very insidious kind of tax, too. It is going to have other repercussions. 
   The question I have to ask of the Senator is this: The Senator talked about the Federal Reserve Board meeting in secret and not knowing what is going on. I don't want to make it political either. No one wants to make it political. But I think we do have a right to know why they make the decisions they make. 
   It is my understanding that the transcripts of the meetings of the Fed are kept secret for 5 years, if I am not mistaken. It may be a shorter period. I stand to be corrected. We don't know for years why they made the decisions they made. What is so secretive about this? 
   Even if they do meet in secret, it seems to me that within 1 month or 3 months or 6 months we ought to at least have the transcript so we would know what was the discussion that went into why the Board raised interest rates a quarter of a point today; what the discussions were last year that caused them to raise interest rates three times. Keep in mind, the Fed has raised interest rates four times in a 1 year period. A little nick here, a little nick there, pretty soon you are bleeding pretty badly. Four times in a 1 year period. What were the reasons for it? We don't know because they meet in secret. Again, it is my understanding--I stand to be corrected--that the transcripts are kept secret for 5 years. 
   Again, the Senator from North Dakota has pointed this out many times, the Federal Reserve was not created by the Constitution of the United States. The Federal Reserve was created by legislation. It is a creature of Congress created by legislation. It seems to me we have a right and a responsibility to have a better understanding not only of how the Fed operates but why they make the decisions they do. I ask the Senator that question, about opening up the transcripts so we know why they make those decisions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I would like to let my fellow Senators know I don't intend to take that much time. 
   Mr. President, I noted with some interest that the chairman of the committee, Senator GRAMM from Texas, when he started speaking a few moments ago said this debate we were having--and he mentioned the Senator from North Dakota, he mentioned this Senator--indicated the fundamental difference between the parties. I waited to see just exactly what he meant by that. I never heard an explanation. 
   But maybe this debate does show some fundamental differences. For example, we are for openness. We believe the Federal Reserve ought to meet in the open, that it shouldn't meet in private. We believe transcripts ought to be made available to the public sooner than they are. Of course, we believe in lower interest rates. We want open meetings and lower interest rates, and the other side wants private meetings and higher interest rates. Perhaps that is really the fundamental difference we are talking about. I say it only tongue in cheek. But it does, I think, really say what this is all about. 
   That is whether or not we are going to have some more accountability and openness in the Federal Reserve rather than what we have had in the past. Its decisions affect every American's life. It affects all of us. This recent interest rate increase today, as the Senator from North Dakota said, is a tax on all Americans. We are all going to pay for it. Some of us can afford to pay it a lot more easily than others. If you are a creditor, if you are part of the creditor class in America where your income exceeds your outgo, where you are able to save, where you have a lot of assets, and you are into investing and lending, higher interest rates may not be such a bad idea. 
   However, if you are in the lower income sector of our economy, you need to buy a new car to get to work and the old one has run out, you do not have enough money, you have to put some money down, pay for it on time, or roll your interest on your credit cards month to month, maybe you need to make your house payment, maybe your kids are in college, you need to make some college payments, and you are an individual making less than $30,000 a year as a family, this is a real tax. It is going to cost you more money. Yet we don't know what the debate was. We don't know the details of why they did this. We will not know for years. 
   I believe there is an important difference. The Open Market Committee just announced another quarter-point interest rate from 5.5 to 5.75 and an increase in the discount rate as well. 
   This makes four times in 1 year that we have had interest rate increases--four times, three times last year, and then once this month. 
   These increases hurt prospective homeowners. It is going to hurt the housing market. I want to say at the outset, we all want Americans to save more money. For modest-income Americans, the best savings program they have is owning their own homes. For modest-income Americans, when they are through with their working lives and they retire and they are on Social Security, the biggest asset they have, and in many cases the only asset they have, is the equity they have in their homes. So we want Americans to become homeowners. 
   This interest rate increase will hurt Americans hoping to own their own homes. It will decrease the number of Americans who can own their own homes and have that as their savings vehicle. It will hurt small businesses and manufacturing. My farmers, who are already hurting enough and who have to borrow every year to get their crops in, they are going to get hit again. Everyone will be hurt one way or another. Some will feel it more profoundly than others. The prime rate is moving up today from 8.5 percent to 8.75 percent. That means the real interest rate, not the nominal but the real interest rate, adjusted to inflation, is close to 6.55 percent. 
   Again, it is the real interest rate that you feel, not the nominal. For example, if interest rates were at, say, 10 percent, and inflation were at 8 percent, the real rate of interest would be 2 percent. If, however, interest rates are 8.75 percent, and inflation is only 2.2 percent, your real rate of interest is 6.55 percent. That hurts you more. 
   When our economy was flourishing in the 1960s with the highest growth rates we ever had, our real prime rates ran around 2 percent to 3 percent. In other words, the real interest rates were 2 to 3 percent. Today it is about 6.55 percent. Think about that. 
   Hopefully, the Fed will not be continuing this process because this hurts people, and there is no reason for it. That is really the essence of my remarks today. Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board seemed to think they needed to make a preemptive strike on inflation before we see clear signs of inflation out there. This view, if aggressively acted upon, would place an absolute cap on our economy's ability to grow. It would destroy much of our potential for growth. That is a tragedy. 
   Back in 1996, I opposed the renomination of Mr. Greenspan along with a number of my colleagues--a small  number. I said at the time, and I say again today, I have no personal animus toward Mr. Greenspan. I agree with those who said he has had a distinguished career in public service. I think he is a bright individual. Like I say, I have only met him, as I can remember, once in my entire lifetime, so I have no personal animosity toward him. I think he is an honorable individual, exceptionally smart--bright. 
   I did have one thing someone brought to my attention at one time. They said back in his youth he was a follower of Ayn Rand, and was with some little group with Ayn Rand in New York City. I said: Don't hold that against him. I said: If you can't test way-out theories, far-out kinds of philosophies when you are young, when are you ever going to test them? I assume Mr. Greenspan has moved on from his youthful days of following that way-out philosophy of Ayn Rand's and is now more mainstream and more centrist than that. But like I say, that is fine. I don't mind what people do in their youth. That is the time to test theories and philosophies, when you are young. 
   As the Senator from North Dakota said, I have no personal animosity toward Mr. Greenspan. I just have a problem with what I believe the philosophy is at the Fed. I don't think it just applies to Mr. Greenspan, It applies to a lot of people at the Federal Reserve Board. 
   In 1996, I opposed the renomination because I feared that he, along with others, had a history of jumping to raise interest rates and to choke off economic growth too soon, blocking the economy from growing at its potential and keeping millions of modest-income, middle-income Americans from benefiting from their hard work. 
   A former Chairman of the Fed, William McChesney Martin, once said it was the Fed's job to remove the punch bowl at the party. At some point that should be done. But doing it too early kills our chance for growth, for jobs. It effectively kills any chance for the maximum number of Americans to climb the ladder of opportunity. 
   Prior to 1996, Mr. Greenspan showed very little concern in that regard. He was focused on the possibility of accelerating inflation. He had, in the past, I believe--and again I say he and the others on the Fed--had damaged the economy by moving too quickly to raise rates and choking off our growth potential. 
   For some time, a lot of economists, not all but a lot of economists took the view that NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, was 5 1/2 or 6 percent; in other words, that if unemployment went below 5 1/2 or 6 percent for a period of time, then inflation would take off. Once it started to accelerate, it would be very hard to stop. So that view was once unemployment got down to that level for a period of time, one had to raise interest rates and stop unemployment from being too low. 
   At the same time, the orthodox view among a lot of economists about how fast could the economy grow over the long term was about 2.3 percent; somewhere between 2 and 2.5 percent. 
   I must again be very frank. That was the administration's estimate of the economy's potential for sustainable growth. That was in President Clinton's budget's economic assumptions for FY 97 and I opposed that. I said to the President and his economic advisers at the time: That is nonsense. You are following some of these economists who do not understand the new economy that is out there. They do not understand the new rate of productivity growth and what is causing it. They are still looking back. They are back in the eighties and not in the 1990s. 
   So it was not just the Fed at that time, it was also the administration of President Clinton and the CBO. 
   They saw it as a simple calculation. You take the increased expected productivity of the economy, estimated at 1.2 percent--again, very low--add the increase to the labor pool--about 1.1 percent--and you get a 2.3-percent rate of growth. 
   Again, they said if economic growth exceeded 2.3 percent over time, or if unemployment fell below 6 percent, the alarm bells would have to go off. It was prudent to raise interest rates or we would be on the perilous path of accelerating inflation. 
   So in 1996, viewing that, I feared we would never get a chance to see what our economy was really capable of doing. That is why I opposed the renomination of Mr. Greenspan in 1996. I suggested in 1996, that the supporters of NAIRU were wrong, that it was an outdated concept. I said at the time we could have unemployment at 4.5 percent or less, and I said it was possible because of increased productivity due to the new technologies, because of the greater integration of the world economy, the new marketing techniques that are taking place in America and that NAIRU was wrong and ought to be thrown out the window. 
   I suggested in 1996 that we ought to give our economy a chance to do better or we would limit our economic growth and limit the ability of average Americans to see their incomes rise. 
   Mr. Greenspan indicated that he would not raise rates simply because of the NAIRU. That was a good statement, but again we had a history of these preemptive strikes, and I feared we would not let the economy reach its potential. 
   I believed Mr. Greenspan would be quick to see the specter of inflation behind some little statistic. I am here to say fortunately I was wrong about that. Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have allowed the economy to grow. Part of the reason was particular situations, such as the crash of the Asian economies, but I believe there was a willingness to let the economy grow and a new attitude that there were some new things happening in the economy. 
   I read a speech Mr. Greenspan gave in which he mused about the increase in productivity and how it did not seem to have any end, the use of computers and how they helped to control inventories. Quite frankly, there seemed to be a shift then at the Fed at that time. 
   The results have been very impressive. Gross domestic product has been increasing at an average rate of about 4.3 percent since Greenspan was last confirmed. Unemployment has gone down by over a percentage point. The portion of our population over 16 in the workforce is at or near a record high. Unemployment for minorities, teenagers, traditionally hard-to-employ groups are at record lows. Incomes for those at the middle are rising--not as much as I would like--and, to some extent, those at the bottom are rising. 
   What has happened is unemployment fell below 6 percent and inflation did not take off; economic growth was near 3 percent and inflation did not take off. And then unemployment came down to 5.5 percent and nothing happened. Then unemployment went below 4.5 percent. It has been under 4.5 percent for almost 2 years now. No inflation. We are seeing our GDP increase at over 4 percent on average per year, almost twice what people were saying a feasible sustainable rate of growth of 2.3 percent and there is no inflation and productivity continues to increase. 
   That was in the initial years. Then starting last year Mr. Greenspan seems to have shifted his view. The concern was not NAIRU. It was irrational exuberance in the stock market. Therefore, we had to put interest rates back up. Last year, there were three ticks up. Today there was another tick up; bringing us to a 1-percent increase in 1 year. It almost seems as Fed are looking for something out there. If it is not NAIRU, which has been discarded, then it is something else out there as to why we have to raise interest rates. There is something else out there lurking that is going to cause inflation to happen. 
   Is it irrational exuberance in the stock market. What this is going to mean is that, quite frankly, we are going to have more ticks up in the interest rate, enough till we see the rate of unemployment start to rise again. 
   I believe that would be a tragic mistake. People need to be employed. We still have people out there who need job training and skill upgrading. Can unemployment stay this low without causing accelerating inflation? Absolutely. The common wisdom is that we have a pool of low-skill workers still to be tapped. All they need is job training and skill upgrading, but they are there. 
   Robert Lerman, in an October 26, 1998, Washington Post article said:  
   Differences between the groups entering and leaving the workforce explains the surprisingly high qualifications of newly employed adults. Older workers without a high school degree are retiring, replaced by younger, better educated workers. In the past 6 years, the population of college graduates aged 25 and over increased by about 20  percent, well above the 7 percent growth in total adult population. Meanwhile, the population of high school dropouts declined by nearly 3 million.  
   We are getting that higher skilled workforce, and they are more productive. The economy is also attracting people who were not considering work to come back into the work force. 
   The job market has been tight in most places. In Iowa, we have a low rate of unemployment, about 2.2 percent, and that is good. Are wages skyrocketing in Iowa because we have low 
   unemployment? No. Are they rising modestly? Yes, and they should. With this booming economy and 4-percent growth in our GDP, wages ought to be going up. 
   As an aside, I find it more than passing strange that here we are in the second week back this year and we could move through the Banking Committee at almost light speed the renomination of a central banker, Mr. Greenspan, to be head of the Fed, but we cannot do it to raise the minimum wage. We cannot do anything to help low-income people get a better share of the economic growth of this country. Gosh, we could sure move fast to help the banking system out, but not to help modest-income Americans. 
   Many economists now come to conclude that NAIRU should not be used to predict a new wave of inflation. Quite frankly, I am happy it is dead. We had this irrational exuberance in the stock market. Now we have a new concept. As I said, if it is not NAIRU, then it is this irrational exuberance. The new concern is the wealth effect. Mr. President, have you heard about the wealth effect? Mr. Greenspan is talking about the wealth effect as a reason we should fear inflation and that we should have some preemptive strike. You have to have something, there has to be something out there. Chairman Volcker had the money supply. Now we have the wealth effect. 
   In a speech at the Economic Club in New York earlier this month, Chairman Greenspan noted the possible negative impacts of the wealth effect. He said that estimates of the wealth effect on the GDP has hovered around 1 percent of the GDP since late 1996. He then said, in part:  
   ..... the impetus to spending by the wealth effect by its very nature clearly cannot persist indefinitely. In part, it adds to the demand for goods and services before the corresponding increase in output fully materializes. It is, in effect, increased purchasing from future income, financed currently by greater borrowing or reduced accumulation of assets.  
   There are always limits, aren't there? Economists were right not to clamp down on the economy until we see real signs of inflation. The Fed should stick with that view. Today's increase makes me believe the Fed will endanger the economy by not waiting for real signs of inflation, and now the wealth effect has become the latest reason, despite the fact inflation is nowhere in sight, except for the runup in oil prices caused, in large part, by OPEC's setting of limits on oil production. The Fed raising interest rates will have no effect on that. I think everyone agrees with that. 
   This wealth effect is estimated by some to add about 4 cents in extra spending per dollar of increased wealth. A prominent study by senior vice president Charles Steindel and economist Sydney Ludvigson, both with the New York Fed, concluded the wealth effect was likely to be between 3 and 4 cents per dollar in annual consumption. They also said it is impossible to predict how quickly the wealth effect will kick in. It can take years for consumer spending to reach a permanently higher level. They said:  
   Forecasts of future consumption growth are not typically improved by taking changes in existing wealth into account.  
   So I guess what I am saying is the wealth effect--just like NAIRU, should not be the reason for raising interest rates, simply because of the fear that it will cause an inevitable cascade of economic effects leading to accelerating inflation. 
   As the Senator from North Dakota said earlier, I believe if the Fed wants a more targeted instrument to more carefully check some of the excesses in the stock market, they should look at margin requirements for buying stock on credit. But raising the interest rates is not going to do it without great harm to the economy as a whole. 
   So quite frankly, again, we see no signs of higher inflation. We have had inflation down from 3.3 percent in 1996 to 1.7 percent in 1997, and 1.6 percent in 1998, and in 1999 it jumped to 2.7 percent. 
   Is that a problem? It sounds like a problem until we take out food and energy. Without food and energy, the core inflation rate continues to improve on a December-to-December basis. In 1996 it was 2.6 percent, in 1997 it was 2.2 percent, in 1998 it was 2.4 percent, and in 1999 it dropped to 1.9 percent--when you take out food and energy. 
   So inflation is going down. Inflation is dropping. And the Fed is raising interest rates. Please, will some economist tell us what is going on here? 
   Again, inflation took a jump in December two-tenths of a percent. But, again, without food and energy. And energy--that was the culprit, not food--energy prices shot up 1.4 percent that month. Raising the interest rate is not going to cure that. I do not know of anyone who says it will. 
   Petroleum prices move with the OPEC cartel's production, not by the effects of interest rate increases. I will repeat that. We all understand petroleum prices move with the OPEC cartel's production and not by the effects of interest rate increases. 
   So again, I repeat, last year inflation actually went down on a December-to-December basis. Yet we had three increases in interest rates last year and another increase just today. 
   Why? What is happening out there? This is hitting our farmers. It is hitting our working families. It may not be hitting Senators and Congressmen making 130-some thousand dollars a year. It is not hitting people making money in the stock market. We have our share of megamillionaires in this body. It is not hurting us, not hurting them. 
   But you go out and talk to that husband and wife who are both working jobs, and they have a couple of kids at home, and they are making $40,000 a year, and they are trying to pay a mortgage on a house, trying to keep a car--maybe two cars; they need two for both of them with their jobs--and keeping their kids in clothes. This is a tax on them. 
   We have no signs of accelerating inflation. I believe we are going down the wrong path in raising interest rates. 
   I basically believe we ought to have the lowest possible reasonable interest rates at all times, and only when we see clear signs of inflation should we then begin the process of ratcheting up interest rates. We have had a period of quality growth and we should be doing all that we can to sustain it. 
   Again, I have a lot more I could say about this and what we ought to be doing. What we should be doing is keeping interest rates low. We ought to be taking the surpluses we have, not using them for a tax cut, which, again, would be the wrong thing to do at this time. That would do more to stimulate inflation than anything, having some tax cut that is going to stimulate and fuel even more demand out there. 
   What we ought to be doing is using the surplus we have now to buy down the national debt. This is where I do agree with Mr. Greenspan: Buy down the national debt. He is right in that regard. I do agree with him on that. 
   But we also need to use some of the surplus to invest in our 
   children's education so they can partake of the new economies as they grow older. Every child in grade school today ought to have access to computers and to the Internet. Every teacher who teaches in grade school today ought to be fully trained in teaching the new kinds of skills using the new technologies. 
   We need to reeducate those already in our workforce with job training. We need to upgrade our infrastructure. There are $100 billion in needed repairs in our schools in America. I understand the President's budget was going to have $1.3 billion for that. 
   We need to improve our infrastructure. We need to improve our transportation infrastructure in this country. These are the things we ought to be doing. This would help to keep our GDP high, keep our workforce employed, keep unemployment low, and keep inflation down. It would not be a tax on working Americans like raising the interest rates that the Fed is doing right now. 
   Productivity is good. Productivity is increasing. We hope it will get back to  where it was in the 1960s. Long term high productivity. A lot of people think we are more productive today than in the 1960s. From 1960 to 1970, our productivity increased by 31.8 percent. From 1990 to the year 2000, it increased 21 percent, although we are doing a lot better in the last half of the 90s. So we have a ways to go before we are as productive as in the 1960s. But I believe that will happen in the next decade if we have reasonable policies. In the next decade, I believe our productivity will continue at a high level and further increase and will closely approximate what we had in the 1960s. 
   I was chastised back in 1996 when I opposed the Greenspan nomination. I was on a couple talk shows, and people asked: What do you think the growth rate could be, the sustained growth rate? I said: At least 3.5 percent, 3 to 3.5 percent without any problem. I got hit by a few economists who said: Oh, HARKIN is way out on that one. 
   Since 1996 we have had--what?--4 percent and no inflation. So even I--as optimistic as I am about the American economy and the ability of our workforce--was a little underestimating the real rate of growth we could have. 
   I am just saying, in the next 10 years we can still maintain a 3- to 4-percent growth rate. I believe we can maintain an honest average of over a 3-percent growth in the next decade. It is not going to happen if this Federal Reserve continues to raise these interest rates. They are going to choke it off. And they are going to choke it off for no good reason whatsoever. 
   We can improve the quality of the lives of Americans, and we can invest in our future, and we can buy down the national debt. We can do all those wonderful things. But if the Fed persists in raising interest rates, it is going to choke off our rate of growth. All of the good we do here--in terms of keeping a surplus, in getting rid of the national debt, of investing in young people and in education--all that will be for naught because our rate of growth will be choked off. 
   When that rate of growth is choked off, unemployment is going to go up. 
   The Fed talks about a soft landing. If you are flying well and the airplane is working and you have a lot of fuel and the sky is clear, why are you worried about a landing? Why are they talking about a landing? This economy, I believe, can grow at a 3-percent plus rate for the next decade. We will have a landing all right. If they keep raising interest rates, we will have a landing. 
   Let me close by saying I think there is a reverse side to the wealth effect. I coin the term the ``poor effect.'' Some economists believe that shrinking wealth has an even bigger effect on spending than growing wealth. If we push the economy into a dive, we will experience the poor effect again. Economist Mark Zandi suggests that declining wealth reduces spending by about 7 cents per dollar of wealth lost. So if the wealth effect is 3 to 4 cents a dollar, declining wealth reduces spending by 7 cents per dollar, almost twice as much. So any danger that is out there of accelerating inflation must be weighed against the possible result of slowing the economy and what I call the poor effect, not the wealth effect but the poor effect. 
   Rural Iowa, my State, experienced the poor effect in a deep agricultural recession in the mid-1980s. The value of land fell by more than 50 percent as our rural economy crumbled. I saw grown friends of mine cry in public, farmers lose their lands, and some of them took their own lives. Families fell apart; couples divorced. The economy of rural Iowa shrunk. Let's not jump too quickly to use the club of higher interest rates. 
   The Federal Reserve has two mandates in law. The Federal Reserve is not a creature of the Constitution of the United States. You won't find it in the Constitution anywhere. It is a creature of Congress. We legislatively created it. We gave it two mandates: to balance concerns about inflation on the one hand and to stimulate full employment on the other. Those goals were placed in the law in 1978. 
   Prior to 1978, there was no specific mention of inflation at all in the law. It was not in any of the laws about the Fed going all the way back to its founding in 1913. By the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the Congress, in the exercise of its constitutional power, said to the Fed: You have two functions now: check inflation and stimulate full employment. That law we passed in 1978 set a goal of 4-percent unemployment for those 16 and older, 3 percent for those over 19. We are near 4 percent now. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, conservative economists laughed at those goals. They said they were ridiculous targets set by politicians. That is the law of the land, and it sure doesn't look so silly now. 
   I worry that the Fed has a hard time maintaining a balance between inflation and full employment concerns. They are only focused on the specter of inflation, and there is no inflation out there. As I said, new advances in our technology, in our computers, designing products at high speed, the rapid replacement of parts, tight controls on inventories at lower cost, reduces the inventory buildup, one of the classic causes of past recessions. Communications costs are dropping like a rock. Every day I get something in the mail that I can make long-distance calls cheaper than I did the day before. Now you can get computers individually tailored for retail customers under $1,000 from Gateway Computer. Amazing, a world economy, capital flowing around the world. 
   I know others want to speak. I see my good friend from Minnesota, who has been a great leader on this in the past, on the floor. I know he wants to speak. I took this time because, as I said, I don't want anyone to mistake that I have some personal animosity toward Mr. Greenspan. That is not so. I do have very deep-seated questions about the direction of the Fed, the fact they are raising interest rates without any inflation, and they are 
   going to choke off this great growth we are having in this country with a series of interest rate increases. They are going to push up unemployment. 
   I will yield the floor with the final statement that we need to open up the Federal Reserve System's meetings. I don't want to make them political. It should not be political. We need to know why they are making the decisions they make. The decision they make on raising interest rates taxes every working American. How would they feel if we debated tax policy behind closed doors? I don't want to make it political, but I think it ought to be open. Secondly, I believe the Fed should pay more attention to unemployment and to growth and not just get so fixated on some specter of inflation that is not even out there. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague and friend from Wisconsin for yielding time to me but, more importantly, for his strong and continued leadership on this issue of East Timor. 
   As we all know, East Timor is a small, new nation in a faraway place. A lot of times we tend to forget about it and push it off to the side. But we can't. We can't forget about what happened in East Timor. I think it is incumbent upon us, as the leader of the world's democracies and as the nation that holds out to oppressed peoples all over the world the ideals of self-determination and democratic institutions, because we are in that position, that we have to take a leadership position among world communities, focusing and keeping our attention focused on East Timor. 
   These brave people for almost 25 years have continued their struggle--peacefully, I might add--for their own right to self-determination. When the Portuguese left in 1975, of course, Indonesia annexed East Timor. The East Timorese people had no say in that whatsoever. Yet they continued a worldwide campaign for their right to self-determination. 
   What didn't they do? What didn't the East Timorese people do? They didn't plant any bombs. They didn't sabotage anything. They didn't blow up airliners. They didn't commit acts of terrorism against the Indonesia Government or the Indonesia people, but forcefully, day after day and year after year, they went to the world community and pricked our conscience. They went to the U.N. They came here. They  went to Europe. There was no accident that Bishop Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta both won the Nobel Peace Prize for their activities because they pursued their right to self-determination as Gandhi or Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., would have done, in a peaceful, nonterrorist way. When they finally had this vote late last summer, they voted overwhelmingly for separation, to have their own nation. 
   Senator REED and I, along with Congressman MCGOVERN from Massachusetts, were there right before the vote about a week before. We traveled extensively around the country. You could already see the militias and what they were trying to do and the intimidation. It was after that trip that the three of us had conversations with our Secretary of State, with Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Secretary Cohen, our Secretary of Defense, and people at the White House. We talked to everyone, saying: Look. We need to have things in place there. There is going to be a blood bath. We hope there isn't. But our sense is that everything we had ever seen before in our lives, in our history--you could almost smell it. You could almost sense what was going to happen in East Timor. A powder keg was ready to go. 
   We met with General Anwar. We went back to Indonesia, and we told President Habibie at the time: If your orders are right, there should be a peaceful transition and a peaceful election. This General Anwar is not carrying out your orders. He is either not carrying out your orders or you are not giving the right orders. But something is not adding up here. The same with General Wiranto, the head of the armed services.

   Mr. HARKIN. I give the Indonesians credit. 
   The article says that this new government commission ``..... named six top generals--including Gen. Wiranto ..... and General Anwar for possible criminal prosecution'' and that the ``militia'' with their ``surrogates carried out an orchestrated campaign of mass killing, torture, forced deportation, rape and sexual slavery in East Timor.''   
   The East Timorese resistance leader and Nobel laureate, Jose Ramos-Horta, said in Singapore that Wiranto should be tried and not just removed from the cabinet. ``In this day and age, you cannot kill hundreds of people, destroy a whole country, and then just get fired.''  
   These are crimes against humanity. 
   I wholeheartedly commend the present Government of Indonesia and its human rights commission for their bravery in doing this investigation and coming up with this finding. I think it moves the democratic forces far ahead in Indonesia because they were able to come out with this finding. 
   I am very supportive of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. We have to make some statements about East Timor. We have to be in the lead on this, and the fact that the human rights commission of the present Government in Indonesia made these findings ought to give us comfort that we are not undermining the Government of Indonesia in helping the East Timorese. 
   I was not privileged to go back with Senator REED when he went there in December. I talked to him. Senator REED said:  
   You would not believe the places we were, that we saw with our own eyes. They were leveled. Buildings were burnt. Some of the church houses were burned down and people just disappeared, all driven across the border. We were up in this one town on the border. He said it was like a ghost town. All of these people were forcefully deported into West Timor, and even yet today they are not letting these people come home.  
   I think the focus of world opinion and public opinion and attention has to be again on East Timor. What the Indonesian military did there is unconscionable. I don't blame the Indonesian people. I talked to too many Indonesians who were opposed to what their military was doing in East Timor, who thought it was a right of the East Timorese, because of their history and their past, to have self-determination. 
   I in no way cast any blame upon the Indonesian people themselves. But I do single out General Wiranto, General Anwar, and the people at the human rights commission who were in charge of aiding, abetting, and fostering the militia that did these terrible things to East Timor--as Senator REED said--vindictively burning down things, destroying telephone lines, destroying bridges, just crazy things such as that, just to leave the country in total waste. 
   Again, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Rhode Island for their strong support of the brave people of East Timor. 
   I hope we in the Senate, if not today, at some point shortly can express our support on this sense-of-the-Senate resolution so the brave people of East Timor and the democratic forces in Indonesia know we will support this and we will do everything we can to help them rebuild this country again as a signal to the rest of the world that we will support peaceful self-determination and the right of people to have their own democratic governments. This is as good a place as any to start. 
   Again, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his strong, continued leadership on this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the two Iowans who led the St. Louis Rams to victory in Sunday's Super Bowl. Quarterback Kurt Warner, a native of Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Offensive Lineman Adam Timmerman, a native of Cherokee, Iowa. It is a bittersweet irony that a third Iowa native, injured Quarterback Trent Green, couldn't play this season and so Kurt Warner stepped in to the position. 
   Nobody--I mean nobody--could have predicted that Kurt Warner would be holding the Super Bowl trophy under the Georgia Dome last Sunday. Not Kurt Warner who was stocking the shelves of the Hy-Vee Market in Cedar Falls, Iowa a few years ago. Not Kurt Warner who was bypassed by the NFL draft out of college and went straight to the Iowa Barnstormers and then the Amsterdam Admirals. And certainly not the Kurt Warner who warmed the bench at the University of Northern Iowa. 
   This is a true American success story. An Iowa boy comes from the bench to Super Bowl 2000 where he sets a Super Bowl record for passing yards--414 yards in all, topping Joe Montana's 1989 Super Bowl record of 357 yards. It doesn't get much better than that! 
   And Kurt Warner had help from another Iowa boy, Adam Timmerman, the Rams offensive lineman, a native of Cherokee, Iowa. Timmerman and the Rams offensive line held the Titans to one sack in the entire game, allowing Warner time to complete the passes that won him his Super Bowl record. 
   You know, I am sure many of you have heard me talk about the ladder of opportunity, about leaving the ladder down so others can climb up. Well, Kurt Warner built his own ladder of opportunity, sticking with it at every turn, persevering against odds that would sink a weaker man. It is great to see him at the top. 
   Iowa is proud of its native sons and daughters. For the past several months, Iowa has been in the public eye because of the caucuses. And now that the Iowa caucuses are behind us, Iowans are proud to share the spotlight with homegrown heroes Kurt Warner and Adam Timmerman. I know we all wish Kurt and Adam good luck in this Sunday's Pro Bowl in Honolulu.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my Senate colleagues in recognizing January as National Biotechnology Month. At the dawn of this new century, it is fitting for us to recognize the promise and potential of biotechnology. 
   With the mapping of the human genome, we are on the brink of critical advances in health care and medical discovery. These advances can become new cures and new treatments, new industrial products, and improved agricultural products. Biotechnology is changing medical practice from the way diseases are diagnosed to the way they are treated. By helping us to understand life at the molecular level, biotechnology can help eliminate the guesswork of disease management and treatment. 
   Biotechnology researchers have already made dramatic strides in confronting some of our most devastating and tragic diseases, from cancer to multiple sclerosis to Alzheimers. Recent breakthroughs in human embryonic stem cell research have given us cause to predict cures for diseases such as Parkinsons, juvenile diabetes and spinal cord injury. 
   As Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations subcommittee, I have been a long-time advocate for health research. Last year, ARLEN SPECTER and I took the lead in providing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a $2.3 billion increase, the largest in NIH history, bringing the agency's overall budget to $17.9 billion. This year, we plan to introduce a resolution calling for a $2.7 billion increase--keeping our commitment to double NIH funding over five years. 
   NIH provides funding for the basic science that underpins the important research and development done by the biotechnology industry. This strong public-private partnership has made our country the world leader in the area of biotechnology innovation. There are approximately 1300 biotech companies in the United States, employing more than 150,000 people. In my own state of Iowa, we have approximately 180 companies, with more than  10,000 employees. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved 22 biotechnology drugs, vaccines and new indications for existing medicines. We currently have more than 90 biotech drugs and vaccines on the U.S. market. And I know this is only the beginning. 
   In addition to its medical applications, biotechnology offers many exciting possibilities in the field of agriculture as well. Through biotechnology scientists are already developing new varieties and strains of plants and animals that will help to solve myriad problems and challenges relating to agriculture. The results of advances in agricultural biotechnology, impressive as they already are, represent merely the infancy of this promising scientific field. 
   The fact that over 800 million of our fellow citizens on this planet suffer from hunger or undernourishment points to the tremendous challenge we face to produce enough food for an ever growing population. As it has in the past, biotechnology will contribute tremendously to meeting that challenge, through increased yields and production, improved productive efficiency and enhanced suitability for difficult environments. Developing new plant varieties that are more tolerant of drought or soil salinity would help to increase food production in areas of the world where people are now going hungry. 
   Biotechnology also promises to help solve environmental challenges in agriculture. For example, plants that are inherently resistant to diseases or insects reduce the amount of pesticides that would otherwise be applied and enter the environment. Biotechnology can also help to reduce the amount of tillage that is needed, thereby reducing energy consumption and soil erosion. 
   Thus far biotechnology has been applied for the most part at the level of the farm, and has not been perceived by consumers as directly benefitting them to a significant degree. That is about to change. We are already seeing the development of new strains of plants that have specific traits to improve the nutritional quality of foods derived from them. Work at Iowa State University, for example, has developed soybeans that produce a soybean oil with lower saturated fat than conventional soybeans. We are not far from having rice that contains Vitamin A, which would alleviate a great deal of human suffering in developing countries. 
   Perhaps the most fascinating area of biotechnology involves the potential for developing new crops and livestock designed to produce a variety of raw materials and substances, likely to be of high value, for use in very specific applications, including medicine. We can produce from plants everything we now rely on petroleum to produce: energy and industrial raw materials for a wide range of products. I believe there will be real economic opportunities for farmers in producing these higher value crops and animals, and for rural communities in processing them. 
   To be sure, if agricultural biotechnology is to meet its potential, we must ensure that all questions about its safety for consumers and for the environment are fully answered. I believe that those questions can and will be answered satisfactorily, using the best sound science available.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague, Senator SPECTER, in the introduction of the ``Stem Cell Research Act of 2000.'' I want to commend Senator SPECTER for having the leadership and foresight to introduce legislation which will broaden federally-funded scientists to pursue stem cell research, under certain, limited conditions. 
   From enabling the development of cell and tissue transplantation, to improving and accelerating pharmaceutical research and development, to increasing our understanding of human development and cancer biology, the potential benefits of stem cell research are truly awe-inspiring. 
   Stem cells hold hope for countless patients through potentially lifesaving therapies for Parkinson's, Alzheimers, stroke, heart disease and diabetes. Also exciting is the possibility that researchers may be able to alter stem cells genetically so they would avoid attack by the patient's immune system. 
   But all of these potential benefits could be delayed or even denied to patients without a healthy partnership between the private sector and the federal government. 
   While market interest in stem cell technology is strong, and private companies will continue to fund this research, the government has an important role to play in supporting the basic and applied science that underpins these technologies. The problem is that early, basic science is always going to be underfunded by the private sector because this type of research does not get products onto the market quickly enough. The only way to ensure that this research is conducted is to allow the NIH to support it. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services ruled last year that under the current ban on human embryo research, federally-funded scientists can conduct stem cell research if they use cell lines derived from private sources. This is a positive step forward, but it continues to handicap our researchers in the pursuit of cures and therapies that will help our citizens, 
   Last fall, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) released its final report, ``Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research.'' The Commission concluded that stem cell research should be allowed to go forward with federal support, as long as researchers were limited to only two sources of stem cells: fetal tissue and embryos resulting from infertility treatments. And they recommended that federal support be contingent on an open system of oversight and review. 
   NBAC also arrived at the important conclusion that it is ethically acceptable for the federal government to finance research that both derives cell lines from embryos and that uses those cell lines. Their report states, ``Relying on cell lines that might be derived exclusively by a subset of privately funded researchers who are interested in  this area could severely limit scientific and clinical progress.'' 
   The Commission goes on to say that ``scientists who conduct basic research and are interested in fundamental cellular processes are likely to make elemental discoveries about the nature of ES [embryonic stem] cells as they derive them in the laboratory.'' 
   NBAC's report presents reasonable guidelines for federal policy. Our bill bans human embryo research, but allows federally-funded scientists to derive human pluripotent stem cells from human embryos if those embryos are obtained from IVF clinics, if the donor has provided informed consent and the embryo was no longer needed for fertility treatments. The American Society of Cell Biology estimates that 100,000 human embryos are currently frozen in IVF clinics, in excess of their clinical need. 
   In addition, our language requires HHS and NIH to develop procedural and ethical guidelines to make sure that stem cell research is conducted in an ethical, sound manner. As it stands today, stem cell research in the private sector is not subject to federal monitoring or ethical requirements. 
   Stem cell research holds such hope, such potential for millions of Americans who are sick and in pain, it is morally wrong for us to prevent or delay our world-class scientists from building on the progress that has been made. 
   As long as this research is conducted in an ethically validated manner, it should be allowed to go forward, and it should receive federal support. That is why Senator SPECTER and I have joined together on legislation that will allow our nation's top scientists to pursue critical cures and therapies for the diseases and chronic conditions which strike too many Americans. I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support H.R. 3373, providing for the minting of a Leif Ericson Millennium Commemorative dollar coin. This bipartisan legislation would authorize the U.S. Mint to issue a coin jointly with the Icelandic National Bank in commemoration of Leif Ericson and his voyage and exploration of North America. The part of the measure concerning Leif Ericson is identical to S. 1710 that Senator GRAMS and I introduced which has the support of 74 Senators. The House bill was introduced by Congressman JIM LEACH of my home state of Iowa who has worked hard toward the passage of this measure. I want to commend him for his good work. 
   The famous Viking explorer is regarded as the first European to set foot on North American soil in the year 1000 AD. In a time of sea voyages and land exploration, perhaps the most recognized Viking in history is Leif Ericson. Ericson's determination, nobility and spirit of exploration are demonstrated in his Voyage of Discovery. Next year marks the 1000th anniversary of Leif Ericson's Voyage of Discovery and this coin will commemorate this landmark event in North American history. 
   Leif Ericson, son of Eric the Red, was born in Iceland in the mid 900's AD. There he learned about reading and writing runes, the Celtic and Russian tongue and the ways of trade. Ericson was also taught the old sagas, plant studies and the use of weapons. As a young boy, Ericson and his friends would spend time watching ships coming in and out of the harbor and dream about someday going on voyage of their own. Ericson grew to be a large and imposing man, one known for his far judgment and honesty. Having his father's adventurous hand, Ericson had a strong urge to travel and explore. 
   Ericson was able to do some traveling between Iceland and Greenland, but his major Voyage of Discovery did not occur until 1000 AD, when explorer Bjarni Herj&#243;lfsson relayed exciting news of a new land that he had seen when he lost his course in the fog. Ericson bought Herj&#243;lfsson's ship, gathered a crew of 35, and sailed westward. Unlike today, Ericson's voyages on the sea were without many modern conveniences. He did not travel by a motor-powered ship, nor have any of today's advanced technological navigational tools. Instead, Ericson and his small crew used the wind and tides as their primary source of motive power, relying on the weather as the engine for his vessel. His Viking ship did not do too well against hard winds with their single sails, but fortunately, fair weather allowed Ericson to navigate 600 miles west up the western coast. Soon he was following the outlines of the new lands he had heard of. 
   The first island Ericson landed on was among glaciers and seemed to be one huge slab of rock. Because of this he named it Helluland (Slab Land or Flat Rock Land), which is now believed to be Baffin Island. Ericson then sailed south and found another land that was flat with white beaches and some trees. He named this land Markland (Woodland) which today is believed to be Labrador on the eastern coast of Canada. 
   Finally, Ericson sailed southeast for two days and came to an island with a mainland. On this land the Viking explorer and his crew came upon an abundance of grapes as well as vegetation. 
   they had never seen before. They also were astounded by the size of fish and other animal life they saw while exploring this land. Ericson and his crew settled in for the winter, but the winter here was very peculiar. No frost came to the grasses. They also noticed that the days and nights were of more equal length here. When spring came and the men were ready to go, Ericson gave this land the name Vinland, which either means Wineland or Pastureland. Vinland is believed to be today's L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland and archaeological findings of this winter camp seem to confirm this belief. 
   Ericson's Voyage of Discovery is a significant event in North American history and symbolizes a long relationship between the U.S. and Iceland. The Government of Iceland is an important North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally and this action would reiterate our strong relationship with and support for their nation. Iceland votes with the United States on virtually all United Nations and NATO issues and has formulated foreign policies parallel to ours. They also are cutting costs at our military base in Keflavi. Iceland has refrained from whaling, encouraged more U.S. trade and investment and initiated a partnership with the state  of Alaska. The Government of Iceland has already approved a silver 1000 Kroner Icelandic coin to be produced by the U.S. Mint that will be packaged and issued simultaneously with the U.S. Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin. We believe jointly issuing these coins will help further relations between our nations. 
   The United States Congress strengthened U.S.-Icelandic relations in 1930 by presenting a statue of Leif Ericson as a gift to Iceland memorializing Ericson's Voyage of Discovery. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson made October 9 ``Leif Ericson Day'' in commemoration of the famous Viking explorer. The Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin in the year 2000 would commemorate the millennial anniversary of Ericson's voyage and would display our commitment to continuing this relationship for the coming millennium. 
   H.R. 3373 allows a simultaneous issuance of a commemorative U.S. silver dollar coin and a silver 1000 Kroner Icelandic coin. Both coins are to be produced in limited mintages, with U.S. Mint issuing a boxed set. Mint and surcharge proceeds from the coins will fund scholarships and student exchange programs between Iceland and United States. The U.S. Mint has read and approved the identical House version as meeting all the guidelines contained in the 1995 Congressional House Banking Committee Commemorative Coin Reforms Act, which protects the taxpayer from any costs. We feel such a coin is an important step in recognizing the important role Iceland has played in North American history. H.R. 3373 also provides for a Lewis and Clark Expedition Commemorative Coin which I strongly support and a Capitol Visitor Center Commemorative Coin.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member on the committee. I rise in strong support of the Work Incentives Improvement Act. I really want to commend my two colleagues, Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont and Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts, for their excellent work in getting this very important piece of legislation through. I want to also thank the members of the Finance Committee--in particular, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN--for their hard work on this legislation. 
   For people with disabilities all over this country, this is truly an incredible day. Congress is continuing to fulfill the promise we made to people with disabilities 9 years ago when we passed the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990. When we passed the ADA, they told Americans with disabilities that the door to equal opportunity was finally open. And the ADA has opened doors of opportunity--plenty of them. Americans with disabilities now expect to be treated as full citizens, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. 
   But our work is not finished. Far too many people with disabilities who want to work are unemployed. One of the main reasons they are unemployed is, under the current system, people have to choose between a job and health care. I could not put it any better than a constituent of mine, a young woman by the name of Phoebe Ball. Phoebe just graduated from the University of Iowa. She was shocked when they found that if she took an entry-level job paying $18,000 a year, she would suffer a huge loss--her health insurance. 
   So Phoebe wrote an article for the newspaper. I will read part of it:  
   I want off SSI desperately ..... I want to work. I want to know that I have earned the money I have ..... 
   My parents and my society made a promise to me. They promised me that I can live with this disability, and I can ..... What is limiting me right now is not this wheelchair, and it's not this limb that's missing. It's a system that says if I can work at all, then I'm undeserving of any assistance, I'm undeserving of the basic medical care that I need to stay alive. 
   ..... What is needed is a government that understands its responsibility to its citizens ..... then we'll see what we are capable of, then we'll be working and proving the worth of the Americans With Disabilities Act.  
   I could not say it any better than Phoebe just did. The Work Incentives Improvement Act is a comprehensive bill that will be the answer to Phoebe Ball's dilemma. If only 1 percent--or 75,000--of the 7.5 million people with disabilities, such as Phoebe, who are now on benefits were to become employed, Federal savings would total $3.5 billion over the work life of these beneficiaries. That not only makes economic sense, it contributes to preserving the Social Security trust fund. 
   The disability community across this country and Members from both sides of the aisle have wholeheartedly endorsed this bill. Rarely do we see such broad bipartisan support. But that is because on this particular issue it is easy to 
   agree--people with disabilities should continue to move toward greater and greater independence. 
   In that spirit, Senator SPECTER and I introduced the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act earlier this week. Its shorthand name is MCASSA. This bill will build on what we are doing today with the Work Incentives Improvement Act. Ten years after the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, next year, we are still facing the situation where our current long-term care program favors putting people into institutions. 
   A person has a right to the most expensive form of care--a nursing home bed--because nursing home care is an entitlement. But if that same person with a disability wants to live in the community, he or she is going to have to face a lack of available services because community services are optional under Medicaid. Nursing home is a mandatory entitlement, but if you want to live in the community, that is optional. Well, the purpose of our bill is to level the playing field and give people with disabilities a real choice. 
   Our bill would allow any person entitled to medical assistance who would  go to a nursing facility to use the money for community attendant services and support. In shorthand, what our bill says is: Let the Federal money follow the person and not the program. If that person wants to use that money for community-based services and attendant services, that person with a disability ought to be able to use the money that way. If they want to use the money for a nursing home, leave it up to the individual; we should not be dictating where they ought to live and how they ought to live. As is the work incentives bill, MCASSA is rooted in the promise of ADA--equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for all. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I thank the President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. In 1994, the Health Care Financing Administration issued a draft regulation deferring to State law on the issue of physician supervision of certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA's). This action was followed -in 1997 by a proposed HCFA rule deferring to State law on this issue. HCFA's rule has been subject to great scrutiny and numerous studies. Nevertheless, HCFA has to date failed to issue its final rule on the matter, and defer this issue to State law. Would the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee agree with this assessment?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a great day for the critically important search for medical breakthroughs. I am very pleased to say that the omnibus appropriations act contains a record $2.3 billion increase in support for medical research through the National Institutes of Health. We are now well on our way towards our goal of doubling our nation's investment in the search for medical breakthroughs. 
   This increase will directly benefit the health of the American people. It will speed up the day when we have a  cure for cancer and other deadly diseases. 
   On top of that, the Senate has passed S. 1268, the Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act of 1999. This bill cosponsored by Senators FRIST, KENNEDY, CHAFEE, REED of Rhode Island, MACK, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, CLELAND, HELMS, WARNER, SARBANES, SCHUMER, COCHRAN, DURBIN, MOYNIHAN, BOXER, ROBERTS, REID of Nevada, SPECTER, FEINSTEIN, COLLINS, INOUYE and HAGEL. I want to thank my colleagues for cosponsoring this legislation, and for their support in getting it passed. 
   This bill addresses a critical shortfall in our nation's medical research enterprise. I was pleased to work with Senator SPECTER this year to achieve a $2.3 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health. The Conference Agreement of the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, provides $17.9 billion for the NIH. This puts us well on track to double funding for the NIH over the next five years, a target that was agreed to by the Senate, 98-0, in 1997. 
   However, as Congress embarks on this important investment in improved health, we must strengthen the totality of the biomedical research enterprise. While it is critical to focus on high quality, cutting edge basic and clinical research, we must also consider the quality of the laboratories and buildings where that research is being conducted. 
   In fact, Mr. President, the infrastructure of research institutions, including the need for new physical facilities, is central to our nation's leadership in medical research. Despite the significant scientific advances produced by Federally-funded research, most of that research is currently being done in medical facilities built in the 1950's and 1960's, a time when the Federal government obligated from $30 million to $100 million a year for facility and equipment modernization. Since then, however, annual appropriations for modernization of our biomedical research infrastructure have dramatically declined, ranging from zero to $20 million annually over the past decade. 
   I am pleased to report that this year we were able to increase that amount to $75 million in our appropriations bill. While this is an important improvement, much more is needed. As a result, many of our research facilities and laboratories are outdated and inadequate to meet the challenge of the next millennium. 
   In order to realize major medical breakthroughs in Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, cancer and other major illnesses, our nation's top researchers must have top quality, state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment. Unfortunately, the status of our research infrastructure is woefully inadequate. 
   A recent study by the National Science Foundation finds that academic institutions have deferred, due to lack of funds nearly $11.4 billion in repair, renovation, and construction projects. Almost one quarter of all research space requires either major renovation or replacement and 70% of medical schools report having inadequate space in which to perform biomedical research. 
   A separate study by the National Science Foundation documents the laboratory equipment needs for researchers and found that 67 percent of research institutions reported an increased need for laboratory instruments. At the same time, the report found that spending for such instruments at colleges and universities actually declined in the early 1990s. 
   Several other prominent organizations have documented the need for increased funding for research infrastructure. A March 1998 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges stated that ``The government should reestablish and fund a National Institutes of Health construction authority. .....'' A June 1998 report by the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology stated that ``Laboratories must be built and equipped for the science of the 21st century ..... Infrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space as well as new construction, where appropriate.'' 
   As we work to double funding for medical research over the next few years, the already serious shortfall in the modernization of our nation's aging research facilities and labs will continue to worsen unless we take specific action. Future increases in NIH must be matched with increased funding for repair, renovation and construction of research facilities, as well as the purchase of modern laboratory equipment. 
   Mr. President, the bill that passed the Senate today expands federal funding for facilities construction and state-of-the-art laboratory equipment through the NIH by increasing the authorization for this account within the National Center for Research Resources to $250 million in FY 2000 and $500 million in FY 2001. 
   In addition, the bill authorizes a ``Shared Instrumentation Grant Program'' at NIH, to be administered by the Center. The program will provide grants for the purchase of shared-use, state-of-the-art laboratory equipment costing over $100,000. All grants awarded under these two programs will be peer-reviewed, as is the practice with all NIH grants and projects. 
   We are entering a time of great promise in the field of biomedical research. We are on the verge of major breakthroughs which could end the ravages of cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's and the scores of illnesses and conditions which take the lives and health of millions of Americans, But to realize these breakthroughs, we must devote the necessary resources to our nation's research enterprise. 
   I want to thank the Association of American Universities, the Association of American Medical Colleagues and the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology for their support for this legislation. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support of this important health care legislation, and I look forward to working with our colleagues in the House of Representatives next year to ensure this legislation is signed into law. Thank you.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has given its approval to Senate Resolution 134. With passage of this resolution, which I introduced earlier this year with Senators THURMOND and HOLLINGS, the Senate has gone on record to right a wrong perpetrated against one of the greatest American baseball players of all time--Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson. And I want to commend Senators THURMOND and HOLLINGS for their good work on this. 
   ``Shoeless Joe'' has been an inspiration to baseball players and fans for decades. Even the legendary Babe Ruth was said to have copied Jackson's swing. I was touched by Jacksons' story through the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' which recounted his story. The movie was filmed in Dyersville, Iowa. Thousands of Iowans, young and old alike, have come to embrace  ``Shoeless Joe.'' In fact, there is an annual Shoeless Joe Jackson celebration and celebrity baseball game in Dyersville. This year it was attended by a cast of baseball greats, including Bob Feller. 
   Jackson's career statistics and accomplishments throughout his thirteen years in professional baseball clearly earn him a place as one of baseball's all-time greats. 
   His career batting average of .356 is the third highest of all time. In addition, Jackson was one of only seven Major League Baseball players to top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a season. Despite all this, in 1920 ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson was banned from the game of baseball, the gamed he loved. He was banned from Major League baseball for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series, in what has become known as the ``Black Sox'' scandal. 
   While ``Shoeless Joe'' did admit that he received $5,000 from his roommate, Lefty Williams, to participate in the fix, evidence suggests that Jackson did everything in his power to stop the fix from going through. He twice tried to give the money back. He offered to sit out the World Series in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. And, he tried to inform White Sox owner Charles Comiskey of the fix. All of these efforts fell on deaf ears. 
   Perhaps the most convincing evidence of Jackson's withdrawal from the conspiracy was his performance on the field during the series. During the 1919 World Series--which he was accused of conspiring to fix--``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's batting average was .375, the highest of any player from either team. He had twelve hits, a World Series record. He led his team in runs scored and runs batted in. And, he hit the only home run of the series. On defense, Jackson committed no errors and had no questionable plays in thirty chances. 
   When criminal charges were brought against Jackson in trial, the jury found him ``not guilty.'' White Sox owner Charles Comiskey and several sportswriters testified that they say no indication that Jackson did anything to indicate he was trying to throw the series. But, when the issue came before the newly-formed Major League Baseball Commissioner's office, Commissioner Judge Kenesaw ``Mountain'' Landis found Jackson guilty of taking part in the fix, and he was banned for life from playing baseball. The Commissioner's office never conducted an investigation and never held a hearing, thus denying ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson due process. 
   Major League Baseball now has the opportunity to correct a great injustice. I have written to Commissioner Bud Selig urging him to take a new look at this case. I was very pleased when the Commissioner responded to my inquiry by saying he is giving the case a fair and objective review. 
   Restoring ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's eligibility for the Hall of Fame would benefit Major League Baseball, baseball fans, and all Americans who appreciate a sense of fair play. 
   The resolution we passed today states that Major League Baseball should honor Jackson's accomplishments appropriately. I believe Jackson should be inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. 
   If that is to happen, Jackson must first be cleared for consideration by the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee, which will stand as the jury which decides whether Jackson's accomplishments during his playing career are worthy of recognition in the Hall of Fame. 
   Mr. President, we are involved in many important issues. Clearly, this matter will not and should not take up the same amount of time this body devotes to critical issues like health care, education, or national defense. But, restoring the good name and reputation of a single American is important. This resolution has given us the opportunity to right an old wrong. It has given us the opportunity to honor one of the all-time great players of America's pastime, ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson. 
   I thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator DASCHLE today for the introduction of the Access to Medical Treatment Act. This bill will allow greater freedom of choice and increased access in the realm of medical treatments, while preventing abuses of unscrupulous entrepreneurs. The Access to Medical Treatment Act allows individual patients and their properly licensed health care provider to use certain alternative and complementary therapies not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
   Mr. President, we have made several important changes to the legislation from last Congress. 
   We have improved the informed consent protections for patients by modeling them after the NIH's human subject protection regulations. The patient must be fully informed, orally and in writing of: the nature, content and methods of the medical treatment; that the treatment is not approved by the FDA; the anticipated benefits AND risks of the treatment; any reasonably foreseeable side effects that may result; the results of past applications of the treatment by the health care provider and others; the comparable benefits and risks of any available FDA-approved treatment conventionally used for the patient's condition; and any financial interest the provider has in the product. 
   Providers and manufacturers are required to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) any adverse effects, and must immediately cease use and manufacture of the product, pending a CDC investigation. The CDC is required to conduct an investigation of any adverse effects, and if the product is shown to cause any danger to patients, the physician and manufacturers are required to immediately inform all providers who have been using the product of the danger. 
   Our legislation ensures the public's access to reliable information about complementary and alternative therapies by requiring providers and manufacturers to report the results of the use of their product to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH, which is then required to compile and analyze the information for an annual report. 
   In addition, the provider and manufacturer may make no advertising claims regarding the safety and effectiveness of the treatment of therapy, and FDA has the authority to determine that the labeling of the treatment is not false or misleading. 
   Mr. President, this legislation preserves the consumer's freedom to choose alternative therapies while addressing the fundamental concern of protecting patients from dangerous treatments and those who would advocate unsafe and ineffective therapies. 
   It wasn't long ago that William Roentgen was afraid to publish his discovery of X-rays as a diagnostic tool. He knew they would be considered an ``alternative medical practice'' and widely rejected by the medical establishment. As everyone knows, X-rays are a common diagnostic tool today. Well into this century, many scientists resisted basic antiseptic techniques as quackery because they refused to accept the germ theory of disease. I think we can all be thankful the medical profession came around on that one. 
   In addition, the Office of Technology Assessment reported in a 1978 study that only about 25 percent of the practices of mainstream medicine were based on scientific evidence. And there is little evidence that has changed in the past two decades. 
   Today's consumers want alternatives. They want less invasive, less expensive preventive options. Americans want to stay healthy. And they are speaking with their feet and their pocketbooks. Mr. President, Americans spend $30 billion annually on unconventional therapies. According to a recent survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), nearly one-half of Americans use some kind of complementary and alternative medicine. These practices, which range from acupuncture, to chiropractic care, to naturopathic, herbal and homeopathic remedies, are not simply complementary and alternative, but integral to how millions of Americans manage their health and treat their illnesses. 
   This legislation simply provides patients the freedom to use--with strong consumer protections--the complementary and alternative therapies and treatments that have the potential to relieve pain and cure disease. I thank Senator DASCHLE for his leadership on this issue, and urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today as we are debating how to protect Social Security and Medicare while making necessary investments in our nation's future, I am introducing legislation designed to provide some options for reducing spending. In an effort to promote greater fiscal responsibility within the federal government, ``The Fiscal Responsibility Act'' would eliminate special interest tax loopholes, reduce corporate welfare, eliminate unnecessary government programs, reduce wasteful spending, enhance government efficiency and require greater accountability. 
   The reforms contained in this bill would result in savings of up to $20 billion this year and up to $140 billion over the next five years. These savings could be used to pay down the federal debt, shore up Social Security and Medicare, provide middle-class tax relief, and/or pay for needed investment in education, health care and other priorities. 
   While I recognize that everyone won't agree on each of the provisions of this measure, I believe it is important for us to put forward options to be considered. I hope that we can work together on a bipartisan basis to produce a set of reforms such as these to lay a path of fiscal responsibility as we move into the next century. 
   The following is a summary of the bill's major provisions: 
   Elimination of Unnecessary Government Programs.  
   A number of outdated or unnecessary programs would be eliminated, including Radio Marti, TV Marti and certain nuclear energy research initiatives. These changes would save over $150 million this year. 
   Reduction of Wasteful Spending and Government Efficiency Improvements. 
   $13 billion a year is lost to Medicare waste and abuse. This would be substantially reduced through a series of comprehensive reforms. In addition, taxpayer support for the cost of certain nuclear energy lobbying activities would be eliminated. 
   A number of common sense steps would be implemented to improve the efficiency of government activities. 
   Spending by government agencies on travel, printing, supplies and other items would be frozen at 1998 levels. This change would save $2.8 billion this year and about $12 
   billion over 5 years. 
   Pentagon spending would be tied to the rate of inflation. This would force the Pentagon to reduce duplication and other inefficiencies identified by government auditors and outside experts. This change would save taxpayers $9.2 billion this year and approximately $69 billion over the next 5 years. 
   Enhancing the government's ability to collect student loan defaults would save taxpayers $892 million this year and $1 billion over five years. 
   Eliminating Special Interest Tax Loopholes and Give-Aways. 
   Tobacco use causes 400,000 deaths a year and costs taxpayers billions in preventable health care costs. And, yet, taxpayers are forced to cough up about $2 billion a year to subsidize the advertising and marketing of this deadly product. The tax deductibility of tobacco promotion would be ended and these funds would be saved. 
   A loophole that allows estates valued above $10 million to elude taxation would be closed. 
   The federal government allows mining companies to extract minerals from federally-owned lands at an actual cost of pennies on the dollar. This special interest giveaway would be ended, saving taxpayers $750 million over the next five years. 
   American citizens temporarily working in foreign countries can earn up to $70,000 without paying any U.S. taxes. This unfair provision would be eliminated, bringing in an estimated $15.7 billion over the next 5 years. 
   A foreign tax credit that allows big oil and gas companies to escape paying their fair share for royalties would be limited. This common sense change would generate $3.1 billion over 5 years to reduce the debt our kids and grandkids will inherit. 
   Increased Accountability. 
   Tobacco companies hook 3,000 children a day on their deadly products. One in three of these kids will be sentenced to an early death. Tobacco companies should be held accountable. Accordingly, a goal of reducing teen smoking by at least 15 percent each year would be set. If tobacco companies fail to meet this goal, they would have to pay a penalty. Such a system would generate approximately $6 billion this year and $20 billion over the next 5 years. It would also significantly reduce the number of young children who become addicted to tobacco. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review the provisions in this bill and look forward to moving forward next year on a fiscally responsible budget plan.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senator ARLEN SPECTER, I am introducing the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act. Our bill allows people to have a real choice about where they receive certain types of Medicaid long term services and supports. It also provides grants to the States to assist them as they redirect Medicaid resources into community-based services and supports. 
   We all know that given a real choice, most Americans who need long term services and supports would rather remain in their own homes and communities than go to a nursing home. Older people want to stay in their homes; parents want to keep their children with disabilities close by; and adults with disabilities want to live in the community. 
   And yet, even though many people prefer home and community services and supports, our current long term care program favors institutional programs. Under our current Medicaid system, a person has a right to the most expensive form of care, a nursing home bed, because nursing home care is an entitlement. But if that same person wants to live in the community, he or she is likely to encounter a lack of available services, because community services are optional under Medicaid. The deck is stacked against community living, and the purpose of our bill is to level the playing field and give people a real choice. 
   Our bill would allow any person entitled to medical assistance in a nursing facility or an intermediate care facility to use the money for community attendant services and supports. Those services and supports include help with eating, bathing, brooming, toileting, transferring in and out of a wheelchair, meal planning and preparation, shopping, household chores, using the telephone, participating in the community, and health-related functions like taking pills, bowel and bladder care, and tube feeding. In short, personal assistance services and supports help people do tasks that they would do them selves, if they did not have a disability. 
   Personal assistance services and supports are the lowest-cost and most consumer friendly services in the long-term care spectrum. They can be provided by a variety of people, including friends and neighbors of the recipient. In many instances, with supervision, the consumer can direct his or her own care and manage his or her own attendants. This cuts down on expensive administrative overhead and the current practice of relying on medical personnel such as nurses to coordinate a person's care. States can save money and redirect medically-oriented care to those who need it most. 
   Not only is home and community-based care what people want, it can also be far less expensive. There is a wide variation in the cost of supporting people with disabilities in the community because individuals have different levels of need. But, for the average person, the annual cost of home and community based services is less than one-half the average cost of 
    institutional care. In 1997, Medicaid spent $56 billion on long term care. Out of that $56 billion, $42.5 billion was spent on nursing home and institutional care. This paid for a little over 1 million people. In comparison, only $13.5 billion was spent on home and community-based care--but this money paid for almost 2 million people. Community services make sound, economic sense. 
   In fact, the States are out ahead of us here in Washington on this issue. Thirty States are now providing the personal care optional benefit through their Medicaid programs. Almost every State offers at least one home and community based Medicaid waiver program. Indeed, this is one of Senator Chafee's most important legacies. He was ahead of his time. 
   The States have realized that community based care is both popular and cost effective, and personal assistance services and supports are a key component of a successful program. 
   And yet there are several reasons why we have to do more. 
   Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus that Americans with disabilities should have the equal opportunity to contribute to our communities and participate in our society as full citizens. Instead, our current Federal Medicaid policy favors exclusion over integration, and dependence over self-determination. This legislation will bring Medicaid policy in line with our broader agreement that Americans with disabilities should have the chance to move toward independence. This bill allows people to receive certain types of services in the community so that they don't have to sacrifice their full participation in society simply because they require a catheter, assistance with medication, or some other basic service. 
   Take the example of a friend of mine in Iowa. Dan Piper works at a hardware store. He has his own apartment and just bought a VCR. He also has Down's syndrome and diabetes. For years Dan has received services through a community waiver program. But, he recently learned that he might not be  able to receive some basic services under the waiver. The result of this decision? He may have to sacrifice his independence for services. Today, Dan works and contributes to the economy as both a wage earner and a consumer. But, tomorrow, he may be forced into a nursing home, far from his roommate, his job, and his family. 
   In addition, our country is facing a long-term care crisis of epic proportions in the not-too distant future. We all talk about the coming Social Security shortfall and the Medicare shortfall, but we do not talk about the long-term care shortfall. The truth is that our current long-term care system will be inadequate to deal with the aging of the baby boom generation, the oldest of whom are now turning 60. Our bill helps to create the infrastructure we will need to create the high-quality, community based long term care system of the future. And it will give families the small amount of outside help they need to continue providing care to their loved ones at home. 
   And, finally, in a common sense decision last June, the Supreme Court found that, to the extent Medicaid dollars are used to pay for a person's long term care, that person has a right to receive those services in the most integrated setting. States must take practical steps to avoid unjustified institutionalization by offering individuals with disabilities the supports they need to live in the community. We in Congress have a responsibility to help States meet the financial costs associated with serving people with disabilities that want to leave institutions and live in the community, and the bill I am introducing will provide that help. 
   And so I call upon my colleagues for your support. Millions of Americans require some assistance to help them eat, dress, go to the bathroom, clean house, move from bed to wheelchair, remember to take medication, and to perform other activities that make it possible for them to live at home. These Americans live in every State and every congressional district. Most of these people have depended on unpaid caregivers--usually family members--for their needs. But a number of factors have affected the ability of family members to help. A growing number of elderly people need assistance, and aging parents will no longer be able to care for their adult children with disabilities. 
   But they all have one thing in common with every American. We all deserve to live in our own homes, and be an integral part of our families, our neighborhoods, our communities. Community attendant services and supports allow people with disabilities to lead richer, fuller lives, perhaps have a job, and participate in the community. Some will become taxpayers, some will do volunteer work, some will get an education, some will participate in recreational and other community activities. All will experience a better quality of life, and a better chance to take part in the American dream.

   Mr. HARKIN. I associate myself with the eloquent and erudite remarks made by my colleague, the Senator from New Jersey. He is right on target. 
   This amendment we are about to vote on misses the mark by a mile in terms of what we ought to do. The Senator from New Jersey has been the leading advocate on the Senate floor for focusing razor-like on the real problem, which is the proliferation of guns, the ready access to guns of the youth of this country. He is right on target. I compliment the Senator for his leadership in that area and the statements made today. 
   Again, the majority has taken a measure which has strong bipartisan support and added a poison pill--nothing more or less than a blatant political maneuver. Most of the provisions  of this amendment provide critical resources to law enforcement and communities to battle the methamphetamine epidemic. This started as a strong measure, one I wholeheartedly endorsed and have cosponsored. We have in the Midwest, the West, the Southwest, a major problem with this dangerous and highly addictive drug. We need additional resources to stop the spread of meth in our rural communities and urban centers. 
   I am a cosponsor of the bill authored by Senators HATCH and ASHCROFT, including provisions to help law enforcement investigate and clean up highly toxic meth labs. It includes $15 million for meth prevention and education, $10 million for meth treatment, and authorizes funding for needed research on the treatment of meth. It also includes tougher penalties for meth lab operators and traffickers. Many of these provisions, about a third of them, are taken from the bill I introduced earlier this year called the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Abuse Reduction Act. 
   Over the past 3 years, I have worked very hard to increase the resources for law enforcement and communities to reduce the supply and demand of these illegal drugs through millions of dollars in grants for law enforcement, prevention, treatment, and research. So the methamphetamine bill is a good bill. It has strong bipartisan support. The methamphetamine amendment is a good amendment--until last-minute additions were included to undermine the bipartisan support. We now have a couple of poison pills added to it. 
   The first is a school voucher program, private school vouchers that will divert Federal education dollars from public schools to private schools. It says for a victim of a crime at a school--a situation that no one condones--that Federal education funds could be used to send that student to a private school anywhere in the State. That sounds good, but it doesn't do anything to make schools safer. Plus there is a big loophole in the amendment. If you read the amendment, it says here:  
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law [et cetera, et cetera] if a student becomes a victim of a violent criminal offense, including drug-related violence, while in or on the grounds of a public elementary school or secondary school that the student attends.......  
   Then they can use these funds to send the student to a private school, including a religious school, anywhere in the State, wherever the parent wants the student to go. 
   So, obviously, a student could be on the school grounds after school, in the evening, on the weekend, as most of these 
   grounds are available as playgrounds, basketball courts, things like that, and if the violent act occurred then, which has nothing to do with the school whatsoever, these funds could be diverted. There is a big loophole in that amendment. Aside from that, that is not the way to address violence in schools. We should, instead, support violence and crime prevention programs in and around public schools, not divert resources from public to private schools. We should invest in initiatives such as the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act and afterschool programs, since we know most juvenile crimes occur between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. 
   I am on the Appropriations Committee for education. As soon as I finish my statement, I am going downstairs to continue negotiations. The President wanted $600 million for afterschool programs to keep these kids off the streets and put them into afterschool programs. The Republican leadership knocked that down in half, to $300 million. That is where we ought to be putting our money, not saying take money out of public schools and put them in vouchers. Let's do what the President wanted to do: Put $600 million in afterschool programs so these kids will be safe. 
   We also need more counselors in schools, especially in our elementary schools, to prevent problems before they start. Public tax dollars should be spent on public schools which educate 90 percent of our Nation's children. Taxpayers' money should not go to vouchers when public schools have great needs, including providing a safe environment. 
   Again, there is another part of this that is a poison pill, and that is the mandatory minimum provisions which were put in the amendment. The Department of Justice, all of the U.S. attorneys, including the two U.S. attorneys from the State of Iowa, oppose this provision. It does not fix the problem. Our prisons are already full. We are building new prisons. In fact, the most rapidly growing part of public housing today is our building of prisons. Yet what this amendment would do is crowd more people into those prisons and require us to build more prison cells. That is not the answer. Building more prisons, making mandatory minimum sentences, getting young people who may be first-time abusers into these prisons, is not the answer. We need more education; we need more prevention; we need more treatment; and we need more counseling for kids in elementary and secondary schools. 
   With these two poison pills, I do not see how anyone could support this. The methamphetamine part was a good part when it started out. Then the majority decided to add some poison pills in a political maneuver. I understand the politics of it, but the politics does not mean we have to shield our eyes and cast a blind vote. 
   I am hopeful that sometime--probably not this year--next year we will be able to bring up again a targeted methamphetamine bill, one that gets to, yes, penalties but also gets to education, prevention, treatment, and research, and put this package together in an antimethamphetamine drug bill that we can bring up and pass without all these riders and poison pills. 
   I yield the remainder of the time on this side.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the face of American agriculture is being changed dramatically by the quickening pace of mergers, buyouts, takeovers and vertical integration. Over the years, farm families have survived bad weather and ups and downs in the markets. They have adapted to new technologies, new ways of buying production inputs and new ways of marketing what they produce. 
   But today farm families are being hit by a tidal wave of economic concentration and consolidation that is threatening their survival in a way that is unlike anything in the past. The pace of consolidation is being driven even faster by the disastrously low commodity prices of the past couple of years. These are deeply troubling times for anyone concerned about the future of the family farm--and we are quickly running out of time to turn things around. 
   Senator WELLSTONE's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, is vitally necessary because I believe that we need a time-out from the headlong rush towards ever greater economic concentration and consolidation in agriculture. All this amendment does is put a hold on mergers and acquisitions involving large agribusiness firms for a period of 18 months or until legislation is in effect addressing market concentration in the agricultural sector, whichever comes first. So it can't be longer than 18 months. 
   All this amendment is saying is that we have to take a pause to get a handle on the mergers and acquisitions in agriculture that I believe have gotten out of hand and out of control. Some will say the amendment goes too far, as my friend from Oregon just said. But I think the merger mania in agriculture has gone way too far already. We must act before the family farm is driven to total extinction. 
   I tell my colleagues, there is no more critical issue to the farm families of America than the rapid and sweeping changes taking place in the economic structure of agriculture. It is an issue that I believe overshadows even the record low commodity prices that are devastating rural America. Farm families and their communities have their backs against the wall, and they are fighting for survival. They are being overrun by economic forces far more powerful than they are. The least we can do is to provide a time-out before it is too late. 
   Far too little attention has been paid to the tremendous consequences of transforming American agriculture from a system of independent family farms to one based on the corporate industrial model. Ever greater economic concentration in the food and agricultural sector affects not only farm families and rural communities. Everyone eats. Consumers ought to ask whether they will enjoy the same high-quality food at reasonable cost if our food supply is in the hands of a few corporate giants instead of many thousands of family farms. 
   Make no mistake about it, the sweeping consolidation in the food and agricultural sector is not about productive efficiency. When it comes to efficiency, nobody beats the independent family farm. What is taking place is about the corporate bottom line: stock deals, positioning in the market, and capitalizing on economic power. Is it in the best interests of this country to have a food and agricultural system dominated by the principles and standard operating procedures of Wall Street? Does it make any sense to continue down a path of ever increasing economic power and consolidation among agribusiness firms while family farmers are driven off the land? 
   The underlying principle of our Nation's antitrust laws is that we are all better off with a system of full, free, and fair competition in the markets. The rapidly growing economic concentration in the food and agricultural sector stands this principle on its head. We have to ask why the antitrust laws on the books are not working to stem the tide of economic concentration in agriculture. 
   Now, the speaker before me--I listened carefully--said over and over again that we shouldn't be interfering in the marketplace. Well, there are times when we must interfere in the marketplace because unbridled exploitation of the marketplace leads to concentration, undue economic power, and monopoly practices. If you don't believe me, look what has happened with Microsoft. Why did we have the Clayton and Sherman Antitrust Acts in the first place? Because unbridled economic power led to more and more concentration, more and more monopolies, and less and less competition. 
   I believe in the marketplace, but the marketplace must be tempered. The marketplace must be tempered by adequate rules and regulations and laws that keep one party from becoming so big it can squash out all effective competition. So to say we shouldn't interfere in the marketplace is to fly in the face of what our 
   stated policy has been for the last century in America. 
   We do interfere in the market. We interfere in the market to try to keep it a free and open and fair and competitive market. Otherwise, let the big get bigger, let them buy out everybody else, and let them squash competition. Why bring a case against Microsoft? Because I think it is being shown that Microsoft is engaging in anticompetitive behavior to squash out competition so that they can charge the consumers what they want to charge for what they offer, not what competition in an open market would bring to the consumers of software, but whatever  Microsoft wants to charge for what they choose to sell because they can effectively squeeze out everyone else. 
   I don't buy the argument that we have to keep our hands off of the market. 
   We tried that in the past, and it brought us to the brink of ruination. So you have to have interventions periodically. I think where we are in agriculture now begs us for that kind of intervention. 
   Now, there is one other important aspect of this amendment. It sets up an Agriculture Concentration and Market Power Review Commission to take a close look at economic concentration in agriculture and to make recommendations on changes in antitrust laws and other Federal laws and regulations in order to ensure that there is a fair and competitive marketplace for family farmers and rural communities. 
   Again, in that connection, I want to say that the present Justice Department has been the most active in the area of antitrust enforcement in agriculture of any Justice Department in my experience in Washington. So I commend the Attorney General and especially commend assistant Attorney General Joel Klein for bringing new life to antitrust enforcement in agriculture and elsewhere. Incidentally, I congratulate Mr. Klein for his wisdom and judgment in taking on the Microsoft case, because I believe if this case had not been pursued, Microsoft would have gotten even bigger and bigger, and more and more of any competition would have been snuffed out. I think this case is going to help consumers. 
   But the Justice Department can only do so much under the present state of our antitrust laws. We must keep in mind that the antitrust laws on the books were written around the close of the 19th century, and we are now at the beginning of the 21st century. The economic structure of agriculture and agricultural businesses has changed dramatically in the intervening years. In addition, there have been many court decisions interpreting and applying the general language of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Those decisions, quite frankly, have not all been favorable to the strong antitrust enforcement that I believe we need in the area of our food and agriculture system. 
   So, at the end of this century, almost 100 years after the Sherman and Clayton Acts and after court decisions that I believe have interpreted these laws in ways that are inimical to the best interests of family farms, this amendment will put a brake on the category of large agribusiness mergers and acquisitions for a period of time, 18 months, so we can have a careful review of economic concentration in agriculture and of what need we have for changes in the law to ensure a fair and competitive marketplace in agriculture. 
   There is a lot of rhetoric flying around about sustaining the family farm in this body. This amendment allows us to address the greatest threat to the survival of family farms now existing. This amendment provides for a pause, a breathing spell, so family farms are not driven to extinction before we can even get a handle on what has happened. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. Presdient, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. When I think of who the minimum wage increase would benefit and why it is needed--I don't think of the teenager popping corn at the movie theater. 
   I think of the single mother of two, a full-time cashier at the local grocery store, struggling to put dinner on the table and clothe her kids. She's off welfare, but still living far below the poverty level. Right now, the minimum wage pays her less than $11,000 a year, working 40 hours a week. 
   If we really want to help parent succeed on their own, they need a fair wage. Senator KENNEDY'S amendment would help us get there. 
   Today we have the opportunity to assure that 11.8 million American workers are provided with a much needed and much deserved raise. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults. Nearly sixty percent are women. More than 1/3 are the sole breadwinners, like the woman I spoke of. 
   Mr. President, it is a sad fact that in today's booming economy and skyrocketing executive pay, minimum wage workers earn 19 percent less, adjusted for inflation, than minimum wage workers earned 20 years ago. The proposed increased would restore the wage floor to just above its 1983 level--which is a positive step despite the fact that it would still be 13 percent below its 1979 peak. 
   I believe that these workers are central to the U.S. economy and that they  should benefit from the recent surge in economic growth--not be left behind. 
   But, I keep hearing the same tired argument echo in this chamber--that raising the minimum wage would cause widespread job loss. Critics need to find another argument--because they're wrong on this one--always have been. 
   Let's look at what happened last time: The 
   Economic Policy Institute reported that in September 1996, one month before the minimum wage increased from $4.25 to $4.75, the national unemployment rate was 5.2 percent. In December 1997, two months after the second annual increase boosted the minimum wage to $5.15, the national unemployment rate was 4.2 percent--a full point lower. More telling, retail trade jobs which disproportionately employ low wage workers, grew as fast as jobs overall. 
   A recent Business Week editorial backed that up saying--  
   In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher minimum wages raise income, not unemployment.  
   The workers who this amendment would target are central to the economy--and they should benefit from the incredible growth of our economy. 
   I know that there are proposals for a more gradual increase in the minimum wage--3 years instead of 2. This would cut the income of a full-time, year-around worker roughly $1,500 over three years compared with the current proposal. The minimum wage has already lost a lot of ground with inflation. The three-year proposal would only hinder this effort to catch up. 
   There is another critical piece of Senator KENNEDY's amendment--stopping the abuse of workers on U.S. land. It would apply the U.S. minimum wage to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands--the CNMI, also known as Saipan. The local government's current minimum wage there is $3.10 an hour. This amendment would go a long way toward relieving some of the egregious abuse and exploitation of temporary foreign workers brought to the U.S. territory to work at the garment factories--most of which are owned by foreign interests. 
   The bottom line is this: All of America deserves a raise--that includes those living and working in Saipan--and the 143,000 Iowans who would benefit from the raise. 
   Profits and productivity are way up. There is room to give workers a wage they deserve without hurting economic growth. The rest of the economy shouldn't be doing better than the people who make it run. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support a raise in the minimum wage. It is the right thing to do for women, for America's families, and it is long overdue. 
   The Kennedy amendment also includes a number of very important tax provisions that I strongly support. One of the most important points about the tax provisions is that the new tax benefits are fully paid for. The cost of these benefits are offset both for the coming year and for the coming ten years so we do not eat into the funds we need to pay for Social Security and needed improvements in Medicare as the baby boomers start retiring. It closes tax loopholes that allow some large companies to escape paying their fair share of taxes by creating artificial accounting gimmicks that have no purpose whatsoever except shifting the burden of taxes from a company to average taxpayers or the public debt. 
   I am very pleased that this amendment includes the text of S. 1300, the Older Workers Protection Act, which I have sponsored. Across America, workers have worked for companies anticipating the secure retirement which is their due and expectation under their company's pension plan. Now, as more Americans than ever before in history approach retirement, some employers are trying to cut their pension benefits. 
   Under current law, a company cannot take away pension benefits that have already been earned. But, in a slight of hand, when some companies change their pension plan making it less generous, they quietly, simply do not pay anything into an employee's account, often for 5 years or more till the employee's pension is ``worn away'' to the lower value of the new plan. This wear away is, I believe illegal under current age discrimination law. It certainly is a violation of the spirit of the law. This provision would clear, real protections for many thousands of workers who are having their pensions slashed without their knowledge. This measure eliminates wear away. It provides a company must pay into an employee's pension account under a new pension plan without regard to higher accrued benefits that might have been earned prior to plan change. 
   The amendment also provides for numerous provisions that help smaller businesses and their owners that I support. These include: 
   100 percent deductibility for self-employed health insurance staring on January 1, that I have been working for many years, 
   A tax credit for the start up costs of a small company pension plan including a 50 percent credit for the match that a small employer puts into a employee's account during the first 5 years. This could really make a difference; giving employers real incentives to setting up quality pension plans so crucial to workers retirement, a 25 percent tax credit for an employer's cost in setting up a day care center, Expanding the amount a small business can expanse to 25,000, Extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the related to Work Tax Credit, Expanding the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. But, I would have liked to see a far faster increase in the increase in this program than the amendment provided. 
   The measure contains a number of benefits of particular interest to farmers that I strongly support including a provision that prevents the use of income averaging pushing a farmer into having to pay the Alternative Minimum tax. And it provides for a 10 year carryback for farmers that I have been advocating. This would I believe it would be important to have the carryback provision take effect for loses that occurred in both 1998 and 1999. 
   On the other hand, the Republican tax amendment has a net cost of over $75 billion over the coming decade that is not offset by closing tax loop holes or by other means. That means that the Republican proposal will have the likely effect of cutting into the funds we need to protect Social Security and to preserve and improve Medicare. That is a real problem under current projections of government revenues and costs. But it is even worse if we end up with a serious downturn in our economy. Some claim that the reason for these tax provisions is a desire to mitigate the costs of the minimum wage increase on small employers. But, the burden on Social Security and Medicare is three times the effect of the estimated effect of the version of the minimum wage provisions in the Majority package. 
   Many of the provisions are worthy of support, many are also in the Democratic proposal where they are paid for. It also contains some provisions that I support but which were not included in the Democratic proposal because of its cost. These include the tax benefits for health insurance and long term care. On the other hand, this proposal unfairly benefits the wealthy. For example, there is a $396 million cost to the government over 10 years to allow a person to increase the amount of money that can be received from a defined benefit plan from $130,000 to $160,000 per year. Every penny of this cost benefits those at the top of the income scale, not one of whom is making less than 10 times the minimum wage just from one retirement benefit! 
   Unfortunately, there are a large number of provisions in the GOP plan that reduce the incentive for small businesses to set up a good pension plan for their workers. The tax code provides about $130 billion a year in tax benefits to promote pensions. The purpose of that considerable public investment is to provide incentives for people to invest in pensions and for companies to fund pension plans for all of their workers, not just owners and key employees. Many small employers are pushed by the law's limits on what they can put into their own pension accounts without providing benefits to all employees to provide decent pension plans for their workers. The majority amendment reduces those restraints and will likely result in far fewer employees getting pensions. That is bad public policy. 
   Lastly, the majority amendment includes provisions that provides significant special interest loopholes in the tax code. There is a provision regarding ESOPs: employee stock ownership  plans. The Treasury believes this provision opens up a significant loophole for some taxpayers. If a high income self employed person or someone in a partnership with others, arranges that all of the people that work with him and his partners are considered employees of another entity, then the partners can incorporate and form an ESOP. Under the provision in the amendment, the doctors could then defer all of the income they desire, effectively as pension income without any limit. So, if they each make $300,000 and one decides that he needs to spend only $150,000 to live on, that high income taxpayer could defer their taxes on the whole whopping $150,000 unspent. That is outrageous. Why should we be putting these very generous loopholes in the tax code that allow a few to not pay their fair share of taxes? They become a special class of taxpayers who only have to pay taxes on what they spend and everything they save goes into the equivalent of a super IRA with all taxes deferred. That makes no sense at all. 
   We need tax provisions that are designed to promote the creation of pensions for the average employee making $25,000 or $50,000, not creating special provisions only of interest to very high income taxpayers that actually reduce their interest in setting up pension plans for their workers. I urge that we pass the Kennedy amendment and reject the majority amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the passage of Senate Bill 1809, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   As the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the former chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy, I take a particular interest in the Developmental Disabilities Act, which has been a cornerstone of our national policy for people with disabilities. In fact, the Supreme Court cited the Developmental Disabilities Act in the recent Olmstead decision as evidence of Congress' intent that people with disabilities should have the choice to receive services in the community. 
   The entities funded under the Act--the Developmental Disabilities Councils, University Affiliated Programs, and the Protection and Advocacy systems--have enabled us to move away from a service system that denied people with disabilities the choice to receive services where families and individuals want them--in their own homes, communities, and neighborhoods. 
   This year's reauthorization is very important for several reasons. First, we must continue our progress toward ensuring that people with developmental disabilities achieve their maximum potential through increased self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration in all facets of life. 
   Second, we must ensure that people with developmental disabilities are free from abuse and neglect in all aspects of the service delivery system. This bill will help protect people with disabilities from abuse and neglect no matter where they live--inside an institution or in the community. 
   And finally, we must do more to strengthen and support families as they provide care and support to family members with a disability. Family caregivers are the true heroes of our long-term care system. In Title II of this bill, Congress lends support to State efforts to give individuals with disabilities the choice to stay at home, with their families. 
   I thank Senator JEFFORDS for acknowledging my strong interest and contributions to this important title. This Family Support grant program gives flexibility and authority to the States in designing statewide systems of family support services for families of children with disabilities. It is our intention that all activities conducted under the Family Support program should be family-centered and family-directed. This means that services and programs should facilitate the full participation and control by families of children with disabilities in decisions relating to the supports that will meet the priorities of the family; and in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of the statewide system of family support. 
   We have given States the flexibility of defining what Family Support services will be provided. Family Support services should lead to the integration and inclusion of children with disabilities and their families in the use and participation of the same community resources that are used by and available to other individuals and families.  
   Family Support services may include help with service coordination; the provision of goods and services such as specialized evaluations and diagnostic services, adaptive equipment, respite care, personal assistance services, homemaker and chore services, behavioral supports, assistive technology services and devices, permanency and future planning, home and vehicle modifications and repairs, equipment and consumable supplies, transportation, specialized nutrition and clothing, counseling and mental health services, family education and training services, communication services, crisis intervention, daycare and child care for a child with a disability, supports and services for integrated and inclusive community activities, parent or family member support groups, peer support, sitter service or companion service, education aids; and financial assistance, which may include cash subsidies, allowances, voucher or reimbursement systems, low-interest loans, or lines of credit. 
   A statewide system of Family Support Services means a system that is family-centered and family-directed, and that assists and enables families to receive rights and procedural safeguards and to gain access to social, medical, legal, educational, and other supports and services; and that include follow along services that ensure that the changing needs of the child and family are met; the coordination and monitoring of services provided to the family; the provision of information to children with disabilities and their families about the availability of services, and assistance to such children and their families in obtaining appropriate services; and the facilitation and organization of existing social networks and natural sources of support, and community resources and services. 
   Such a statewide system should also be culturally competent, community-centered, and comprehensive so that it addresses the needs of all families of children with disabilities, including unserved and underserved populations; and addresses such needs without regard to the age, type of disability, race, ethnicity, or gender of such children or the major life activity for which such children need the assistance. 
   When applying for a grant, States should demonstrate the nature and extent of the involvement of families of children with disabilities and individuals with disabilities in the development of the application, including the involvement of unserved and underserved populations; and in strategies for actively involving families of children with disabilities and individuals with disabilities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the statewide system of family support for families of children with disabilities. In the application, States should also describe the unmet needs for family support for families of children with disabilities in the State. 
   When applying for a grant, States should designate a lead entity that will coordinate activities funded under the grant with activities of other relevant State and local agencies. The lead agency should have the capacity to promote a statewide system of family support for families of children with disabilities throughout the State that is family-centered and family-directed; to promote and implement systems change activities; and to maximize access to public and private funds for family support services for families of children with disabilities. The application should also designate the involvement of other State or local agencies, including local councils, in the preparation of the application and the continuing role of each agency in the statewide system of family support for families of children with disabilities. 
   We have given States maximum flexibility in selecting activities they will implement in providing family support services for families of children with disabilities. The State may support training and technical assistance activities for family members, service providers, community members, professionals, students, and others to increase family participation, choice, and control in the provision of family support services for families of children with disabilities; to develop or strengthen family-centered and family-directed approaches to services, including service coordination services, service planning services, and respite care services; and to assist families of children with disabilities in accessing natural and community supports and in obtaining benefits and services.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am fortunate the remarks I am about to make follow the remarks of my colleagues from Iowa and New Jersey in talking about nursing homes because I want to take a few minutes to talk about another aspect of how the elderly are getting ripped off in this country and what has happened with HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, and what they have been trying to do to stop this. What the Senate is doing and what the House has done recently is going to turn the clock back on our attempts to cut out waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. 
   I have been working for over a decade to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system. It is a big problem. The Office of Inspector General estimates that last year, Medicare lost nearly $13 billion--that is with a B, billion dollars--to waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. 
   A few years ago, it was over $23 billion a year. So we have made some progress. It is still a huge annual waste of our tax dollars. I call it the Medicare waste tax, and we need to cut the Medicare waste tax. 
   Since 1989, I have held hearing after hearing, released report after report documenting unnecessary losses to the Medicare program. I commissioned the Office of Inspector General and the General Accounting Office to research and review these unnecessary payments and to make recommendations. On July 28 of this year, I introduced S. 1451, the Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1999 which incorporates many of these GAO and IG recommendations. If enacted, it would save Medicare and our taxpayers billions of dollars every year. 
   Medicare fraud is what we hear the most about, some egregious cases where a scam artist has found yet another way to skim millions from the Medicare trust fund. Those are the cases that make the headlines. But my years of investigation and review of this problem indicate that by far the greatest losses to Medicare are not in fraud, but they are due simply to waste and abusive practices. These losses are often directly due to or are encouraged by wasteful Medicare payment policies and practices and a laxity in oversight, as well as weaknesses in the Medicare law that restrict the program's ability to get the best deal possible when purchasing goods and services. 
   To examine this further, in 1996, my staff and I undertook a study of Medicare payments for medical supplies. This followed a study by the GAO that I had requested earlier on the same topic. We compared Medicare's payment rates for 18 commonly used medical supply and equipment items with what the Veterans' Administration paid. Then we compared it to the wholesale rate and the retail rate. 
   What we found was startling. This is a chart that depicts what we found. For example, an irrigation syringe--a small syringe like this little one right here, these little plastic syringes--we found that Medicare is paying $2.93 for each one. The Veterans' Administration is paying $1.89. The wholesale price was $1.10. The retail price was $1.95. One can walk into a drugstore and buy one for $1.95. Medicare was paying $2.93 for each one. The potential savings from that alone, if we base it on the wholesale price, is $4.4 million every year just on little plastic syringes. 
   We had a walker. The Medicare purchase price was 75 bucks. The VA price was $25 for the walker. The wholesale price was $39, and the potential savings was about $17 million a year. 
   Again, this is not an elaborate device. This is just a simple aluminum holding walker. Medicare was paying $75 each. The wholesale price was $39. 
   This is a commode chair. This is even more egregious. The commode chair was being paid for by Medicare at the rate of $99.35 each. The VA was paying $24.12 each. The potential savings was $30.6 million a year. This is a commode chair; we have all seen them. A lot of people use them in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   Potential savings: If Medicare just paid the VA price, not the wholesale price, just what the Veterans' Administration is buying them for, there would be a savings of $30 million a year just for the commode chair.  
   Those are some of the items we found were being grossly overpaid for by the Medicare system. 
   So, armed with this information, we began to work to cut this waste. First, I pushed an idea I have advocated for over a decade: Competitive bidding. Competitive bidding, that is how the Veterans' Administration gets the rates it does--good old-fashioned American free enterprise; put them out there for competitive bids. 
   While Medicare pays bloated prices based on historical charges, the VA, which has much less purchasing power than Medicare, puts out bids that provide for both quality and cost control. 
   So I wanted to get through competitive bidding. But all we could get through the Congress was a demonstration on competitive bidding. 
   I do want to point out one of the items on which we were successful in reducing the price on this idea of competitive bidding. One of the demonstration programs we did was oxygen. We found that for oxygen, Medicare was paying more than 50 percent more than the Veterans' Administration. So we had a debate here about reducing the Medicare rate for oxygen. We had a compromise. We cut the rate by 30 percent. That was in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. We said we were going to reduce the oxygen payments by 30 percent and put it out for competitive bids. 
   We just got the first bids in on the competitive bidding demonstration for oxygen. Guess what. The suppliers bid to provide home oxygen for about 25 percent less than the 30-percent cut we put in. On top of the 30-percent cut, the bids came in at 25 percent less than that. They are still making money. And they will still be providing regular servicing of equipment, doing it for that much less. 
   Let me get this straight. A lot of the oxygen suppliers said they could not do this because they would lose money. We did not listen. We went ahead and put through the 30-percent cut. Then we put it out for competitive bids. They then cut it 25 percent more than that. 
   So look at it this way. If the home oxygen people were making 50 percent more off Medicare than they were making off the Veterans' Administration, and we cut it by 30 percent, put it out for competitive bids, and they came in 25 percent even lower than that, that means they are now 5 percent under the Veterans' Administration. They were making money off VA before, and now they are even less than what VA is on competitive bids. And you know darn well they are not going to bid that unless they are making money on it. They are not going to put a bid out there to lose money. 
   That is just an indication of how much waste and abuse there is in the Medicare system and why competitive bidding ought not to be a demonstration project but it ought to be the norm, the standard for all of our purchases for Medicare. 
   We got the demonstration program. However, as a part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we did succeed in giving Medicare a modest version of another waste-fighting weapon I have been pushing for a long time. We provided HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, with enhanced ``inherent 
   reasonableness'' authority to reduce Medicare payments when it is clear that current Medicare payment levels are ``grossly excessive.'' In other words, Medicare, HCFA, has an ``inherent reasonableness'' clause. We enhanced that to say they could reduce Medicare payments when they were clearly grossly excessive. I would have liked to have done much more--obviously, put it out for competitive bids--but it is a step in the right direction. 
   Specifically, what this does is provide Medicare with the authority to reduce payments by up to 15 percent a year for items where Medicare believes there are gross overpayments. That was 2 years ago. After 2 years of prodding, HCFA has finally begun the process of using its new authority to make Medicare a more prudent purchaser. They published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 13 of this year. This followed an extensive investigation reviewing retail prices, wholesale prices paid by payers other than Medicare, and, of course, the payment amounts made by the Veterans' Administration. 
   HCFA and their intermediaries then came up with an initial list of 12 items of durable medical equipment and 1 prosthetic device for which Medicare currently pays a grossly excessive amount. HCFA recommended reducing these exorbitant rates, and they projected over a 5-year period, just making these modest adjustments, it would save Medicare and the taxpayers over $487 million--just in the next 5 years. 
   This chart will begin to show some of these items. 
   For example, the items here: Lancers, enteral nutrients, eyeglass frames, catheters, test strips, albuterol sulfate; the overpayments are: 36 percent, 16 percent, 21 percent, 24 percent, et cetera. This chart shows the 5-year savings we would get off them. Then this chart shows the overpayment for the folding walkers I just talked about, the commode chairs, and others, for another $120 million. It is a total 5-year savings of almost half a billion dollars just from these items alone. 
   Let me make it clear, we are only talking about the right of HCFA to reduce grossly excessive payments. Excessive pricing is not determined by comparing prices paid by Medicare to wholesale prices. That is not how we determine excessive pricing. HCFA, in its proposed rule, takes the Veterans' Administration price--what the VA is paying for these same items--and then it adds 67 percent. 
   Keep this in mind. I will get my commode chair back out here again. For an item such as this commode chair, what the HCFA has said is: We will see what VA is paying for it, not what the wholesale price is. What is the Veterans' Administration paying for it? Then we will add 67 percent over that. That is what we will now pay for that commode chair. 
   Keep in mind, the companies making these commode chairs are not losing money in the VA system. They would not be selling them to the VA if they were losing money. So you know they are making money off the VA. 
   Now HCFA says: OK, they were so grossly overpriced before, we are now going to cut it; we are only going to allow a 67-percent markup. Wouldn't you like to have that guarantee in everything you sell the Government? 
   I see no reason we should pay more than the VA. Medicare is the largest purchaser of medical supplies and equipment in the Nation. Because of this purchasing power, it ought to be able to demand better prices than anyone else. Medicare should not pay any more than any other Federal program does, whether it is VA, CHAMPUS, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or others. 
   Now, guess what. Even with the 67-percent markup over the VA rate, Medicare is currently paying even more. 
   It is hard to believe. 
   Now, here are the folding walkers. The VA payment on those is $30.24. The proposed Medicare payment is $50.50. That is with a 67-percent markup. So if they are making money on VA, they are making a killing off of Medicare. Here is the commode chair. VA is paying $37.64; the Medicare payment is $62.85. What a deal. And this is a result of us saying they shouldn't pay grossly exaggerated prices. Evidently paying $62.85 for a commode chair for which the VA is paying $37 is not grossly exaggerated. I think it is. There are a lot of other things, folding walkers and everything else. Here is a folding walker that has a wheel on it. The VA is paying $45.94; the proposed Medicare payment, $75.88. 
   Even with that, HCFA is moving ahead, barely, to save Medicare and taxpayers a lot of money. We need to do more, and we need to do more rapidly. 
   If my colleagues think that is bad news, get ready for the really bad news. With almost no discussion, last week the House Ways and Means Committee added a little special interest provision to the Medicare Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This provision would indefinitely delay cutting this wasteful spending. It would deny Medicare and the taxpayers $ 1/2 billion of savings. It does this simply by stopping HCFA from moving ahead. It stops Medicare, its intermediaries and carriers from using this inherent reasonableness authority until the Secretary has published a new rule and those rules are finalized. 
   Medicare says this would mean a delay of maybe 18, 22, 24 months, another a couple years. If their track record is any indicator, the delay would be a lot longer than that.  
   I suppose a lot of people on that House Ways and Means Committee got a lot of phone calls from the people who make walkers and commodes and these syringes who said do something about this. It is in the House Ways and Means Committee bill. It would block just these modest attempts to safeguard Medicare. We would still allow them to make 67 percent more than what they are making from VA. That is not enough for them. So they got a little provision slipped in that House bill. Talk about special interest legislation and a rip-off of our elderly and a rip-off of our taxpayers. 
   What did the Senate do? Well, they tried to do the same thing. The Senate counterpart to that bill, called the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Adjustment Act of 1999, would prohibit use of this inherent reasonableness authority until 90 days after the Comptroller General of the United States releases a report of its proposed impact. That would delay this implementation probably for another year. So the House, if we took the best case scenario, probably would delay it for 2 to 3 years. The Senate bill would delay it for at least a year. I am sure a compromise will be made leaning towards the House side, when this bill goes to conference, by members of the Finance Committee. I want members of the Finance Committee to know we are watching. We want to know what they are going to do to start reducing these exorbitant prices people pay for medical equipment. It is not right to stop or further delay HCFA from implementing at least these modest savings. 
   We gave HCFA the authority in 1997; 2 years later, they just started to act on this. You can see how long it takes them to do something. Just when they are getting ready to make these cuts, to put more reasonableness in the amounts of money we pay, 
   the Congress says, no, stop; put on the brakes. We can't do this. The Congress is standing by--let me rephrase that. The Congress is not standing by. The Congress, under the bills in the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, is actively stopping the progress and the process by which we will save taxpayers billions of dollars, an added tax not only on our taxpayers but on our elderly. 
   We can do something about it. We have shown we can do something about it. We have shown how much we can reduce costs in oxygen and these other items. But now there are elements in this Congress who say, no, we can't do that. 
   Well, we are going to watch. We will see what the Ways and Means Committee and the Finance Committee do to stop this rip-off of our taxpayers. We have grappled with ways to reduce Medicare expenditures. We passed this limited provision 2 years ago, giving them the authority just so they wouldn't pay grossly exaggerated prices. HCFA said: OK, we are not going to pay grossly exaggerated prices; we will just pay 67 percent more than VA. That is grossly exaggerated. But even to that modest amount of reduction, the House Ways and Means Committee says no. 
   We all remember the Pentagon and the $500 toilet seats the Pentagon was buying some years ago. It is great news for all of us that the Pentagon isn't buying them anymore. Unfortunately, Medicare is. Taxpayers don't deserve to be ripped off and to have all of their money go for this gross waste and abuse in the Medicare system. Again, I know it is the waning hours of the Congress. We are all going to be getting out of here, I guess next week, they tell us. There is going to be a balanced budget amendment fix. We are going to look to see whether or not the special interests have gotten their way once again to rip off the taxpayers of this country and the Medicare system. 
   I may not have the opportunity to take the floor after that is done. We may be recessed or adjourned until next year. But we will be back, as will the taxpayers of this country and the elderly people and their families who have been getting ripped off for far too long. We will be back to make sure we get competitive bidding once and for all to save our taxpayers a lot of money. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I oppose this conference report. There are a number of important and positive elements in the measure that provide for improvements in the regulation of financial institutions that will better enable us to assure for the soundness of our financial institutions. More could have been done in that area. But, there are clear improvements. There are provisions which help small banks and small insurance companies acquire additional resources that are important to their ability to compete, to help their customers and useful to economy in their local areas. And, in a world marketplace, American institutions should have the resources needed to compete in that marketplace. 
   Unfortunately, these positive steps are outweighed by the negative impact the bill will have on the privacy rights of Americans. Under this legislation, banks, insurance firms, and credit card agencies that are owned by the same mega-corporation can share a consumer's personal information. What kind of stock do you own? What information can be acquired from your credit card statements? When do your CD's mature? And, I fear, that information about a customer's health might also become available to those in a company who might decide if a customer is to get a loan or not get a loan. Do we want any possibility that a loan officer might have access to information about the medical condition and other private medical matters of a loan applicant without the customer's permission? I believe that this bill should have clearly provided solid protections in these areas. Unfortunately, these are the kinds of things that could happen if this measure becomes law. 
   The measure does not even allow a customer to say No, I do not want any information picked up from my bank account or from records with the insurance company which is a part of a larger financial institution to be shared by any other part of a financial institution. If a customer wants information shared because that customer believes that he or she would be helped by one stop shopping for financial activities, fine. Let that customer waive rights to privacy by signing an appropriate form. But, the basic right to block information collected by a company from being shared by other parts of a company is not in this bill. 
   There is an ability to say that you do not want the financial entity to simply sell the information. But, I understand that under this bill, your financial institution can share information they have acquired from your various accounts with other companies that they have entered into certain types of marketing agreements. 
   Computers have great advantages. They increase the efficiency of our economy. But, they can store huge amounts of information about a person's private habits and circumstances. In this age where we have an explosion in the amount of information that is collected about people, I believe it is essential that we erect strong barriers that prevent the passage of personal information without a person's permission. 
   I am also concerned about the weakness in the bill concerning the Community Reinvestment Act. We need to keep the burdens of paperwork down, particularly for small banks. But, we also need to provide for effective teeth in the requirement that banks provide proper financial assistance to all parts of their service area. And, this bill falls short in that area.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the discussion of this trade bill, we hear a lot of talk about the different things involved in trade and how we want to lift countries up; that the essence of this trade bill before us is to open up the avenues and the corridors of free trade so people living in Third World countries, in Africa specifically, can begin to enjoy some of the benefits of increased production, increased distribution of goods and services, and an increased standard of living. That is what the proponents of the trade bill are arguing. 
   I am not here to argue against that. I believe free trade, if it is practiced as free trade, it can have genuine beneficial effects on all parties involved. There are anomalies, however, in the trade structure that keep the benefits of open and free trade from being genuinely and broadly distributed among people in Third World countries. There are a lot of these, but I believe the single most important feature, institution or practice of Third World countries that inhibits their economic growth, inhibits their social growth, even if they are allowed into a free trade structure, is the use and practice of abusive child labor. 
   Child labor is the last vestige of slavery on the face of the Earth. It is widespread. It is condoned--if not openly, at least passively--by many of the major industrial nations of the world. I think it is time we get rid of this last vestige of slavery: child labor. 
   I have an amendment that is very simple and straightforward. It builds on the international consensus that emerged from the ILO conference in Geneva this summer in which the delegates unanimously adopted a convention to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The amendment simply states that in order to be eligible for the trade benefits in this bill, a country must meet and effectively enforce the standards regarding child labor, as established by the ILO convention 182 for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. It is just that simple. In other words, if a country wants the benefits of this trade bill, they must meet and effectively enforce the standards of the recently adopted ILO convention 182. 
   This convention defines the worst forms of child labor as: all forms of slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, or the sale and trafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict; child prostitution, children producing and trafficking narcotic drugs; or any other work which by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, the safety, and the morals of children. These are the provisions of ILO convention 182. 
   As I stated earlier, for the first time in history, this last June, the world spoke with one voice in opposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from across the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to Moslem, from Buddhist to Christians--came together to proclaim unequivocally that ``abusive and exploitative child labor is a practice which will not be tolerated and must be abolished.'' 
   So gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an acceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstances. Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable because of cultural traditions. And gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the road to economic development. When this convention was approved, the United States and the international community as a whole laid these arguments to rest and laid the groundwork  to begin the process of ending the scourge of abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   Additionally, for the first time in its history, the U.S. tripartite group to the ILO--consisting of representatives from government, business, and labor--unanimously agreed on the final version of the ILO convention 182. 
   I believe strongly that the time has come to say to countries: If you want the trade benefits outlined in this bill, you must, at a minimum, enforce international standards on abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   That is at a minimum. 
   So let me be clear about what is meant by abusive and exploitative child labor. This is not about kids working on the family farm. It is not about kids who work after school. There is nothing wrong with that. I worked in my youth when I was in school. Probably most of us in the Chamber today worked when we were young and in school. There is nothing wrong with that, and that is not what we are talking about. The convention that the ILO adopted in June deals with children who are chained to looms, who handle dangerous chemicals, who ingest metal dust from working around machinery, children who are forced to sell illegal drugs, forced into prostitution, forced into armed conflict, forced to work in factories where furnace temperatures exceed 1,500 degrees. 
   Let me refer to this chart again and repeat, for the sake of emphasis, what the convention does. It abolishes the harshest forms of child labor, including child slavery, child bondage, child prostitution, use of children in pornography, trafficking in children, the forced recruitment of children for armed conflict, the recruitment of children in the production or sale of narcotics, and hazardous work by children. Those are the abusive and exploitative forms of child labor that are covered. 
   According to the ILO, in Latin America and the Caribbean there are an estimated 17 million children working. In Africa--and we are on the Africa trade bill--80 million children are working. In Asia, about 153 million children are working. There are about half a million in Oceania, in the islands of the southwest Pacific. This totals about 250 million children world wide that are working full time. 
   They are forced to work with no protective equipment under hazardous and slave-like conditions. They endure long hours for little or no compensation. They simply work only for the economic gain of others. They are denied an education and denied the opportunity to grow and develop. 
   I paint this in sharp contrast to afterschool jobs that kids have so they can have some more spending money to buy the latest CD. These kids are not buying CDs. They are not even in school. They are kept out of school and are forced to work. 
   Again, I know firsthand what this is about. I have some charts here, some pictures. Last year, my legislative assistant, Rosemary Gutierrez, and I traveled to several countries in South Asia to investigate child labor. This happens to be a picture that was taken outside of a compound in Katmandu, Nepal. This was on a Sunday evening, shortly after dark, maybe about 7 or 7:30 in the evening. I had heard repeated stories about children who were working, making carpets, children as young as 5 to 7 years of age. But I also knew from others I had talked to that if you asked to visit one of these plants, by the time you got there, they had the kids out the back door. So nobody could ever see them. 
   Well, it turned out that, through mutual acquaintances, we located a young man--I don't know how old he is now, maybe 21 or 22 years old--who had been a former child laborer in one of these plants. He knew of a plant where he knew the guard at the gate on this Sunday evening in question. So what we did is, we got in an unmarked car and we drove to the outskirts of Katmandu and went up to this compound. Later, we found out we were mistaken and the owner was in fact there. So we went up to the gate, four or five of us, with this young Nepalese man. He got us in the gate. 
   This was the picture I took outside the gate. There is a sign posted very prominently in Nepalese and in English. As you can see, it says, ``Child labour under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited.'' They have these signs all over. So I took a picture of it. 
   We went to the gate of this compound. We walked down a fairly narrow alleyway. There were low-lying buildings on our left and right. We went down a few hundred yards and turned to our left to this carpet factory. We went into the carpet factory. Mind you, 
   this is on a Sunday evening, and it is about 7:30. Here is what we found. I can tell you this is what we found because I took the picture. There were dozens and dozens of kids working in this building, with a lot of dust around; carpets put off a lot of dust when they make them. I took this picture of these two kids. I had the young man who spoke Nepalese there, and we were able to talk to them a little. 
   As best I could figure out, he was about 7 and she was about 8. This was at 7:30 in the evening. You can't see because the flashbulb wasn't strong enough, but there are dozens of children sitting in rows up and down the aisles working. 
   Here is a better picture, and I am in it. My staff assistant took this picture. These kids are 8, 9, 10, 11 years old, all the way back here, on both sides, up and down, working at 7:30 at night. These are kids who work probably 12 to 14 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week. When they are not working, they are taken out of here to those low-lying buildings where they sleep and eat; that is where they live. They are not allowed to go out. They are not allowed to go out on the streets. They are not allowed to get an education, go to school. They go from their little Quonset hut, where they stay like stacks of cord wood. Then they are herded in here, work 12 to 14 hours a day, and they are herded back into the building. They are 7, 8, 9 years of age. 
   I said: What happens when they get to be 12, 13, or 14? I didn't see any children there that old there. Well, sometimes the boys go into different kinds of work, and the girls are sold into prostitution. You don't have to take my word for that; you can talk with anybody in the U.N., the ILO, and talk about the trafficking of young girls from Nepal to India, some as far away as Saudi Arabia. 
   I met with some young girls who had been sold into prostitution. There is an organization in Nepal of women trying to repatriate these young women, get them back to their country and their villages. Some were sent as far away as Saudi Arabia. Trafficking in prostitution--that is what we are talking about in this amendment. We are not talking about kids working after school. We are talking about these kids. Should a country that permits this and condones this and doesn't take active steps to stop it--should they, I ask you, get the benefits of this trade bill? 
   Here is another kid. I did not take this picture. This is not my picture. I admit that. But there is a young boy in the Sialkot region of Pakistan. He is 8 years old. His name is Mohammad Ashraf Irfan. You may not be able to see it from there, but he is making surgical equipment. These are scissors used in surgery that are shipped to this country. Think about that. Think about that the next time you go into the doctor's office. It is clean, it is sterile, you have a wound, and they are going to sew you up or they are going to make you well again. You see those little scissors come out, or the little knife, and the things they use. Think about Ashraf here who is 8 years old. Look at him. The next time you go into a doctor's office, think about Ashraf and think about hundreds of thousands like him sitting there day after day. He has no protective goggles, no protective equipment on his hands, and he is making surgical equipment to be used in the finest of doctor's offices and hospitals in Europe and America. That is what we are talking about in this amendment. 
   I believe our goal must be to encourage and to persuade other countries to build on the prosperity that comes with trade and to lift their standards up. Exploited child labor in other countries not only penalize Ashraf to a lifetime of illiteracy, low wages, bad health, and not only does it condemn him to that, and hurt his life, but the fact they exploit him means that it unfairly puts workers in our country and other countries at a disadvantage. 
   You can't compete with slavery. This is slavery. You can dress it up and call it what you want. But this is about the nearest thing you can get to slavery.  Yet, unfortunately, the legislation before us does not address this issue. It simply relies on the criteria of the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, to extend countries trade benefits. 
   Is that adequate to what we know is going on in the world? 
   This criteria in GSP has been on the books since 1984--15 years. And child labor today is worse than it was 15 years ago. 
   Let me explain that the USTR, our own Trade Representative office, in its implementation and enforcement of GSP, has, I believe, abused the language in the statute that calls for taking steps to afford respect for workers' rights, including child labor. They have interpreted that any gesture made by a country will satisfy the requirements of GSP. 
   There is a list of five internationally recognized workers' rights provisions in GSP. Here they are: One, the right of association; two, the right to organize and bargain collectively; three, a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; four, a minimum age for employment of children; five, acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. 
   If a country takes steps--we don't say how big a step--if a country takes one teeny, little bit of a step in any one of those areas, they are allowed GSP benefits. They may have the most abusive forms of child labor, but if they have taken steps --for example, to have the right of free association--there you go. They have satisfied the requirements. Quite frankly, these countries should be taking steps in all five areas and enforcing the laws they have on the books. 
   The fact is, there are laws in Nepal against the use of child labor in these looms. There are laws in Pakistan against what Ashraf Irfan is doing. They all have laws on the books. They are just not enforcing them. Many of these countries have been able to provide cosmetic and unenforceable actions. Then they are recognized as having taken steps, and they are off the hook. In fact, the principal sponsor of the GSP criteria, an individual I served with in the House of Representatives, Representative Don Pease, wanted to set a high standard to ensure that countries not only have laws on their books with regard to these rights and minimum age requirements but that they were also being enforced. 
   When it got to conference, it was watered down. We have that today. If they meet just one of those criteria, that is all they have to do. 
   Fifteen years later after GSP, we now have a universal standard adopted this June by the ILO in Geneva. The ILO convention 182 is a well-defined, internationally accepted standard that I believe should be the criteria in granting any country U.S. trade benefits. ILO convention 182 that will hold everyone to one real and enforceable standard that was unanimously agreed to in Geneva this past June. 
   Again, as I have said before, I believe in free trade. I voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement. But I also believe in a level playing field. I also believe you should use trade to try to lift countries up--not lift countries up on the backs of children but to lift those countries up alongside of us. 
   U.S. workers can't compete with slaves. U.S. workers can't compete with 8-year-old kids working 12 and 14 hours a day who are paid almost nothing. You can dress it up any way you want. You can use whatever fancy words and language you want. That is slavery. These kids don't have a choice. They are forced to work in unbearable conditions. They don't have a choice. They do not have any freedom and liberty. Is that not the definition of slavery? Children are exploited for the economic gain of others. The child loses, the family loses, this country loses, and we in the world lose, too. 
   Every child lost to the workplace in this manner is a child who will not receive an education, learn a valuable skill, and help this country develop economically, or become a more active participant in the global market. When just one child is exploited in this manner, every one of us is diminished. 
   Recently, I came across a startling statistic. According to the UNICEF report entitled ``The State of the World's Children 1999,'' nearly 1 billion people will enter the 21st century--the new millennium--1 billion people will enter unable to read a book, or unable to sign their name because they are illiterate. This is a formula for instability, violence, and conflict down the road. 
   Nearly one-sixth of all humanity--think about it; three and a half times the population of the United States--next year won't even be able to read a book or sign their name. 
   This is the reason: Because they were denied an education when they were young. They were forced to work in front of rug looms, or making surgical equipment, glassware, and metals in mines and places such as that. 
   I believe it is shocking. I believe children making pennies a day spells disaster and conflict down the road. In cold, hard, economic terms, children making pennies a day will never buy a computer, they will never buy the software to run it, they will never purchase the latest music CD or a VCR to play American-made movies. 
   By allowing abusive and exploitative child labor to continue, we not only doom the child to a future of poverty and destitution, we doom future markets for American goods and services. 
   Why in our trade bill do we not just look one foot in front of our nose? We think about next year or the year after. Why not think about 10, 15, or 20 years from now, when 8-year-old Ashraf Irfan is in his twenties and thirties? What will he be buying? Will he buy a computer? Will he buy software and log on to the Internet? Will he buy clothes? No; he will be functionally illiterate. He will go to a store and watch television and see how the rest of the world lives and say, Why do I live like this? 
   It is ripe for revolutions, wars, insurrections, and instability all over the world. 
   Some say child labor shouldn't be dealt with in trade measures. I think this is wrongheaded thinking and closed minded. I believe we should be addressing child labor issues on trade measures. After all, we are ultimately talking about our trade policy. Not too long ago, agreements on intellectual property rights were not considered measures to be addressed by trade agreements. In the beginning, only tariffs and quotas were addressed by GATT because they were the most visible trade-distorting practices. 
   As time went on and as we began to develop more and more intellectual property in this country, we said we ought to include intellectual property rights and services, too. Now they have become an integral part of our trade agreements. The trade bill two years ago had several pages on intellectual property rights and one small, ineffectual paragraph on child labor. Now the WTO will consider rules dealing with foreign direct investment. That is another new step. A part of our trade agreements will now involve foreign direct investment and competition policy. 
   When I looked at the trade bill two years ago and saw all the pages dealing with intellectual property rights and I saw the little, ineffectual paragraph that actually turned the clock back on child labor, I thought to myself, if we can protect a song, can't we protect a kid? Think about it. We are going to protect someone's song so it can't be stolen, used, recorded, or sung by anybody else in the world--we can protect that; but we can't protect this kid? Tell me that child labor is not an apt policy for trade policy and trade bills. I believe it is time we do this. We as a nation cannot ignore what is happening. 
   In 1993, this Senate put itself on record in opposition to the exploitation of children for economic gain by passing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I submitted. That was in 1993. It was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Nonetheless, it passed. In 1994, I requested the Department of Labor to begin a series of reports on child labor. These reports now consist of five volumes representing the most comprehensive documentation ever assembled by the Government on this issue. Earlier this year, President Clinton issued an Executive order prohibiting the U.S. Government from procuring items made by forced or indentured child labor. We are making progress. 
   Some may say we have not even ratified convention 182 ourselves, so how do we expect others to abide by that? The chairman of the committee, Senator HELMS, had a hearing about 2  weeks ago on this. I thought it was a great hearing. I am pleased to report to my colleagues, just today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported out the new ILO convention. I am hopeful we will have it on the floor to get a unanimous vote and to ratify that before we leave this year. I have every reason to believe we 
   will before we leave this year.

   Mr. HARKIN. Normally, I would say fine to accept it, but since the Foreign Relations Committee passed it out this morning and I believe we will have it before the Senate before the end of the year, I think it is important for the Senate to express itself on this issue on the forms of abusive and exploitative child labor. It is important we do that. We have taken so many steps and come so far, we ought to do that. I am hopeful my colleagues will support this. 
   My amendment is cosponsored by Senator HELMS, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. WELLSTONE from Minnesota. There is a pretty broad philosophical spectrum encompassed on this amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be temporarily set aside, and I ask to call up my amendment No. 2495.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by my colleague from North Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS, and also by my friend from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE. As you can see, this has broad philosophical support. 
   I also at this moment inform my colleagues and thank Senator HELMS for reporting out just this morning, from the Foreign Relations Committee, the Convention 182 on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. That is record time. It was just adopted in June of this year. Then it had to go through some legal reviews and the President submitted to the Senate on August 5, 1999. So I want the chairman to know how much we appreciate the expeditious handling of that and the fact it is reported out. I am hopeful we can get a vote on it before we go out toward the end of this year. 
   The reason I had the clerk read the entire amendment is because it is not very long and not very convoluted. All it says, basically, is no country will get the benefits of this bill unless they adopt and enforce the provisions of this Convention 182 that was just adopted in June. 
   I might point out that there are 160 signators to this Convention. It is the first time in history the entire three representatives of the ILO Tripartite group, which are representatives from government, business, and labor agreed on the final form of a convention out of ILO. So it has broad support. 
   This talk about the worst forms of child labor, child prostitution, child trafficking in drugs, child trafficking itself, hazardous work, any forms of bondage or slavery--all of those are listed under 182. All this amendment says is the benefits of this bill cannot go to any country that does not adopt and enforce the provisions of 182. 
   I hope we can get a vote on the convention itself before we go out this fall. I believe it will say to all these countries in Africa: We are willing to trade with you, we are willing to help, but if you are going to have child prostitution, if you are going to traffic in kids, going to use kids in the drug trade, if you are going to chain them to looms, and you are not going to let them go to school, you are not going to permit them to have their own childhood--you are not going to get the benefits of this trade bill. 
   I think it is the least we can do, to try to help take one more step forward in eliminating child labor throughout the world.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Dr. Percy G. Harris, a distinguished Iowan from Cedar Rapids who is retiring after forty years of practicing family medicine. His biography is truly a great American story. 
   Dr. Harris was born into a poor family in Mississippi in 1927. He was orphaned as a teenager and moved to Waterloo, Iowa to live with his aunt. High school was a struggle for Percy Harris, but he finally received his diploma at the age of 19. After that, he was determined to make something of his life, and set his sights on becoming a doctor. He was admitted to medical school at Howard University in Washington, DC. He paid his way by working as an elevator operator and janitor. After he received his medical degree, Dr. Harris returned to Cedar Rapids, Iowa to open a family practice.  
   His practice grew and flourished over four decades. His patients credit him with the old-fashioned virtue of patience and say he is always willing to spend extra time caring for them. He believes in giving back and is active in the community as a civil rights leader and as a volunteer athletic doctor for Jefferson High School. 
   Percy Harris's life is a list of firsts. He was the first African-American to hold an internship at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids. He served as Linn County, Iowa's first and only medical examiner. In 1977, Governor Robert Ray appointed him to the Iowa Board of Regents where he served two terms as the Board's first African-American member. 
   Dr. Harris encountered adversity along the way, but he chose to view it as a challenge rather than an obstacle. In 1961, he and his wife, Lileah, decided to build a home for their growing family. They set their sights on a piece of property in one of Cedar Rapids' all white neighborhoods. The neighbors were up in arms, but Percy and Lileah Harris persisted and eventually purchased the property in a dispute that gained national attention. They built their family home on the property and raised 12 fine children, all of whom are now grown and successful in their own right. 
   Mr. President, Dr. Harris is one in a long American tradition of medical practitioners who put patients before profits, who lead by example, and who dedicate themselves to the well-being of humankind, from their community to their nation. I congratulate him on his many achievements and wish him well in all future endeavors. I know wherever he chooses to put his many talents, he will leave his mark.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to follow up with my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania. He is absolutely right; we have had a great working relationship for a long time. He has been open with me, as has his staff. We have had a great working relationship, and I think that proved itself in the bill we brought to the Senate floor. We had a great bill on the Senate floor. We had a strong, bipartisan vote, 75-23. It doesn't get much more bipartisan than that around here. It was about half and half, Democrats and Republicans, voting for it. So it was a good bill, a strong bill. 
   Now, my friend from Pennsylvania, for whom I have the highest respect and affinity, is right; there are a lot of good things in this bill. It reminds me of sitting down at a dinner and you have a smorgasbord of prime rib, steaks, lamb chops, pasta, and all this wonderful meal spread out, and you can sample each one, but you have to take a poison pill with it. Is that really worth eating? That is the problem with this bill. There are good things in it; I admit that to my friend from Pennsylvania. But this 1-percent across-the-board mindless cut that was added later on--I know not with the support of either one of us on the Senate side--is a poison pill. Then they tried to say this is 1 percent and you can take it from waste, fraud, and abuse, or anything like that. But when you looked at the fine print, it was 1 percent from every program, project, and activity;  every line item had to be cut by 1 percent. 
   That means in a lot of health programs, labor programs, and in some education programs, with that 1-percent cut, we are actually below what we spent last year--not a reduction in the increase. We are actually below what we were last year.

   Mr. HARKIN. When you look at this table, you can see why it is such a poison pill. I am greatly troubled by the vote coming up. I have been on this committee and the subcommittee now since 1985. I have been privileged to chair it and then to be the ranking member with Senator SPECTER as chairman. To my best recollection I have never voted against a Labor-HHS appropriations bill--not once --when Republicans were in charge and then when Democrats were in charge because we have always worked out a reasonable compromise. Well, this will mark the first time that I will have to vote against it. I don't do so with glee. I don't do so as some kind of a pound on the table, saying this is the worst thing in the world. With that poison pill in there, we just can't eat it. I don't think a lot of people can. 
   This is cutting Social Security, veterans' health care, Meals on Wheels, community health centers, afterschool programs, and education. Well, we all want to protect Social Security. Let's do it the right way. I believe we are going to have to sit down with the White House. I want to make sure Senator SPECTER, Senator STEVENS, and I are there at the table talking about this because I believe there is a way out of this. 
   We have a scoring from the CBO that if we have a look-back penalty on tobacco companies for their failure to reduce teen smoking, we can raise the necessary budget authority and outlays needed to meet what we have in our Labor-HHS bill without this mindless 1-percent across-the-board cut, without dipping into Social Security. I believe that is the way to go. I notice that Congressman PORTER, the chairman of the House subcommittee, was quoted just this morning as saying he favors making room for needed spending on discretionary programs by some type of a cigarette tax. 
   He said that with ``the revenue generated by such a proposal we could get rid of all of the accounting gimmicks such as the delayed obligations at NIH.'' 
   I want to say something else about that. There is no one who has been a stronger supporter of NIH than Senator SPECTER has been through all of this. 
   Again, we had a good bill. We had some delayed obligations at NIH. But we had an amount that they could live with. Now, we are up to an amount of about $7 billion, if I am not mistaken, in delayed obligations at NIH. I believe that is going to cause them some distinct hardships. We have to get those delayed obligations back down to the area we had when we had the bill on the Senate floor. 
   I compliment Senator SPECTER for doing a great job. He is a wonderful friend of mine, and he has done a great job of leadership on this bill. It is too bad that other authorities someplace decided to put in a poison pill. But, hopefully, after this is over, we can work together, we can get it out, and we can have a bill that is close to the one that we passed on the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Labor-HHS bill which has been attached to the D.C. appropriations bill. I will not have any comments on the D.C. appropriations bill; I leave that to my friend and colleague, my leader, Senator DURBIN from Illinois.

   Mr. HARKIN. Today we are bringing up--and I guess the vote will be held on Tuesday--the conference report that accompanies the D.C. appropriations bill. This report, as we now know, also includes the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill negotiated by the House and Senate appropriators. 
   I regret very much that the conference agreement includes a poison pill inserted by the House Republican leadership, an irresponsible and indiscriminate across-the-board cut against all discretionary programs, projects, and activities. Later I will discuss that at length. 
   First, I commend the work of my colleague and chairman on the appropriations bill, Senator SPECTER. He and I have had a great working relationship through the years, a true partnership every year on this bill, first when I was Chair and he was ranking member and now he is Chair and I am ranking. 
   Senator SPECTER has a deep commitment to the vitally important health, education, labor, research, and other initiatives in this bill. Senator SPECTER and his staff have always treated our side fairly. I want him and them to know how much I appreciate that. I not only appreciate it; I understand how important it is in terms of completing our Nation's business. 
   A few weeks ago, the Senate passed the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25; 41 Democrats and 32 Republicans voted for it. This is an exceedingly strong vote. It got this strong vote because Senator SPECTER and I worked together and we worked with Senators from both sides of the aisle to craft a bill that truly reflected our Senate priorities. It was a good bill. It provides a major increase for medical research. It provides $500 million more than the President requested for education. It maintained our commitment to worker safety provisions. 
   It did have one major flaw. It did not fund the President's class size initiative in an acceptable manner. Nonetheless, I argued strongly for its passage. At the time, I told Members on my side of the aisle I would work to resolve the class size issue in conference. We had a good Senate bill. We had a strong Senate vote, with 73 votes on the Senate side. 
   The House of Representatives, on the other hand, was not able even to produce a bill. The Appropriations Committee on the House side reported out a bill. It cut education, cut job training, had a whole lot of bad labor riders dealing with workers' safety protection. But the full House never even took it up. 
   Several weeks ago, we began something I had never ever engaged in  around here; we began a nonconference conference. We could not have had a conference because the House never passed a bill, but we met with the House appropriators. Congressman JOHN PORTER, the chairman of the Labor-HHS subcommittee on the House side--Senator SPECTER and I, and our staffs, met with him in an effort to move the process forward. When our committee was working on it, we made good progress. We worked together to produce an agreement that was very close to the Senate bill. 
   Again, I compliment and commend my colleague on the other side of the aisle in the House, Congressman PORTER, for working together in an open and constructive manner to produce a bill I believe could have garnered votes and could have passed. If we could have ended the conference at that point, I would be here today speaking in favor of the Labor-HHS and Education bill. However that is not the case. 
   With regard to the class size reduction issue, I raised the point in our negotiations with the House that 38 Senators encouraged the President to veto the conference report if it did not include this initiative. However, I was not able to convince the negotiators on this point. I am, however, convinced this issue will be addressed in any final bill. But putting this class size initiative aside, we had put together, I thought, really a pretty good agreement. We included a large increase for biomedical research, $100 million for community health centers, and a big increase for Head Start. None of what I term ``the offensive House riders'' the House had put on for labor, health, and safety--none of those were included. Largely, it reflected most of the priorities of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, both Republican and Democratic. 
   As I said, if we could have ended it there, we probably would have had a pretty good bill. But then Republican House leadership got involved. First, they insisted key programs be cut. They insisted afterschool programs be reduced by $100 million. They insisted the small increase we had for critical family planning services be eliminated. They insisted on cutting Goals 2000. Why? I don't know, unless it was because it was a Presidential priority. 
   Next, they insisted on further delayed obligations. We had some delayed obligations, but I think they were delayed obligations with which we could have lived, with which the Departments and Agencies could have lived. But the delayed obligations the House leadership put in, I think, will cause some real problems at the National Institutes of Health. 
   I have long said not only do we have to increase the money going to the NIH, that we had to double their budget over 5 years--of which I have been very supportive--but that we need continuity, so grants could go out to researchers that are not interrupted, so when researchers start on a program and a research project they can continue. 
   With the delayed obligations and the extent to which we have them in this bill, it appears that NIH will not be able to fund these research programs on a longer term basis. It is just going to be from 1 year to the next. As any person familiar 
   with research can tell you, that is not the best way to conduct research. I think the delayed obligations are going to cut back on the good that we did in terms of increasing the funding for NIH. 
   Next, the House leaders also put in a $121 million reduction in salaries and expenses. That was over and above the reductions we had already made on the Senate side. We cut pretty deeply in the salaries and expenses and administrative costs of the Departments under our jurisdiction, but the House leadership cut another $121 million. I believe that is unacceptable. 
   After that, the House leadership added--over, I might say, the opposition of most of the appropriators--the poison pill across-the-board cut. The House Republican leaders repeatedly said this cut will give each Department the ability to cut fraud, waste, and abuse. I take a back seat to no one in this body or the other body or on either side of the aisle when it comes to fighting fraud, waste, and abuse in government programs, but that is not what this provision says, nor would it accomplish that. This is not a 1-percent cut that can be taken from any broad array of programs. Every program, project, and activity in this bill has to be cut by 1 percent. 
   So when you see the House Republican leaders on television saying: 1 percent, that's nothing, we can take that out of fraud, waste, and abuse--sorry. That is not the way the provision is written. The provision is written it is 1 percent. It is not 1 percent of the increase; it is 1 percent of the total that goes to each line item in this bill, every single line item has to be cut. 
   You might say that is not, that 1 percent--that doesn't sound like a lot. When you put it in the Social Security system and the offices that administer Social Security, it cuts it big time. It cuts millions of dollars out of veterans' health care. It cuts Meals on Wheels, community health centers, afterschool programs; it cuts education. Again, I point out it does not just cut the increases; it cuts many important programs actually below last year's level. 
   I will read from a list here of some programs that actually will have less than last year because of this across-the-board cut. Adult job training--we saw the other day our economy is booming at unprecedented rates. But the economy is changing. For example, we had an announcement the other day in Iowa a major packing plant was closing its doors 5 days before Christmas. I will not go into that right now, but talk about heartless; 5 days before Christmas, Iowa Beef Processors is closing its doors, and over 400 people are being thrown out of work. We need to retrain those people. We need to retrain them for the new kind of economy we have. The bill before us cuts adult job training to less than what we had last year. It is the wrong way to go. 
   Youth opportunity grants, community service jobs for senior citizens are cut below last year's level. Family planning, AIDS prevention, substance abuse block grants, child welfare and child abuse programs are all cut to less than what we had last year. This is not a cut in the increase, this is a cut below what we had last year. 
   Teacher training: I met with some educators in my office yesterday who were here from Irving School in Dubuque. They were getting an award as one of the blue-ribbon schools of America, a great award. I mentioned the teacher training program was being cut to less than last year. They said: How could this possibly be? This is the program, the Eisenhower math and science program, that keeps our teachers up to par with what is happening so they can better teach their students. You can vote for this bill if you want, Mr. President, but if you do, you are voting to cut teacher training programs for Goals 2000, the literacy programs.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the House Republican leadership and others have argued this across-the-board cut was needed to protect Social Security. We all agree we want to protect the Social Security surplus. But the Congressional Budget Office says even with the across-the-board cut, they are going to have to tap Social Security by $17 billion. So leaving that aside, an across-the-board cut is not the answer. Let's protect Social Security. Let's do it in the right way. Let's make the tough decisions, not hide behind an across-the-board cut. 
   Frankly, there are other offsets we could use. I say we should impose a penalty on tobacco companies that fail  to meet targets for reducing youth smoking. In fact, I have in my hand a specific proposal to do just that, to set a goal of reducing teen smoking by 15 percent. That is a modest goal. If they fail to meet that modest goal, they would have to pay a penalty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this proposal would raise almost $6 billion in fiscal year 2000. 
   That is $2.8 billion more than is saved by this across-the-board cut. It would have the added benefit of protecting our kids from the deadly addiction of tobacco. 
   I want to be very clear--my esteemed friend from Illinois is sitting here--this is not a new idea. We have voted on this before. In fact, this was part of a proposal the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Ohio proposed and which actually passed this body. So why don't we do this rather than having an across-the-board cut in teacher training, the substance abuse block grant, health programs, AIDS prevention programs. Let's do something we already said we ought to do--cut teen smoking. And if the tobacco companies cannot meet it, they pay a penalty. Unfortunately, the conference report we have before us does not take this path. 
   With all the respect, admiration, and friendship I have for Senator SPECTER--and he has worked doggedly on this bill; he has worked hard to protect education and health and research programs; he and his staff have worked openly with me and my staff--reluctantly I will have to vote against this conference agreement. 
   The poison pill across-the-board cut did it. I do so with reluctance because I believe we crafted a good bill in the Senate, and it would have avoided all kinds of political maneuvering if we had the bill we passed in the Senate. If we followed that bipartisan path Senator SPECTER and I worked on and set up in the Senate that was reflected in a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, we would have had a much different result. 
   It is very clear to everyone, if this conference agreement is passed by the Senate, it will be vetoed by the President, and that veto will not be overridden. When that happens, I plan to work very hard with my chairman, Senator SPECTER, and will be sitting at that table to help craft a bill with our House colleagues and, of course, with the White House, that reflects congressional priorities but does not make these inordinate, mindless across-the-board cuts and that has offsets that truly do reduce teen smoking and help us meet our goals of not invading the Social Security trust funds.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to reflect on the passing of one of the true giants in the Senate, someone with whom I was privileged to work for the last 15 years I have been in the Senate--Senator John Chafee, a good man with a great heart and a great soul, a statesman in every sense of the word, a public servant unequaled, a man who dedicated his entire professional life to the service of his country. 
   He was a good friend of people on both sides of this aisle. He was respected by all who knew him and served with him, and he returned that respect in kind. During all the efforts with which I had worked with him through the years, he always returned respect. If you did not agree with him, he respected your position. I never once heard John Chafee belittle a  Member of this body or the other body because of a position that was taken by that Senator or Congressman. He respected people's views. He respected the fact you come from a different viewpoint. 
   He was a great bridge builder. He would reach out to people, always looking for a way to craft a consensus, always having in mind ``I am not right all the time and you are not right all the time, but if we work together, we can build a consensus and find a middle way.'' 
   He set aside partisanship. He put his energies into working for the greater good. He won high praise from a wide spectrum of admirers, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. You cannot get much broader than that. 
   He is a true American hero. He never talked about it. He left college in 1942 and joined the Marine Corps and fought in one of the bloodiest battles of the U.S. Marine Corps in Guadalcanal. If that was not enough, he fought during the invasion of Okinawa. Those were two of the bloodiest battles of World War II. 
   He left military service, but came back to fight, once again, in Korea in 1951. I do not mean sitting behind a desk either; I mean as a soldier in the field. Between his tours of duty, he had already earned his bachelor's degree at Yale and his law degree at Harvard. A career of distinguished service followed: Rhode Island House of Representatives, Governor of the State, Secretary of the Navy, and United States Senator. He was the first Republican Senator elected in Rhode Island in 46 years. 
   Having known him well, I know, no matter where his public service took him, his heart was always in Rhode Island. In talking with him when he announced he was retiring, he said he looked forward to retiring to his home State of Rhode Island. 
   He wore many titles in his lifetime--lieutenant, captain, Governor, Secretary, Senator, but he was proudest of being a husband, a father, and a grandfather. He was devoted to his family: Virginia, 5 children, 12 grandchildren. I know their loss is tremendous, but I hope in the days, weeks, and months ahead they will take comfort in John Chafee's magnificent legacy. 
   When the major achievements of the 20th century are recounted, many will bear his mark: the Clean Air Act, Superfund, Social Security improvements, fair housing, civil rights. He played a major role in every major piece of environmental legislation that has been passed in the last two decades. He fought for health care coverage for low-income families and expanded coverage for uninsured children. He fought hard for the Family and Medical Leave Act. John made it his mission to make sure no American fell between the cracks. America's women, children, and families are the beneficiaries. 
   I had the privilege of working with John Chafee on a couple of major issues. I worked very closely with him for over a year tackling our Nation's leading public health problem: the use of tobacco. With Senator GRAHAM from Florida, we introduced the first bipartisan bill. We called it the KIDS Act to protect our children from tobacco. 
   Senator Chafee had the courage to take on the tobacco industry and provided great leadership on this issue. He did it because of his unwavering dedication to improve health, save lives, and protect our kids. 
   While we did not succeed with our bill, we did succeed on another important effort, and that is combatting teen smoking. Senator Chafee and I offered an amendment to fully fund FDA's initiative to have store clerks check the IDs of children and young people before they sell cigarettes. 
   And as you walk up to the counter in your 7-Eleven and other stores, right now you will see they have put in place an ID check. They check IDs before selling cigarettes. 
   Senator Chafee led that initiative. 
   Senate passage of this amendment was the first big defeat of big tobacco in the Senate in 10 years, since we passed the ban on smoking on airlines. That effort has had a big impact. Thousands and thousands of kids have been prevented from buying a deadly addictive product. 
   As I said, that important victory would not have been possible without John Chafee and his skill at forming a bipartisan coalition and crafting a creative solution to this very pressing problem. 
   I also had the privilege of working with John Chafee on disability issues. As the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Bush in 1990, Senator Chafee and I formed a working relationship on this issue. He was a major champion for creating alternatives to institutions for people with disabilities, to get people out of institutions and into their homes and into their communities where they could be fully integrated into all aspects of American life. 
   Senator Chafee's work to create the Medicaid home and community-based waivers opened the door for independent living for tens of thousands of people with disabilities across our country. 
   I can tell you this has been a movement that has taken hold in our country. It has provided so much joy to families. It has provided opportunities for people with disabilities. 
   I had a family in my office the other day from Iowa, the Piper family, Sylvia and Larry Piper, and their son Dan. I have known Dan for a long time, since he was in high school. Dan has Down's syndrome, but he was mainstreamed in school, after his parents had told him they probably would have to put him in institutions for the rest of his life. They got him in high school. He was the captain of the football team. He acted in school plays. And after he got out of high school, he went out and got a job. He has been working now for several years, and he lives in a community setting. He has his own apartment. He has his own job, pays taxes, buys his own TV set. He told me he just bought a VCR. Community-based living. His parents are proud of him. They are happy he is out there on his own. They know his future is going to be bright. He is not stuck in an institution someplace. 
   Well, sitting in my office with my friends, the Pipers, and my long-time friend, Dan, I had to think of Senator Chafee and his leadership to create the community-based waivers that allow people with disabilities to live independently. 
   He also worked in a true bipartisan manner to promote maternal and child health programs. John Chafee's commitment to fighting for what he believed in was matched by the dedication of his long-time and loyal staff. My heart goes out to all of them. I have worked with them for a long time. They are a great staff. 
   John Chafee was a very humble, unassuming giant in the Senate. He had a broad, inclusive vision. He was a principled and thoughtful person. He was kind and generous. He asked and gave the best of himself in everything he did. He never sought recognition. He rolled up his sleeves and went to work. His spirit and his voice will be sorely missed. I am privileged to have called him my friend. 
   In closing, at times such as this I always remember the question that was put to John Kennedy one time. A reporter once asked President Kennedy how he wanted to be remembered. President Kennedy gave it a momentary thought, and he said he believed the highest tribute that could be paid to anyone would be to be remembered as a good and decent human being. So if I could use that as the highest tribute that can be paid to anyone, we remember John Chafee as a good and decent human being. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. The Developmental Disabilities Act has been a cornerstone of federal registration for people with disabilities. I am pleased to be here today with Senator JEFFORDS, Senator KENNEDY, and other colleagues from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to introduce legislation that will reauthorize this important law. 
   The entities funded under the Act--The Developmental Disabilities Councils, University Affiliated Programs, and the Protection and Advocacy agencies--have enabled us to move away from a service system dominated by large public institutions, and to establish services where families and individuals want them--in their own homes, communities, and neighborhoods. In fact, the Supreme Court cited the Developmental Disabilities Act in the recent Olmstead decision as one of several pieces of federal legislation that secure opportunities for people with disabilities to enjoy the benefits of community living. 
   This year's reauthorization is important for a number of reasons. First, we must continue our progress toward providing better community services for all people with disabilities. The Development Disabilities Act is instrumental in that work. 
   Second, we must ensure that people with developmental disabilities are free from abuse and neglect in all aspects of the service delivery system. This bill will help protect people with disabilities from abuse and neglect no matter where they live--inside an institution or in the community. 
   And, finally, we must do more to strengthen and support families as they provide care and support to family members with a disability. Family Support programs are one of the fastest growing services on the State level. State policy-makers are realizing that family caregivers are the true heroes of our long-term care system and they need help if they are going to keep their children at home. In this year's reauthorization of the Developmental Disabilities Act, we have included a Family Support program to help states strengthen and coordinate their support systems for family caregivers. 
   I commend the disability groups for all of their work to make this reauthorization possible. I thank my colleagues and their staff for their hard work to reauthorize this law into the next millennium. I applaud their commitment to people with developmental disabilities.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our friend and colleague John Chafee was a good man, a first among equals. He was a statesman and a public servant. He dedicated his professional life to the service of his country. He was a good friend to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   John Chafee was respected by all who knew and served with him. And he returned that respect in kind. He was a bridge builder, always looking for a way to craft consensus. 
   He set aside partisanship and put his energies into working for the greater good. And he won high praise from a wide spectrum of admirers, from the ACLU to the Chamber of Commerce! 
   John had an early and lifelong sense of duty to his country. He left college in 1942 to join the Marine Corps. He fought in the U.S. invasion of Guadalcanal and later on Okinawa. He returned to active military duty in 1951 in Korea. Between his tours of duty, John earned his bachelor's degree at Yale and his law degree at Harvard. 
   He built a career of distinguished service to his state and his nation. He served in the Rhode Island House of Representatives (1957-63), as Governor of Rhode Island (1963-69), as Secretary of the Navy (1969-72). And in 1977, John Chafee came to the United States Senate, the first Republican Senator elected in his state in 46 years. 
   No matter where public service took him, his heart was always in Rhode Island. And it was to Rhode Island that he planned to retire next year. 
   John Chafee wore many titles in his lifetime, and he wore them all with distinction: Captain, Governor, Secretary, Senator. 
   But I believe that John was proudest of being a husband, father, and grandfather. He was devoted to his family--to Virginia, their five children, and twelve grandchildren. Their loss is tremendous, and I hope in the days and weeks ahead they take some small comfort in John's magnificent legacy. 
   When the major achievements of the 20th Century are recounted, many of them will bear the mark of John Chafee: the Clean Air Act, the Superfund, Social Security, fair housing, civil rights. 
   He played a major role in every major piece of environmental legislation that has passed during the past two decades. He fought for health care coverage for low income families and expanded coverage for uninsured children. 
   He fought for the Family and Medical Leave Act. John made it his mission to ensure that no American fell between the cracks. And America's women, children, and families are the beneficiaries. 
   John Chafee and I worked together long and hard to protect kids from tobacco addiction. In 1998, we introduced the first comprehensive bipartisan tobacco prevention bill--the Kids Deserve Freedom from Tobacco Act. 
   Our bill--also known as the KIDS Act--was designed to cut tobacco use by kids in half over a three-year period. John took some risks in joining this bipartisan effort, but he did it because he was a passionate advocate for children. 
   I also had the privilege of working with John on disability issues. He was a major champion for creating alternatives to institutions for people with disabilities. 
   Senator Chafee's work to create the Medicaid home and community-based waivers opened the doors to independent living for tens of thousands of people with disabilities. His efforts in this area alone are too numerous to recount. 
   In addition, he worked in true bipartisan manner to promote maternal and child health programs and to protect thousands of children with disabilities from losing SSI. 
   John Chafee's commitment to fighting for what he believed in was matched by the dedication of his longtime, loyal staff. Our hearts go out to all of them. 
   Mr. President, John Chafee was a humble giant. He had a broad, inclusive vision. He was principled and thoughtful. He asked and gave the best of himself in everything he did. He didn't seek recognition. He just rolled up his sleeves and got to work. His spirit and his voice will be sorely missed. I am privileged to call him my friend.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me this time, and I thank her for her strong support for women's rights and the constitutional right of women to make their own decisions in terms of reproductive health. 
   I thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, for her strong support, and my friend and colleague  from Illinois who will be speaking shortly, Senator DURBIN. 
   It has been said by the proponent of the underlying bill that this amendment of mine has nothing to do with his underlying bill. 
   I beg to differ and to disagree. 
   This amendment has everything to do with the underlying amendment because, really, what my friend from Pennsylvania is seeking to do is to begin the long process--which I am sure he would like to have a shorter process--to overturn Roe v. Wade, to take away the constitutional right that women have in our country today to decide their own reproductive health and procedures. That is really what this is about: A chipping away--one thing here, another thing there. 
   If anyone believes, by some fantasy dream, if the underlying bill of the Senator from Pennsylvania would ever become the law of the land, that this would be the end of it, that the Senator from Pennsylvania and those who believe and feel as he does would not feel the need to do anything else with regard to a woman's right to choose, is sadly mistaken. They will be back again with something else, and back again with something else, until Roe v. Wade is overturned. That is really what they are about. 
   So as far as I know, this will be the first time that the Senate of the United States has ever been able to speak; that is, to vote on how we feel and how we believe Roe v. Wade ought to be interpreted as the law of the land. 
   This is the first time, that I know of, that we have had the opportunity to vote up or down on whether or not we believe that Roe v. Wade should stand and should not be overturned and that it is, indeed, a good decision. 
   Again, I just read the ``Findings'' of my amendment. My amendment is very short. It just says:  
   Congress finds that--

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, once again, the Senator from Pennsylvania said that my amendment is about changing the subject. He also made the point that this bill has nothing to do with Roe v. Wade. 
   Most respectfully, I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   This law does not provide for any protection of a woman's health. Of course, they keep using the term ``partial-birth abortion.'' That is nowhere found in the medical lexicon. That is not a medical term. That is a political pejorative term used to excite and inflame passions. That is all it is. Let's be honest about that. I think if the other side was sincere in wanting to end late-term abortions, they could have supported Senator DURBIN's amendment yesterday, which would have accomplished that. 
   Finally, in States where they have passed legislation such as the Santorum bill--the underlying bill here--doctors in those States stopped performing all abortions because it was so unclear as to the timeframe. There is no timeframe in this at all. That is why the circuit courts, in all these instances, have struck these laws down as being unconstitutional. A recent case in our circuit upheld a case in Iowa on this law. 
   So, really, what this vote is about is whether or not the Senate wants to turn back the clock and move back to the pre-Roe v. Wade days of back-alley abortions, the days when women committed suicide when they were faced with a desperate choice, the days of women dying or being permanently disfigured from illegal abortions, when women became sterile and could not have children because they had illegally botched abortions. 
   This vote about to occur is whether the Senate believes that in the most personal and heart-wrenching decisions the politicians should know what is best, and not the women, their families, and their doctors, and according to their own religious beliefs and faiths. That is what this vote is about. It is about whether or not we believe Roe v. Wade was a wise decision and whether or not ought to have their rights to decide their own reproductive health. It has everything to do with the underlying bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered will basically express the sense of the Congress in support of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. With all of the amendments that keep coming up and trying to chip away at Roe v. Wade, Senator BOXER and I decided that it was important for us to see if there was support in the Congress for Roe v. Wade. 
   I know there are some groups around the United States that believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. I do not believe that. I think it was an eminently wise decision. As time goes on, and as we reflect back, the decision enunciated by Justice Blackmun becomes more and more profound and more elegant in its simplicity and its straightforwardness. 
   However, it seems as we get wrapped up in these emotionally charged debates on partial birth abortion, we lose sight of what it is that gave women their full rights under the laws of our Nation and our States. 
   I was interested a couple of minutes ago in what Senator MIKULSKI pointed out; that the eminent theologian, St. Thomas Aquinas, had basically stipulated that in soul man--that is the putting of the soul in the human body--occurred 6 weeks after conception for a  man but 10 weeks after conception for a woman. That was a theology that held for a long time. 
   I studied Saint Thomas Aquinas when I was in Catholic school. He was an eminent theologian, as I said. We look back and we say: That is ridiculous. The very division of 6 weeks for a man and 10 weeks for a woman is kind of ridiculous. Medical science has progressed. We know a lot of things they did not know at that time. What will we know 50 years from now that we do not know today? 
   Women, through the centuries, as we have developed more and more the concept of the rights of man--and I use man in the terms of mankind, all humans, the human race--that as we enlarge the concept of human rights--those rights we have that cannot legitimately be interfered with or trespassed upon by the power of any government--as we progressed in our thinking about those human rights, all too often women were left out of the equation. 
   It was not until recent times, even in our own country, that women had the right to own property. It was not until recent times that women even had the right to vote in this country, not to say what rights are still denied women in other countries around the globe. 
   As we progressed in our thinking of human rights, we have come a long way from Thomas Aquinas who said that for some reason a man gets a soul a lot earlier than a woman gets a soul. Yes, we've come a long way. 
   I believe our concept of human rights now is basically that human rights applies to all of us, regardless of gender, regardless of position at birth, regardless of nationality or station in life, race, religion, nationality; that human rights inure to the person. 
   One of the expansions of those human rights was for women to have the right to choose. After all, it is the female who bears children. That particular right inures to a woman. It was the particular genius of Roe v. Wade that Justice Blackmun laid out an approach to reproductive rights that basically guarantees to the woman in the first trimester a total restriction on the State's power to interfere with that decision. In the second trimester, the State may, under certain inscriptions, interfere. And in the third trimester, after the further decision of the Casey case, the 
   States may interfere to save the life or health of the mother. 
   We have a situation now where women in our country are given--I should not use the word ``given''--but have attained their equal rights and their full human rights under law. 
   That was Roe v. Wade. Since that time, many in the legislatures of our States and many in this legislature, the Congress of the United States--the House and the Senate--have sought repeatedly to overturn Roe v. Wade; if not totally to overturn it, but to chip away at it--a little bit here, a little bit there, with the final goal to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
   According to CRS, only 10 pieces of legislation were introduced in either the House or Senate before the Roe decision. Since 1973, more than 1,000 separate legislative proposals have been introduced. The majority of these bills have sought to restrict abortions. 
   Unfortunately, what is often lost in the rhetoric and in some of this legislation--is the real significance of the Roe decision. 
   The Roe decision recognized the right of women to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. The decision whether to bear a child is profoundly private and life altering. As the Roe Court understood, without the right to make autonomous decisions about pregnancy, a woman could not participate freely and equally in society. 
   I do not believe that any abortion is desirable--nobody does. As Catholic and a father, I've struggled with it myself. However, I do not believe that it is appropriate to insist that my personal views be the law of the land. 
   I think there are some things that Congress can do to prevent unintended pregnancy and reduce abortion by increasing funding for family planning, mandating insurance coverage for contraception and supporting contraception research. 
   Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I believe it would establish the one important principle that we can agree on--that despite the difference in our views, we will not strip away a woman's fundamental right to choose. 
   So I think we need to make it clear, we need to make it clear that we have no business--especially we in the Congress of the United States--have no business interfering with a woman's fundamental right to choose.

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to my colleague from California, I want to thank her for her stalwart support and defense of Roe v. Wade through all these years. I follow in her footsteps, I can assure you. But I remember as a kid growing up in a small town in rural Iowa, that it was commonplace knowledge, if you had the money, and you were a young woman who became pregnant, you could go out of State; you could go someplace and have an abortion. But if you were poor and had nowhere else to go, you went down to sought out someone who would do an illegal abortion. Those are the women who suffered and died and were permanently disfigured.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California. I thank her for the question. I will elaborate on that in just a minute. 
   Again, I say to the Senator from California, we do need to send a strong message that the freedom to choose is no more negotiable than the freedom to speak or the freedom to worship. It is nonnegotiable. 
   This ruling of Roe v. Wade has touched all of us in very different ways. As the Senator from California just pointed out, it is estimated that as many as 5,000 women died yearly from 
   illegal abortions before Roe. 
   In the 25 years since Roe, the variety and level of women's achievements have reached unprecedented levels. The Supreme Court recently observed:  
   The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.   
   I will also quote Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter in the Casey case:  
   At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  
   I think that is what this is all about--whether we will use the heavy hand of the State to enforce certain individuals' concepts of when life begins, how life begins, when can a person have an abortion, when can a person not. People are divided on this issue. Some people are uncertain about it. I quarrel with myself all the time about it because it is as multifaceted as there are individual humans on the face of the Earth. 
   I would not sit in judgment on any person who would choose to have an abortion, especially a woman who went through the terrifying, agonizing, soul-wrenching procedure of having a late-term abortion because her health and her life was in danger. That must be one of the most soul-wrenching experiences a person can go through. 
   And you want me to sit in judgment on that? The Senator from Pennsylvania wants to be able to say: Here it is. You can't deviate from that. I am sorry; that is not our role; that is not the role of the Government or the State. 
   That is why, again, I believe it is particularly important that we cut through the fog that surrounds this issue and get to the heart of it, which is Roe v. Wade. 
   I used the word ``elegant.'' It means simplistic, simplicity. Elegant: Not convoluted, not hard to understand, not shrouded and complex, but elegant, straightforward, simple in its definition. That is Roe v. Wade. 
   There are now those who want to come along and change it and make it complex, indecipherable, benefiting maybe one person one way, adding to the detriment of another person another way, so that we are right back where we were before Roe v. Wade. 
   So I believe very strongly that we need to express ourselves on this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That is why I will be asking for a rollcall vote at the appropriate time because it is going to be important for us to send a message on how important it is to preserve a woman's fundamental right to choose under Roe v. Wade.

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Illinois has stated it elegantly, very simply and straightforward. That is the essence of the amendment, and the Senator is correct. Voting on the amendment, which I offered, a vote in favor of my amendment would be a vote to uphold Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose. A vote against it would be a vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and to take away a woman's right to choose. 
   The amendment I have offered would be consistent with the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for enlightening this issue and for clearly drawing what this amendment is all about. 
   Again, a vote in favor of the amendment which I have offered states we will support Roe v. Wade, that Roe v. Wade should be the law, that a woman's right to choose should be kept under the 
   provisions of Roe v. Wade, as further elaborated in the Casey case. A vote against my amendment would say you would be in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and taking away a woman's fundamental right to choose. 
   I agree with the Senator from Illinois. 
   In closing my remarks, knowing others want to speak, the Roe decision recognized the right of women to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. The decision is a profoundly private, life-altering decision. As the Roe Court understood, without the right to make autonomous decisions about pregnancy, a woman could not participate freely and equally in our society. 
   I think there are some things we ought to be doing to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce abortions. We could, for example, increase funding for family planning. Every time we try to do that, there are those who are opposed to increasing funding for family planning. We could mandate insurance coverage for contraception. That could help. But, no, there are those who say we shouldn't do that either. We could have more support for contraception research. There are those who say, no, we shouldn't do that either. And those who are opposed, by and large, to increasing funding for family planning and insurance coverage for contraception and contraception research are the same ones who want to overturn Roe v. Wade or take  away a woman's right to have a late-term abortion in the case of grievous health or life-threatening situations. 
   A little bit off the subject of Roe v. Wade, but which I think is particularly important to point out, is that Saturday, October 23, 3 days from today, will mark the 1-year anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered in his home in Amherst, NY, 1 year ago this Saturday. As most are aware, there have been five sniper attacks on U.S. and Canadian physicians who perform abortions since 1994. Each of these attacks has occurred on or close to Canada's Remembrance Day, November 11. 
   All of the victims in these attacks were shot in their homes by a hidden sniper who used a long-range rifle. Dr. Slepian tragically was killed. Three other physicians were seriously wounded in these attacks. 
   I am reading a letter sent to the majority leader, Senator LOTT, dated October 18, signed by the executive director of the National Abortion Federation, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the executive director of the American Medical Women's Association, the executive director of Medical Students for Choice, the president and CEO of the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, and the executive director of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health. All of these signed the letter to Senator LOTT spelling out what I said. The letter goes on:  
   Federal law enforcement officials are urging all women's health care providers, regardless of their geographic location, to be on a high state of alert and to take appropriate protective precautions during the next several weeks. Security directives have been issued to all physicians who perform abortions for clinics or in their private practices, and to all individuals who have been prominent on the abortion issue. 
   Senator Lott, on behalf of our physician members, and in the interest of the public safety of the citizens of the US and Canada, we urge you to reconsider the scheduling of a floor debate on S-1692 at this time. As you are aware, each time this legislation has been considered, extremely explicit, emotional and impassioned debate has been aroused. 
   We have grave fears that the movement of this bill during this particularly dangerous period has the potential to inflame anti-abortion violence that might result in tragic consequences. 
   We sincerely hope that you will take the threats of this October-November period as seriously as we do, and that you will use your considerable influence to ensure that the Senate does not inadvertently play into the hands of extremists who might well be inspired to violence during this time. We urge you to halt the movement of S. 1692. Please work with us to ensure that the senseless acts of violence against U.S. citizens are not repeated in 1999.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is one other thing I want to mention. I am going to read a letter because this person is a personal friend of mine, someone I have gotten to know over the years. I believe the Senator from California has a picture of Kim Koster. I ask a page to bring me the picture back here, if I may have that. 
   This photo is Kim Koster and her husband, Dr. Barrett Koster. They are both friends of mine, whom I have known for I guess about 3 or 4 years. I am going to read her letter in its entirety:  
   My name is Kim Koster. My husband, Dr. Barrett Koster, and I have been married for more than seven years. We have known since before we were married that we wanted very much to have children. 
   To our joy, in November of 1996 we discovered that we were expecting. The news was a thrill, to us and to our family and friends. We were showered with gifts and hand-me-downs, new toys, books and love. Barry's family gave us a 19th-century cradle which had rocked his family to sleep since before his grandmother Sophie was born more than 100 years ago. 
   Our first ultrasound was scheduled a little more than four months into the pregnancy. On Thursday, February 20, we saw our baby and spent five short minutes rejoicing in the new life, and then the blow fell. The radiologist informed us that he had ``significant concerns'' about the size of the baby's head. His diagnosis was the fatal neural tube defect known as anencephaly, or the lack of a brain. After four months of excitement and joy, our world came crashing down around us. 
   Once the diagnosis was made, there was no further medical treatment available for me in our hometown, and we were referred to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. Our first OB appointment there was set for Monday morning. My husband and I spent that long weekend, the longest of our lives, doing research on anencephaly, talking with family and friends, and hearing personal stories about the fate of anencephalic babies. 
   In Iowa City, a genetics OB specialist examined a new ultrasound and immediately confirmed the diagnosis. An alpha-feto-protein blood test and amniotic fluid sample only drove the truth harder home. Our fetus had only a rudimentary brain. There were blood vessels, which enabled the heart to beat, and ganglion, which enabled basic motor function. There was no cerebellum and no cerebral cortext. There was no skull above the eyes. 
   I had been preparing for pregnancy for more than a year with diet, exercise and prenatal vitamins, including the dose of folic recommended to prevent neural tube defects. Yet we still lost our child to one of the most severe and lethal birth defects known. Our baby had no brain--would never hear the Mozart and Bach I played for it every day on our great-grandmother's piano, would never look up into our eyes or snuggle close to our hearts, would never even have an awareness of its own life. 
   On Tuesday, February 25, 1997, my husband and I chose to end my pregnancy with a common abortion procedure known as ``D and E.'' As difficult as it was, I literally thank God that I had that option. As long as there are families who face the devastating diagnosis we received, abortions must remain a safe and legal alternative. 
   In 1998, Barry and I discovered to our delight that I was pregnant again. Although we were overjoyed, our happiness was tempered by the knowledge that we had a 1-in-25 chance of a second anencephalic pregnancy. This time, we asked our loved ones to hold off on the baby gifts, we played no Bach, and every week was a mix of excitement and unavoidable worry. And on July 17, 1998, an ultrasound revealed the worst. We had a second anencephalic pregnancy--a second daughter lost to this lethal birth defect.  
   Fortunately for my medical care, the so-called ``partial birth abortion'' bans have been vetoed by President Clinton, and my doctors were able to provide me with a safe, compassionate procedure that brought this second tragic pregnancy to an end. And thanks to those doctors and their ability to give me that care, my recovery has been rapid--enabling Barry and I to plan to try again. 
   But if this bill becomes law, we would not be able to do so. For the chances of our having a third anencephalic pregnancy are all the way up to 1 in 4, and this bill would ban any procedures that would help us. It would force me to carry another doomed child through all nine months. That idea is far more horrifying than all the unreal anti-choice rhetoric that can be manufactured, for the reality is that this is a terrible law, a grievous interference between doctor and patient, and would only compound the tragedy and heartache faced by families like us. 
   Please protect the health of women and families like mine, and reject S. 1692.  
   There is nothing one can add to that. S. 1692 would say that the Kim Kosters in families across the country that we legislators--I am not a doctor, I am not a theologian, I am not a psychiatrist or a psychologist; but the bill proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania would say that we know more than all of them, that we stand in the judgment seat of the Mrs. Kosters: We are going to decide for you. 
   Attorneys? I am an attorney. Maybe some of us are teachers, I don't know. Maybe some are social workers or business people. There are a variety of different people here on the floor of the Senate. But somehow we get to tell you: Mrs. Koster, you and your husband have no right to decide. We are going to do it for you. Our decision is, no matter what--even under these terrible circumstances--you are going to have to carry that to term and bear the consequences of that. 
   Maybe there are some in this body who want to sit in that kind of judgment seat. Count me out. Count me out. I leave these decisions to Kim and her husband, to her doctor, to her own faith, to her own religion to make those very profound, anxiety-producing, soul-wrenching decisions. That is why I have fought for this amendment--to state loudly and clearly that Roe v. Wade gave women that right and we don't want it overturned. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry if someone referred to them as executioners. That, I think, is totally inappropriate and inflammatory and could lead to tragic consequences in our country. 
   I don't know the doctors who helped Kim Koster. But from talking to her, they were sensitive. They are doctors who wanted Kim and her husband to know every facet of what was happening and wanted them to make their own decision. They are doctors who have a lot of compassion and professionalism and, under the legal framework, were able to help this couple get through a very bad time and enabled them to move on with their lives and to plan on another child. 
   If that had not been there--if we had taken Roe v. Wade away or if we had adopted S. 1692--I don't know what would have happened to Kim Koster and her husband or whether they would be here today planning to try again to raise a family. 
   I say to my colleague from California that I believe Kim Koster is an extremely brave individual. In fact, I would say to anyone who wants to talk to her about what happened to her, she is out in the reception room right now. She would be glad to tell them why it is important to not only adhere to Roe v. Wade but to defeat S. 1692 that would have taken away her reproductive rights and under very tragic circumstances.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from California because I believe this statement by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is really aimed at us. They are aiming it at legislators who somehow sit in judgment--legislators who would put themselves in the position of defining for women what their reproductive rights are. Here is the quote:  
   At the heart of liberty--  
   At the heart of liberty--  
   is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under the compulsion of the state.  
   That is the quote. I believe it is directed at us. 
   Mr. President, I don't know how long people want to talk on this. I know the day is getting late. I ask unanimous consent that we have 30 minutes equally divided before we have an up-or-down vote on this amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to express to the conferees of Commerce Justice State Appropriations the importance of keeping the Hate Crimes Prevention Act in the spending bill. 
   I am a cosponsor of this legislation that expands the federal criminal civil rights statute on hate crime by removing unnecessary obstacles to federal prosecution and by providing authority for federal involvement in crimes directed at individuals because of their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability. 
   In particular, prejudice against people with disabilities takes many forms. Such bias often results in discriminatory actions in employment, housing, and public accommodations. Laws like the Fair Housing Amendments Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act are designed to protect people with disabilities from such prejudice 
   But disability bias also manifests itself in the form of violence--and it is imperative that the federal government send a message that these expressions of hatred are not acceptable in our society. 
   For example, a man with mental disabilities from New Jersey was kidnaped by a group of nine men and women and was tortured for three hours, then dumped somewhere with a pillowcase over his head. While captive, he was taped to a chair, his head was shaved, his clothing was cut to shreds, and he was punched, whipped with a string of beads, beaten with a toilet brush, and, possibly, sexually assaulted. Prosecutors believe the attack was motivated by disability bias. 
   In the state of Maine, a married couple both living openly with AIDS, struggling to raise their children. Their youngest daughter was also infected with HIV. The family had broken their silence to participate in HIV/AIDS education programs that would inform their community about the tragic reality of HIV infection in their family. As a result of the publicity, the windows of their home were shot out and the husband was forcibly removed from his car at a traffic light and severely beaten. 
   Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have included people with disabilities as a protected class under their hate crimes statutes. However, state protection is neither uniform nor comprehensive. The federal government must send the message that hate crimes committed on the basis of disability are as intolerable as those committed because of a person's race, national origin, or religion. And, federal resources and comprehensive coverage would give this message meaning and substance. Thus, it is critical that people with disabilities share in the protection of the federal hate crimes statute. 
   Senator KENNEDY's Hate Crimes bill has the endorsement of the Administration and over 80 leading civil rights and law enforcement organizations. It is a constructive and sensible response to a serious problem that continues to plague our nation--violence motivated by prejudice. It deserves full support, and I am hopeful that it is included in the final version that the President signs.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understood that the conference report was supposed to contain the following language concerning an economic development initiative item approved in the FY 99 VA-HUD Appropriations measure: ``The description of the Warrior Hotel EDI project in the FY 99 HUD-VA Appropriations report is modified to the following: $1 million for the restoration of the Warrior Hotel in Sioux City, IA, to be used for adult day care and other services or uses consistent with the revitalization of the Central Business District''. Unfortunately, this language was inadvertently left out of the report.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation I originally proposed during the 105th Congress, the Social Security Consumer Protection Act. Quite simply, this bill is designed to protect constituents from what has been an all too common consumer scam. 
   I introduced a similar bill during the prior Congress after an investigation by my staff found that unsuspecting consumers--from new parents to newlyweds to senior citizens--were falling prey to con artists who charged them for services that are available free of charge from the Social Security Administration (SSA) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Many of these schemes involve the use of materials and names which purposely mislead consumers into believing the scam artists are affiliated with the government. 
   Companies operating under official sounding names like Federal Document Services, Federal Record Service Corporation, National Records Service, and U.S. Document Services are mailing information to thousands of Americans, scaring them into remitting a free to receive basic government services, such as a new Social Security number and card for a newborn or changing names upon marriage or divorce. 
   One of my constituents, Deb Conlee of Fort Dodge, received one of these mailings. It sounded very official. It began, ``Read Carefully: Important Facts About your Social Security Card.'' The response envelope is stamped ``SSA-7701'' giving the impression that it is connected with the SSA. The solicitation goes on to say that she is required to provide SSA with any name change associated with her recent marriage and get a new Social Security card. It then urges her to send the company $14.75 to do this on her behalf. It includes the alarming statement, ``We urge you to do this immediately to help avoid possible problems where your Social Security benefits or joint income taxes might be questioned.'' 
   What the solicitation fails to mention, of course, is that these services are provided at no charge by SSA. 
   After hearing Ms. Conlee's story, I contacted SSA and asked them to investigate these complaints. Then SSA Commissioner Shirley Chater responded that the services provided by these companies, ``Are completely unnecessary. Not only do they fail to produce any savings of time or effort for the customer, they also tend to delay issuance of the new Social Security card.'' 
   In its investigations, SSA received hundreds of complaints involving over 100 companies. The Postal Inspection Service has received hundreds of additional complaints. The Inspector General of SSA validated many of these complaints, including finding repeated cases of violations of Federal law. While it is already illegal for a company to imply any direct connection with a Federal agency, it is not illegal to charge for the very same services that are available at no cost to the Government. 
   The Social Security Consumer Protection Act addresses this issue in a few important ways. First, the bill prohibits charging for services that are provided for free by SSA and HHS unless the following statement is prominently displayed on the first page of the solicitation in bold type, 16-point font, ``Important Public Disclosure: The product or service described here and assistance to obtain the product or service is available free of charge from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services. You may wish to check the government section of your local phone book for the phone number of your local Social Security Administration or Department of Health and Human Services office for help in obtaining this service for no charge or you may choose to use our service for a fee.'' 
   Should a consumer decide to use the services of one of these companies, they are protected from inappropriate use of their personal information. This bill prohibits the sale, transfer or use of personal information obtained on consumers through such a solicitation without their consent on a separate authorization form that clearly and plainly explains how their personal information could be used. 
   I am joined in introducing this important consumer legislation by Senators BRYAN, KERREY, and DODD. 
   I am also pleased that the Social Security Consumer Protection Act enjoys the support of such consumer organizations as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the Consumer Federation of America. 
   Mr. President, these scams must come to an end. Consumers deserve full disclosure. This legislation will go a long way toward ensuring consumers understand their rights when it comes to obtaining services from their government. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I will yield myself 4 minutes and hurry. 
   I want to say a few words about both parts of the bill before us. The first part is the regular fiscal year 2000 Ag appropriations bill. I commend and thank the chairman, Senator COCHRAN, and thank our ranking member, Senator KOHL, for their hard work and conscientious effort to craft this bill under difficult spending constraints. 
   There are important provisions in the bill providing funding for agriculture programs, agricultural research, food safety, nutrition, conservation, rural economic development, and in other areas. There are a number of items in this bill that are especially important to my State of Iowa, which I will not list here. I just want to say the regular fiscal year 2000 bill is basically a good bill under the circumstances. 
   There is a matter that deserves special mention; and that is, in the Senate we had an overwhelming vote of 70-28 to remove sanctions on food and medicine. The Senate conferees also voted in the conference to hold the Senate position, but the House conferees adjourned before we could even vote on sanctions reform. So after all these years of hearing all the talk about removing embargoes on food and medicine, the Republican leadership in the House walked away before we had a chance to reform it. So we still have embargoes on food, embargoes to keep our farmers from selling food to foreign customers. 
   I also want to mention a provision that was stuck in this bill on the H2A program. That program allows bringing in foreign agricultural workers if the employer cannot find domestic workers. The provision in this bill will significantly shorten the time during which an employer has to look for U.S. workers before bringing in foreign workers. 
   I recognize that it can be hard to find U.S. workers for agricultural jobs in some instances, but I do not think that Congress ought to be changing the law to make it easier to cut U.S. workers out of those jobs and give them to foreign workers. 
   I now will turn to the emergency assistance package, which totals about $8.7 billion. My colleagues and I have been working since last May to get this Congress to pass a farm assistance package. We had to fight for too long this summer even to get a recognition here in Congress that there is a farm crisis. Then we had to fight to get this Congress to take any action. And finally, we had to fight for a package that would be adequate to deal with the severe economic hardship in rural America. 
   So, we have come a long way since last spring. This emergency package will provide a good deal of assistance to help farm families survive this crisis. I am disappointed, however, that the bill uses the same payment mechanism as the failed Freedom to Farm bill and that it does not contain an adequate amount of assistance to respond to the droughts and other natural disasters around the country. 
   The emergency package has far too little in it for livestock producers--particularly for pork producers who have lost $4 billion in equity over the past 22 months. And it contains no money for emergency conservation work and repairing flood damage. Nor is there any economic development assistance for rural communities that are suffering because of the downturn in agriculture. 
   On balance, I am supporting the emergency package because it will get some money out to farm families who are struggling to remain in business. 
   As I have said, it is like throwing a leaking liferaft to a drowning person. That is how I feel. I am standing on the shore. Someone is drowning. All I have is a leaking liferaft. Do I throw it to them or not? Of course, I do, in the hopes that shortly we will get something better. But right now our farmers are drowning. They are sinking. So this emergency bill will help for a little bit, but it is not a long-term solution to the problem. 
   The fact that Congress is passing a stopgap emergency package for the second year in a row demonstrates that our current farm policy is not working. We must reform the failed Freedom to Farm bill before next year. 
   Unless we reform Freedom to Farm, all the signs indicate farmers are going to need another emergency package next year, too. Frankly, you can only go to the well so many times. 
   We cannot continue to have a farm policy in this country that lurches from one crisis to the next. It is time to address the root problem: the lack of a farm income safety net in the Freedom to Farm bill. The Freedom to Farm bill has to be changed to restore farm income protections that were eliminated when the bill was enacted. 
   Freedom to Farm is a bankrupt farm policy and it is bankrupting America's farm families. 
   As we have said repeatedly, this bill uses a payment mechanism that has  nothing to do with what farmers planted this year. The Freedom to Fail bill is already a proven failure. So why on Earth would we want to go right back to the Freedom to Fail bill to try to remedy its shortcomings? This bill includes $5.5 billion in Freedom to Farm type payments. They would be paid out based on base acres and yields set some 20 years ago. The payments would have nothing to do with this year's planting. In fact, they can go to people who planted nothing. 
   Using the so-called ``three-entity rule,'' an individual could get $80,000 of these payments and not have planted anything. Add that to the $80,000 in regular AMTA payments, which they also could get without planting anything. This bill then also doubles the payment limit for marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments to $150,000. Now in practice, that is $300,000 through the use of the three-entity rule. The total that potentially could be paid to one individual then is $460,000. 
   This bill does not treat oilseeds fairly. There is a very complicated and confusing program for providing direct payments to oilseed producers. It is going to take a long time to get this program sorted out and to get the payments out to producers of soybeans and other oilseeds--and the payments are not going to be fairly distributed among producers. Here is the real irony of this emergency assistance package. With the AMTA type payments, if you did not plant anything this year you can still get as much as an extra $80,000 under this package. 
   I have some examples under the payment scheme we have in this emergency package. All of these farmers have 500 acres of land, half planted to corn and half planted to soybeans. Yet the payments range anywhere from $19,941 down to $2,040--three neighbors right in a row, farming 500 acres--half in corn and half in soybeans. Or you can have a farmer who decides to go to Palm Beach. He has 500 acres. He did not plant anything. He is going to get $17,901 even though he never did anything. Yet for farmers in the State represented by my friend from North Carolina, who have had disaster losses--or farmers in Iowa, the Dakotas, Minnesota, the Northeast and East who have had drought or other disaster losses--they are going to get pennies on the dollar. Farmers who worked hard, planted a crop, have hardly anything to show for it. But here is a hypothetical example of a farmer who planted nothing, who has 500 acres, and he is going to get $17,900. That is not right.

   Mr. HARKIN. For the first farmer, Smith, all 500 acres are corn base. Those are the acres on which the direct AMTA-type payments are made. Again, 250 acres planted to corn and 250 acres planted to soybeans. That farmer will receive an additional AMTA type corn payment of $17,901 and a soybean payment of $2040, for a total of $19,941. Keep in mind this farmer is receiving both a corn payment and a soybean payment on the very same acre on some of the land. 
   The second farmer, Jones, has 500 acres, but this farmer has only 250 acres of corn base. Again, 250 acres in corn and 250 acres in soybeans. This farmer will receive $8950 in AMTA type corn payments and $2040 in soybean payments, for a total of $10,990. 
   Another farmer, Brown, has 500 acres, but no corn base, with half the land in soybeans and half in corn. This farmer will receive $2040, because that is all that would be paid on the soybeans. 
   In summary, 500 acres of land, half planted to corn, half planted to soybeans, and you have a range of payments from $2040 all the way up to $19,941. All because the AMTA payments are based on what was planted 20 years ago or more, not on what farmers are planting now. 
   And here is the real kicker, a landowner who chooses to plant nothing can receive a payment. So the owner of that 500 acres could still receive the $17,901 without planting a seed. I call this the Palm Beach Farmer example. 
   Mr. President, there is a lot wrong with this bill, but there is an overriding need to get assistance out to farmers. Frankly, I have little confidence that we would get anything better if this bill were sent back to conference. I have amendments that I am still prepared to offer. But we couldn't even get the House conferees to come back to the table. They were forbidden by their leadership to do so. 
   This bill could have been much better, and I deeply regret that we were foreclosed from improving it. So I will vote for this conference report,with some reluctance, simply because so much is at stake for farm families and rural communities in my state of Iowa and across our Nation. 
   As I said, it amounts to throwing a leaking liferaft to a drowning person. Let's throw the liferaft out; but let us change the bill next year so we are not back once again trying to pass emergency farm assistance. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I strongly believe that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--or CTBT--is in our nation's national security interests. But before I discuss my reasons for supporting the Treaty, let me first say why the Senate--even those who are unsure of the Treaty--should support the Resolution. The past week of debate over the issue has only underscored the arguments for its ratification. 
   I have spoken before about the history of the CTBT. Let me reiterate some of its history and why it is important to Iowans. 
   On October 11, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force after being ratified by the Senate in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 80-14 just a few weeks earlier. This treaty paved the way for future nuclear weapons testing agreements by prohibiting tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. This treaty was signed by 108 countries. 
   Our nation's agreement to the Limited Test Ban Treaty marked the end  of our nation's above ground testing of nuclear weapons, including those at the U.S. test site in Nevada. We now know, all too well, the terrible impact of exploding weapons over the Nevada desert. Among other consequences, these tests in the 1950's exposed millions of Americans to large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. ``Hot Spots,'' where the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest, were identified by a National Cancer Institute report as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131. The ``Hot Spots'' included many areas far away from Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Outside reviewers have shown that the 5-16 rad level is only an average, with many people having received much higher exposure levels, especially those who were children at the time. 
   To put that in perspective, federal standards for nuclear power plants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further understand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this: 150 million curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear weapons testing in the United States, about three times more than from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union. 
   It is all too clear that outlawing above-ground tests were in the interest of our nation. I strongly believe that banning all nuclear tests is also in our interests. This is a view shared by many leading Iowans. I request unanimous consent that a recent editorial from the Des Moines Register be placed in the RECORD. 
   October also marked some key steps for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or CTBT. On October 2, 1992, President Bush signed into law the U.S. moratorium on all nuclear tests. The moratorium was internationalized when, just a few years later, on September 24, 1996, a second step was taken--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT, was opened for signature. The United States was the first to sign this landmark treaty. 
   Mr. President, President Clinton took a third important step in abolishing nuclear weapons tests by transmitting the CTBT to the United States Senate for ratification. Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to take the additional step of ratifying the CTBT. I am hopeful that we in the Senate will ratify the Treaty, and continue the momentum toward the important goal of a world wide ban on nuclear weapons testing. 
   Many believed we had conquered the dangerous specter of nuclear war after the Cold War came to an end and many former Soviet states became our allies. Unfortunately, recent developments in South Asia remind us that we need to be vigilant in our cooperative international efforts to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. This weeks coup in Pakistan only makes clearer the need for a nuclear test ban treaty. 
   The CTBT is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on all nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. Its ``zero-yield'' prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons. The Treaty would also establish a far-reaching verification regime that includes a global network of sophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide monitoring stations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to deter and detect violations. 
   It is vital to our national security for the nuclear arms race to come to an end, and the American people recognize this. In a recent poll, more than 80 percent of voters supported the Treaty. 
   It is heartening to know that the American people understand the risks of a world with nuclear weapons. It is now time for policymakers to recognize this as well. There is no better way to honor the hard work and dedication of those who developed the LTBT and the CTBT than for the U.S. Senate to immediately ratify the CTBT. 
   It's ratification is clearly in America's and the worlds security interests. It would make the world a safer place for our children and grandchildren. Its defeat could well trigger a major new arms race in Asia--a prospect that should send chills down the backs of us all. 
   The choice is clear. 
   Mr. President, I have read through the treaty as best I could and looked at some of the annexes and protocols thereto. In there, there is a list of about 317 monitoring stations that would be put in place if we ratify this treaty. Right now, I understand there are about 100. So we will have three times more monitoring stations than we have right now. So to those who say we might not be able to absolutely detect every explosion over a certain amount, or under a certain amount, quite frankly, we will have a lot more monitoring stations by ratifying this treaty than we have right now. 
   Secondly, if the explosions are so small as to be undetectable, there are provisions in the treaty that allow for a state to have an onsite inspection. So there is a whole process it goes through so we can have an onsite inspection to determine whether or not it was a nuclear explosion. 
   Lastly, the treaty does contain a supreme interest clause in accordance with which a state party may withdraw from the treaty upon 6 month's notice, et cetera, if it determines that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interest. So, at any time, if the United States, or any other sovereign nation, decides it is in their supreme interest to withdraw from the treaty, they can do so by giving 6 month's notice. 
   Lastly, if anybody ever had any doubt about why we ought to be ratifying this treaty, the headline in this morning's paper ought to say it all: Army Stages Coup In Pakistan. Troops Arrested Prime Minister. 
   In part, it says:  
   India expressed deep concern with the government's ouster and put its army on high alert.  
   If nothing else, this ought to tell us to ratify this treaty, or else we are going to have more nuclear explosions in South Asia. It is a powder keg waiting to happen. We ought to ratify the treaty.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Leif Ericson Millennium Commemorative Coin Act along with my colleague Senator ROD GRAMS from Minnesota. This bipartisan legislation would authorize the U.S. Mint to issue a coin jointly with the Icelandic National Bank in commemoration of Leif Ericson and his voyage and exploration of North America. The famous Viking explorer is regarded as the first European to set foot on North American soil in the year 1000 AD. Next year marks the 1000th anniversary of Leif Ericson's Voyage of Discovery and this coin will commemorate this landmark event in North American history. This same legislation passed the House on July 19, 1999, and passed both the House and the Senate as amendments during the 105th Congress. 
   The Government of Iceland is an important North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally and this action would reiterate our strong relationship with and support for their nation. Iceland votes with the United States on virtually all United Nations and NATO issues and has formulated foreign policies parallel to ours. They also are cutting costs at our military base in Keflavi. Iceland has refrained from whaling, encouraged more U.S. trade and investment and initiated a partnership with the State of Alaska. The Government of Iceland has already approved a silver 1000 Kronor Icelandic coin to be produced by the U.S. Mint that will be packaged and issued simultaneously with the U.S. Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin. We believe jointly issuing these coins will help further relations between our nations. 
   Mr. President, the United States Congress strengthened United States-Icelandic relations by presenting a Leif Ericson statue as a gift to Iceland in 1930 as a gesture of memorializing Ericson's Voyage of Discovery. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson made October 9 ``Leif Ericson Day'' in commemoration of this famous Norwegian Viking explorer. The Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin in the year 2000 would commemorate the millennial anniversary of Ericson's voyage and would display our commitment to continuing this relationship for the coming millennium.

   Mr. HARKIN. I rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend from Missouri and the Chairman of the Small Business Committee. I heard not all but most of the opening comments by the offerer of the amendment, Senator BOND. What I heard mostly was the concerns expressed by Senator BOND regarding its impact on small businesses. 
   While I happen to serve on the Small Business Committee, Senator BOND is the chairman of that committee. It goes without saying that Senator BOND has had a long and intense interest in the impact of rules and regulations on small businesses. I think I can say without fear of contradiction that Senator BOND has done a very good job in protecting and defending the rights of small businesses. Quite frankly, I believe I have, too, and others on the committee. I can understand Senator BOND's concern, legitimate concern about what would happen with the small businesses. 
   In that regard, I support his thrust in terms of making sure that we do not impact unduly on small businesses and that we fulfill our obligation to ensure that small businesses get the support whatever it might be, to help change and redesign a workplace that would be injurious to workers suffering from ergonomic types of illnesses. 
   To say that it would have an impact on small businesses does not mean we can't do anything about it because I think we have an obligation to protect the health and the safety and the welfare of the workers of this country. Whether they work for IBM or General Motors or whether they work for a small concern that employs five people, I believe we have an obligation to be concerned about their health and their safety. 
   Obviously, we also have an obligation to be concerned about the small businesses in this country. That is why I say, to the extent we can, we better be prepared to help small businesses to cut down on the illnesses and injuries to workers from musculoskeletal disorders and the results of ergonomic illnesses. 
   So again, I hope this is not just the reason someone might vote against this, because of the impact on small businesses; think about the impact on the workers, what is happening to workers out there. 
   I would also like to point out that if a small business has no workers with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), is not in manufacturing and does not have workers with significant handling duties, that small business doesn't have to do a thing. Millions of small businesses (drycleaners, banks, advertising agencies, shoe repair) will have no obligation to comply unless a worker gets hurt. 
   Then let us have a meeting of the minds to do both. Let's protect our workers, and then meet our obligation to help small businesses. It seems to me this is the way to go. 
   I know the Senator from Illinois has been waiting to speak, but let me also comment upon the fact that Senator BOND had said something about women-owned businesses, that women-owned businesses will be at risk. Quite frankly, women are at risk. 
   Here is a study done on ergonomics, called A Women's Issue, from the Department of Labor. The title says: Who is at Risk? Women experienced 33 percent of all serious workplace injuries--those who required time off of work--in 1997, but they suffered 63 percent of repetitive motion injuries, including 91 percent of injuries resulting from repetitive typing or keying and 61 percent from repetitive placing. Women experienced 62 percent of work-related cases of tendonitis and 70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases. So this is a women's issue. It is women who are suffering more from repetitive injury diseases and illnesses than men are. We should keep that in mind. 
   Secondly, we hear about doing a study and that we shouldn't promulgate or have these rules prior to the study being done. Well, first of all, for the record, there is no new study being done. The study being done by the National Academy of Sciences, which is referred to often, is just a study or a review of existing literature. They are not conducting any new research. All of the literature being reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences is already available to OSHA. The study the NAS is doing is a review of all the existing studies. We have studied this issue to death. There have been more than 2,000 ergonomic studies, and there have been 600 epidemiological studies done on ergonomics. We have more than enough information to move ahead in protecting workers. The study we keep hearing about is simply a study of all the studies. Let us keep that in mind. 
   We have been a long time in this rulemaking process. We have had over 8 years of study. I think it is well to note, too, the first Secretary of Labor who committed the agency to issuing an ergonomic standard. It was then-Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who committed the agency to issuing an ergonomic standard. We have been studying it ever since. 
   Also, keep in mind, no rule has been issued, not even a proposed rule. Again, that is all we are talking about, letting OSHA go ahead with a proposed rule. That is not the end of it. Once the proposal is issued, the public, people on all sides of the debate will have ample opportunity to comment on the proposal. 
   Lastly, this really does kind of break the agreement we had last year. Our word is our bond around this place. If we don't keep our word, this place disintegrates. Last year, we had an agreement made with the House Members, Congressman Livingston, who at that time was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and DAVID OBEY, who was the ranking member. They signed a letter dated October 19, 1998. What they said was: We understand that OSHA intends to issue a proposed rule on ergonomics late in the summer of 1999. We are writing to make clear that by funding the NAS study, it is in no way our intent 
   to block or delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics. It was signed by Chairman Livingston and ranking member OBEY.  
   I happen to be a member of the Appropriations Committee. Obviously, we are on an appropriations bill. I was involved in the discussions on that last year. The agreement was made to go ahead and let the National Academy of Sciences do a review--that is all it is; it is not a new study--of the studies that have already been done. 
   Let's keep that in mind; this is not a new study. During that time, OSHA was not prevented from going ahead and issuing a proposed rule--not a final rule, a proposed rule, which I have pointed out, then, allows everyone to have their input and allows us in Congress to see it. Again, people talked about this study, and we had this agreement. We should live up to the agreement. 
   They talk about the cost. Here is a whole packet--I will have them here if anybody wants to read them--of ergonomic changes made by companies, both large and small, to help reduce the significance and the number of injuries. These are what companies on their own did. 
   One caught my eye. This is from Sun Microsystems. They make computer equipment and systems in California. Problem: In 1993, the average work-related musculoskeletal disorder disability claim was $45,000 to $55,000. The solution: Sun Microsystems purchased ergonomic chairs and provided education and work station assessments to all who requested them. The company also encouraged workers to adopt proper posture while working with computers. The impact: The average repetitive-strain-injury-related claim dropped from $45,000 to $55,000 in 1993 to $3,500 in 1997.  
   Does it work? Yes, it does. It works well. We ought to get on with it. Let OSHA issue their proposed rule. These delays hurt workers. More than 600,000 workers lose work each year because of ergonomic-related injuries. These are our cashiers, nurses, cleaning staff, assembly workers in manufacturing and processing plants, computer users, clerical staff, truck drivers, and meat cutters. 
   This amendment should be defeated because the workers of this country deserve to have their health and their safety protected. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Senator ROBB and I are going to take a few minutes. I know the time is late. I know people want to get to a final vote on this. I want to talk about how good this bill is and to urge people to vote for it. 
   This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I will not go through the whole thing. It basically is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying Congress should appropriate at least $3.7 billion in Federal resources to help communities leverage funds to modernize public school facilities, otherwise known as public school construction. 
   What we have in this country is schools that are on the average 40 to 50 years old. We are getting great teachers, new methodologies, new math, new science, new reading programs, and the schools are crumbling down around us. They are getting older every day. Day after day, kids go to schools with leaky ceilings, inadequate heat, inadequate air conditioning for hot summer days and the fall when the school year is extended. They are finding a lot of these buildings still have asbestos in them, and it needs to be taken out. Yet we are shirking our responsibilities to refurbish, renovate, and rebuild the schools in this country. The General Accounting Office estimates 14 million American children attend classes in schools that are unsafe or inadequate. They estimate it will cost $112 billion to upgrade existing public schools to just ``good'' condition. 
   In addition, the GAO reports 46 percent of schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. We want to get computers in the classrooms, we want to hook them to the Internet, and yet almost 50 percent of the schools in this country are inadequate in their internal wiring so kids cannot hook up with the Internet. 
   The American Society of Civil Engineers reports public schools are in worse condition than any other sector of our national infrastructure. Think about that. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers--they are the ones who build our buildings, build our bridges and roads and highways and streets and sewers and water systems, and our schools--they say our schools are in the worst state of any part of the physical infrastructure of this country.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the nicest things our kids ever see or go to  is shopping malls and sports arenas and movie theaters, and the most run-down places are their schools, what kind of signal are we sending them about the value we place on education and their future? 
   This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which simply outlines the terrible situation we have in this country and calls on the Senate and the Congress to respond by providing at least $3.7 billion, a small fraction of what is needed but a step in the right direction--$3.7 billion in Federal resources to modernize our Nation's schools. 
   I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague and cosponsor, Senator ROBB.

   Mr. HARKIN. I am very concerned about the proposed $70 million funding cut to the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) approved by the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate has recommended that MIP be funded at $630 million, the amount authorized in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). 
   In 1998, Medicare contractors saved the Medicare Trust Fund nearly $9 billion in inappropriate payments--about $17 for every dollar invested. Any funding cut to MIP is tantamount to the government throwing money out the window. In fact, I believe, because of the tremendous need to reduce an estimated $13 billion in Medicare waste, we should increase MIP funding. Therefore, I will work hard to ensure that the Senate funding level for this important program is not compromised.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator REID for all of his support and his help and great work in moving this bill along. We appreciate it very much. 
   We have had a good debate, a long debate, a good exchange of amendments on this bill. We have had amendments that have been approved and rejected on both sides of the aisle. 
   I thank and commend my chairman, Senator SPECTER, for his leadership, his skill, and his persistence, his dogged persistence in managing this bill and getting it through. Senator SPECTER had tried time and time again during the long, hot, dog days of summer and coming into this fall, never giving up, always pushing us to get this bill up and get it through. Again, I commend him and thank him for his leadership and also thank Senator SPECTER and his staff for always working closely with us. I can honestly say that at no time were we ever surprised about anything. We have had a very good working relationship. We may not have always agreed on everything--that is the nature of things around here--but we always had a good, open, fair, and thoughtful relationship. I appreciate that very much on the part of my chairman. 
   This is always the toughest appropriations bill to get through. It was tough when I was chairman and Senator SPECTER was ranking member. Things have not changed a bit. This year was a greater challenge than ever. But I say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, we have produced a very good bill--not just a good bill, a very good bill. It is not perfect. Maybe there are some things I would like to have seen different. Perhaps we can improve it a little bit in conference. But it is a very good bill. 
   Let me just give a few of the highlights of what we were able to accomplish in this bill: 
   First of all, an overall increase of $4 billion over last year; a $2.2 billion increase for education programs. That is $500 million more than the President asked for. So if anyone says we did not take care of education, they do not know what they are talking about, and I say that in all candor; $500 million more than what the President asked for. 
   A $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health--$2 billion last year, $2 billion this year, keeping our promised goal of doubling NIH funding in 5 years. 
   We have had a very important increase for community health centers, a $100 million increase for community health centers. Community health centers in rural areas and in some of our poorer areas of this country are the health care system for a lot of poor people in our country, and they are doing a great job. This bill has a $100 million increase for community health centers. 
   We maintain the funding for all the job training and worker protection provisions in the Department of Labor. We have over a $600 million increase for Head Start. Maybe I would like to see a little bit more, but it is good progress. We are moving in the right direction towards getting all 4-year-olds covered in Head Start programs. 
   The Dodd amendment almost doubles the child care development block grant to $2 billion for child care. That is very important. 
   We double the funding for afterschool programs. Again, I know how strongly Senator SPECTER feels about this. He authored a bill, the youth antiviolence bill, of which I am a cosponsor, taking care of these kids after school. We doubled from $200 million to $400 million the afterschool programs. 
   We raised the maximum Pell grant from $3,150 to $3,325, the highest it has ever been. 
   Let me cut to the quick. I know many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have signed a letter expressing their concern over the lack of authorization of reducing class size. We have the money in there for it, but we do not have the authorization. 
   As I have said repeatedly, reducing class size is critical. I am personally disappointed that Senator MURRAY's amendment was not adopted. But I want to be very clear, though, that there is absolutely no inconsistency with signing that letter and voting for passage of this bill. 
   We vote to send bills with problematic issues to conference all the time around here. Maybe there is one little thing we do not agree with, but overall we agree with the major thrust of the bill, and we send it to conference. 
   Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is a good bill. We should send it to conference. If you are concerned about class size, the best and quickest way to have those concerns resolved is to vote the bill out and send it to conference. We will have a chance there to make improvements. If you still have problems after that, you can vote against the conference report. 
   But this bill is too important to the health, the well-being, and the education of the American people to kill it on the Senate floor. Everyone who votes for this bill can be proud of their vote, proud of the investments that we have made in the human infrastructure of this country. 
   Lastly, people have said there are a lot of gimmicks in this bill. There are no gimmicks in this bill. We advance funds because of the unique way that education is funded in this country. We do not pay it out until the next year anyway. So there are no gimmicks in this bill. This is straightforward. This is a sound bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. 
   Again, I thank Senator SPECTER, his staff: Bettilou Taylor, Jim Sourwine, Mary Dietrich, Kevin Johnson, Mark Laisch, Jack Chow, and Aura Dunn for all of their hard work. I also thank my minority staff: Ellen Murray and Jane Daye; also my personal staff: Bev Schroeder on education; Chani Wiggins on labor; Sabrina Corlette on health; Katie Corrigan on disabilities; Rosemary Gutierrez on child labor; and, of course, my outstanding leader, legislative director, Peter Reinecke, for all of his hard work. 
   So again I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to give this bill their ``yes'' vote and send it to conference resoundingly because it is a good bill, and it is good for America.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. The CBO has projected that we are heading toward using at least $19 billion of the Social Security surplus next year. Again, I agree with Senator NICKLES that we should not be dipping into Social Security to pay for this year's appropriations bills. But, quite frankly, I believe the other side already has dipped into Social Security by the fact of what they have been doing with their spending bills. 
   While I do agree with Senator NICKLES on not dipping into Social Security, I don't agree with his solution. Again, he calls for an across-the-board cut against all discretionary programs, even those that we have already passed. They were passed by both sides, went to conference, came back, and they have been signed into law by the President. Now they want to take that back. 
   OMB has estimated a 9-percent across-the-board cut. We have a letter from CBO which shows that this across-the-board cut that Senator NICKLES is proposing would be about 5.5 percent. Well, let's take a look. The Senator from Minnesota said we are spending too much money. I am going to get into that in a second. Take a look at what we would have to cut with a 5.5-percent cut across the board. Our COPS program, our community policing program that puts cops on the streets, would have to be cut by $26 million; Head Start, $290 million cut; meals for seniors, $29 million cut; NIH, $967 million cut. That is almost a $1 billion cut in NIH. While Senator SPECTER and I and others, in a bipartisan manner, have worked to get the $2 billion increase for NIH and get it on the track to double in 5 years, this would whack about a billion dollars out of NIH.

   Mr. HARKIN. Not one penny in taxes. I want to say to my friend from Nevada that the Senator from Minnesota said we are spending too much money. I am thinking that I might offer an amendment to cut NIH by $1 billion. Let's see how many votes we get on the other side. What if I offered an amendment to cut Head Start by $290 million? Do you think the Republicans would all vote to cut that? How about title I, education grants, $380 million in cuts to title I for our schools? How about veterans' health care, cut by $1.1 billion? Does anybody believe that if we offered amendments to cut those, we would get the votes to do that? Maybe the Senator from Minnesota would be the sole person who would vote to cut NIH by a billion dollars; I don't know. Perhaps we ought to have an amendment to see if that is what they want to do. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-12-19991006</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. That is probably true. The Senator is absolutely right. When the Senator says we are spending too 
   much and we have to cut spending, why doesn't he offer some amendments to cut NIH, title I, meals for seniors, and Head Start? No, they are going to try to hide behind this sort of across-the-board cut. An across-the-board cut means deep cuts in these programs. 
   The Senator from Nevada said we have a proposal where we can pay for these programs and it would not require any tax at all. This is what we could do. I have a proposal that has been scored by CBO. If we just penalize the tobacco companies that fail to reduce teen smoking--they set the targets to reduce teen smoking, but they are not meeting them. We are saying that they pay a penalty for not reducing that and it raises $6 billion. CBO has given us the score on that. We could fund the Department of Defense at the requested level. What DOD said is, fund them at that level. That saves us $4 billion. We could enact the administration's proposal for student loan guarantee agencies. That is $1.5 billion in savings. 
   I might add that the House, last week, went the opposite direction. They raised the student loan origination fees. I could not believe they did that. Talk about raising taxes; last week, the House raised the taxes on college students by making them pay more for their loans. They increased it by 25 percent. It affects about one-third of students. More than half of the students in my State of Iowa are affected by that. So they got a 25-percent increase in their origination fees. 
   Well, that is the opposite way to go. If we enacted the administration's proposal, we would save $1.5 billion. Reduce Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse by $13 billion. Well, again, the House bill--the counterpart to this--actually cuts funding for Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse. It retreats at a time when we have $13 billion estimated annually that we lose to Medicare for waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   What the House GOP did is to cut $70 million from the audits and other checks that save us $17 for every dollar spent. We know from the audit agencies and others that for every dollar we have spent on audits, every dollar we have spent on the checks, we got $17 returned from waste, fraud, and abuse. Yet the House bill cut money from fighting waste, fraud, and abuse. That is inexcusable. If we want to go after it, we could save $13 billion. 
   The last is reducing corporate welfare. We have a series of things--$2 billion tax deductibility of tobacco advertising; underpayments by oil and gas industry royalties for use of Federal lands; billions lost because of tax loopholes and gimmicks that allow foreign companies and multinationals to avoid paying their fair share by bookkeeping methods that shift funds to foreign tax havens. By doing that, we can save about $4 billion. So our total offsets are about $28.5 billion, and we haven't raised taxes on any American. Nobody would have to pay more taxes. 
   Yet this is the choice: Either have these kinds of offsets that will help pay for increased funding at NIH, veterans' health care, Head Start programs, meals for seniors; or what the Senator from Oklahoma wants to do, and that is to have a huge cut in all of these programs. That is really where we are. 
   As I said, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma; we shouldn't be dipping into Social Security. But we shouldn't be cutting Head Start programs. We shouldn't be cutting Meals on Wheels, meals to seniors. We shouldn't be cutting NIH and biomedical research. We should focus on the waste, fraud, and abuse, focus on the tax loopholes, focus on the DOD funding at their requested level, and that will more than pay for the programs we have come up with on a bipartisan basis.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I compliment him on this amendment. 
   There is all this talk going around about across-the-board cuts. We just had the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma which he withdrew. As you can see, there is some sentiment on the other side of the aisle to have some across-the-board cuts. Again, we have tried to resist those because, as the Senator from Massachusetts said so eloquently, there are a lot of people out there who could be drastically hurt--low-income people, needy people, seniors, veterans, and others. 
   What this amendment addresses is the education end of it. Both sides of the aisle have said time and time again that education is our No. 1 priority. The leader said that earlier this year. Both sides have been saying education is our No. 1 priority. What this amendment basically says is, as I understand it, if there is going to be any across-the-board cut--and there shouldn't be because we have plenty of offsets; we don't need an across-the-board cut--if there is an across-the-board cut, we will exempt education, only education, including IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, title I, and Pell grants. 
   What the Nickles amendment would have done--again, it is sort of rolling around out there about an across-the-board cut--CBO said the Nickles amendment would translate into a 5. 5-percent cut. For title I, that would be a $380 million cut. OMB said it would be as much as a 10-percent cut. That would be $800 million. So somewhere between a $380 and a $800 million cut in title I. Afterschool programs would be cut $20 to $40 million; ed technology, $35 to $70 million; and special education would be cut from $300 to $600 million, if, in fact we had an across-the-board cut. 
   Again, I urge Senators to vote for this amendment because it will send a signal, loudly and clearly, that if there are any across-the-board cuts, we are not going to take it out of education. We understand that education is our No. 1 priority. We understand we have to invest in education. The last thing we want to be included in any kind of across-the-board cut would be any cuts in education. 
   I compliment the Senator from Massachusetts. This is a great amendment. This ought to receive a 100-0 vote to protect education from any across-the-board cuts. 
   I yield back whatever time I have remaining.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I may object. I have been standing here about 45 minutes waiting to speak. I thought we were going to go back and forth across the aisle. I want to speak on the bill, not as in morning business. Since I like the Senator from Utah so much, I will not object. I wanted to make my point.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President for this time and his indulgence while  I take my 10 minutes when I know we are supposed to be recessing for our luncheon caucuses. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Wyoming. 
   I want to take a few minutes to talk about the managers' amendment, the slot amendment that provides for a two-step process for the elimination of airline slots for landing and takeoff rights at O'Hare, Kennedy, and LaGuardia Airports. 
   Senator GRASSLEY and I have been working on this for quite awhile together. I am pleased we have been able to work closely with Chairman MCCAIN, with Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator GORTON, and others on the development of this proposal. 
   It is an important step toward eliminating a major barrier to airline competition. Not only must we eliminate the barrier, but we have to do it in a way that mitigates against the long-term effects of a Government-imposed slot rule. Under the current rules, most smaller airlines have, in effect, a far more difficult time competing, in part, because of the slot rule. 
   In the first phase of the proposal, in the managers' amendment, small airlines will be allowed immediate expanded access to the airports. Again, this will help stimulate increased competition and lower ticket prices. Turboprop and regional jet aircraft will also be allowed immediate slot exemptions when they serve smaller markets. This will increase airline service available to smaller cities, especially cities west of the Mississippi, such as the Presiding Officer's cities in Wyoming, or Nebraska or the Dakotas or Iowa, or places such as that. 
   The two-step mechanism in the bill has the support of 30 attorneys general, the Business Travel Coalition, and the Air Carrier Association of America which represents many of the smaller airlines. 
   After that first phase, in the final step--after a number of years when the new competitive airlines might get a chance to establish a foothold and smaller cities would have established better service--the slot rules will be ended at O'Hare, Kennedy, and LaGuardia Airports. 
   Again, I commend Chairman MCCAIN for working so closely with us on this issue. Chairman MCCAIN had a field hearing in Des Moines on April 30 of this year to hear firsthand how the current system affects small- and medium-sized cities. Senator MCCAIN has worked hard to move forward a proposal which I believe will significantly increase competition. 
   I also thank Senator GORTON, and my colleague, Senator ROCKEFELLER from West Virginia, for their considerable efforts. These Senators have shown a keen interest in the problems unique to smaller cities and rural areas where adequate service is a paramount issue. 
   The provision has a number of items that address the noise implications of eliminating the slot rule near the three airports. I believe this final language is an excellent compromise. I am pleased that the structure of our original proposal is largely intact. I was also pleased that the House moved in June to eliminate the slot rule at these airports. I think the Senate provision improves on that. 
   Access to affordable air service is essential to efficient commerce and economic development in States with a lot of small communities. Again, Americans have a right to expect this. Airports are paid for by the traveling public through taxes and fees charged by the Federal Government and local airport authorities. Unfortunately, when deregulation came through in 1978, there was no framework put in place to deal with anticompetitive practices. A lot of these outrageous practices have become business as usual. 
   What happened? We went through deregulation in 1978; and then in 1986 the DOT gave the right to land and take off under these slots to those that used them as of January 21, 1986. So what happened was, when the Secretary of DOT, in 1986 said, 
   here, airlines, these are your slots, it locked them into those airports, and it effectively locked out competition in the future. It was, in fact, a give-away. I always said this was a give-away of a public resource. These airports do not belong to the airlines. They belong to us. They belong to the people of this country. 
   So what has happened is that over the years these airlines have been able to lock them up. So we have this slot system. The slot system came in in the late 1960s because the air traffic control system was getting overwhelmed with the number of flights then being handled. So they had a slot system. 
   Just the reverse is true today. With the modernization of our air traffic control system--with global positioning satellites, GPSs, all of the other things we have, the communications systems, our air traffic control system, and the ongoing modernization of it--we can handle it. We do not need the slots any longer. 
   However, rather than just dropping them right away, we need to mitigate against the damage that has been caused by the slots. That is why we need to have a phaseout, a two-step phaseout--a phaseout that would both phase out the slots but at the same time include, in that first phase, turboprops that serve smaller cities, new airlines that would start up with small regional jets that would serve some of the smaller cities that have been cut out of this for the last almost 20 years--well, I guess 14 years now since 1986. 
   So, again, many airlines have monopolies in markets, especially if they control a hub airport. Local airport authorities at major hub airports do very little to encourage small carriers to use hub airports. It is no surprise that big airlines would rather see gates empty than lease them to competitors. Dominant carriers flood the market with cheap seats to destinations served by small carriers. They maintain the low price until the day the small carrier is gone. 
   This happened in Des Moines with Vanguard Airlines. We had a new airline that started. What happened? United and American, flying to Chicago, dropped their fares by over half, dropped their fares down to below what Vanguard could do. The travelers were happy, but Vanguard could only afford to do that for so long, and then they went out of business. As soon as they went out of business, what did United and American do? They upped their fares 83 percent. That is what they were doing to stifle competition. 
   I believe that allowing new entrant carriers, such as Vanguard, Access Air, and others that may be coming along, easier access to O'Hare from cities such Des Moines, and the Quad Cities--Moline, Rock Island, Bettendorf, and Davenport and others, will be a step in the right direction toward helping economic development and growth and providing for lower airfares for our people. 
   The amendment of the managers opens up the opportunity for direct service into LaGuardia, important to cities such as Des Moines and Cedar Rapids and the Quad Cities. 
   Again, the Quad Cities recently lost American Airlines' service to O'Hare because of the slot rule. American Airlines decided to fly their new regional jet between Omaha and O'Hare. Normally, this would not have had an impact on Quad Cities' service to O'Hare, but under the slot rule, Quad Cities lost American Airlines' service entirely. They entirely lost it. 
   Without the slot limitation, Quad Cities would be a profitable market for American or any other airline. But the area did not make the cut with a limited number of landing rights available under the existing slot rule. Again, economic decisions are not based upon what they can expect to get from a market; it is based upon the slot rule. That is skewing the economic decisions made by airlines and by small community airports. 
   So again, for our area, for Iowa, for areas west of the Mississippi--I am sure for Wyoming and for West Virginia--we need to change this system, but we need to do it in a way that does not lock in the past anticompetitive activities of the larger airlines. 
   Right now, Sioux City, IA, does not have service to O'Hare. It is the No. 1 destination of its business travelers. So, again, what is this doing? It hurts economic development and stifles competition in Sioux City. 
   Again, I urge the Senate to support the managers' amendment. Doing so will lower airfares, it will improve air service to small- and medium-sized cities across the Nation, and it will allow for economic decisions to be based on economics and not upon an outdated, outmoded, anticompetitive slot rule. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate struck the portion of the Gorton slots amendment concerning O'Hare Airport and inserted a portion of the language that had appeared in last years measure. I understand that was not done because the Chairman and Senator ROCKEFELLER supported the substance of the change. I understand there was a concern with the filing of over 300 amendments on the issue. It was clear that we would have had difficulty finishing the bill if the Senate was forced to consider those amendments. Now we can move this measure to conference. I am hopeful that we will see the slot rule eliminated in two phases in the conference. I believe that the O'Hare elements of the Gorton Amendment are solid and would be an excellent position for the Senate to push for, given that the House has proposed to eliminate slots at O'Hare. 
   We need a two-step elimination of the slot rule to provide time for mitigation against the adverse effects of the rule. These include: the need to provide for improved turboprop service for our small cities, the need to provide for regional jets for our mid-sized cities, the need to provide for balance between the major carriers and we need an ability to provide for new entrant carriers to competitively compete. I am pleased that Senator GRASSLEY is expected to be a conferee on the entire measure.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened, with interest, to the comments made by my colleague from Oklahoma. I read his amendment. All I can say is I will use a term that is very popular out in the Midwest: It is like closing the barn door after you let the horse out. 
   I would have to ask my friend from Oklahoma--he's part of the Republican leadership--I wonder if he has talked to himself lately. 
   I wonder if he has talked to the other Republican leaders. 
   This is a great sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but the fact is, the Republican leadership has already dipped into Social Security. Don't take my word for it; take CBO's word for it. They have already dipped into it.

   Mr. HARKIN. ``GOP Spending Bills Tap Social Security Surplus, CBO Cites Planned Use of $18 Billion.'' This was in the paper yesterday:  
   On the same day House Republicans launched a new attack charging Democrats with ``raiding'' Social Security to fund spending programs, congressional analysts revealed that the GOP's own spending plan for next year would siphon at least $18 billion of surplus funds generated by the retirement program. 
   Yesterday's report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office seemed to undermine a concerted GOP effort to blame President Clinton for excessive spending and gain the high ground in the high-stakes political battle over Social Security.  
   There it is. They already have dipped into Social Security. We have already used up the non-Social Security budget of $14 billion, according to CBO. Actually, it was by $19 billion, but that included about $5 billion that was in the tax scheme they came up with, which the President vetoed. So we get that back. We are about another $15 billion into Social Security already. 
   Again, this is a great sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The fact is, though, the President sent a budget this year that was balanced, that met all our needs. I might have wanted to add a few things here and jiggle a few things there, but there were some penalties on tobacco companies in that budget. But, no, the Republicans, they don't want to penalize the tobacco companies, oh, no. Hands off the tobacco companies. We can't penalize them. But what we can penalize are the elderly on Social Security. They can pad the budget on the Pentagon. They added more to the Pentagon budget than what the Department of Defense even asked for. We have been playing all these shell games all year, moving money around. 
   Well, we have a plan, and we have had a plan, to be able to balance the budget, fund these programs by not dipping into Social Security but by penalizing the tobacco companies that fail to reduce teen smoking. 
   It seems to me we could beef up our efforts to reduce Medicare waste and abuse. There is $13 billion right there, by the latest estimates. How about legislation that would save money by reducing student loan defaults and cutting excessive administration fees that we pay to banks for student loans? How about reducing some corporate welfare? How about closing some special interest tax loopholes? 
   No, no, the GOP, the Republicans don't want to do that. They want to cut education and health care. Oh, yes, and the earned income tax credit; that is their latest scheme. I see in the paper this morning that their frontrunner for the Presidency, Governor Bush of Texas, couldn't even swallow that one. He said: What are the House Republicans doing? He said: I am against balancing the budget on the backs of the poor. Obviously, House Republicans want to do that; evidently, a few Republicans over here, too, want to use the earned income tax credit to pay for their schemes and for the faulty budgeting they have done. 
   I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I may come up with a second degree. I guess he has already second degreed it. We can second degree it again. We will have a vote on that. I think we need a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we send the Republican leadership back for remedial math so they can add things up a little bit better. 
   I yield to my friend from Oklahoma, having said that; I yield 
   for a question anyway.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, don't take my word for it. Read the CBO's letter, dated August 26, almost a month ago. Things haven't gotten any better. You can read it in the newspapers. You can add it all up for yourselves. 
   This is what they have done, all these schemes. Now they are going to designate the census as an emergency. Thomas Jefferson could have told you there was going to be a census in the year 2000, but they think it is an emergency. 
   I said they want to delay the tax cut for low-income Americans, the one program that helps get people from welfare into work, the earned income tax credit. They want to cut that down to pay for their schemes and their tax cuts for the wealthy. They are using two sets of books--CBO books, OMB books, one or the other, whichever make it look good on any one day or the other. They want to spread one year's funding over 3 fiscal years. They propose to defer approximately $3 billion in temporary assistance for needy families, TANF block grants, from fiscal year 2000 to 2001. 
   The schemes go on and on and on, all because, it seems to me, the Republicans looked at the Clinton budget that was sent down this year, which was balanced, which moved us ahead in the areas of education and health, which moved this country forward but had some penalties on tobacco companies and some offsets, as we call it around here, which means we pay for some of this by penalties on the tobacco companies. It is obvious to me the Republicans said, no, we can't touch the tobacco companies.  
   All year we have been having this jiggling going back and forth and back and forth about where they are going to come up with the money to fund the extra $4 billion that they put onto the Pentagon. Where are we going to come up with the extra money to pay for their tax breaks for the wealthy? So on and on, we get these schemes; they keep bouncing around. 
   Now we are told that defense, I guess, is going to be an emergency. That is the latest scheme. The defense bill is now going to be an emergency bill, but there is no emergency out there. 
   As I said, you can have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which says we should adopt an across-the-board reduction if we don't have a balanced budget. But quite frankly, why don't we have some penalties on the tobacco companies? Rather than cutting health care for the elderly, rather than cutting education for our kids, which his sense of the Senate would do, why don't we have some penalties on the tobacco companies for their failure to reduce teen smoking? CBO told us that would raise, if I am not mistaken, about $6 billion. There is $6 billion we could get right there for teen smoking. 
   That is where we are. I find it odd, kind of amusing, kind of bemusing, I guess, that the Senator from Oklahoma, one of the leaders on the Republican side, would offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. As I said, they have already dipped into Social Security. Now he wants to close the barn door. 
   All I can say is, too little and too late. I think the Senator from Oklahoma needs to have some remedial math. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the article from which I quoted.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator and I do agree we should not raid Social Security. But I think it already has been under some of their proposals. That could be open for debate. The Senator says let's make an across-the-board cut if at the end have gone overboard. I made a list of some of the things we could cut, such as $13 billion in Medicare fraud and abuse; $6 billion in tobacco penalty; $2 billion in student loan guarantees, as fixes that we can make; $10 billion in corporate welfare; $4 billion cut in Defense to get just to the DOD request. That is about $35 billion. Why don't we take some of that money, if we have to, rather than cutting education and community health centers? That is what the Senator from Oklahoma would propose, if I am not mistaken.

   Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, the last time I checked, the Republicans do run the House of Representatives. Their education budget is below that. Ours is up a little bit, but you know what happens when you go to conference. And who runs the conference? The Republicans. I am saying, we may be up in the Senate, but the Republicans run the House and they have cut it down below. That is my point. 
   The Senator said education was up. But under the Senator's scenario of an across-the-board cut, obviously, education would be cut, as would community health centers and Head Start, because it would be across the board. I am saying, if we want to have a balanced budget, which we do, where do we cut? 
   Why won't the Senator accept penalties on the tobacco companies? The CBO gave us scoring of $6 billion just from penalties on tobacco companies for not reducing teen smoking to the level they said they were going to do. That is $6 billion right there. Yet the Senator doesn't seem to be willing to even entertain that as a possible source of revenue. No, he wants to cut across the board. 
   So, again, this debate will continue, obviously, for the remainder of the fall as we get into the final crunch on our bills around here. But it seems to me that to have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we do an across-the-board cut, without looking at some other things--as I mentioned, there are $2 billion in student loan guarantee fixes we can make, and the tobacco penalty I talked about, or bringing Defense back down to the DOD request. There are a whole bunch of things we can look at that will still let us increase Head Start and education, community health centers, all the things that meet human needs and invest in the human resources of our country, rather than doing it as the Senator from Oklahoma has suggested. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to add a few thoughts for today's debate regarding consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I strongly believe that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--or C-T-B-T--is in our Nation's national security interests. But before I discuss my reasons for supporting the treaty, let me first say why the Senate--even those who are unsure of the treaty-should support its consideration by the Senate. 
   The Senate should hold hearings and consider and debate the treaty. The Senate should vote on the treaty by March of next year. 
   Let me now mention some history of this issue and mention some of the major milestone along the road to ending nuclear weapons testing. In fact, next month, the month of October, is the anniversary of many important events. 
   On October 11, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force after being ratified by the Senate in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 80-14 just a few weeks earlier. This treaty paved the way for future nuclear weapons testing agreements by prohibiting tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. It was signed by 108 countries. 
   Our nation's agreement to the Limited Test Ban Treaty marked the end of our above ground testing of nuclear weapons, including those at the U.S. test site in Nevada. We now know, all too well, the terrible impact of exploding nuclear weapons over the Nevada desert. Among other consequences, these tests in the 1950's exposed millions of Americans to large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. ``Hot Sports,'' where the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest, were identified by a National Cancer Institute report as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131. The ``Hot Spots'' included many areas far away from Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Outside reviewers have shown that the 5-16 rad level is only an average, with many people having been exposed to much higher levels, especially those who were children at the time. 
   To put that in perspective Federal standards for nuclear power plants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further understand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this: 150 million curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear weapons testing in the United States, above three times more than from the Chernobyl nuclear power plants disaster in the former Soviet Union. 
   Mr. President, it is all too clear that outlawing above-ground tests were in the interest of our nation. I strongly believe that banning all nuclear test is also in our interests. 
   October also marked some key steps for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. On October 2, 1992, President Bush signed into law the U.S. moratorium on all nuclear tests. The moratorium was internationalized when, just a few years later, on September 24, 1996, a second step was taken--the CTBT, was opened for signature. The United States was the first to sign this landmark treaty. 
   President Clinton took a third important step in abolishing nuclear weapons tests by transmitting the CTBT to the Senate for ratification. Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to take the additional step of ratifying the CTBT. I am hopeful that we in the Senate will debate and vote on ratification of the Treaty, and continue the momentum toward the important goals of a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons testing. 
   Many believed we had conquered the dangerous specter of nuclear was after the Cold War came to an end and many former Soviet states became our allies Unfortunately, recent developments in South Asia remind us that we need to be vigilant in our cooperative international efforts to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. 
   The CTBT is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on all nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. Its ``zero--yield'' prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the development amd development of new nuclear weapons. The treaty would also establish a far reaching verification regime that includes a global network of sophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide monitoring stations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to deter and detect violations. 
   It is vital to our national security for the nuclear arms race to come to an end, and the American people recognize this. In a recent poll, more than 80% percent of voters supported the CTBT. 
   It is heartening to know that the American people understand the risks of a world with nuclear weapons. It is now time for policymakers to recognize this as well. There is no better way to honor the hard work and dedication of those who developed the LTBT and the CTBT than for the Senate to immediately ratify the CTBT.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I say I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. He is a true gentleman, I think, in the spirit of comity on the Senate floor, to recognize the unanimous consent request that was proffered earlier was not acceptable to this side. I bear some responsibility for that. I was engaged in a conversation with my staff and did not even hear the unanimous consent request propounded, so I bear some responsibility for that. 
   As I said, in the spirit of comity and the smooth functioning of the Senate, my friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, came back on the floor and said he would move to vitiate that unanimous consent agreement, which he did, I think, again, in the true spirit of comity and smooth functioning of the Senate. That then was objected to, I guess, by the Senator from Arkansas?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment propounded by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas really would harm the NLRB drastically. The Senator from Arkansas said the caseload had gone down. That is true, the caseload did go down, I assume because we increased some of the funding and they were able to, then, hire some more staff and decrease the caseload. 
   If now, however, we cut the funding, they are going to have to release those people and fire people who were hired; therefore we will be right back where we started from. 
   We keep hearing about the backlog. What is the backlog? The NLRB, at the end of last fiscal year, had 6,198 cases pending at the end of the last fiscal year. I understand some of those were reduced last year, but we are still in the neighborhood of about a 5,500-case backlog. So I do not know how the Senator from Arkansas can argue we are making great progress. We are making a little bit of progress. But to take the $25 million out of the NLRB would put us right back where we were before, and you would see the backlog start going back up again. That may not be his intention, but that is exactly what would happen. 
   At this funding level, the staffing, I am told, would have to be reduced by at least 100 people below the current level. That would be about a 5-percent reduction. Again, that would mean the backlogs would continue to go up. The time to process the claims would grow significantly, and that would hurt not just the employees but also the employers. Both sides are harmed when they get this kind of backlog at the NLRB. Again, they are most effective when they can get at this in a hurry. Workers who are fired for union organizing must sometimes wait weeks or months for cases to be processed. Then when the remedy does come through it is too late. People have to move on with their lives. They have found other jobs, they get the remedy, but it is too late to make any kind of difference at all. 
   Employers are hurt because a delay causes back pay to add up until the case is resolved. This creates uncertainty. It destabilizes the workplace. I have had employers who have contacted my office and said: Can't you do something about NLRB? There is a case pending. It is causing us a lot of headaches. So it is not just labor, but it is also management that is hurt when you have this kind of backlog. 
   If this amendment goes through the funding level right now would put us, as I understand it, below the 1993 inflation-adjusted level for the NLRB. During that period of time, the number of cases has gone up. So you can see the number of cases has gone up. We took a little bit out last year because of some additional staffing we gave them. This budget cut would put us back where we were in 1993. 
   Of course, not only would the present backlog of cases take more time, we could see actually more cases piling up behind the ones that are there. 
   Again, there is some thought that the NLRB is a kind of a prolabor organization. The NLRB is effective because it is a nonmanagement, nonlabor, independent board. It promotes stable and productive labor relations. If they are not able to do their job, our whole society breaks down. 
   Let me get to the point. The Senator from Arkansas wants to take $25 million out of this and put it into community health centers. I take a back seat to no one in supporting community  health centers--consolidated health centers I guess they are now called--and have worked over the years with Senator SPECTER, as a matter of fact, to increase funding for our community health centers. They do a great job. In many cases, they are really the only source for a lot of low-income people who have no health care insurance. 
   We worked very hard--Senator SPECTER, I, and our staffs--to get a $100 million increase. We are up to slightly over $1 billion now for community health centers, and they need the money. But I do not think they need the money at the expense of taking it out of the NLRB. We gave them a $100 million increase. I believe this will be more than sufficient to help get new community health centers started next year and to adequately fund the ones in existence. 
   While I support community health centers, this is not the way to get money for them, by taking it out of the NLRB and taking it out of the more rapid resolution of the backlog of cases. Many times, the workers who are waiting to get a case heard are the same ones who are low income and need to have their cases resolved so they can get on with their jobs and their lives. 
   I yield back whatever remaining time I have.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. 
   I hope I can have the attention of Senators and the Senator from Arkansas, the proponent of the amendment. 
   I just spoke with the National Association of Community Health Centers on the phone. They said to me that I could say the following things publicly: 
   No. 1, they did not ask for nor seek this amendment. 
   No. 2, they are quite happy with the Specter-Harkin increases that came in the appropriations bill and hope that we can keep it in conference--which I publicly assure them and others that we will do everything we can to keep the $100 million increase. 
   And, No. 3, while they appreciate the intention of the Senator from Arkansas to get more funding for community health centers, they do not want it to happen at the expense of the NLRB. 
   So I just spoke with the National Association of Community Health Centers. I wanted to make that point; that they would not want this to happen at the expense of the NLRB. 
   I yield back my time, I guess.

   Mr. HARKIN. I don't mean to take any more time of the Senator from Arkansas. I can't help poking a little bit at him before the vote. 
   It is interesting that the Senator from Arkansas is trying to take $25 million out of the NLRB for the community health centers. Why didn't the Senator from Arkansas try to take $25 million out of the defense appropriations to help the community health centers? Why didn't he try to take $25 million out of energy and water or all the other 12 appropriations bills that came down here? Why go after the NLRB? 
   As I pointed out, I just spoke with the Association of Community Health Centers. They said that while they appreciate his intentions of giving them more money, they don't want to do it at the expense of the NLRB. I hope the amendment will be defeated.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I again thank Senator SPECTER and his staff for all of their hard work in putting this bill together. Senator SPECTER has done, indeed, a commendable job. He has done so in a professional and bipartisan fashion under very difficult and trying circumstances. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his patience, his good work, and, above all, his persistence. 
   Again, my good friend, Senator SPECTER, spoke of the bipartisan effort on this, and that he is hoping the President will sign this bill. I will have something to say about that in a moment. But I want to make it clear that in no way do we want to delay this bill. We ought to get it up and get it through. I am just sorry that we didn't get it up earlier this year. I still feel compelled to say that of the 13 appropriations bills, this is the last one. That should not be our priority. Education and Health and Human Services should not be the last priority. It should not be the last bill up for the fiscal year. It should have been the first bill and not the last bill. But we are here. The fiscal year is drawing to a close, and hopefully we can get this through. 
   But I want to point out that in my role as ranking member, while I will be supportive of Senator SPECTER in his efforts to get this bill through, I want to make sure that I protect the rights of Senators on this side of the aisle to offer amendments and to debate them in a timely fashion. 
   Before I say a few more words about the contents of the bill, I think it is important that I briefly talk about the funding of the bill and how it plays into the overall budget situation. 
   First, let me repeat what I said yesterday in our committee markup. 
   I am very pleased that the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee has worked to restore a more reasonable level of funding for this bill. Investments in education and health, labor, and other areas are key to our Nation's quality of life, our future, and our next generation of children. 
   I am concerned, however, that it now seems that the Republican leadership intends to simply shift the funds for the census and the Pentagon to our bill as emergency spending when clearly they are not emergencies. In other words, it looks as if the leadership is going to declare the funds for the census and the Pentagon--which have been shifted to fund our bill--as emergency spending--emergency for the census and emergency for the Pentagon. They are not emergencies. Even Thomas Jefferson could have told us there would be a census in the year 2000. That is no emergency. The Republican leadership is playing a shell game, and the loser may be Social Security. 
   Money is being moved from one bill to another to make it look as if we can fund all 13 appropriations bills with all  their priorities and still stay within the budget caps. 
   According to CBO, the Republican leadership has already spent the projected on-budget surplus for next year. About $14 billion of the non-Social Security budget surplus has already been spent. In addition, it looks as though there has already been about another $19 billion dig into Social Security. 
   Declaring the census and the Pentagon--which are clearly nonemergency items--emergency spending doesn't mean anything. It means the Republican leadership will dig that much further into the Social Security surplus in fiscal year 2000. Stay tuned for the next chapter because it looks as though Social Security is going to have a big bite taken out. It shouldn't be that way. 
   I have drafted legislation that imposes penalties on tobacco companies that fail to reduce teen smoking. CBO has scored my amendment as raising approximately $6 billion in fiscal year 2000. I think that is better than taking it out of Social Security. 
   Before the whole process is completed--I don't mean this bill; I mean the whole process this year--we will be looking for new sources of revenue to offset the costs of appropriations without tapping into Social Security. I believe getting this money from the tobacco companies that have already set their targets for reducing teen smoking and having them pay penalties is a much fairer and better way of meeting our goals in our appropriations bills than tapping Social Security. 
   Having said that, there are many excellent items in this bill. In particular, I commend the chairman for the $2 billion increase in NIH. Yesterday, as Senator SPECTER said, there was a hearing held on Parkinson's disease. This is a disease that causes untold human suffering, a disease that scientists believe may be cured within the next 10 years or drastically reduced and alleviated. Under Senator SPECTER's leadership, we are taking another step to realize that result. 
   The morning shows today were talking about the hearing yesterday. Michael J. Fox, the famous movie actor who testified, showed his trembling hands and how Parkinson's disease was affecting him. It was quite a poignant representation of the ravages of Parkinson's disease. Of course, those who had the privilege of serving with Congressman Mo Udall from Arizona know how that affected him and the suffering it caused him in his later years. 
   Most scientists believe one of the major steps that can be taken in finding the pathways to interventions and cures for Parkinson's disease is through adequate funding of stem cell research. We had it in this bill until it was taken out in committee yesterday on a split vote. I think it won by two votes, if I am not mistaken. It was a close vote. 
   The provisions on stem cell research were removed. That is a shame. People suffering from Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injuries, neurological problems, neurological diseases, and neurological accidents could have hope. For example, I think of Christopher Reeves, who has been so diligent and energetic in his efforts to push for more research in finding how to repair damaged spinal cords. Here is an avenue of research that could collapse the timeframe and lead to major breakthroughs on repairing neurological damage through stem cell research. Yet because of a handful of people in the Senate or the House--I 
   don't know where, but it comes from the Republican leadership--we couldn't bring this bill out with that stem cell research provision. That is a shame. 
   I was talking to some Senators yesterday who started talking about partial-birth abortion and all that kind of stuff. I said, wait a minute. What does that have to do with stem cell research? Absolutely nothing. Again, as I stated in committee, and I will state again for the RECORD on the floor, we approve in this country--and I think all the major religions and ethicists all agree--in vitro fertilization is not only permissible and acceptable but a very good way for a woman who may have problems getting pregnant and bearing a child to do so. In vitro fertilization is a widely accepted practice where the egg is removed from the mother and mated to a sperm. These eggs are then frozen in nitrogen and one is implanted. If it takes, a baby results, a child results, and we have some very happy parents. 
   However, there are a lot of fertilized eggs still frozen in liquid nitrogen. That is what we are talking about. That is where they want to get the stem cells. It has nothing to do with partial-birth abortion or anything else. The Cell Biology Association says there are probably about 100,000 frozen fertilized eggs in the country. That is where the scientists get the stem cells. These fertilized eggs will be destroyed anyway. They are not going to keep them forever in liquid nitrogen; they will be destroyed. Scientists say, why not let scientists take the stem cells out to do the kind of stem cell research we need to find the cures for Parkinson's and spinal cord injury. 
   That is what was in our bill. Here are the restrictions we have placed in our bill. First, we say the stem cell research had to be conducted under ethical guidelines. Second, to use any of the fertilized eggs to extract the stem cells, scientists must have the informed consent of the donor. Third, we could only use stem cells from fertilized eggs that are the result of in vitro fertilization. We had all of these restrictions. 
   Why would we want to take that out of the bill? I understand the leadership says they want to take it out because it couldn't pass with it. Why? Because there are two or three people who have some hangup about this. Perhaps they don't understand. If we could debate it and fully flesh it out and get it out, perhaps then people would understand what we are trying to do. I think there is a lot of information being promoted and bandied about on stem cell research that is totally false. It prohibits Congress from doing what I think is in the best interests of morality, ethics, and science. 
   So we do not have it in the bill. Now I hear the leadership says they are going to have hearings next year and bring up a separate bill in February. I will believe it when I see it because we cannot get it on this bill, and this is where it logically belongs. This is the bill with all biomedical research funded by the Federal Government, with a couple of exceptions in the Department of Defense. This is the proper place for it. 
   I cannot see why it is going to take a long time. We have had hearings on it. Senator SPECTER has had hearings on it. We have had hearings on it in other committees. How many more hearings do we need? How many more people have to come down with Parkinson's, die of Parkinson's? How many more people have to linger with spinal cord injuries and other neurological problems before we have the guts to do what is right around here and give the scientists the tools they need to do the research in stem cells? 
   So I am very upset that this was taken out--and taken out, I might add, at the behest of the leadership, not the chairman of the subcommittee nor the chairman of the full committee, as I understand it, but of the leadership of the Senate. I think it is wrong to do that, coming on the heels of this very powerful hearing yesterday, with all the national publicity coming out, even yet today, on Parkinson's disease, to say: Yes, but I am sorry, we are not going to permit nor fund the kind of research that would lead to a possible cure. 
   I want to make it clear, there is some stem cell research that will be conducted by NIH but only from two stem cell lines from the University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins. These are just from two sources. When you have 100,000 in the United States, you can get stem cell lines from a lot of different sources. 
   I am trying to think of an analogy here. This is akin to doing research on cancer but saying: But you can only do research on pancreatic cancer. You cannot do research on prostate or breast cancer or thyroid cancer or anything else, but you can do it on pancreatic. That is all. That is all we are going to allow. That is basically what we are saying on stem cell research: You can do this little bit of research, but you can't do the kind of broad research with which you open the doors and find some of the answers. 
   Again, I wanted to go on a bit on this because I think it is that vitally important. I think it is wrongheaded--I might even have stronger words than that but not appropriate for the Senate floor--for the Republican leadership to demand this be taken out of our bill. I  believe the votes would be here if the Republican leadership would stand up for it. Oh, we would probably have a few people, misinformed, not understanding the situation, who might vote against it. But I believe the provisions we had in this bill, carefully crafted to provide all the protections, would have garnered an overwhelming vote in the Senate--were it not for the leadership's position. 
   Again, I might add, as I said, there are a lot of good things in this bill for which Senator SPECTER has fought: A billion dollars for community health centers, a $100 million increase of vital importance for low-income people who do not have insurance coverage. In fact, it is probably the best bulwark we have for preventive health care, keeping healthy low-income people who do not have health care insurance. We have $400 million for afterschool programs; that is a $200 
   million increase. 
   Again, I compliment Senator SPECTER for the anti-school-violence bill he has put together, of which I am a cosponsor. As we pointed out, there is a lot of talk about school violence these days. The fact is, schools are the safest places for our kids. Less than 1 percent of the violence committed by or against kids is done in school--less than 1 percent. Most of the violence happens after school. That is why we need strong afterschool programs. We have all these school buildings around this country, we have put a lot of money in them, and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon they lock the doors. What is inside? There are gymnasiums, there are swimming pools, there are art rooms, there are computer rooms, basketball courts, weight rooms, music rooms--all behind locked doors at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. You have these kids on the street looking for something to do, and that is when the violence happens; that is when the drugs happen. What Senator SPECTER and I and others have done is increased by $200 million last year, up to $400 million, afterschool programs. 
   Obviously, if you are going to leave the doors of the school open, you have to pay. It costs money for heating, air conditioning; it costs money for supervision, for people to run the programs. If you have a music room, maybe kids want to take up music after school; maybe they want to take up theater. Maybe these young people would like to act a little bit, get into theater. You are going to have to have somebody there working with them. Better we pay the cost of an art teacher, a music teacher, a phys ed instructor or whatever for the 3 hours or 4 hours from after school until the time for dinner at home--better we pay that than we pay for the violence and the drugs and stuff that is happening on the streets. I hope this marks a steady increase this year, next year, and the year after that in afterschool programs. 
   We have $5.3 billion for Head Start, an increase of $608 million, again moving toward the target of making sure that, in America, every 4-year-old who is eligible is covered for Head Start. I am told that with this increase we are getting close to 80-percent coverage of all eligible 4-year-olds, so hopefully next year we can close that gap and get 100-percent coverage. We have increased the maximum Pell grants to $3,325, a $200 increase for low-income students to go to college. So there are some good things. 
   But there are some big holes in this bill that need to be filled. One of those, perhaps one of the most important--and it is critically important--is the provision the Senator from Washington State, Mrs. MURRAY, I am sure will shortly be talking about. That is the issue of class size reduction. Last year, we put in money for class size reduction. We put in $1.2 billion last year, and we hired 30,000 teachers around the country to reduce class size. This was a high priority of everyone. When you talk about bipartisanship, let me read what former Speaker Newt Gingrich said of the class size reduction program:  
   A great victory for the American people. There will be more teachers, and that is good for all Americans.  
   The former Speaker, Newt Gingrich--not a Democrat. 
   House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY last year, on class size reduction, said:  
   Good for America and good for the schoolchildren.  
   Finally, BILL GOODLING, chairman of the House Education Committee, said, referring, again, to the class size reduction program:  
   It is a huge win for local educators and parents.  
   This year, the Republican leadership is saying we have to cancel the program, cancel it--$1.2 billion. We hired 30,000 teachers, and they are saying this year: Fire them all. 
   Oh, yes, they are going to say: We are going to put the $1.2 billion into some kind of block grant program, and then they can use it for this, use it for that, and all that stuff. The priority we have heard from teachers, principals, superintendents, and from parents around the country is that we need to reduce class size. I have heard, on the Republican side, talk that we need teacher qualification, teacher upgrading. I am all for that, but I do not care; you can give me the best qualified, best trained teacher in the world, and if he or she is teaching a second grade class that has 35 or 40 kids in it, I am sorry, they cannot handle it; I don't care how well trained they are. 
   We had a priority last year on the course of hiring an additional 100,000 teachers to reduce class size in this country, a goal that was shared by the former Speaker of the House, the House majority leader, and the Republican chairman of the House Education Committee. 
   This year, the Republican leadership says no; because President Clinton wants it, we are going to cut it out. Talk about bipartisanship. This was a bill that had broad-based support. I do not see it as a Republican or Democratic provision at all. 
   I have heard from parents in Iowa about reducing class size, and they did not say I am a Democrat or I am a Republican and here is what I want. They said: I am a parent and my kid is in a class with 30-some kids and it is too big. 
   I hear from teachers. They did not tell me if they were Republican or Democrat. I don't know. I did not ask. They complained to me about what it is like as a young teacher just out of college. They have their teaching certificate, and they are on their way. They want to be a good teacher. They want to make a good profession out of it, and they get stuck in a second-grade class with, I heard one of them say, 38 kids. Talk about teacher burnout. You can handle that for about 2 years and then you are out the door. That is why we are losing so many young bright teachers. They want to teach. They want to get to know their kids and to work with those kids. They cannot do it when they have 30 kids in a classroom. 
   What we have is a bill that basically disinvests the investment we started last year in reducing class size. If this bill were to go through as it is, 30,000 teachers hired last year will have to be let go this year. They say: We are going to put money in block grants if they want to do it. I am sorry, we decided we needed to reduce class sizes. Let's keep our eye on the prize. Let's keep our eye on the goal. Let's at least accomplish one goal for our kids that we set out to do, and that is to reduce class size. 
   They say they are going to provide $1.2 billion for a teacher assistance initiative. There are two problems with this approach. First, I do not know what the teacher assistance initiative is. Maybe someone can explain it. We have not had any hearings on it. We had lots of hearings on reducing class size. I do not know what a teacher assistance initiative is. Some fancy words. 
   Secondly, when is it going to be authorized? I also serve on the authorizing committee, and the bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has not even been written. We have had hearings. We are a long way from passing this major legislation. Under the existing law, even though the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expires this fiscal year--tomorrow--under the law, we are given a 1-year extension, a 1-year grace period. You know how the Congress is, Mr. President. If we get an extension, we will fill up the time. Quite frankly, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is not going to be passed this year; it is going to be passed next year. 
   For some reason, the Republican leadership wants no part of the initiative to reduce class size, I guess because the President wants it. Well, big  deal. Last year, the Speaker of the House, the majority leader and the Republican chairman of the Education Committee wanted it, too. Why is it just because President Clinton wants it they do not want to go along with it? I do not understand that. I simply do not understand that. 
   Last night, President Clinton announced his intention to veto this bill if it comes to him in its current form. He will veto the bill because it does not guarantee we can continue the class size reduction program that we initiated last year. 
   I have a statement by the President. I will read it:  
   Today the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations committee passed a spending bill that fails to invest in key initiatives to raise student achievement. While its funding levels are better than those of the House version, the Senate bill still falls short of what we need to strengthen America's schools. It does not guarantee a single dollar for our efforts to hire quality teachers and reduce class size in the early grades. It cuts funding for education technology and underfunds such efforts as GEAR UP and after-school programs. And it does not provide funding to turn around failing schools. 
   To develop world-class schools, we need to invest more and demand more in return. We need accountability from our schools--and from our Congress, too....... 
   If this bill were to come to me in its current form I would have to veto it. I believe, however, that we can avoid this course. I sent the Congress a budget for the programs covered by this bill that provided for essential investments in America's needs, and that was fully paid for. I look forward to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to ensure that this bill strengthens public education and other important national priorities.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, all I can say is, I wish they could put Senator SPECTER and me in a room. I think we would come up with a good bipartisan bill. We have already. Because of some outside influences, we are going to have some real problems. That is a shame. 
   I believe my colleague, Senator MURRAY, will be offering an amendment to authorize and fund the program as we did last year to reduce class size. This amendment will ensure that school districts across the country will not have to lay off almost 30,000 new teachers hired this fall. I urge my colleagues to support Senator MURRAY's amendment. 
   Again, before I close, I thank Senator SPECTER and his staff for all their work and their willingness to work together in a truly bipartisan fashion to get this bill to the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. 
   I want to take a few minutes, as I do every year when the debate comes up on IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to set the record straight. 
   There is hardly anyone left on the floor but my two good friends, the Senator from California and the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Pennsylvania. But I want to make clear that IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, is not 
   a Federal mandate. The Senator from New Hampshire keeps talking about it as a Federal mandate. But saying it does not make it so.  
   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a civil rights bill. It is a bill that basically helps the States meet their constitutional obligation. In the early 1970s, there were two court cases in which the courts said that if a State chooses to fund public education, then children with disabilities enjoy a constitutional right to a free and appropriate public education. A State, if it wanted to, could say: We are not going to fund any public education, and they could do so. 
   But if a State provides a free public education to its children, it cannot discriminate on the basis of race or sex or national origin. And as a result of these two cases that came up in the early 1970s, they cannot discriminate on the basis of disability, either. 
   So as long as a State provides a free public education to its children, it cannot say, yes, for non-disabled students; but no to kids with disabilities. Constitutionally, they have to provide that free, appropriate public education to all kids. 
   In 1975, the Congress said: Look, this is going to be a burden on the States, so we will help. We will help the States with some funding to meet their constitutional obligations. It is not a Federal mandate. So we set up this law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and we said: OK, we will provide you some funds to help you out if you do these certain things, meet these certain guidelines. 
   No State has to take one penny of IDEA money. We do not force it on them. We do not say: You have to take it. We say: Look, because of the court cases, you have to provide a free, appropriate public education to every child with a disability. What we are saying at the Federal level is: We are going to help you do that. But, if you want our help here are the guidelines. Follow them and you get the money. That is the basis of IDEA. It is not a Federal mandate. 
   We also keep hearing that somehow we guaranteed to help the States meet 40 percent of the cost of educating the kids with disabilities. That is not so. 
   The maximum award to any State under IDEA would be 40 percent of the national per-pupil expenditure per year for education, not 40 percent of the cost of educating the kids in their State with disabilities. We said the maximum grant would be 40 percent of the national average cost of educating every child. That, right now, if I am not mistaken, is around $6,850. 
   So $6,850 is the national per pupil average that we funded out of the Federal Government in 1998. The IDEA funding formula is 40 percent of the per pupil average or $2,750, give or take a few dollars. I am not going to figure it to the exact dollar. Under the legislation we have right now, it is about 11.7 percent. With the increase, it gets it up to about 15 percent. So we do have a ways to go before we reach the maximum of 40 percent.

   Mr. HARKIN. I want to make it clear, do I support the goal of getting up to 40 percent of the national per pupil expenditure up to $2,750 per student? I do. But I don't believe we ought to do it at the expense of afterschool programs or out of Head Start or anything else. That is what I dislike about the Gregg amendment. If he wants to come up with more money for IDEA, fine. I will be glad to support him. But to take it away from other kids who have needs, I think, is not the way that we ought to proceed. Quite frankly, I don't know anyone in the disability community who would say, yes, take it away from those kids and give it to ours. They would say, look, fund the disability programs, fund IDEA, but fund afterschool programs, fund breakfast programs, fund Head Start programs, because these are all our kids and they all have needs. We ought to appropriately fund all of education. 
   If this Congress gave the same priority to education as it does for the Pentagon, we wouldn't have to make these types of choices. There would be enough for both. 
   We added $4 billion to the Pentagon's budget over what they asked for. When will we ever see the day when we would add $4 billion over what the Department of Education requested? 
   Those were the basic points I wanted to make. IDEA is not a funding mandate. We need afterschool programs. We need IDEA also. I don't agree with stripping funds from one important program to fund another. That is why I believe Senator GREGG's amendment has deficiencies. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on January 6 of this year, the Majority Leader stood on the Senate Floor and told us that education would be a high priority for the Senate. This is what he said:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. Democrats say it is important and it will be a high priority. Republicans say it will be a high priority.  
   I don't think the Republican Leadership can make that claim today. 
   We are now less than five legislative days--and that's counting Mondays and Fridays--before the end of the fiscal year, and there is one education bill that must be enacted--the education appropriations bill. 
   Yet, despite proclamations that education would be a top priority, the Senate has been working on all but one of the thirteen appropriations bills. The only one left--the one that is now dead last--is the education bill. Mr. President, this is the wrong priority. 
   Despite a valiant effort by the Chairman of the subcommittee--Senator SPECTER--the education appropriations bill has not even been written. Senator SPECTER has fought every day to move the bill. He tried in June, July, August, September. He tried last week. 
   And, if that isn't bad enough, the leadership has robbed the education bill to pay for the others. As a result, we are looking at deep cuts in all of the programs funded by the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. 
   Not only is education dead last on the calendar, education is dead last for resources. Our subcommittee started with an allocation substantially below a freeze from last year. Now, it is even worse. 
   Last week, the leadership staged a raid on education. They took another $7.276 billion in budget authority and $4.969 billion in outlays from education and other essential priorities in the bill. 
   So now, our subcommittee allocation is $15.5 billion below a freeze. That means we are faced with cutting education programs a whopping 17%. 
   What does a 17% cut mean? It means that 5,246 of the new teachers we hired to reduce class size will be fired. A 17% cut means that 142,000 students will be cut from the Head Start program. This cut means 2.1 million children will lose the extra help they receive from the Title I program to master the basics of reading and math. That is where we currently stand in the Senate. 
   Yesterday, the House education appropriations subcommittee passed the FY 2000 bill. The news for education is not good. Under the House bill, U.S. schools will receive less money next year than last by $200 million. The bill falls $1.4 billion short of the President's budget request for the activities funded by the Department of Education and provides $500 million less for Head Start. 
   The bill eliminates funding for the initiative to reduce class size so 30,000 will get pink slips next spring. 
   The bill cut funding for education technology; froze funding for the Title I reading and math program and terminated the School to Work program. 
   In addition, the bill cut, from current levels, funding for vital job training programs by $700 million because unemployment is low. Training programs do not only help workers when they lose a job but also help workers upgrade and improve their job skills to compete in the international marketplace. 
   The gap between the rich and poor continues to grow and the key to reducing this disparity is to help workers improve their job skills. And yet, the House bill slashes funds to help workers upgrade their skills as we enter the new millenium. 
   Last week, the Assistant Majority Leader said we should not be increasing funding for education. He was making a hypothetical statement about the education appropriations bill. 
   The picture is becoming clear. The record is replete with statements from the other side talking about education as a priority. We now find those words are not even worth the paper on which they are written. The House has cut education, and the Assistant Majority Leader has concurred. 
   The Republican leadership found $16 billion for the Pentagon. That's $4 billion more than DOD even asked for! And they found real money. 
   But when it comes to education, we get platitudes and promises. The children of America deserve better. 
   That's why we are offering this Sense of the Senate resolution. 17% cuts are unacceptable. Such cuts will savage our schools 
   We must have significant new investments in education. There are more children in our public schools than at any time in our history and we must not turn our backs on them. 
   We must keep our promise to help local school reduce class size. We must help keep our children safe by significantly increasing our investment in after school programs. We must increase our investments in IDEA and the Title I reading and math program. And we must help modernize our nation's crumbling schools. This resolution makes it clear that education will be a priority not just in words, but in deed. 
   Actions by the Republican majority in Congress directly contradict the priorities of the American people. It is time to free the education spending bill and make the necessary investments in education. 
   I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to listen to the American people. Let us not get into another protracted battle over the education budget. I urge adoption of the resolution.

   Let me ask the Senator, I understand this loophole that allows a handful of oil companies to keep from paying their fair share of taxes for what is owed the Government--it is only just a few, and most of the oil companies pay their fair share. Is that right?

   Mr. HARKIN. Doesn't it strike us as odd that 95 percent of the oil companies are good citizens? They pay their honest taxes. There are honest royalties. Yet we get 5 percent of the largest who are skirting the law, who are doing this, and keeping us from collecting the royalties that help us with our Land and Water Conservation Fund. So we are talking about 5 percent, a handful of the largest of all the oil companies. 
   I ask my friend from Nevada, what sense does this make? Why would we excuse 5 percent of the largest when we stick it to the smaller oil companies and make them pay their royalties? If we are going to do this, why not do it for all of them? 
   Second, we heard the Senator from North Dakota talking about how the railroads were putting up their value as par value, and he changed that when he became tax commissioner. I was thinking about that. I wonder if anyone has ever offered to buy a railroad at par value and whether they would sell it. I want to ask the Senator from Nevada, as to these oil companies, does the Senator think I could as a private individual--if I wanted to get an oil jobber and go buy oil--buy oil from those companies at the value they placed on this, at which they paid royalties?

   Mr. HARKIN. I don't think so. If I am wrong, someone please correct me because I would like to go out and buy some of that oil. I think I could turn it into a pretty handsome profit. I believe in the profit incentive. But you know darned well that you can't bill that oil at that price. They sell it to themselves at that price, and that is how they are getting out of paying the Government their fair share of royalties. 
   I also have to ask the Senator from Nevada, I understand what the Senator from California is attempting to do is not to impose any kind of new tax--this is not a new tax, as I understand it--on the oil companies.

The Hutchison amendment has already cost us $66 million in lost royalties, according to the Interior Department. Is that right? Already, to date, according to the Interior Department, taxpayers have lost $88 million. When you add the Hutchison amendment on that, it will cost us $154 million, according to the Interior Department. Is that correct?

   Mr. HARKIN. This is over centuries, thousands of years ago, tens of thousands of years ago, the winds blew and they blew 
   up these huge mounds of fine dirt. There are only two places to this extent. One is here and one is in China. These are a natural phenomenon. They are beautiful, very scenic, and we are trying to reclaim them and preserve them for future generations. This money could help do that. 
   I guess that is why I wanted to ask the Senator the question because he caught my attention when we talked about parks. We don't have national parks in Iowa. But we do have things such as the Loess Hills, Effigy Mounds, and some fishing and hunting areas that get money from the Water and Conservation Fund--and historic preservation. 
   I am constrained on this. I am a big supporter of ethanol because ethanol is clean. We grow it. It is renewable. We don't have to import it from other countries. I have always thought that ethanol could compete fairly with oil. There is a provision in the law that gives a certain tax credit for the use of ethanol in gasoline. 
   One of the Senators from Texas has always gone after it saying ethanol should not get any tax breaks; it should stand on its own two feet and compete against oil. I took the floor one time, I say to my friend from Nevada, and I said: Fine. Let's go back and recapture all of the tax breaks that all of the oil companies have gotten for the last 50 or 60 years. And how about the tax breaks they get now? How about this? If this doesn't amount to a tax break for big oil, I don't know what does. They want to keep that but they want to take away the small amount of tax credit that we have for ethanol. 
   I want to get that off my chest because I hear these oil State Senators coming in here all the time telling me that we can't provide any kind of tax incentive for the use of ethanol because we don't for oil. Nonsense. This proves it right here.

They are talking about this very item, ripping off the taxpayers. ``According to the watchdog project on government oversight, there is more than $2 billion in uncollected Federal royalties at open market prices, and the total grows by more than $1 million every week.'' 
   This editorial, along with an editorial that appeared in the Los Angeles Times of July 20 of this year, gave an indication of how much money was given by the oil companies in campaign contributions. Big oil contributed more than $35 million to national political committees and congressional candidates in this time over the last 12 years. 
   I question no one's motives on this floor. I never question anyone's motives. I say this is another indication of why we need campaign finance reform.

What I am saying, when we get editorials such as this that point out how much money has come from oil companies to the campaign coffers of the people making this debate, it demeans the whole debate.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on January 6 of this year, the majority leader stood on the Senate floor and told us that education would be a high priority for the Senate. This is exactly what he said:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. Democrats say it is important and it will be a high priority. Republicans say it will be a high priority.  
   I am sorry to say Republicans cannot make that claim today. I want to take a few moments this afternoon, along with some of my colleagues, to assess where education is on the leadership's priority list. 
   We have less than 7 legislative days, and that is counting Mondays and Fridays--we do not do much on Mondays and Fridays--before the end of the fiscal year. There is one Education bill that must be enacted, and that is the Education appropriations bill. 
   Despite proclamations that education will be a top priority, the Senate has been working on all but 1 of the 13 appropriations bills. We have done at least some work on 12 appropriations bills. We have 1 left. Dead last: education. This is a list of all of the appropriations bills: 
   Military construction, No. 1 on the list--the President has already signed that--leg branch; Treasury; District of Columbia; Transportation; Defense; energy and water; Commerce-Justice-State; Interior; Agriculture; and VA-HUD, the full committee approved VA-HUD last week, and it will be on the floor this week. Education, no action taken. It is dead last on that list, and education is supposed to be a high priority with the leadership in the Senate? Those are wrong priorities. Education should be at the top of this list, not at the bottom of the list. 
   Despite a valiant effort by the chairman of our subcommittee, Senator SPECTER, the Education appropriations bill has not even been written. Senator SPECTER has fought every day to move this bill forward. He tried in June, July, August, and September. He tried again last week, and we cannot even meet to mark up the bill. 
   If that is not bad enough, the leadership has robbed the Education bill to pay for other bills. As a result, we are looking at deep cuts in all of the programs funded by the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. 
   Not only is education dead last on the calendar, it is dead last for resources. Our subcommittee started with an allocation, an allocation we received earlier this year, substantially below a freeze from last year. If that is not bad enough, it is even worse now. 
   Last week, the leadership staged another raid on education and took $7.276 billion in budget authority, $4.969 billion in outlays, from education and other essential priorities in the bill so they can get the VA-HUD bill to committee. 
   Our subcommittee allocation is $15.5 billion below a freeze. That means we are facing a whopping 17-percent cut in education. 
   This chart illustrates that. In fiscal year 1999, the year we are in right now, we had slightly more than $89 billion. This year, where we stand right now, we have $73.6 billion. That is a 17.3-percent cut that will be across the board. 
   What does that impact? A lot of things. Here is one: That cut will impact reducing class size and improving teacher 
   quality. This cut will force communities to lay off 5,246 newly hired teachers. These are the the teachers hired this year, for whom we put money in, for reducing class size. They will have to be let go after just 1 year. 
   Funding will be cut for the Teacher Quality Enhancement Program for 24 States and 52 partnerships to improve recruitment and training of teachers. That is where we are right now. 
   We came to the Chamber last Thursday and talked about this issue. Later on in the day, the assistant majority leader, Senator NICKLES, came to the Chamber and said:  
   I would like to correct the record, because I know I heard a number of my colleagues say the Republican budget is slashing education, it's at the lowest end, it's the last appropriation bill we are taking up. Let me correct the record.  
   He says:  
   One, the budget the Republicans passed earlier this year had an increase for education.......  
   The budget. We are not talking about the budget. We are talking about actual money. I do not care what the budget said. I want to know where the real money is. When that budget got to our appropriations bill, we were cut below a freeze for last year, and certainly the leadership ought to know that. 
   Then he said:  
   The Appropriations Committee has yet to mark up the Labor-HHS bill.  
   Our Education bill. Not that we have not tried. Senator SPECTER tried in June, July, August, and September to bring it up, and we are not allowed to bring it up. We are not allowed to mark it up. 
   Mr. NICKLES said:  
   I understand from Senator SPECTER and others they plan on appropriating $90 billion. The amount of money we have in the current fiscal year is $83.8 billion.  
   That is off a little bit. 
   He says:  
   So that is an increase of about $6.2 billion........That is an increase of about 9 percent. That is well over inflation.  
   I am quoting Senator NICKLES. Our assistant majority leader says:  
   I think it is too much. I think we should be freezing spending.  
   He is talking about education. He says it is too much. He says we have $90 billion. That is not so. Right now we have a total of $73.6 billion for our committee. That is it. If Mr. NICKLES has $90 billion, I wish he would show me the money. We would love to mark it up. We would love to give education an increase. 
   With all due respect to my friend from Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, I wholeheartedly disagree with him that we freeze at last year's level of funding for education. I will go into that a little bit later, but we need an increase in education because of what is happening around the country. 
   Mr. NICKLES said:  
   I think we should be freezing spending.  
   That says it all. The leadership is not committed to increased investments in education. If they had their way, according to the assistant majority leader, they would freeze funding for education. 
   We need additional investments in education. Why? Let's look at it this way: The average school building in the United States is 42 years old; 14 million children attend classes in buildings that are unsafe or inadequate. Enrollment is booming. There are more children in U.S. schools than at any time in our history. Class sizes are expanding. It is not unusual for elementary schools to have 30 to 35 kids in a class. 
   Our schools are literally bursting at the seams to accommodate the 53.2 million students enrolled in public schools. These students need teachers; they need the latest technology; they need computers in the classrooms if we are going to compete in the next century, in the next millennium. 
   So when the assistant majority leader says he wants to freeze education funding at last year's level, that says it all. They are not going to make education a priority. They do not care what is happening with the burgeoning classroom sizes. 
   There are priorities and there are priorities. The leadership found $16 billion more for the Pentagon. It is interesting that this is $4 billion even more than what the Pentagon asked for. Having spent a number of years myself in the military and having been on the Appropriations Committee for a number of years, I can say, without any fear of contradiction, I have never seen, nor do I think I will live long enough to ever see, the Pentagon ask for less money than they actually need. They always ask for more money than they need. Yet the leadership said that is not even enough; we are going to give you $4 billion more. 
   I have heard one plan after another for how we are going to fund education. The assistant majority leader said we have $90 billion, but we only have $73  billion. I do not know where he found this money. I challenge the assistant majority leader to come on the floor and tell us where we get the $90 billion. I would like to see it. 
   They are talking about delaying the earned-income tax credit for poor working Americans. How about that for funding education. Talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
   Then there is talk about cutting Medicaid, or a large across-the-board cut in the bill. 
   Then we have heard talk about extending the fiscal year; we are going to have another month. We are not going to have 12 months in a year. We are now going to have 13 months in a year. I have even heard grade school kids laughing about that one. That does not pass the laugh test around here. 
   All I can say is President Clinton sent us a budget that increased funding for education programs which had the offsets necessary so we did not have to raid Social Security and Medicare. It was not as much of an increase as I would like to have seen, but at least it is an increase and not a 17-percent cut. He had the offsets there, too. 
   In fact, whenever the leadership so deigns that our 
   education subcommittee can meet and mark up our bill, I will propose an offset that will deal with raising $5.9 billion next year for cutting teen smoking, which has been fully calculated by the CBO to raise that much money. So we get two things: We will cut teen smoking and raise some money for education. 
   Over the past 5 years, we have had many legislative fights over the education budget. In 1995, the Republican leadership was so insistent on cutting education they shut down the Federal Government to make their point. The American people made their views well known at the time. They said: Do not cut education. As a result, the cuts were restored and additional investments were made. I must say that since 1996, education investments have increased, although the leadership has been dragged, kicking and screaming, to the table every single year. And this year is no exception. 
   The American people understand this. They are telling us loudly and clearly to make education a top priority. A recent ABC News poll found that three out of four Americans say improving education will be very important in the next election. Another poll, done by the University of Chicago, found that 73 percent of Americans favor increasing Federal investment in education. Yet our assistant majority leader says we need to freeze it. Someone is out of step with the American people. 
   Lastly, there is one other chart I want to show about what is happening. I continually hear from my constituents in Iowa and from Iowa legislators, and others, that property taxes keep going up all the time. Property taxes are going up. State legislators are feeling the pinch about putting more and more money into education. They are wondering what is happening. This chart shows what is happening. 
   In fiscal year 1980, of all the money spent in this country on elementary and secondary education, the Federal Government provided 11.9 percent. In 1998, last year, the Federal Government provided only 7.6 percent of the total funding for elementary and secondary education. 
   The Federal Government, through the 1980s--the Reagan and Bush years and on into this decade--had been cutting the amount of Federal support for elementary and secondary education. This gap from about 11.9 percent to 7.6 percent is made up in property taxes. It is made up in local taxes and State taxes--where they have been asked and see the need to fill in that gap. So we have failed in our responsibility to adequately help our States and local communities fund education. 
   I see my friend from Hawaii is here. I just want to make one other short comment and I will yield the floor to him. 
   Last Thursday, the assistant majority leader said something about teachers. He said:  
   I heard both of my colleagues say--  
   Being me since I was the one speaking--  
   ``Boy, we need more Federal teachers or more school buildings.''  
   Then Senator NICKLES said:  
   Is that really the business of the Federal Government?  
   I never said we need more Federal teachers. But I did say we need more local teachers. We need more teachers to help reduce the size of classes. I believe that is a legitimate Federal responsibility, going out and helping our local communities. Not a one of those teachers we hired this year to reduce class size works for the Federal Government. They work 
   for local school districts. But we are doing our part in helping. 
   To say that we need more school buildings is right. There are more children in U.S. schools than at any time in our history--53.2 million students. The average age of our buildings is 42 years old. 
   Yes, Mr. NICKLES, we need some newer schools, more schools, and we need some more computers in classrooms; we need more qualified teachers and more teachers to reduce class size. But, again, education is last on the list. 
   Last, we are facing the end of the year. We have a 17-percent cut where we stand right now in education--dead last. So much for Republican priorities on education. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Do I control the time, Mr. President?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, for a great statement on education. That is why I am taking the floor now, to talk about it and to lay out what has happened this year in education funding. 
   I think my colleague, my friend from Arkansas, has really encapsulated it. There should be no higher priority in our country than the education of our children. I thank my colleague. We will work together on this. 
   Education should not be a partisan issue. It should be bipartisan; it should have strong support from both parties. However, I am constrained to say at the beginning of this year, the Republican leadership said they were going to make education No. 1, the No. 1 priority. That is what the Senate majority leader said in January. That is what the chairman of the Budget Committee said. I am the ranking member on the appropriations subcommittee for education. When we got our initial allocation, we were then at a cut, in  the beginning, of $8 billion below a freeze from last year. 
   I think my colleague, the chairman of our subcommittee, Senator SPECTER, has done a splendid job trying to get us moving forward. We were supposed to have a markup in May. That was postponed. This is for education. Then in June, postponed. Then we were supposed to mark up after the Fourth of July recess--postponed. They were supposed to do it before the August recess. We were supposed to have marked up last week--postponed. We were supposed to mark up this week--postponed. Why? Because the education subcommittee's funding has been raided to pay for other things. 
   So I say to my friend from Arkansas, we have gone from No. 1 to No. 13. We can act on every other appropriations bill in the Senate, but education is dead last. 
   Talk about priorities. I do not run the floor. The Republican leadership runs this floor and how we bring up the bills. We have not even brought the education appropriations bill up yet. We have 14 days left in this fiscal year. We passed a bill today that includes a pay raise for all the Senators and Congressmen. We passed that. We had time for that. We had the money for that. We had the money for defense. We have had the money for everything else. But we do not seem to have the money for education. 
   What kind of a signal does that send? I said the other day, I feel sort of like that movie actor Bill Murray in ``Ground Hog Day.'' We keep getting the promise we are going to mark up education and it never happens. It never quite gets there. We never quite get to that day. 
   So we have gone from 1st to 13th--dead last--in the Senate in terms of the priority for education. 
   So what happened this week? Again, the education budget was raided, with $7.5 billion taken out of the education budget for VA-HUD. I am all for veterans. We have to fund our veterans' programs and medical care and housing. But they had to take it out of our education budget. In fact, even as I speak right now, the Appropriations Committee is marking up the VA-HUD bill with money that ought to be in there for education. 
   So where does that leave us? That has left our Appropriations Subcommittee $15.5 billion below a freeze from last year. That translates into a 17-percent cut below last year. 
   What does that mean for education? When you factor out education from all the other things we have in our bill, that is a $5.6 billion cut in education below what we had last year. And education is the No. 1 priority of the Republican leadership? Say again? I do not understand this. We can fund everything else. We can pass every other bill. We can give huge increases to the Pentagon. But right now, as we stand here today, education is going to take a $5.6 billion cut. 
   That translates into real cuts--real cuts for teachers, for example. We figured this out. We had an initiative last year of reducing class sizes. Everyone agrees, reducing class sizes is a goal that we ought to be pursuing diligently. This year we funded reducing class sizes by $1.2 billion. If this cut, where it stands right now, goes through, we will have to fire 5,246 teachers we just hired will lose their jobs. So 5,000 teachers we hired for this school year, to reduce class sizes, will have to be let go with the 17-percent cut. 
   Then I looked to see what it would do in my own State of Iowa. In Iowa, for example, some of the things that are most meaningful in education, title I--the title I reading and math program will be cut $11.3 million with this 17-percent cut; special education, IDEA, will be cut $8.5 million; class size reduction--the one I just spoke about; cutting the teachers--will be cut $1.6 million in the State of Iowa; safe and drug-free schools will be cut $717,000 from a $3.6 million level. That is just in my State of Iowa. 
   I suggest to Senators that they might want to take a look at how much in each of their States' education funding will be cut where we are right now with that 17-percent across-the-board cut with what we have in our Education appropriations bill right now. 
   Check your State. Then go back and tell your Governors and tell your State legislators, tell your school boards, tell your principals and superintendents and teachers how much education is going to get cut and how much they are going to have to come up with in increased property taxes. I bet the Governors will love that in the States. 
   So right now education is dead last in the priorities in what 
   is going on in the Senate. What does that say to our kids? What does that say to the people in general? We have increased defense spending. Oh, yes, we increased defense spending $16 billion. We have cut education by $5.6 billion. I guess we are going to have the strongest military in the world, and we are going to have a bunch of dummies in it or have more money in the military for remedial math and reading programs to bring them up to standards. 
   Mr. President, I end where I started. We went from first in priority to dead last. That is unacceptable. We have to turn it around for the future of this country. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator GORTON for permitting me at this time to speak as in morning business before they get on with the important business of the Interior appropriations bill. I want to take this time because I was unable to be here earlier when Senator FEINGOLD, Senator REED, I think, and Senator BOXER spoke on the issue of East Timor. I want to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues what I saw during my recent trip to East Timor with a delegation that included Senator REED of Rhode Island and Congressman MCGOVERN of Massachusetts. We were in East Timor on August 20 and 21, just a little over 2 weeks ago. The purpose of our trip was to assess the conditions in East Timor leading up to the August 30 referendum. 
   It was a trip that in some ways was uplifting but at the end--I could smell it in the air--I had a foreboding of things to come. On the first day we traveled to the capital of East Timor, Dili and spent the night there. The next day, under the auspices of the United Nations, we took a helicopter to Maliana, and then from Maliana to Suai before returning to Jakarta. What was so uplifting about it was to see so many people willing to risk their lives to be able to vote; people whose homes were burned down, their lives threatened, families threatened, and yet they were going to vote. 
   When the vote was taken, over 98 percent of those registered came out to vote. Mr. President, 78 percent of the people of East Timor voted for independence and not to stay with Indonesia, a clear-cut victory for independence and, I can say from firsthand meetings with U.N. and U.S. officials as well as with people on the ground in East Timor, that had it not been for the open assaults by the militias and intimidation and threats, that 78 percent probably would have been about 90 percent for independence. 
   When I left East Timor, Senator REED and Congressman MCGOVERN and I all called on the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force immediately to East Timor, either on the day of the vote or the day after the vote. 
   We all had a sense of what might come if there was not a stable force on the ground to prevent the violence from happening in the first place. 
   Upon returning to Jakarta, we met an hour and a half with President Habibie of Indonesia, and I will have more to say about that in a minute. We conveyed to him our concerns with the security situation in East Timor. He assured us time and time again in the hour-and-a-half meeting that Indonesia would maintain order in East Timor. I was there with Congressman MCGOVERN and with U.S. Ambassador Roy. President Habibie assured us the Indonesian Army would maintain peace, harmony and law and order after the vote was taken. 
   My fears of what would happen have been confirmed in the most horrific manner. As we have all witnessed on CNN and in the newspapers over the past several days, the militias have gone on a killing rampage acting on the orders and with the assistance of the Indonesian military and the Indonesian police forces. 
   I must tell my colleagues, when we were in Maliana, for example, a couple days before we were there, the militias had put on street demonstrations right in front of the U.N. compound armed to the teeth with guns. Amongst these militias were the Indonesian military and the Indonesian police in clear violation of the agreement they had signed with Portugal and the United Nations on May 5, 1999. Every U.N. observer with whom I spoke, every single one without exception, said the militias were backed by and armed by the Indonesian military and that the military and the civilian police were supporting the militias openly. 
   Now that these militias have gone on a rampage, one must ask, where is the Indonesian military and where is the Indonesian police? The Indonesian military had 10,000 to 15,000 military people there. They could have stopped it. They either chose not to or they are actively supporting this murderous rampage. Either is unacceptable. 
   They are attacking unarmed civilians. They are rounding up refugees,  putting them in trucks, and trucking them to unknown destinations. They are tearing families apart. Just as we saw in Kosovo, the same thing is happening in East Timor. Husbands are separated from wives, parents separated from their children and carted off in trucks into the back country, and no one knows what is happening to them. The same thing is happening as happened in Kosovo. 
   When we were in East Timor, we spent an evening with Bishop Belo, the Catholic bishop of East Timor. I will point out a bit of history. 
   East Timor for the last I think it was 400-some years was under Portuguese domination. About 200 years ago, Portugal formally annexed East Timor. It was a colony of Portugal up to 1975 when Portugal left. Indonesia brutally invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the next year. The United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's annexation of East Timor. 
   Through the years since then, the East Timorese have suffered mightily. Over 200,000 East Timorese, it is estimated, were brutally slaughtered by the Indonesian military over these years. But they persisted. They persisted in wanting their independence. In 1991, sadly, East Timor got worldwide attention when Indonesian troops opened fire on mourners who were at a funeral for an independence supporter in Dili. It was a big funeral. There were 200 men, women, and children slaughtered by the Indonesian military in 1991. 
   Through all of this, Bishop Belo, East Timorese by birth and upbringing, ordained a Catholic priest in Portugal, came back to East Timor, elevated by Pope John Paul II to be a bishop. 
   Two years ago on June 18, Bishop Belo was in Washington and said a mass of peace and reconciliation at St. Peter's Church. A number of us were there that morning. That was the first time I had the occasion to meet Bishop Belo. 
   Of course, the year before that, in 1996, Bishop Belo and Jose Ramos Horta jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize for their peaceful resistance through the years to the Indonesian takeover of East Timor. A year after that, Bishop Belo was here and said mass at St. Peter's, as I said, and we were there. 
   It was for me a very touching moment, to spend an evening in Bishop Belo's home in Dili with Senator REED and Congressman MCGOVERN, to have dinner in his home and talk with him about what was happening in East Timor and to hear him pour out his heart about how many people had died and the suffering of the East Timorese people and his hopes and his prayers. We held hands around the table and he led us in a prayer that, regardless of what the outcome of the vote would be, East Timorese would not kill each other and that the Indonesian military would quietly leave. 
   I am saddened to say that 3 days ago the militias entered the compound of Bishop Belo and burned his house down, the very house in which we had dinner not more than two weeks ago. He was able to escape and is now in Australia. 
   We sat in Bishop Belo's dining room and saw all the mementos he had. He had a picture of himself shaking hands and being greeted by President Clinton, a bust of President Kennedy that was given to him by Representative PATRICK KENNEDY who visited there a few years ago, a signed picture from President Bush who had met with him, and, of course, his Nobel Peace Prize. Now that house has been reduced to ashes. 
   There were several thousand East Timorese in his compound being protected by the church. Eyewitnesses saw the militias killing people and some were being put on trucks--this is where the families were separated--and taken out into the countryside. 
   On Monday, I spoke with Jose Ramos Horta, his corecipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He said in the 500-year history of East Timor, the church has never been attacked. There have been wars and there has been fighting, but the church has never been attacked. He even said that when the Japanese took over East Timor during World War II they never attacked the church. 
   As bad as that is, I have an even sadder story to tell. 
   We went to the community of Suai, which is in the southwestern part of East Timor, because we had heard there were about 1,500 people who had taken up refuge in a church compound. This was now 9 days before the vote. We wanted to go there and see for ourselves. So Senator REED, Congressman MCGOVERN, and I went there. 
   Truly, there were 1,500 people in this compound. 
   The buhpati, as he is called, the mayor, the person who runs the city, had cut off the water. It was very hot, and he had cut off the water to these people. Who were these people? These were people who had been driven from their homes because the militias feared that they were going to vote for independence. Men, women, children, families, all gathered in this churchyard, had their water cut off. 
   Then the U.N. tried to get through a truckload of food. They wouldn't even let the food get through. The two priests who were protecting these people were Father Hilario and Father Francisco. This is a picture I had taken with them at the church compound. Father Hilario and Father Francisco, two of the nicest individuals you ever want to meet, both Catholic priests, only doing their job protecting people. They weren't speaking out for independence or anything like that. They were simply doing their job as the parish priests. 
   I learned this morning that yesterday the militias entered their house, took these two priests out and killed them, 2 weeks after we saw them. Unarmed, they were. Militias took them out and brutally killed them. That is what is happening in East Timor today. 
   We have a responsibility that goes back 23 years. When Indonesia first invaded East Timor in 1975, the United States took the position that we supported Indonesia. I was at that time a Member of the House of Representatives and, with other Members of the House, introduced a resolution condemning Indonesia for their brutal invasion of East Timor at that time. In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands, almost 200,000 East Timorese lost their lives to the brutality of the Indonesian military. Through it all, they maintained their cohesion. They maintained their peaceful resistance. On August 30, 98 percent of the registered voters came out to vote in the face of machetes and bullets and threats. Despite being driven from their homes and having their homes burned down; they voted 78 percent for independence. 
   If we stand for anything, we should stand for the right of self-determination and independence when people exercise their right to vote. That is what we stand for as Americans. That is our philosophical foundation. 
   It was a free and fair vote, even though the militias were intimidating people. 
   I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.

   Mr. HARKIN. It seems to me that for the bastion of democracy, those of us in this country who believe so deeply in the right of the secret ballot, the right of people to be able to vote for their futures, to see this happen and for us to stand back and do nothing is shameful. We ought to be on the front lines of asking the United Nations to go in there with a peacekeeping force now. 
   I had asked the United Nations and the Clinton administration to put pressure on the U.N. to send a peacekeeping force to East Timor on the day of the vote or the day after the vote. If we had done that, we wouldn't have had these killings that have gone on. We could have had a little bit of preventive action. But, no, we didn't do it. We said we had to wait until the Indonesians asked us to come in. It is clear that the Government of Indonesia is not going to keep law and order there. It is clear from every eyewitness account we have that the Indonesian military is behind the militias and their brutal attacks on innocent civilians. So now it is incumbent upon the world community to answer the call to go to East Timor to restore peace and stability. 
   I will shortly be introducing a resolution to that effect that basically congratulates the East Timorese on their vote, condemns the violence, and calls upon our U.N. Ambassador to seek the United Nations Security Council's immediate authorization to deploy an international force to East Timor to restore peace and stability. 
   Already Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Thailand, Pakistan, Malaysia, and the Philippines have all said they will contribute forces. Today, we learned that China has basically said they are open minded on this issue. Well, now is the time for the United States to take some leadership. 
   I call upon President Clinton to be forceful in calling upon the United Nations to send an international force immediately to East Timor, and we should contribute to this force. We should not shirk our responsibilities in this matter either. 
   To do nothing now would be to fly in the face of everything for which this great country stands for. We were one of those actively encouraging the Indonesians, the Portuguese, the United Nations, and the East Timorese to reach this agreement to allow this vote. We supplied funding and observers for the vote. The Carter Center was actively involved in East Timor, ensuring it would be a free and fair vote and counting the ballots. If we now walk away, if we now say, well, we can't do anything unless Indonesia invites us in to a place that they annexed with brutal force 23 years ago then we are less of an America than we have been in the past. 
   I am deeply saddened by the death of these two priests. I didn't know them well, but I spent some time with them, spoke with them, asked them about what they were doing, asked them about the conditions in their parishes. They were gentle souls just doing their job as shepherds of their flocks, yet taken out and brutally murdered. 
   Lastly, I understand that by tomorrow, the United Nations will remove the 212 people they have there now. I am again asking the President to call upon Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, to not pull out our U.N. people who are there. If we do, we will have no eyes and no ears; we will have no presence at all in East Timor, and the killing rampages we have witnessed over the last several days will only mushroom. 
   I hope the U.N. will keep its people there. I hope the United States will put every ounce of our leadership behind the United Nations to send an international force there within the next 48 hours. If we do, we can save thousands of lives. And we can restore peace and stability. We can tell the rest of the world that when you have a free and fair and open election under U.N. auspices, we are not going to let thugs and murderers take it away from you. That is the kind of America I think we ought to be.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``National Fund for Health Research Act of 1999''. And I am particularly pleased to be joined in this effort by my friend and colleague, Senator SPECTER. This bill is similar to legislation I introduced with Senator SPECTER in the 105th Congress, and with Senator HATFIELD during the 104th Congress. The bill gained broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. 
   Our proposal would establish a National Fund for Health Research to provide additional resources for health research over and above those provided to the National Institutes of Health in the annual appropriations process. The Fund would greatly enhance the quality of health care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures and cost-effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that strike Americans. 
   To finance the Fund, health plans would set aside approximately 1 percent of all health premiums and transfer the funds to the National Fund for Health Research. 
   Each year under our proposal amounts within the National Fund for Health Research would automatically be allocated to each of the NIH Institutes and Centers. Each Institute and Center would receive the same percentage as they received of the total NIH appropriation for that fiscal year. The set aside would result in a significant annual budget increase for NIH. 
   In 1994 I argued that any health care reform plan should include additional funding for health research. Systematic health care reform has been taken off the front burner but the need to increase our nation's commitment to health research has not diminished. 
   While health care spending devours over $1 trillion annually our medical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States devotes less than 3 percent of its total health care budget to health research. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on research. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war against disease and disability continues. 
   Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health costs in the long run. For example, the costs of Alzheimer's will more than triple in the coming century--adding further strains to Medicare as the baby boomers retire. We know that through research there is a real hope of a major breakthrough in this area. Simply delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years would save an estimated $50 billion. 
   Gene therapy and treatments for cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could eliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving patients' quality of life. 
   Mr. President, Senator SPECTER and I do everything we can to increase funding for NIH through the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill. But the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has put us on track to dramatically decrease discretionary spending, so that the nation's investment in health research through the NIH is likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative action is taken. 
   The NIH is not able to fund even 30% of competing research projects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. Science and cutting edge medical research are being put on hold. We may be giving up possible cures for diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's and countless other diseases. 
   Mr. President, health research is an investment in our future--it is an investment in our children and grandchildren. It holds the promise of cure of treatment for millions of Americans.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last month I had the honor of accompanying President Clinton and Education Secretary Richard Riley on a visit to Amos Hiatt Middle School in Des Moines, Iowa. We were joined by a high school teacher named Ruth Ann Gaines and an 8th grade student, Catherine Swoboda for a discussion on the need to modernize our nation's schools. 
   Hiatt Middle School opened its doors in 1925 and students spend all but a few hours a week in classrooms built during a time when Americans could not  imagine the technological advances that would occur by the end of the century. 
   In 1925, Americans were flocking to movie theaters to see--and hear--the first talking motion picture--Al Jolson's ``The Jazz Singer.'' The students who walked through the doors of the brand new Hiatt school that year could not imagine IMAX theaters with surround sound where a movie goer actually becomes a part of the film. 
   In 1925, consumers were lining up in department stores to buy novelties like electric phonographs, dial telephones, and self-winding watches. CDS, DVD players, cellular telephones or palm pilots were unthinkable. 
   And, the introduction of state-of-the art technologies like rural electrification and crop dusting were revolutionizing the lives of families and farmers alike. 
   There have been incredible technological and scientific advances in the past seven decades. Yet, our schools have not kept pace with the times. We continue to educate our children in schools built and equipped in bygone eras. 
   Mr. President, Iowa has a long and proud tradition when it comes to public education--a tradition which dates back to before statehood. 
   As a result of the Land Ordinance of 1785, every township in the new Western Territory was required to set aside 640 acres of land for support of public education. Iowa's first elementary school was established in 1830 and the first high school in 1850. 
   In 1858, the Iowa Free School Act laid the foundation for Iowa's public school system. By 1859 the state had 4,200 public schools--some in log cabins. 
   This long commitment to education has brought great results. 
   From 1870 on into this century, Iowa had the nation's highest literacy rate and the nation's highest test scores. Iowa students continue to do well but we must do better. Our public education system has served us well. But, the times have changed dramatically. 
   The thousands of one-room school houses that dotted the countryside served us well for 
   many generations. But time marches on and so must our schools. Just as the pot-belly stove gave way to central heat; candles gave way for electric lights; the blackboard and chalk must make way for the computer. We must make sure that every child and every school can facilitate the technology of the 21st century. However, Iowa State University reports that we need at least $4 billion over the next ten years to repair and upgrade school buildings and Iowa and make sure they can effectively utilize educational technology. 
   Mr. President, the facts about the need to modernize and upgrade our nation's pubic school facilities are well known. 
   The General Accounting Office estimates that 14 million American children attend classes in schools that are unsafe or inadequate and it will cost $112 billion to upgrade existing public schools to overall good condition. In addition, GAO reports that 46 percent of schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. 
   Enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at all time high and will continue to grow over the next 10 years making it necessary for the United States to build an additional 6,000 schools.

   Mr. HARKIN. 
   Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 1999,'' known as RECAA 1999. I am pleased to be joined by Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL; the distinguished Senate Minority Leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE; Senator JEFF BINGAMAN; and Senator PETE DOMENICI in introducing this legislation.  
   These long awaited amendments will ensure that the United States government meets its responsibility to provide fair and compassionate compensation to the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the mining of uranium and from fallout during the testing of nuclear weapons in the early post-war years. These citizens helped our nation during the Cold War and we must not forget them. 
   In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) was enacted. RECA, which I was proud to sponsor, affirmed the responsibility of the federal government to compensate individuals who were harmed by the radioactive fallout from atomic testing, for which the government took few precautions to ensure safety. Additionally, workers who have suffered long-term health problems because they were not adequately informed of the dangers faced during uranium mining were eligible for compensation under the act. 
   Administered through the Department of Justice, RECA has been responsible for compensating approximately 6,000 individuals for their injuries, but we can and should help a lot more. While the passage of the 1990 law was a momentous event, I have been carefully monitoring the implementation of the RECA program. 
   I am disturbed over numerous reports from my Utah constituents concerning the burdensome process of filing claims with the Department of Justice. One complaint which I hear far too often is ``that it is easier to compensate a dead miner, than one living with disease.'' We cannot let this injustice continue. We have drafted the RECA Amendments of 1999 in response to these concerns. 
   We should not add a bureaucratic nightmare to the burden of disease and ill-health already carried by these citizens. Moreover, excessive regulatory hurdles have made it too difficult for some deserving individuals to be fairly compensated under the Act. We must streamline and speed up the application process. In addition, advances in our medical knowledge compel us to modify the 1990 Act to define better criteria for compensation and to include diseases that we now know have radiogenic causes. 
   Let me explain how this bill was developed. RECA originally defined a list of 13 compensable diseases based upon the 1988 Radiation Exposed Veterans Compensation Act and the findings of the 1980 report of the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations (BEIR-III). In 1992, REVCA was amended based upon the findings of an updated BEIR-IV and -V Reports which defined a host of cancers that are considered for disability compensation due to radiation exposure. 
   In addition, the report of the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, released in 1995, provides further scientific evidence for changes in the 1990 RECA law. The Committee reviewed 125 current studies and more than 200 public witnesses in evaluating the risks and diseases caused by exposure to radiation conducted in the Cold War period. The conclusions of the advisory committee report support the reduction in radiation level exposure, the elimination of distinction between smokers and nonsmokers for lung cancer, and the inclusion of other radiogenic diseases. 
   Based on the evidence in both the President's Advisory Committee and the BEIR-V Committee Reports, we have extended the number of eligible radiogenic pathologies by six to include: lung, brain, colon, ovary, bladder, and salivary gland cancers. In addition, specific non-cancer diseases, such as silicosis, have been incorporated. Adding these diseases, which have been documented by science as linked to radiation exposure, will more fairly compensate our fellow citizens who were exposed to this danger so long ago. 
   With the inclusion of these modifications, miners, millers, and uranium ore transporters will be eligible in 11 western states to seek equitable compensation for their sacrifice in our nation's effort to produce our nuclear defense arsenal. I have worked with Senators DASCHLE, CAMPBELL, and BINGAMAN in reviewing Atomic Energy Commission records to document the uranium/vanadium mines supported by the U.S. government during and after the Manhattan Project. Eleven western states were found to have mines dating from 1947 through 1970 from which the U.S. government purchased radioactive ore. 
   Furthermore, uranium mills in these areas testify to the need to include millers who were exposed to radioactive decay without the benefit of state or government-instituted safety precautions. The report ``Raw Materials Activities of the Manhattan Project on the Colorado Plateau,'' by William Chenoweth, a noted geologist, documents the tragedies of exposure endured by miners, millers, and ore transporters as they extracted, prepared and moved the radioactive ore for use in the nuclear arsenal. These changes would enable an estimated 6,000 individuals harmed by exposure to uranium radiation to seek compensation. 
   Of the thousands affected by radiation exposure, many of the downwinders, miners and millers were members of Indian tribes. Particularly noteworthy was the large number of U.S. atomic energy mines on Native American reservations. Many of these miners were not aware of the dangers that radiation exposure can cause, and the government did little to inform them of the risks. After RECA 1990 was passed into law, many complications have hindered members of Indian tribes from seeking their compensation. In working with the members of the Navajo 
   Nation and other Native American tribes, we have developed legislation that largely addresses their concerns. The bill also instructs the Attorney General to take into account and make appropriate allowances for the laws, traditions, and customs of Indian tribes. 
   Finally, my bill also contains a grant program designed to provide for the early detection, prevention and education on radiogenic diseases. These programs will screen for the early warning signs of cancer, provide medical referrals, educate individuals on radiogenic cancers as well as prevention, and facilitate documentation of RECA claims. These grants will be available to a wide range of health care providers including: cancer centers, hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, community health centers, and state departments of health. 
   Some may question the cost of our legislation. Let me set the record straight. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost close to $1 billion over the next 21 years. That averages out to just over $47 million a year. This estimate is significantly lower than other proposals that have been considered by Congress over the past several years. Ours is, I believe, a common sense approach that keeps to the intent of the original statute. 
   But, Mr. President, in considering the cost, it is important to remember what prompted the original statute. What justified this compensation program in the first place? The answer is that the federal government during the early years of the atomic testing program, exposed American citizens--our neighbors--to deadly nuclear fallout. Knowing that there would be adverse effects of exposure to fallout, the government exploded these bombs so that the fallout would blow ``downwind'' of the more heavily populated cities. There was no warning or instruction about minimizing exposure for the citizens in these rural areas. In my view, Mr. President, this bill is only fair and just. If we fail to provide even basic compensation for the hardships they have endured, we will still be taking them for granted. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me and Senators DASCHLE, CAMPBELL, BINGAMAN, and DOMENICI in meeting our nation's commitment to the thousands of individuals who were victims of radiation exposure while supporting our country's national defense. I believe we have an obligation to care for those who were injured, especially since, at the time, they were not adequately warned about the potential health hazards involved with their work. Now is our chance to compensate these men and women for their injuries. I urge my colleagues to support these Americans by cosponsoring the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 1999.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will inform and empower consumers in the United States through a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made without the use of abusive and exploitative child labor. I am joined in my efforts by Senators HOLLINGS and DORGAN. I want to thank them for working with me on this important effort. 
   This is the third time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this bill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law. 
   I'd like to ask my colleagues to take a moment to look around. Maybe it's the shirt you have on right now. Or the silk tie or blouse. Or the tennis shoes you wear on weekends. 
   Chances are that you have purchased something--perhaps many things--made with abusive and exploitative child labor. And chances are you were completely unaware that was the case. You will find a label that tells you what size it is, how to care for it and what it costs. But it doesn't tell you about the person who made it. 
   Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization (ILO) released a very grim report about the number of children who toil away in abhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over two hundred and fifty million children worldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving a basic education. Many of these children begin working in factories at the age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and often forced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay. 
   Now when I speak about child labor, I am not talking about 17 year-olds helping out on the family farm or running errands after school. I am speaking about children, often under 12 years old, who are forced to work long hours in hazardous and dangerous conditions many as slaves instead of going to school. 
   On September 23, 1993, the Senate appropriately put itself on record as expressing its principled opposition to the abhorrent practice of exploiting children for commercial gain and asserting that it should be the policy of the United States to prohibit the importation of products made through the use of abusive and exploitative child labor by passing a Sense of the Senate Resolution I introduced. In my view, this was the first step toward ending child labor. 
   Americans in Des Moines or Dallas or Detroit may say, ``What does this have to do with us?'' It is quite simple. By protecting the rights of workers everywhere, we will be protecting jobs and opportunities here at home. A U.S. worker cannot compete with a 12 year old working 12 hours a day for 12 cents. 
   In 1998, the United States imported almost 50 percent of the wearing apparel sold in this country and the garment industry netted $34 billion. According to the Department of Commerce, last year, the United States imported 494.1 million pairs of athletic footwear and produced only 65.3 
   million here at home. 
   As I have traveled around the country and spoken with people about the issue of abusive and exploitative child labor, I have found that consumers--ordinary Americans--want to get involved. They want information. They want to know if the products they are buying are made by children. 
   According to a survey sponsored by Marymount University, more than three out of four Americans said they would avoid shopping at stores if they were aware that the good sold there were made by exploitative and abusive child labor. They also said that they would be willing to pay an extra $1 on a $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made under legitimate circumstances. 
   Mr. President it is obvious that consumers don't want to reward companies with their hard earned dollars by buying products made with abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   This issue demands our attention. Our legislation, the Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act 1999, will inform and empower consumers in the United States through a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made without abusive and exploitative child labor. In my view, a system of voluntary labeling holds the best promise of giving consumers the information they want--and giving the companies that manufacture these products the recognition they deserve. 
   The crux of this legislation is to provide the framework for members of the wearing apparel and sporting goods industry, labor organizations, consumer advocacy and human rights groups along with the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury and Labor to establish the labeling standard and develop a system to assure compliance that items were not made with abusive and exploitative child labor. Thus, ensuring consumers that the garment or pair of tennis shoes they purchase was made without abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   In my view, Congress can't do it alone through legislation. The Department of Labor can't do it alone through enforcement. It takes all of us from the private sector to labor and human rights groups to take responsibility, to come together to end abusive and exploitative child labor. And I am pleased to say there has recently been promising action to that end. 
   Mr. President, when the private sector decides to take speak up--it certainly can make a difference. In Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has agreed to work with the International Labor Organization to take children out of the garment factories and put them into school--where they belong. As of May 1999, more than 353 schools for former child workers have opened, serving nearly 10,000 children. So, if we can do it in Bangladesh, then we can do it elsewhere. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear, companies can choose to use the label or not to. This bill is not about big government telling the private sector what to do. This bill is centered around this fundamental principle: Let the Buyer Be Aware. This ``Truth in Labeling'' initiative is based on 
   the principle that a fully informed American consumer will make the right, and moral, choice and vote against abusive and exploitative child labor with their pocketbook. 
   We have seen such an approach work effectively with the Rugmark label for hand-knotted carpets from India. It is operating in some European countries. Consumers who want to buy child labor-free carpets can just look for the Rugmark label. I visited the Rugmark headquarters in New Delhi, India last year. Mr. President, this initiative is working. It has succeeded in taking children out of the factories and putting them into schools while providing consumers with the information they need. To date, 1.25 million of carpets have received the Rugmark label. 
   Mr. President, the progress that has been made on eradicating abusive and exploitative child labor is irreversible.  Therefore we must continue to more forward. And I believe my bill allows us to do just that. It allows the consumer to know more about the products they buy and give companies that use the label the recognition they deserve. 
   Our nation began this century by working to end abusive and exploitative child labor in America, let us close this century by ending child labor around the world. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1999. The bill I am introducing today prohibits the importation of any product made, whole or in part, by children under the age of 15 who are employed in manufacturing or mining. This is the fifth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this bill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law. I would like to thank Senators HOLLINGS, DORGAN, LEVIN, MIKULSKI and KENNEDY for joining me in this important effort as original cosponsors of this legislation. 
   The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that over two hundred and fifty million children worldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving a basic education. Many of these children begin working in factories at the age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and often forced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay. 
   Child labor is most prevalent in countries with high adult unemployment rates. According to the ILO, some 61 percent of child workers, nearly 153 million children, are found in Asia; 32 percent, or 80 million, are in Africa and 7 percent, or 175 million, live in Latin America. Adult unemployment rates in some nations runs over 20 percent. In Latin America, for example, about one in every ten children are workers. Furthermore, in many nations where child labor is prevalent, more money is spent and allocated for military expenditures than for education and health services. 
   The situation is as deplorable as it is enormous. In many developing countries children represent a substantial part of the work force and can be found in such industries as rugs, toys, textiles, mining, and sports equipment manufacturing. 
   For instance, it is estimated that 65% of the wearing apparel that Americans purchase is assembled or manufactured abroad, therefore, increasing the chance that these items were made by abusive and exploitative child labor. In the rug industry, Indian and Pakistan produce 95% of their rugs for export. Some of the worst abuses of child labor have been documented in these countries, including bonded and slave labor. 
   Children may also be crippled physically by being forced to work too early in life. For example, a large-scale ILO survey in the Philippines found that more than 60 percent of working children were exposed to chemical and biological hazards, and that 40 percent experienced serious injuries or illnesses. 
   These practices are often underground, but the ILO report points out that children are still being sold outright for a sum of money. Other times, landlords buy child workers from their tenants, or labor ``contractor'' pay rural families in advance in order to take their children away to work in carpet-weaving, glass manufacturing or prostitution. Child slavery of this type has long been reported in South Asia, South-East Asia and West Africa, despite vigorous official denial of its existence. 
   Additionally, children are increasingly being bought and sold across national borders by organized networks. The ILO report states that at least five such international networks trafficking in children exist: from Latin America to Europe and the Middle East; from South and South-East Asia to northern Europe and the Middle East; a European regional market; an associated Arab regional market; and, a West Africa export market in girls. 
   In Pakistan, the ILO reported in 1991 that an estimated half of the 50,000 children working as bonded labor in Pakistan's carpet-weaving industry will never reach the age of 12--victims of disease and malnutrition. 
   I have press reports from India of children freed from virtual slavery in  the carpet factories of northern India. Twelve-year-old Charitra Chowdhary recounted his story--he said, ``If we moved slowly we were beaten on our backs with a stick. We wanted to run away but the doors were always locked.'' 
   Mr. President, that's what this bill is about, children, whose dreams and childhood are being sold for a pittance--to factor owners and in markets around the globe. 
   It's about protecting children around the globe and their future. It's about eliminating a major form of child abuse in our world. It's about breaking the cycle of poverty by getting these kids out of factories and into schools. It's about raising the standard of living in the Third World so we can compete on the quality of goods instead of the misery and suffering of those who make them. It's about assisting Third World governments to enforce their laws by ending the role of the United States in providing a lucrative market for goods made by abusive and exploitative child labor and encouraging other nations to do the same. 
   Mr. President, unless the economic exploitation of children is eliminated, the potential and creative capacity of future generations will forever be lost to the factory floor. 
   Mr. President, the Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1999 is intended to strengthen existing U.S. trade laws and help Third World countries enforce their child labor laws. The bill directs the U.S. Secretary of Labor to compile and maintain a list of foreign industries and their respective host countries that use child labor in the production of exports to the United States. Once the Secretary of Labor identifies a foreign industry, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to prohibit the importation of a product from an identified industry. The entry ban would not apply if a U.S. importer signs a certificate of origin affirming that they took reasonable steps to ensure that products imported from identified industries are not made by child labor. In addition, the President is urged to seek an agreement with other governments to secure an international ban on trade in the products of child labor. Further, any company or individual who would intentionally violate the law would face both civil and criminal penalties. 
   This legislation is not about imposing our standards on the developing world. It's about preventing those manufacturers in the developing world who exploit child labor from imposing their standards on the United States. They are forewarned. If manufacturers and importers insist on investing in child labor, instead of investing in the future of children, I will work to assure that their products are barred from entering the United States. 
   Mr. President, as I said when I first introduced this bill five years ago, it is time to end this human tragedy and our participation in it. It is time for greater government and corporate responsibility. No longer can officials in the Third World or U.S. importers turn a blind eye to the suffering and misery of the world's children. No longer do American consumers want to provide a market for goods produced by the sweat and toil of children. By providing a market for goods produced by child labor, U.S. importers have become part of the problem by perpetuating the impoverishment of poor families. Through this legislation, importers now have the opportunity to become part of the solution by ending this abominable practice. 
   Mr. President, countries do not have to wait until poverty is eradicated or they are fully developed before eliminating the economic exploitation of children. In fact, the path to development is to eliminate child labor and increase expenditures on children such as primary education. In far too many countries, governments spend millions on military expenditures and fail to provide basic educational opportunities to its citizens. As a result, over 130 million children are not in primary school. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, this legislation places no undue burden on U.S. importers. I know of no importer, company, or department store that would willingly promote the exploitation of children. I know of no importer, company, or department store that would want their products and image tainted by having their products produced by child labor. And I know that no American consumer would knowingly purchase something made with abusive and exploitative child labor. These entities take reasonable steps to ensure the quality of their goods; they should also be willing to take reasonable steps to ensure that their goods are not produced by child labor. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed into the RECORD.

I ask the author of the amendment exactly how this differs from the last package, the Cochran amendment, which is set aside right now. As I look at it, the difference between this package and what we voted on yesterday, the Cochran amendment, is $400 million for crop insurance premium reductions and $400 million for disaster payments for 1999 crop losses. Is that correct?

   Mr. HARKIN. In examining this amendment now before us, the difference is about $800 million, give or take a little bit. So while the package yesterday was about 6.9, this raises it to about 7.7, if I am not mistaken. 
   My opinion on this, Mr. President, is that while we are making some movements here, I think things are working right. 
   I yield again to my friend from Kansas.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for clarifying that. 
   Again, I make the point that I think we do see some movement. I am still hopeful we can reach a decent compromise on these packages. I believe that is accomplishable. 
    I think we can accomplish that. 
   I might just say that I think the $400 million in disaster payments for this year, I say to my friend from Kansas, is still inadequate, too low. From all of the indications we get from disasters up and down the east coast, in the Mid-Atlantic States, plus some of the disaster we have had out in North Dakota and other places, and flooding, as we have had in my State of Iowa, $400 million is simply not going to be enough to handle the disasters this year. I think we need to work a little bit more on that in terms of disaster payments for this year. 
   The $400 million you put in for the crop insurance, I applaud. We had that in our bill. I think that is a good measure. I am a little concerned about the payments for oilseeds. Here is where we get into the policy issue on the AMTA payments and LDP.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. We can work on that. The Senator may not be wrong on that. That may be closer to what we probably should be doing. There are other things in that disaster part I tell the Senator to look at. We did not completely fill the needs of last year's disaster. I think the Senator from North Dakota can talk about that. We had about $300 million in our bill just to meet the disaster needs of last year that were not fully paid for. So I ask you to look at that. You may be right on not anticipating or knowing exactly where the Mid-Atlantic States are right now. But there are other things we had in our disaster bill that we do know about and that do need to be addressed. 
   Lastly, I want to say again, on the payments to oilseeds, which is in the Senator's bill, which is about $500 million, this really gets to the heart of whether we should have all AMTA payments or some mix of that and LDPs. Under AMTA payments, of course, you don't get any payments for soybeans. Under LDP, you do. Under the proposal we had, which our side offered yesterday, under LDP, we estimated there would be about $1 billion that would go to soybean producers for their losses this year. Under the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, there is $500 million in payments to all oilseeds, including soybeans. So we had not only $1 billion in the LDP, we had about $1 billion in purchases. So the $500 million is about a fourth of what we estimated the need would be for oilseeds. 
   That is why I still hope we can reach some compromise on having a blend of AMTA payments and LDP payments, because I think LDP payments would more adequately respond to the needs of oilseeds than would a $500 million payment. 
   Other than that, as I said, I think there is some good progress here, and I think there is some basis for reaching some kind of compromise agreement before the Sun sets today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I compliment and thank my colleague from North Dakota for crafting this new proposal and for all of his hard work on behalf of farmers and ranchers all over this country. Senator DORGAN has, indeed, been a leader in this Senate in focusing attention on the fact that so many of our farmers and ranchers are in dire straits, and that we need a substantial package of relief and help to get them through this winter and into next year. 
   What Senator DORGAN has now sent to the desk is, hopefully, a reaching out to our colleagues and friends on the Republican side to join us in this effort. The proposal we had yesterday that I had offered was $10.7 billion. This is now $1 billion less. So we have come down $1 billion. We have taken some money out of places which, quite frankly, this Senator thinks is going to be hard to explain to some farmers. But in order to try to reach an agreement with our colleagues on the other side, for at least a meaningful package, Senator DORGAN and I and others have crafted this new package that is $1 billion less than what we offered yesterday. 
   This may, indeed, be the Senate's last chance to vote on a meaningful package of support for our farmers and ranchers. 
   Again, the amounts that are in this package are pretty close to the minimum of what we are going to need. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why we have the proposal again before us that, as I understand it, is about $400 million more than what it was yesterday.  
   I don't know, the Senator from Mississippi might correct me on that, but I think it is about $400 million more. I think that includes crop insurance.

   That is a step in the right direction to put that $400 million for the Crop Insurance Program. That was in our initial proposal. I am delighted to see it in this one. 
   But I must say the entire package is still not enough. Will it help? Sure, it will help. Heck, $100 would help. I have farmers out in my area who would take $100. One thousand dollars would help. Yes; this will help. 
   If I might analogize it a little bit, it is the kind of help that if a person is out there drowning in deep water, and you throw him one of those little life preservers, the drowning person grabs ahold of the life preserver, only to find out there is a slow leak in it. It is going to keep that person alive for a while, give him a few more moments of life on Earth. Then the air is going to go out. 
   That is sort of the way I see the Republican amendment before us now. It will help. It will get some farmers through. It is going to leave a lot behind. I think it is going to hold out some false hopes. The last thing our farmers and ranchers need now is false hope. They need real hope that we are going to significantly address the problem. 
   Again, I point out that the amendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi includes payments that go out to farmers all as agriculture marketing transition adjustment payments, so-called AMTA payments. These payments are based upon old-fashioned, outdated ag policies. What I mean by that is that the AMTA payments are based upon something known as base acres and proven yields. Base acres has gone out the window; we don't have that any longer; and yet they reach back, years back, to take base acres and proven yields in order to make the payments. 
   I want to forewarn my colleagues: You are going to see a lot of stories in the paper this fall and this winter about people getting these payments who aren't even farming, aren't even raising a crop. But they are going to get them because several years ago, 10 years ago, they had some base acres and they had an established proven yield. They may not even have that any longer, but they are going to get a payment. They are going to get an AMTA payment. 
   Yet a young producer who may not even have been in business 10 years ago, who started up in this decade, does not have base acres, does not have proven yields, but they are out there struggling to get by, they are not going to get the same AMTA payment. They will get a modest LDP this fall that is already in the bill, but this amendment offers no further relief under the loan deficiency payments. 
   To be sure, I understand that Senator COCHRAN's amendment has a $500 million payment to soybeans and oilseeds. Again, that is helpful. But under our LDP program the payments to soybean producers would be in the neighborhood of about $1 billion, not $500 million. They deserve some help also. I shouldn't just say soybeans. I mean all oilseeds, whether it is safflower or canola oilseeds, would also get more under the LDP payment than they would under the AMTA payment. 
   That is why I believe the Cochran amendment is still insufficient and why I believe the amendment sent forward by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN, again may be our last best hope to get meaningful help to all the farmers--all of them, not just a few. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding the time.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Mississippi for letting us have this additional time. 
   Again, I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota and my colleague from Iowa. Sure, there are some things in this with which I do not agree. I do not think it all ought to go out in AMTA payments. 
   Obviously, the body has spoken. The Republicans have the votes on that. So it is done. 
   There is a better way of putting it out through the LDP system, but that is a moot point right now. What we are down to is really how much we are going to put out there and whether or not we are going to dribble it out or do something meaningful. 
   We keep coming down from the amendment we offered the other day for about 10.7; then we came down to 9.8, and I guess this now is about 8.5.

   Mr. HARKIN. It is 8.8. 
   So, again, I hope that Senators will see fit to at least endorse and vote for this package. The amendment offered by Senator COCHRAN has no money for section 32 purchases, which I think is going to be very important for our pork and cattlemen, to buy up some of this excess stuff we have and put it into food banks, school lunch programs, and things such as that. 
   I also must say there is no money in the Cochran amendment for price reporting. Quite frankly, I still think we have an obligation to do something about the unmet needs from the 1998 floods we had that so devastated North Dakota and some other parts of this country. Quite frankly, in this amendment, this compromise proposal that Senator CONRAD and Senator GRASSLEY have offered, there is money for that. 
   So I think it does represent a true compromise. It represents a sort of meeting between where we started yesterday and where the manager of the bill started. Again, I think there are some provisions in there I wish we could have changed, but we had our votes and we were not on the winning side of that. 
   So I think we can at least now have an agreement to get the amount of money out there, even though it is through the AMTA payments, that is needed and to provide some of the money for some of the areas that the Cochran amendment has omitted. 
   I thank the managers, and I thank Senator CONRAD for yielding me this time. I urge support of the amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I just respond to my friend from Oklahoma by saying that they can still go ahead and have the hearings and everything else after we adopt the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Nothing prevents the committee from going ahead and meeting and having the blue-ribbon panel appear, and proceed with hearings. But we ought to express ourselves here as to the health issues that confront us. 
   I also point out to my friend from Oklahoma that I was reading the blue-ribbon panel's page here on this, and I thought I might read the pertinent parts because it is not quite exactly as my friend from Oklahoma said. 
   On page 6 it says: ``Recommendations for Blending Fuel for Clean Air and Water.''  
   Based on its review of the current water protection programs, and the likely progress that can be made in tightening and strengthening those programs by implementing Recommendations 1-9 above, the Panel agreed broadly, although not unanimously, that even enhanced protection programs will not give adequate assurance that water supplies will be protected, and that changes need to be made to the RFG [the reformulated gasoline] program to reduce the amount of MTBE being used, while ensuring that the air quality benefits of RFG, and fuel supply and price stability, are maintained.  
   The next paragraph said:  
   The key elements of that package, described in more detail below, are: 
   Action agreed to broadly by the Panel to reduce the use of MTBE substantially (with some members supporting its complete  phaseout), and action by Congress to clarify federal and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline additives that threaten drinking water supplies.....  
   So I think it is quite clear where they are headed on that: To reduce MTBE use substantially. Some members even wanted its total elimination. 
   Mr. President, what we are talking about here is a health issue. I find it astounding----

   Mr. HARKIN. I beg to differ. The blue-ribbon panel's conclusions support the Senator's resolution. What we are talking about is phasing out MTBE, and encouraging the use of ethanol--an oxygenate that reduces air pollution and at the same time does not contaminate water supplies or adversely affect health. 
   That is what we are talking about. I was responding to the point of the Senator from Oklahoma about what the blue-ribbon panel was saying. They were clearly saying that we ought to substantially reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE. They want to make sure we have a fuel supply that is not a health hazard to our people. That is what they are saying. That is really the issue before us. It is a health issue, pure and simple. 
   Again, I find it astounding that people can argue and say: We have a lot of MTBE out there; forget that it is a possible human carcinogen; forget that it is highly polluting; let's go ahead and keep using it because, quite frankly, we don't have anything to replace it with right now. That is the sort of argument that is being used. 
   I thought the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, laid out quite succinctly how dangerous MTBE is. We have been told, first by the Senator from Texas, that it is just a matter of leaking tanks. Well, that is not just it at all. Senator DURBIN pointed out motor boats, motor skis, everything else, lawn mowers, motorcycles, airplanes, everything else that is using MTBE all leak a little bit, and every time it leaks, MTBE gets into the surface water and ground water. 
   One might say: Well, it is the gasoline leak that is the problem, and not what is in the gasoline. But when you have a gasoline leak, most of the components in gasoline, tend to break down. MTBE breaks down very little and very slowly, and it permeates rapidly. It is highly soluble in water, when it gets in water. If you put some oil in water, it doesn't mix. It can be separated out. But when MTBE gets in water, because of its chemical properties, it permeates the water quite rapidly, and that is what makes it so tough to get it out. It is not like oil or gasoline in water at all. It is highly soluble in the water. 
   As Senator DURBIN pointed out, the U.S. Geologic Survey has found that MTBE is the second most commonly found contaminant in ground water. But it has been in widespread use for only about 7 years. The second most prevalent contaminant in ground water in the United States, in a matter of only 7 years. EPA estimates that MTBE already can be detected in 5 to 10 percent of water supplies nationwide. 
   MTBE has been found to be leaking into groundwater at over 10,000 sites in California. A state report in Maine found that anywhere from 1,000 to 4,300 private wells could contain unhealthful levels of MTBE. And in New Hampshire, MTBE has been found in 100 public wells and water supplies. Five parts per billion is enough to contaminate water and make it taste and smell like turpentine. As I said, it is highly toxic. It is a poison. It permeates rapidly. 
   I think I would like to review a little bit some of the history of why we are here. In 1990, when we passed the Clean Air Act, trying to reduce the pollutants in automobile gasoline, we wanted to get rid of the witch's brew--we always called it the witch's brew--of toxins that were basically used as octane enhancers, such as benzene, xylene and toluene, highly toxic, highly poisonous substances used to enhance octane and performance. 
   In order to get rid of those toxics, while maintaining gasoline performance, something was needed to replace them. The oxygenates make a cleaner burning gasoline while improving octane and gasoline performance. So we came up with the oxygen content standard in the Clean Air Act so that we could have cleaner gasoline, and reduce the toxics and carbon monoxide emissions. The oxygenate in the fuel does that. It reduces carbon monoxide. We all know what carbon monoxide is--a pollutant that makes you sick or kills you. So we came up with the oxygenate standard for that. We got rid of pollution and carbon monoxide. Both MTBE and ethanol were octane enhancers so they could be used to make cleaner gasoline and replace the witch's brew of toxics like xylene and benzene and toluene. 
   Because MTBE is a derivative of petroleum, it was much easier to get the MTBE and to use it and to have it marketed more rapidly around the country than ethanol. That is why MTBE became the largest part of the oxygenate supply for the reformulated gasoline program. 
   I freely admit that MTBE does do some good in reducing air pollution. I would never argue that it doesn't; of course, it does. But we have found that the downside is even worse in terms of its pollution of water supplies. So we say, are we on the horns of a dilemma? We have MTBE. It reduces air pollution. It keeps the octane up. But it terribly pollutes our ground water. Is there nothing we can do? 
   Well, yes, there is. We can move toward using more ethanol. Now, ethanol is a renewable fuel that provides the clean air benefits, but it will not pollute ground water. Ethanol is so safe one can drink it. It is about 190 proof. That is what it is, basically 190 proof, good old corn alcohol. That is all it is. You can drink it if you want. It is pretty strong, but it won't hurt you. So we can replace it MTBE with ethanol. 
   Senator GRAMM talked about the vapor pressure, the fact that when you mix ethanol with gasoline, a funny thing happens. It becomes more volatile. True. Therefore, they say because it is more volatile, it evaporates and it causes ozone. Well, I have looked at that, and quite frankly, I think the conclusions about evaporation are outdated and not valid. 
   First of all, it is true that the Reid vapor pressure does go up, so it is more evaporative. But if you look at the design and building of automobiles since that time, you find that automobiles are not like they were 20 years ago. The gas tanks have a sealing flap on them. All gas tanks have an airtight lock on them now, all cars built probably within the last 10 to 15 years. Almost all new cars use fuel injection. They don't have carburetors like the old cars used to have. There isn't that much evaporation from automobiles, even when they sit in the hot summer sun. It may be true of older cars, but not of the new cars that have been built within the last 10 or 15 years. 
   Secondly, at most of the gas pumps in the United States now, they have a recapturing mechanism to recapture the fumes from the pumps. So those that say that because we mix ethanol with gasoline and it evaporates and causes ozone, that is based upon studies that I believe are not valid and are outdated. 
   We do know one thing about ethanol. It reduces carbon monoxide tailpipe emissions. And carbon monoxide contributes to ozone formation. The air quality benefits of reduced carbon monoxide emissions has to be taken into account when talking about the evaporation of gasoline containing ethanol. So we have a proposition. We can replace MTBE with ethanol. We can enhance the octane. We can clean up the gasoline, cut the toxics and reduce carbon monoxide, and there is absolutely no pollution water pollution. But Senator GRAMM and others have said, and the Senator from Oklahoma, we can't do that. The reason we can't do that is because we don't have an alternative in place right now to replace MTBE. 
   If I read the sense-of-the-Senate resolution of the Senator from California,  it doesn't say we have to do this immediately. It says: It is the sense of the Senate that the United States should, one, phase out MTBE in order to address the threats that MTBE poses to public health and the environment--phase it out. We didn't put a time limit on it, just phase it out. 
   Well, let me, for the record, point out how we can, without disruptions in fuel supplies, replace MTBE with nonpolluting ethanol. We now produce about 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually. We use about 1.2 billion gallons of that in this country and we export the rest. We would need about an additional 2.1 to 2.2 billion gallons of ethanol production to replace MTBE. The current ethanol production capacity that we have in the United States right now is about 1.8 billion gallons annually. So to replace MTBE, the U.S. would need to have the capacity to produce about 3.3 billion gallons of ethanol each year. That is the 1.2 billion that we use domestically, plus the 2.1 it would take to replace MTBE. So that would be about 3.3 billion gallons. 
   In checking with the producers of ethanol, they have told me ethanol production could be ramped up anywhere in 2.5 to 3 years to meet those requirements. We already have 1.8 billion gallons of annual ethanol production capacity. We don't even have to double it in order to meet the requirements of replacing MTBE. 
   I point out that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's analysis supports this conclusion that we could, within 2.5 years, and at the most 3 years, ramp up the production of ethanol to replace MTBE. I would have to admit there is probably no way we can phase out MTBE in probably less than 2.5 to 3 years. So as we phase out MTBE, we could ramp up the production of ethanol. 
   Now, my friend from Oklahoma said we don't have the transportation facilities and things such as that. They would come along, plus, I daresay that ethanol would be produced in a lot of different places in the country. Now it is mostly produced in the Midwest, but it will probably be produced in a lot of other areas in the United States. 
   So for the reasons of health, for the reasons of making sure we don't further contaminate our ground water and our water supplies in this country, to ensure that we are able to replace MTBE in an orderly fashion with a renewable fuel produced here in this country, I support the sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by the Senator from California, Senator FITZGERALD, and others. 
   Lastly, I want to make one more point. The Senator from Texas went on about subsidies for ethanol. I don't think he wants to get involved in that subject. Quite frankly, we have the data to show that the tax breaks to the oil industry vastly exceed the modest tax incentives for ethanol. That is just during the recent past, not to mention all the tax and other subsidies the oil industry has gotten over the last 100 years or so from the U.S. Government. So I don't think the Senator from Texas wants to get involved in talking about subsidies, especially when we can point out the huge tax subsidies the oil industry has gotten over all these years. 
   In conclusion, the issue before us is framed this evening primarily as an environmental and health issue, pure and simple. All of these arguments from the other side notwithstanding, what we are about is saying the Senate is going on record that we ought to phase out MTBE and to promote renewable ethanol to replace MTBE. Ethanol enhances energy security, it supports the farm economy, it improves air quality and the environment. There are many reasons to support ethanol, but when it comes down to the crux of the debate tonight we are talking about the extensive water contamination caused by MTBE and the fact that with ethanol we have a clean and safe alternative to take its place. That is what this debate is about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of Senators DASCHLE, WELLSTONE, and myself to provide an additional $2 million for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, known as GIPSA. This agency performs a critical role in ensuring open markets and fair trade practices for the livestock market. These are issues of great concern to livestock producers, especially in recent years as low prices have raised questions about decreasing competition, inadequate price information and possible abuses of market power. 
   The Packers and Stockyards Program at GIPSA already has large demands placed on its investigative, analytical and legal resources. Congress and others are putting pressure on GIPSA to conduct more and more sophisticated investigations under significant time pressure. 
   One of the strongest needs is for rapid response teams which are sent out to specific areas where serious complaints are occurring to quickly determine what is happening and to quickly resolve the problems that are occurring so farmers can get real relief in a timely manner. 
   GIPSA continues to oversee contracting practices, which are the subject of increasing concern, scrutiny and debate. 
   In an ever-faster paced market, GIPSA must have the resources to meet its responsibilities. These additional funds are essential to ensuring that the nation's livestock markets remain fair and open to all producers. 
   The amendment is paid for by reducing the funding for the Economic Research Service. The reduction will be from academic research contracted out by that agency.

   Mr. HARKIN. Just for a question. 
   I think the Senator from Minnesota put his finger on it. When I heard the Senator from Kansas speak, it seemed as if what he was saying was that we are going to leave farmers and ranchers out there at the mercy of the grain companies, the packers, the wholesalers, the retailers, and the processors. They are making money in the domestic market, but the farmers are not. 
   I ask the Senator from Minnesota: Does the Senator believe that it is a viable responsibility for our government to ensure that family farmers have some bargaining power, some power out there in the marketplace so they can get a better share of the consumer dollar that is being spent in America today? 
   I add to that, I say to the Senator, that under previous farm programs--and under what we have been advocating in terms of raising loan rates and providing for storage and things such as that--they provided that farmers have a little bit better bargaining power in terms of selling their crops, and thus hopefully getting a better portion of their income from the market. 
   I thought it was a curious argument for a conservative from Kansas to be making that the measure of the success of the Freedom to Farm bill is how the Government checks go out to farmers. I find that a curious argument. 
   My question to the Senator is whether or not it is a legitimate role for the Federal Government to play to help level the playing field between farmers and those who buy their products from the farm.

   Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his statement, which is exemplary in its clarity. The arguments the Senator has made, the point he made, this should crystallize clearly what this debate is all about, what is happening, what we are all talking about. 
   I picked up on one thing the Senator said--that under the Republican's proposal the payments would go out without regard to whether someone was producing anything or not; it could actually go out to absentee landlords, people who are not on the farm, hadn't even planted anything. 
   As the Senator knows, the AMTA payments that are in their bill go out without regard to whether they are planting anything or not. It is based upon outdated, outmoded provisions of base acreages and proven yields. It goes back as far as 20 years. 
   I wonder if it occurred to the Senator from North Dakota--I heard a couple of Republicans this morning talk about the failed policies of the past. Yet they are basing their payments on a policy that goes back 20 years, base acreages and proven yields, which any farmer will tell you has no basis in reality as to what is going on in the farm today. 
   I am curious. Does the Senator have any idea why they would want to make payments based on something that is not even happening out there today? It is not even based on production, not helping the family farmer. I am still a little confused as to why they would suggest that kind of payment mechanism rather than what we are suggesting, which goes out to farmers based on the crops they bring in from the fields.

   Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield further, the Senator has stated it absolutely correctly. I was interested in the chart there of wheat prices. I ask the Senator if he would put it back up there again, on wheat prices. It just about mirrors corn and soybeans, all the major production crops in the Southwest. 
   I have an article from the Wichita Eagle, from 1995, I believe. It is an article written by the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I think he was a House Member at the time, Senator ROBERTS. So this article says:  
   Good Bill for Farm Reality, by Pat Roberts.  
   The first sentence says:  
   My Freedom to Farm legislation now before Congress is a new agricultural policy for a new century.  
   ``My Freedom to Farm.......'' That is by PAT ROBERTS, now Senator ROBERTS. I want to read to the Senator from North Dakota this paragraph in there. He says:  
   Finally, Freedom to Farm enhances the farmer's total economic situation. In fact, the bill results in the highest net farm income over the next seven years of any proposal before Congress.  
   He says:  
   The AMTA payment cushions the Nation's agriculture economy from collapse during the 7-year transition process.  
   I have to ask my friend from South Dakota, are your farmers receiving the highest net farm income that they have received ever in any farm program? Are they receiving the highest farm income? And are your farmers being cushioned by the Freedom to Farm bill?

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader for yielding before he makes a motion. I will not take more than a couple of minutes. I didn't get a chance to make a couple of points earlier in the day. 
   I want to say a few words about the great work of the Senator from West Virginia. I opened the New York Times this morning and saw his picture. He was standing in a drought-stricken cornfield in West Virginia yesterday with the Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary Glickman. He called me on the phone yesterday before the Secretary had gotten there. We talked about the terrible drought situation facing the farmers in West Virginia. Senator BYRD wanted to make sure that we addressed that situation, which we have in our bill, to address the severe drought situation not only in West Virginia but on the entire east coast. I also heard personally from Senator BYRD on the great problem facing our livestock farmers. 
   So we have placed in this amendment an amount of $200 million to be added to Section 32 funds to be used for assistance to livestock producers who have suffered losses from excessive heat and drought in declared disaster areas. 
   Again, I commend Senator BYRD from West Virginia for bringing this to our attention so we were able to put this amount of money into the bill for livestock producers. I also want to mention a couple of other things that were not said earlier. 
   We have some situations where crops have suffered damage, some in 1998 and some in 1999, where the existing farm programs are not adequately addressing the situation and the problems. So we provided $500 million in our amendment to respond to these situations, in other words, to take a comprehensive view of the disasters that have struck many farmers around the country. We have problems with the citrus crop in California, with apples and onions in New York, that I understand is a $50 million problem. We expect the Secretary to also address that situation with crops in New Jersey, New Mexico, and I know in other States. 
   We have done all we can in our bill to accommodate the request to address these issues in a comprehensive manner in disaster payments. Again, I point out we take care of those disasters in our bill. Those are not addressed in the bill put forward by the other side. 
   Last, I point out that Section 32 funding is also available to purchase commodities to reduce surpluses in a lot of different areas. That is why Section 32 funding is so important. I expect at least $3 million would be available to make up the existing shortfall in the TEFAP funding under our proposal. 
   I thank Senator DASCHLE again for his great leadership on this bill. We may have to continue to do some work, but I agree with our leader, we have to do something before we leave here this week. I thank him for his leadership and yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we just had a vote on a package that was proposed by the other side which would have gone out in direct payments to farmers as sort of income support for the low prices this year. The motion to table was unsuccessful. But I note that the vote was 51-47, a very close vote, to be sure. So now, under the previous arrangement, the first-degree amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE and I, and others on this side, is now the pending amendment. 
   I would like to explain for a couple of minutes the differences between what we have proposed and what was previously voted on. The package that was previously voted on was basically direct payments to farmers, AMTA payments, transition-type payments, which would go out. 
   Our package is a lot more comprehensive in that it addresses not only the income loss of farmers this year because of disastrously low prices, but our proposal also has $2.6 billion in there for disaster assistance. It covers such things as the 30-percent premium discount for crop insurance, so we can get farmers to buy more crop insurance all over America. We have money in there for 1998 disaster programs that were not fully compensated for with money from last fall's disaster package. We have some livestock assistance programs, Section 32 funding, related to natural disasters, and flooded land programs. I might also point out that because of the disastrous drought affecting the East Coast, we have money in our proposal that would cover disaster payments to farmers up and down the Middle Atlantic because of the severe drought that is happening. 
   I might also point out that because of the need to get this money out rapidly to farmers, we have adequate funds in our disaster provision for staffing needs for the Farm Service Agency, so they can get these funds out in a hurry to our farmers. 
   I also point out that in the proposal now before us, we have an emergency conservation program for watershed and for wetlands restoration. We have some trade provisions that I think are eminently very important. They include $1.4 billion that would go for humanitarian assistance. This would be to purchase oilseed and products, and other food grains that would be sent in humanitarian assistance to starving people around the world. That was not in the previous amendment we voted on.

   Also, we have some emergency economic development because the disasters that have befallen our farmers and the low grain prices have affected many of our people in the smaller communities. We have funds for those problems also. 
   I yield for a question.

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. There was no disaster assistance in the other bill. There is disaster assistance in ours--$2.6 billion that would cover the droughts, cover the floods, and cover a lot of the natural disasters that have befallen farmers all over America. That is a big difference in these two bills. That is encompassing the bill that we now have before us. 
   Lastly, I would like to say that the payments that go out under our bill go out to producers and go out to actual farmers. Under the bill that we just voted on, some of the payments would go out to people who maybe didn't even plant a thing this year. They may not have even lived on a farm. This has to do with 20-year-old base acreages and program yields. So a lot of money can go out to people who aren't farming any longer. Our payments go out to actual farmers and people who are actually out there on the land. 
   I yield to my friend from New York.

   Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely. In response to my friend from New York, absolutely for New York and all the States in the upper Northeast. It is not only just the price problem that you have. You have some disasters hitting you up there, and no money to help those farmers is included in their bill. That is why it is so important that this bill is passed and not tabled. 
   I hope Senators will recognize that in this bill it is not only income support, but it is also disaster payments to farmers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today all across America most people are doing pretty well. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in years. The stock market keeps going up. Our gross national product is going up at a great rate. As we now know, we have a surplus for the first time in almost 30 years in the Federal budget. We just had a lengthy debate last week on what we are going to do with that surplus. Our friends on the other side want to take most of it and give it, through a tax break, to people mostly in the upper-income brackets. 
   If you just looked at that, you would think we shouldn't be worried too much about what is happening in America; things look pretty good. 
   Out of the glare of Wall Street, far from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, sort of silently and quietly, American farmers and ranchers are losing their businesses. They are at the end of their rope. Our small towns and communities that dot our countryside are facing a bleak winter, with the prospect that things will get even worse after the harvest is in and the snow falls. 
   The situation facing American agriculture today--according to bankers, farm economists, and agricultural economists from many of our universities--is the worst it has been since the Great Depression. We have to respond to that. We have to respond in a way that is meaningful. That is what our first-degree amendment does. 
   I listened to my friend from Mississippi describe this amendment. I guess my response basically would be, ``Nice try.'' Would it help farmers? Would the Republican amendment help farmers? Why, sure. Any little bit would help. Does it get to the underlying problem? Does it really help get our farmers through this winter and into next year? The answer is no. It is hopelessly too short. 
   While I appreciate the effort by my friends on the Republican side to come up with a last-minute amendment to perhaps put out a smokescreen on what is really happening in agriculture and what we need to do to respond to the crisis, it is a nice effort, but it really doesn't do it. Our hard-working, dedicated, progressive farmers and ranchers across this country don't just need a little bit of a handout that the Republican amendment will give them. What they need is a package of help that will not only get them through this summer and this fall but through next winter so they can get back on their feet again next year. 
   You will hear a lot of talk about how one of the problems is our lack of exports. I just want to point out that even though the United States has a trade deficit, one sector that earns us money and that has a positive trade balance is agriculture. But there are those who would have you believe it is because of the lack of 
   exports that our farmers are in such bad shape. Here is the chart that puts the lie to that. 
   For wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans--the major commodities we export--the exports are fully up this year over what they were in the previous couple of years. We are exporting more. If we are exporting more, what is the problem? The problem is, there is no price and farmers aren't getting anything for their commodities. 
   Here is what has happened to soybeans just in my State of Iowa since the fall of 1997: Basically about a 45-percent decrease in the value of that crop. The same is true with corn. There have been precipitous drops just in the last year and a half. It is not a lack of total exports. It is a lack of the money and the price that farmers are getting. 
   While we need to get an emergency package of money out to farmers, we need to do it now. We also have to be about changing the farm policy. We cannot go on another year under the Freedom to Farm bill and be back here again next year looking at another package of several billion dollars. The Freedom to Farm bill has failed miserably. It has failed our Nation. It has failed our farmers. It has failed our rural communities. 
   I have an article that was in the Kansas paper back in 1995 when we passed the Freedom to Farm bill by my friend from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS. He said:  
   Finally, Freedom to Farm enhances the farmer's total economic situation. In fact, the bill results in the highest net farm income over the next seven years of any proposal before Congress.  
   I hate to say it to my friend from Kansas, but net farm income in key farming areas is down dramatically. For the principal field crops, net farm income is going to be down about 29 percent this year from the average of the last 5 years. That is why we are facing one of the greatest depressions in agriculture since the 1930s. That is why halfhearted measures are not going to work. That is why the bill we have come up with really does address the magnitude of the problem. It is deep, and it is a very large problem and one that has to be addressed efficiently. 
   The amendment that Senator DASCHLE and I, along with Senator DORGAN, Senator KERREY, Senator JOHNSON, Senator CONRAD, Senator BAUCUS, Senator DURBIN, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator LINCOLN, and Senator SARBANES have just sent to the desk provides for a total of $10.79 billion to farmers and ranchers for this next year. 
   There is a great gulf of difference between what the Republicans have set up and what we are proposing. First, the Republicans are proposing that we send all of this money out in a direct payment to farmers; an AMTA payment, it is called, a market transition payment. Our payments go out in supplemental loan deficiency payments,  which means they are based upon a farmer's production--what that farmer actually produced this year, not what they did 10 or 20 years ago. In that way, it is more fair and it is more direct to the actual farmers this year. We include $2.6 billion for disaster assistance. 
   We include a number of other measures such as $212 million for emergency conservation. We have had a lot of floods and a lot of damages in a lot of States. We need to repair the damage to farm and ranch land and enhance our conservation. For emergency trade provision, we have $978 million for purchases of commodities for humanitarian assistance. We have people starving all over the world. We have a Public Law 480 food assistance program and related programs. Our bill provides about $1 billion to take the surplus food we have and send it around the world to starving people. The Republican proposal does not include that. 
   We include money for emergency economic development for our rural towns, small towns, and communities that are hit hard. Our total package of $10.79 billion addresses the magnitude of the problem. It is that big. 
   I say to the people who think $10.79 billion is a lot of money, we passed a tax break bill last week for $792 billion, most of which goes to upper-income people in this country. Very little will ever go to our farmers and our ranchers around America. 
   This point in time is going to decide what happens to rural America this winter. That is why it is so important to act now. That is why it is so important that we get the money out that is needed--not some halfhearted measure in a way that doesn't address the real and devastating economic problems that farmers have all over America. 
   I will have more to say about my amendment later.

   Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct. The Freedom to Farm bill was premised that we would put farmers on the free market. As the Senator from Kansas said, they would have high net income for the next several years. However, Freedom to Farm ripped the safety net out from agriculture. 
   As I pointed out, our exports are up. We are exporting more of our key commodities, but there is no price. The safety net has been taken out from underneath agriculture. Farmers all across America recognize that Freedom to Farm has been a total and absolute disaster when it comes to protecting farm income, and it has to be changed. That is why the first thing we need to do is get the emergency package, but then we have to address the end-of-the-line problem of Freedom to Farm.

   The Senator is right. We started this spring, in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, trying to add some money. We got beat on a nearly straight party-line vote. All but one Republican voted no; Democrats voted yes. 
   We then came back, as the Senator from Minnesota knows, and tried it again in the subcommittee on this bill. We again lost on a straight party-line vote. 
   Now we are on the floor. I will say we are making some progress. At least now our friends on the other side recognize there is a problem. At least they are willing to address it somewhat. The amendment that the Senator from Mississippi sent to the desk is better than nothing, but it is not going to do enough to help get our farmers through this winter. It is only a little more than half of what is needed.

   Did the Senator have a question?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. About 15 minutes--perhaps not that long. 
   Let me conclude my earlier remarks. Quite frankly, I find myself in a very uncomfortable position. This is extremely uncomfortable for me. I think the pending amendments are the ultimate statement on the failure of the current farm policy. Why do I say it is uncomfortable for me? Because I don't like it when farmers have to rely on government payments because they are not getting enough from the marketplace. 
   I am uncomfortable with an amendment that provides above $10 billion in support for our farmers. I find myself extremely uncomfortable. That is why I view what we are doing here as part of a two-step process. First, we must get the emergency money; but second, we have to change the underlying failures of the Freedom to Farm bill or we will be right back where we are again next year, asking for billions more in emergency payments to deal with the crisis in the farm economy. 
   Our farm policy now is based on cash payments. Now we are back here talking about even more cash payments. We are forced into this situation because the underlying farm policy is wrong. And that is how the Republicans' proposal is shaped. It is a stopgap gesture based on AMTA payments.  So naturally, the larger farmers with the larger base acreages are going to get the most money. This policy goes against what government programs ought to be. Government programs ought to be for those who are in need. This amendment stands that principle on its head. The Republican proposal will give most of the money to the biggest farmers under the so-called AMTA payments. Our proposal offers a more equitable distribution by providing the assistance to producers who are actually on the farm right now and in relation to what they are growing now--not what they grew 20 or more years ago. That is a big difference between the two approaches. 
   The Republicans' said they wanted to get rid of the old farm programs when they passed Freedom to Farm, but their AMTA type payments are based on that very same outdated base acreage and payment yield system that is decades old. And quite frankly, with the AMTA system, payments can go to someone who is not even trying to grow a crop and has not incurred those expenses. And the benefits of AMTA payments are too easily claimed by absentee landlords. They could be long gone and living in--Palm Beach, Miami, or retired in southern Texas or someplace else. Our proposal is designed to provide the money to real farmers who are actually farming and trying to grow crops. 
   I might also add one other thing: We are facing some terrible disaster conditions around the country. I know out in the upper Midwest we have had floods and excessive moisture that have prevented planting, in the Dakotas for example, and we have had terrible floods and rainstorms in parts of Iowa. We are facing a tremendous drought on the eastern seaboard among the Atlantic coastal States where we also have farmers who are in dire straits. 
   In our package, we have over $2 billion for disaster-related assistance. The Republican package has zero dollars to help farmers survive disasters, not for those on the Eastern seaboard suffering that terrible drought or others undergoing disasters. That is another big difference because these are truly farmers in need. They need help. Our bill has that help for them; the Republican bill doesn't. 
   Those are the two major differences I see. I will have more to say tomorrow about the Freedom to Farm bill. Freedom to Farm had a lot of cheerleaders when it passed a few years ago, saying how great it would be. Those cheers ring hollow now. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Quite frankly, farmers are going broke. And they know it is a failure. It has not protected farm. 
   We must change the underlying farm policy. We need to get loan rates up. We had a bipartisan group of State representatives and Senators from Iowa here last week, Republicans and Democrats. They had a proposal for us: Raise the loan rates, allow the Secretary of Agriculture to extend commodity loans and provide 
   storage payments to farmers, all of which I support. I said: You are talking to the wrong person; you ought to talk to the backers of Freedom to Farm. Don't try to convince me, I am for it. 
   We ought to raise the loan rates. We ought to provide for storage payments. We ought to extend the loans. I think that is what we will come back and try to do in September, the second part of our two-step process. 
   The name Freedom to Farm reminds me of a conversation a little bit ago when it was asked, is there anything good about the bill. I said about the only thing good in the Freedom to Farm bill is the name ``freedom.'' 
   But considering where the farm economy is now, I am reminded of the words in the Janis Joplin song. ``Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose.'' How accurate that is when it comes to the farm crisis. For our farmers, the word ``freedom'' in the Freedom to Farm bill, is just another word for ``nothin' left to lose.''

   Mr. HARKIN. In responding to my friend from Minnesota, I was meeting with farmers this week in Iowa talking about our emergency package. On more than one occasion the farmers got up and said: We appreciate what you are trying to do. We can sure use the money. But if all you are going to do is send out another check and we are going to have the Freedom to Farm bill again next year, it isn't going to work because we will be even deeper in the hole next year. 
   They are begging Congress to change this policy. 
   I tell my friend from Minnesota what I hear most often from them is they have to have a better price, they have to be able to market their grain more efficiently, and they need some limited kinds of conservation land idling program shorter than 10 years. 
   The vast majority of farmers I talked to said we have to get our supply and demand in line. The only way we will get them in line anytime soon is if we have some land out of production. With short-term land retirement, something to take land out for conservation purposes for 2 years, or 3 years at the most, where they get some economic benefit for that, coupled with higher loan rates and the extension of the loan and storage payments, we can start to get some stability and get the farm economy back on track. 
   This past weekend as well as on other Iowa visits, farmers are telling me if we don't change the underlying farm bill it will get worse next year.

   Mr. HARKIN. I could not agree more. I would proffer this. If all we do is pass this emergency package, either this one or the scaled-down package of the Republicans, and we do nothing else, farmers are going to see the handwriting on the wall. If we do not change that Freedom to Farm bill, they are going to see it and they will say, I'm going to be right back where I am again next year. Farmers are going to say, I'm getting out. They will be leaving in droves. It will drive farmers out. 
   In the State of Iowa, from April of 1998 to April of 1999, land prices in Central Iowa have gone down 11 percent already. The Governor of Iowa was at a  meeting I held in Iowa this weekend. He said, when the legislature left 3 months ago, when they went out of session, they estimated the growth in revenues at 1.8 percent. It is now down to 1 percent. That is going to affect our schools and everything else in the State of Iowa. So the broader impacts on Iowa's economic health are already being felt. It is already happening. 
   I have had people tell me if all we are going to do is put the money out there, it will help them some with their debts, it will help them get through the next few months, help them get through the harvest, but if we do not change the Freedom to Farm bill, they are out, they are not going to be there next year.

   Mr. HARKIN. I respond to my friend from North Dakota: These big cash payments are an inherent part of the Freedom to Farm bill--an inherent part of it. A lot of that money goes to the big operators. Yet we have our family farmers out there who are just trying to get by. 
   That is why this Freedom to Farm bill--I wish I could say just one good thing--the only good thing about Freedom to Farm was flexibility. It gave the farmer planting flexibility. But as the Senator from North Dakota might remember, when we were debating the farm bill, the Senator from North Dakota offered an amendment to provide the planting flexibility to farmers and still have a farm program that provided higher loan rates and storage payments and some set-asides within the confines of the farm program. If I am not mistaken, it was the Senator from North Dakota who offered the amendment to provide the flexibility to farmers to plant what they wanted, where they wanted, and yet it was defeated on a party-line vote. 
   So there were those who sold to the farmers the Freedom to Farm bill on the basis that they would have planting flexibility. But we did so in our proposal. We provided planting flexibility in our alternative--I believe it was the Senator from North Dakota who offered it----

I think farmers by and large got very confused by that. They were told by our friends on the other side of the aisle you had to have Freedom to Farm to get flexibility. That is not so. What happened with Freedom to Farm is that it took away the safety net and we are in the situation we are in right now. I repeat, for emphasis' sake, these big cash payments are an inherent part of the Freedom to Farm bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Minnesota, I hope each of us in our own capacity would understand what is happening out there right now. We are not blind. We are not deaf. We are not without the capability of going out in the countryside and talking to farmers and listening to them. We all do that. 
   If we have eyes to see and ears to hear and a decent knowledge of what is happening on the farms, I hope we will not have to have all the rallies and have farmers come to big meetings to try to impress upon us this need. I daresay, however, the way things are going that will happen. 
   If we do not address the underlying aspects of the Freedom to Farm bill,  you are going to get more and more farmers out to these meetings, especially after harvest. Of course, farmers are busy during the harvest. You will not see too many of them probably in the fall. It is going to be a long, cold winter if we do not change the underlying bill. It will not be just the farmers, you will have the bankers come in. I have heard from bankers in, and you are going to have people from small towns and communities, the school boards and everybody else saying: Look, what is happening? Our towns are drying up. 
   I say to my friend from Minnesota, I hope we will not force farmers to go to meetings and plead with us to recognize the dire straits they are in. We know it. We know what it is like out there. We have all the data. We have the statistics. We know what the prices are like. Pick up the newspaper and read what the prices are. Look at what futures prices are. I had a chart earlier today about the prices. Cash price of soybeans is down about half, about 45 percent in about the last 2 years. You do not really need much more than that to understand what the problem is, I say to my friend from Minnesota. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD an outline of the $10.793 billion that is in the first-degree amendment, which is pending at the desk, outlining the different line items and where that money goes so people can look at it tonight.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, right now companies are changing pension plans. They are going from defined benefit plans to these cash balance plans. That is OK. This amendment doesn't stop that. But what is happening now is workers who have worked at these companies for sometimes 20 or 25 years have their pensions degraded. There are 5 to 7, and sometimes as many as 10, years when nothing is put into their pension plans. The younger workers are getting money paid into their pensions and the older workers are not. 
   This amendment says that if they change pension plans they can not discriminate against the older workers, and the companies have to put into the older workers' pension accounts whatever they are putting into the younger workers' pension accounts so that we don't have this kind of wear away for 5 or 7 years when older workers are denied their pension benefits.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding. 
   Mr. President, I will talk about the bill itself, but I also want to talk about an amendment that I intend to offer tomorrow, sponsored by myself, Senator LEAHY, Senator REID of Nevada, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator WELLSTONE. It has to do with pensions. 
   Current law prevents companies from reducing pension benefits which a worker has already earned. However, there is a new phenomenon going on. Companies are now changing to so-called cash balance plans which can save the companies millions of dollars in pension costs each year by allowing them to take a substantial cut out of their employees' pensions. 
   Employees generally receive three kinds of benefits from working. They get direct wages, health benefits, and pensions. So reducing an employee's pension years after it is earned should be no more legal than denying a worker wages after the work has been performed. 
   Under traditional defined benefit plans, the worker gets a pension based on the length of employment and the average pay of the last few years of service. The pension is based on a preset formula using those key factors rather than on the amount in an employee's pension account. 
   Under some cash balance plans, payments to workers do not start until the value of their pension has reduced to the lower level of the cash balance plan. This is a term of art that they call wearaway. In fact, under a number of cash balance plans, some older workers receive no pension benefit contributions for as long as 5 or more years, while younger workers, workmates working right alongside them who started under the cash balance plan, receive regular contributions during those years. 
   So what does this really mean to real people in the real world? Well, two Chase Manhattan banking employees hired an actuary to calculate their future pensions after Chase Manhattan's predecessor, Chemical Bank, converted to a cash balance plan. The actuary estimated that their future pensions had been cut by 45 percent. John Healy, one of the workers, said, ``I would have had to work about 10 more years before I broke even.'' 
   In another case, Ispat Inland, Inc., a Chicago steel company, converted to a cash balance plan on January 1. Paul Schroeder, a 44-year-old engineer who has worked for Ispat for 19 years, calculated it would take him as long as 13 years of additional work to acquire additional pension benefits. So this practice stands to hurt millions of older workers.  
   Frankly, I consider it age discrimination. After all, a new employee, usually younger, effectively receives greater pay for the same work in the form of money put into the pension plan. In other words, you have two people working side by side. As I said, they get their wages. They also get their pensions. But if one is not getting any pensions, he is basically getting less pay. 
   The amendment we are offering tomorrow would prevent the wearaway. It would require a company to add to the pension benefits of older workers in the same way that they add to the benefits of younger workers. 
   I will make it clear that my amendment does not stop companies from modifying their plans. It does not stop them 
   from converting to cash balance plans, and it doesn't stop them from improving the portability. It simply prevents employers from cutting the benefits of older workers by thousands of dollars a year, compared to what happens to a younger worker. 
   My amendment just says that a company cannot discriminate against long-time workers by not putting money into their pension account just because they earn pension benefits under a prior plan. Workers would get whatever they are entitled to receive under the terms of their old pension plan as well as all they are entitled to under the new plan for the period that their pension fell under that plan. The total benefit would be the sum of the two. 
   In closing, my amendment is supported by the National Council of Senior Citizens, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security, the AARP, the AFL-CIO, the Pension Rights Center, Business and Professional Women USA, the Older Women's League, and the Women's Pension Project. 
   Older workers across America have been paying into pension plans throughout their working years anticipating the secure retirement which is their due. Now, as more Americans than ever before in history approach retirement, we are seeing a disturbing trend by employers to cut their pension benefits. 
   I urge the Senate to support our amendment. 
   Let me shift for just a second, in whatever time I have remaining, to say that I am going to vote against this tax bill for three reasons: It is fiscally irresponsible, it widens the gap between the rich and the poor, and it really robs our children. 
   My friends on the Republican side make it sound so simple. They say: Look, we have this enormous surplus. It means people are paying too much in taxes. Let's give it all back in a tax cut. 
   Well, if only it were that easy. First of all, we don't have those surpluses yet. They are anticipated, but they are not here. Again, I remember back in 1981 when we were told by some that we could cut taxes and increase military spending and we wouldn't have a deficit. Well, the deficit almost quadrupled during the 1980s. The public debt more than quadrupled. We simply put the American people on a credit card. 
   Finally, in 1993, Congress got serious. We took the lead in stopping the hemorrhaging. So now we have turned it around. We have gone from an annual deficit of $290 billion to a surplus of about $120 billion, created 18.9 million new jobs. Unemployment is at 29-year lows. The rate of inflation is the lowest it has been since the Kennedy administration. Our GNP is growing at a great rate. We are beginning to pay down the $5.6 trillion debt saddled on our kids. 
   My friends on the Republican side rejected that deficit reduction bill in 1993. Not one single Republican voted for it. 
   I remember when Senator GRAMM of Texas said:  
   ..... if we adopt this bill, the American economy is going to get weaker, not stronger. The deficit, 4 years from today, will be higher than it is today and not lower...... When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, Government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.  
   That was in 1993. Obviously, my friend from Texas could not have been more wrong in his assessment. 
   But now we have this big tax cut before us based on paper projections. But we also find the gap between the rich and poor is growing even wider. At a time when we need to ensure the future for our children, we are going to take it away from them. 
   This is the way I look at it. We built up this huge debt in the 1980s. Who made out from that? Look at all the statistics. Upper-income people made a lot of money in the 1980s and secured more wealth. More assets went to fewer and fewer people in this country and, thus, the gap between the rich and poor widened. We have slain the dragon of deficits and we are now going to have some surpluses. It seems to me it is our responsibility to take that money and lift the heavy debt burden off of our kids and grandkids--$5.5 trillion of debt. We owe it to our children and grandchildren. 
   I keep hearing a lot of my friends on the Republican side say: Well, this isn't our money; it is your money; we should give it back to you, the people today that are paying taxes; give it back. Of course, most of it goes back to the upper 5 percent of income earners in America. But I look upon it in a different way. The huge debt we ran up in the 1980s is going to be a burden on our kids and grandkids. The very wealthy people who made out in the 1980s are now going to get a big tax cut. It seems to me that what we need to do is take that money and say, no, you know who this money belongs to? It belongs to our kids and grandkids. We better be paying off our debts so they are not saddled with it when they grow up. 
   Let's secure Social Security. We keep hearing the hue and cry all the time that young people don't think Social Security is going to be there for them. Well, this is our chance to make sure they know it is going to be there for them, and also that we secure Medicare. We then can take and reduce the debt on our kids, invest in education, so that our kids will have a growing economy and be more productive in the future. That is what we ought to be doing with this--not giving it back to people who already have too much. 
   I must tell you, I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people who have a lot of money. We all have rich friends, people who have made a lot of money. I have yet to have any one of them ever tell me that they desperately need a tax break. Mostly, what they tell me is: Pay down the debt, invest in education, save Social Security for our kids. 
   That is what we ought to be doing. The top 1 percent of the taxpayers are the ones that make out the most in the tax cut by the Republicans.

   Mr. HARKIN. Since 1980, the average after-tax income of the top 1 percent of American families has increased by 72 percent. The income of the poorest fifth of American families has declined by 16 percent. If the Republican tax bill becomes law, corporate limousines will line up in front of the Capitol 
   with their trunks open. The top 1 percent will haul the money away in the trunks of their limousines. 
   I have always said there is nothing wrong with making money in America. There is nothing wrong with being rich. There is nothing wrong with having a nicer house, a bigger car, and all the better amenities of life. That is a big part of the American dream. But I believe when you make it to the top, and others make it to the top, and I make it to the top, it is the responsibility of Government to make sure we leave the ladder down there for others to climb, too. The Republican tax bill, basically, says to the wealthy in this country: You have it made. Don't worry about anybody else. You made it to the top. Now you can pull up the ladder behind you and we are going to help you. The Government will help you pull the ladder up behind you. 
   President Clinton has talked often about the bridge to the 21st century, and we have a good construct of it: Unemployment is low, GNP is going up, debt is going down. But if only a few people cross that bridge, it will become a dividing line. That is why we don't need this tax bill. We need to bring people together, not divide us even more, as this tax bill would do.

   Mr. HARKIN. I will not talk that long. I thank the manager. 
   Mr. President, I will talk about another motion I will have to recommit the bill with instructions tomorrow when it comes up. This has to do with funding for the National Institutes of Health. 
   Just 2 1/2 years ago, the Senate went on record, 98-0, committing to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health over 5 years. But this tax bill shortchanges America's health and reneges on the Senate's promise, by forcing cuts of up to 38 percent in discretionary health programs. 
   Earlier this evening, my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, talked about NIH being the ``crown jewel'' of our Government. Indeed, I agree with him. It is. But we said we were going to double the budget. Yet now, because of this tax bill, we are going to be faced with huge cuts. We can't even get our appropriations bill on the floor because we are $8 billion to $10 billion below what we had last year, and yet we are going to give a big tax break to the wealthiest in our society. 
   We have to invest in this medical research--Alzheimer's and arthritis to cancer, diabetes, and spinal cord injury. We are on the verge of breakthroughs in all of these areas. Now is not the time to back off; now is the time to invest in biomedical research. 
   If we were able to just simply delay the onset of Alzheimer's in individuals by 5 years, the savings would be $50 billion a year. We would have no problems in Medicare if we just delayed the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years. 
   My amendment is going to be very simple. It makes good on the promise the Senator made, 89-0, to double the NIH budget over 5 years. The amendment returns the tax bill to the Committee on Finance, with instructions that the committee report back to the full Senate within 3 days with an amendment to provide an additional $13 billion for the NIH over 5 years. Funding for this would be provided by reducing or delaying specific tax cuts in the bill, so long as those tax cuts that benefit moderate- or middle-income taxpayers are not reduced. 
   Again, I commend this amendment. It is sponsored, again, by myself, Senator KENNEDY, Senator MIKULSKI, and Senator MURRAY to again make good on our promise to make sure we put the necessary funding in biomedical research at the NIH. 
   I yield to the manager, if the manager would like to have the time back. I will be glad to yield back whatever time I have remaining.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator HOLLINGS, Senator BIDEN, and Senator GRAHAM an important piece of legislation that will help to protect and preserve Medicare. The bill is entitled the Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1999. 
   For over ten years now, I have worked to combat fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicare program. As Chairman and now Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of the administration of Medicare, I've held hearing after hearing and released report after report documenting the extent of this problem. While virtually no one was paying attention to our effort for many years, we've succeeded in bringing greater attention and focus to this problem in recent years. 
   Part of our effort has been to try to quantify the scope of the problem. Several years ago, the General Accounting Office reported that up to 10 percent of Medicare funds could be lost to fraud, waste and abuse each year. Many questioned that estimate as too large. They said the problem existed, but it wasn't nearly as big as 10 percent. A few years ago, the Inspector General conducted the first-ever detailed audit of Medicare payments. That Chief Financial Officer Act audit found that fully 14 percent of Medicare payments in 1996, or over $23 billion, had been made improperly. 
   To combat these substantial losses, we have put into place the reforms embodied in the Health Insurance Portability Act and the Balanced Budget Act. HCFA, the Inspector General and the Justice Department also have continued to aggressively use new authority to crack down on Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. As a result, we have seen a dramatic decrease in these improper payments. According to the most recent Inspector General's report, improper payments had been reduced from $23.2 billion in 1996, to $20.3 billion in 1997, to $12.6 billion in 1998. 
   While I am very pleased with the successful efforts so far in combating fraud, waste, and abuse, that still amounts to a nearly $13 billion annual ``waste tax'' on the American people. Now is not the time to rest on our laurels. We must now question, what is the best way to move forward and further cut this tax. I know there are no ``magic-wand'' solutions--this is a complex problem with many components. But basically, you need four things: well thought out laws, adequate resources, effective implementation and the help of seniors and health providers. We've made progress on each of these fronts over the last couple of years, but much more remains to be done.  
   Mr. President, we have many thousands of dedicated health providers who work very hard to improve the quality of life for all people. Through their efforts, Americans have the best quality health care in the world. But, unfortunately, there are a small minority of providers who take advantage of our health care system. This legislation is directly designed to deal with those situations. Further, it is clear that many mispayments to Medicare are the result of a simple lack of understanding of our often complex Medicare payment system. This legislation also addresses this problem by providing increased education and assistance for providers and by reducing the paperwork and administrative hassles that can often lead to innocent, but costly, billing errors. 
   The primary goal of this legislation is simply this--to ensure that Medicare pays for all that it should pay for--and only what it should pay for. 
   The Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act I am introducing today will take a number of important steps to stop the continued ravaging of Medicare. 
   This Bill for example, would direct HCFA to double and better target audits and reviews to detect and discourage mispayments. Currently only a tiny fraction of Medicare claims are reviewed before being paid and less than 2 percent of providers receive a comprehensive audit annually. We must have the ability to separate needed care from bill padding and abuse. 
   Our bill would also give Medicare the authority to be a more prudent purchaser. As passed by the Senate, the Balanced Budget Act gave Medicare the authority to quickly reduce Part B payment rates (except those made for physician services) it finds to be grossly excessive when compared to rates paid by other government programs and the private sector. In conference, the provision was limited to reductions of no more than 15 percent. This bill would restore the original Senate language. In addition, to assure that Medicare gets the price it deserves given its status as by far the largest purchaser of medical supplies and equipment, Medicare would pay no more than any other government program for these items. Finally, overpayments for prescription drugs and biologicals would be eliminated by lowering Medicare's rate to the lowest of either the actual acquisition cost or 83% of the wholesale cost. 
   Our bill would also give the Secretary of Health and Human Services greater flexibility in contracting for claims processing and payment functions on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and providers. It would update Medicare contracting procedures and bring it more in line with standard contracting procedures already used across the Federal Government and therefore allow Medicare the ability to get much better value for its contracting dollars. 
   The Medicare Waste Tax reduction Act of 1999 would also ensure that Medicare does not pay for claims owed by other plans. Too often, Medicare pays claims that are owed by private insurers because it has no way of knowing a beneficiary is working and has private insurance that should pay first. This provision would reduce Medicare losses by requiring insurers to report any Medicare beneficiaries they insure. Also, Medicare would be given the authority to recover double the amount owed by insurers who purposely let Medicare pay claims they should have paid. 
   Additionally, coordination between Medicare and private insurers would be strengthened. Often, those ripping off Medicare are also defrauding private health plans. Yet, too little information on fraud cases is shared between Medicare and private plans. In order to encourage better coordination, health plans and their employees could not be held liable for sharing information with Medicare regarding health care fraud as long as the information is not false, or the person providing the information had no reason to believe the information was false. 
   Our bill would also expand the Medicare Senior Waste Patrol Nationwide. Seniors are our front line of defense against Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. However, too often, seniors don't have the information they need to detect and report suspected mistakes and fraud. By moving the Waste Patrol nationwide, implementing important BBA provisions and assuring seniors have access to itemized bills we will strike an important blow to Medicare waste. 
   Another critical component of any successful comprehensive plan to cut the Medicare waste tax is to focus on prevention. Most of our efforts now look at finding and rectifying the problems after they occur. While this is important and we need to do even more of it, we all know that prevention is much more cost effective. The old adage ``A stitch in time saves nine'' was never more true. A major component of an enhanced prevention effort would be the provision of increased assistance and education for providers to comply with Medicare rules. 
   Further, a great deal of the mis-payments made by Medicare are the result not of fraud or abuse, but of simple misunderstanding of Medicare billing rules by providers. Therefore, this bill provides $10 million a year to fund a major expansion of assistance and education for providers on program integrity requirements. This bill would also ensure the reduction of paperwork and administrative hassle that could prove daunting to providers. Health professionals have to spend too much time completing paperwork and dealing with administrative hassles associated with Medicare and private health plans. In order to reduce this hassle and provide more time for patient care, the Institute of Medicine would be charged with developing a comprehensive plan by no later than June 1, 2000. Their recommendations are to include the streamlining of variations between Medicare and other payers. 
   Mr. President, while we have made changes to medicare in attempts to extend its solvency thru the next decade, we urgently need to take other steps to protect and preserve the program for the long-term. We should enact the reforms in this bill to weed out waste, fraud and abuse as a first priority in this effort. I urge all my colleagues to review this proposal and hope that they will join me in working to pass it yet this year.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr President, in April, the nation was rocked by an unspeakable act of violence at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Twelve innocent students, a heroic teacher and the two student gunmen were killed in the 8th deadly school shooting in 39 months. 
   Since that tragic incident, there has been a nation wide discussion on the causes of such violence and a search for solutions to prevent such occurrences in the future. I would like to take a few moments to discuss one innovative program that can help us prevent violent acts from happening in the first place. 
   Mr. President, children today are subjected to unprecedented social stresses, including the fragmentation of the family, drug and alcohol abuse, violence, child abuse and poverty. In 1988, the Des Moines Independent School District recognized the situation confronting young students and expanded counseling services in elementary schools. 
   The expanded counseling program-- Smoother Sailing operates on the simple premise that we must get to kids early to prevent problems rather than waiting for a crisis. As a result, the district more than tripled the number of elementary school counselors to make sure that at least one well-trained professional is available in every single elementary school building. 
   Smoother Sailing began as a pilot program in 10 elementary schools. The program increased the number of counselors in the elementary schools so there is one counselor for every 250 students--the ratio recommended for an effective program. The participating schools began seeing many positive changes. 
   After two years, the schools participating in Smoother Sailing saw a dramatic reduction in the number of students referred to the office for disciplinary reasons. 
   During the 1987-88 school year, 157 students were referred to the office for disciplinary action. After two years of Smoother Sailing, the number of office referrals in those schools dropped to 83--a 47% reduction in office referrals. 
   During the same period, Des Moines elementary schools with a traditional crisis intervention counseling program had only a 21% reduction in office referrals. 
   There were other changes as well. Teachers in Smoother Sailing schools reported fewer classroom disturbances and principals noticed fewer fights in the cafeteria and on the playground. The schools and classrooms had become more disciplined learning environments. It was clear that Smoother Sailing was making a difference so the counseling program was expanded to all 42 elementary schools in Des Moines in 1990. 
   Smoother Sailing continues to be a success. 
   Smoother Sailing helps students solve problems in a positive manner. Assessments of 4th and 5th grade students show that students can generate more than one solution to a problem. Further, the types of solutions were positive and proactive. We know that the ability to effectively solve problems is essential for helping students make the right decisions when confronted with violence or drugs. 
   Smoother Sailing gets high marks in surveys of administrators, teachers and parents. They report a high degree of satisfaction with the program. 
   Ninety-five percent of parents surveyed said the counselor is a valuable part of my child's educational development. Ninety-three percent said they would seek assistance from the counselor if the child was experiencing difficulties at school. 
   Administrators credit Smoother Sailing with decreasing the number of student suspensions and referrals to the office for disciplinary action. In addition, principals report that the program is responsible for creating an atmosphere that is conducive to learning. 
   Experts tell us that to be effective, there should be at least one counselor for every 250 students. Unfortunately, the current student:counselor ratio is more than double the recommended level--it is 531:1. That means counselors are stretched to the limit and cannot devote the kind of attention to children that is needed. 
   In most schools, the majority of counselors are employed at the middle and secondary levels. Therefore, the situation is more acute in elementary schools where the student to counselor ratio is greater than 1000:1. 
   Mr. President, Smoother Sailing was the model for the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Act, a section of the Elementary and Secondary School Act. 
   Today, along with Senators LINCOLN and WELLSTONE, I am introducing the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Improvement Act of 1999. This legislation does three things. 
   First, it reauthorizes the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Act and expands services to secondary schools. 
   Second, it authorizes $100 million in funding to hire school counselors, school psychologists and school social workers. 
   Finally, since the counselor shortage is particularly acute in elementary schools, the amendment requires that the first $60 million appropriated would go to provide grants for elementary schools. 
   Mr. President, CNN and USA Today recently conducted a public opinion poll of Americans. They asked what would make a difference in preventing a future outbreak of violence in our nation's schools. 
   The leading response was to restrict access to firearms. The second most popular response--a response selected by 60% of those polled--was to increase the number of counselors in our nation's schools. 
   We should heed the advice of the American people. We have a desperate  need to improve counseling services in our nation's schools and this legislation will be an important step in addressing this critical issue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for giving me this time. 
   I listened with great interest and confusion--I guess a little bit--to what the Senator from North Dakota was saying. He is right on target. I served 10 years in the House of Representatives before I came to the Senate. We were always a little frustrated at that time, I remember, by the Rules Committee because they would set up the rules by which we could debate. We only had 5 minutes in the House. You could speak 5 minutes, and that was it. Once in a while, you were lucky to get consent to speak for 7 or 8 minutes. 
   We always knew that if the majority party or minority party or interested people could not get an amendment up because of the Rules Committee, it could always be done in the Senate. I cannot think of any time since I came to the Senate in 1975 when an issue we wanted to debate in the House but were prevented from doing so by the action of the Rules Committee was not then later followed up with full debate on the Senate floor. 
   That is as the framers of our Constitution envisioned. The Senator from North Dakota is right, and the Senator from Nevada is right. With 435 Members in the House, there is no way it could function if it functioned under the same rules as the Senate, so they have to have a Rules Committee. I understand that. 
   In the Senate, as envisioned by the framers of our Constitution, we are to have open and deliberative debate about the great issues of the day, and it is to be just that, deliberative.

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator, he is absolutely right. I remember that time. I remember some of the great debates we had. I say to my friend from Nevada, when I came to the Senate, the Republicans were in charge, and then the Democrats were in charge, and then it went back to the Republicans again. In all those years--first it was under Senator Dole, then Senator BYRD, Senator Mitchell, Senator Dole again--in all that time, we had free and open debate in the Senate. Once in a while, the majority would try to skirt it a little bit, but that 
   was used very rarely. The general rule in the Senate was that we had authorizing bills, we offered our amendments, and we debated them fully. Sometimes they lasted until 2:30 or 3 in the morning--not often, but once in a while when it was an important issue of the day, when those who felt strongly about those issues thought it needed a full airing. 
   I do not remember at any time during that period that anything got held up, that this body came to a screeching, grinding halt. We had our say. We had good deliberations. That is gone now. We do not have that any longer. We do not have a free-flowing debate in the Senate any longer. A person gets up, gives a speech, and leaves the floor. Why? Because the way things are being structured now does not really allow for the free-flowing, deliberative debate we have had in the past. 
   When we changed rule XVI in 1995, when the then-new Republican majority voted to change rule XVI, I was opposed to that. I thought we should continue to operate as we had been operating. But since 1995, what has happened is, under the new leadership in the Senate, we have a structure that does not allow for that kind of debate and deliberation on authorizing bills. It has been common now for the majority to take the position that we do not have any regular debate on controversial subjects. We are not allowed the orderly amendment process to be considered in the Senate. 
   We are all products of our backgrounds, our upbringing, what we learned earlier in life. I know the distinguished majority leader--who is a fine man, and I have the greatest amount of respect for him--in his tenure in the House served on the Rules Committee. I am openly wondering whether or not the Senate majority leader's tenure on the House Rules Committee is somehow affecting his leadership in the Senate. Is the Senate majority leader trying to run the Senate the way the House Rules Committee runs the House? It seems to me that is what is happening, moving the Senate toward House procedures. 
   The pattern has become clear. The Republican leader decides on a particular measure; they move to consider it in a process where no amendments can be offered or only a limited number of predetermined amendments may be offered. 
   Again, the argument of limited time is often suggested as a reason--we do not have all this time--but that is clearly a veil that hides nothing. 
   Several days are spent working out the details of what may be allowed instead of proceeding to the bill and allowing us to debate. 
   How many days, I ask my friend from Nevada, have we spent on the floor with nobody here, quorum call after quorum call, simply because the majority leader does not want to have a measure on the floor to which we can add our amendments and openly debate them? 
   The reason given is that, well, it will take too much time if Senator HARKIN or Senator REID or Senator JOHNSON or Senator DORGAN get up and start offering their amendments and debate them. Yet we spend the entire week in quorum calls while they try to work out the details of some agreement on how to proceed. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights is a great example. We passed that in our committee, the committee on which I serve, last spring. We wanted to bring it out on the floor for debate. The majority leader would not allow it: Oh, it would take too much time, don't you see. 
   What were we forced to do? We were forced to offer it on the agriculture appropriations bill. It should not have been there. We should have had open and free debate. That brought the ag appropriations bill to a standstill. 
   Then they tried to work out how we were going to do this. Finally, there was a unanimous consent agreement that established a very tight rule, similar to the House Rules Committee, in order for us to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. Why didn't we bring it up in the first place a month or two ago and debate it in the orderly process and be done with it? 
   Another example is the proposed lockbox, a procedure under which surpluses could be blocked from being spent year to year. There are a variety of ways this could have been accomplished. There are a lot of different views on this lockbox and how we are going to proceed on it. But look what has happened. Not once, not twice, but three times the majority leader moved to invoke cloture to block any amendments from being offered to lockbox--three times to shut off any amendments. So we still do not have the measure before us. Yet time is consumed, time is wasted around here. More time is wasted in the Senate than any place I have ever seen. We still have not brought up the lockbox. We could have brought it up a month ago and debated it.

   Mr. HARKIN. That is what I do not understand. The Senator makes my point. The majority leader is trying to run the Senate like the Rules Committee, saying: We are bringing it up, but we don't want your amendments, we don't want you to discuss this. 
   The Senate must be an open body. Placing authorizing measures on appropriations bills is an imperfect but, under the way the Senate is running now, a necessary method of bringing 
   matters to the consideration of the Senate. 
   In light of the actions by the Republican leader to cut off our debate and our ability to have open deliberation, we have been forced to use the appropriations bills as a method of doing that. 
   These issues should be discussed seriously. I do not know that we need to change our rules so much around here as we need to show a greater willingness to be open, to allow for the smooth flow of ideas and amendments on the floor, rather than gagging Senators, preventing them from offering timely amendments. 
   I must say, if we do not move toward some accommodation on this, parliamentary procedures will be used to deteriorate the ability of the Senate to function. The restoration of rule XVI will restrict our options on the minority side. But I cannot believe--and I say this to my friend from Nevada; I say this to the occupant of the Chair--I cannot believe that any serious student of parliamentary procedure believes that rule XVI will effectively block Senators from eventually getting votes on desired matters. It will happen, but it is going to take a terrible toll on this place. 
   We should be debating issues such as the minimum wage and fair pay. The  other day I saw a figure that said, if you took the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies, the CEO pay in 1960 and the minimum wage in 1960, and you brought them forward to 1999, if the minimum wage had gone up at the same rate as CEO pay, the minimum wage today would be $40 an hour. 
   I would like to debate that on the floor. I would like to debate the necessity and the need to raise the minimum wage. Mr. President, $10,700 a year, that is what it is right now for people trying to raise their families. We need a full deliberation on this. It is an important issue. Yet we are choked off and gagged from even doing so. 
   I can assure the majority that this can only escalate. The reimposition of rule XVI will invite the use of alternative, more disruptive parliamentary methods in order for the minority to raise these important issues for the benefit of the American people. Furthermore, I believe that this, then, will cause further erosion of the good will of this body in the smooth consideration of legislation. 
   We had 48 cloture votes in the last Congress. We have already had 17 this session. As the Senator from Nevada said, it is laid down immediately, not after we have debated it for some time; and the majority, exercising its right to bring debate to a close, files cloture. No. It is done right in the beginning before one amendment is offered, before one word is even uttered on the issue before us. 
   So I say to the majority, do not escalate, because one escalation leads to another. The reimposition of rule XVI will lead to some other action taken on this side for the minority to exercise its rights. Then there will be another escalation on the other side, and then in the end the Senate will be the loser, our Government will be the loser, and the American people will lose. 
   Let us not overturn the 1995 precedent on rule XVI. Let us, instead, have a substantive series of discussions to work out the necessary adjustments to the way we operate so that we can, once again, as we had until recent times, have open and fair deliberation of the major issues before this body. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding me time.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, like so many of my fellow Senators, I just came from the memorial service that took place in Statuary Hall for the two police officers, Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut, who gave their lives 1 year ago defending the Capitol and those of us who work in these hallowed Halls. 
   I just got to thinking, when I was there watching all of the uniformed police officers standing so gallantly up on the platform, what a tough job these policemen have, what a terribly tough job they have. 
   On the one hand, because of the very nature of our jobs, we have to be accessible; we have to expose ourselves to the public on a daily basis, whether it is out in the front of the Capitol or over in the grass or walking between offices. We have to be available and accessible to the public. The police officers have to let us be accessible. We cannot put a shield around us. 
   On the other hand, it is the police officers' sworn duty to protect us and to keep us safe from harm. 
   All police officers have a tough job in this country. I think, above all, the police officers who work in and around the Capitol have the toughest job of all because they have these two conflicting responsibilities--to make us accessible, to not put shields around us, to keep this an open, public place, to be the shrine of freedom, and, on the other hand, to protect us and defend us from harm. 
   I just must say, I am as guilty as anyone; I never take the time to thank the police officers who protect us. We pass by them every day. We go in and out of the doors. We see them on the subway. We exchange pleasantries. 
   I am going to make an extra special effort from now on just to say thank you to these police officers, the men and women who protect us daily in the Capitol and who, as Officers Chestnut and Gibson showed a year ago, are willing to lay down their lives for us. We should thank them every day. I do so now and will make a special effort to do so in the future.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Delaware, for yielding me this time. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important amendment to restore funding for the successful COPS Program. We know it works and it should be continued. Later on, I will also be offering an amendment to restore funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program--another vital resource for local law enforcement. 
   I voted against this bill in committee for one main reason: it drains the critical funding needed by our local and state law enforcement to help them do their jobs--to fight the drug problems in our communities and to keep our streets safe. The bill before us cuts the Byrne grants by more than 18 percent. The local law enforcement block grant is cut by 24 percent. Neither of these cuts makes sense. 
   Our communities need them to beef up their drug and violent crime task forces. These grants go straight to the state and local agencies. Why would they be cut? Violent crime has gone down, but does that mean we should give up the fight? Drugs and crime are a continuous battle and now is not the time to let up. 
   I've received dozens of letters from Iowa police chiefs and sheriffs describing the kind of setbacks that they would suffer if these cuts go through. 
   This amendment which restores just about a third of the fiscal year 1999 level funding for Community Oriented Policing Services Program, would be a good first step to giving our local communities the support they need to do their jobs. Police chiefs and sheriffs from across the country have told us loud and clear--the COPS Program is one of the 1994 Crime Act's most effective programs. 
   Consider this: Serious crime is retreating all across the United States. Since the COPS Program began, violent crime across the nation has dropped 21 percent--in part because local law enforcement used these federal grants to hire more officers to keep our streets safe, and to upgrade their operations with new technology. In Iowa, the murder rate has plummeted 34 percent from last year. Now is not the time to cut back on our efforts to fight illegal drugs and violent crime. 
   Rural America will pay the heaviest price if this amendment is not adopted. The COPS Program made a special commitment to include small towns and rural areas. Half of all COPS funding goes to agencies serving jurisdictions of under 150,000 in population. And its making a difference. I hear it all the time from sheriffs and police chiefs throughout Iowa. 
   I got a letter just the other day from Police Chief Douglas Book of Forest City, Iowa--a town of 4,500 people. He said zero-funding COPS would be detrimental to his operation. He wrote:  
   * * * COPS, by the addition of one officer, has allowed us to provide a school resource officer for 20 hours per week. Something that was non-existent before COPS. Through the addition of the COPS funded officer we were able to be proactive in various areas of our community. One very successful operation resulted in a 75 percent drop in juvenile assaults * * * This funding literally deals with the quality of life in America. Results, not politics, must be the guiding factor * * * COPS works. Fund it. [Douglas Book, Forest Hill Police Chief, 6/23/99]  
   Here's another letter I received from Coralville, Iowa Police Chief Barry Bedford:  
   Without the COPS Program, we would not have been able to keep up with the tremendous increase in the calls for service and crime-related activities, nor would we be able to obtain the vitally needed mobile data computers. This is a program that needs to continue if we are going to keep our communities safe.  
   The chiefs are right. Community policing works. It's a flexible program that is responsive to law enforcement needs. More cops on the beat have an undeniable effect on crime and a community's sense of security. 
   Funds to hire more than 100,000 officers have been awarded since 1994 by the COPS to more than 11,300 state and local law enforcement agencies across the nation. That's more than half the policing agencies in the country. As a result, these officers are joining agencies that serve more than 87 percent of the American public. 
   Iowa alone has received over $37 million to hire 544 officers. COPS funds have also been used to put computers in police cars in Dubuque, help officers in Grundy Center deal with vandalism and help Waterloo police fight drugs. COPS grants have helped community and county police departments hire civilians to do paperwork so more officers can be out on the streets. In short, COPS has made our streets and communities safer. 
   It makes no sense to block such a successful program that directly benefits our communities and makes them safer for our families. While crime is down--this is not the time to claim victory and retreat. So I urge my colleagues to support our amendment that restores this crucial law enforcement funding and I also urge that any language in this bill that mentions closing down the COPS office this year be deleted. 
   I compliment my colleague from Delaware for being a great leader on this program. This amendment should be supported and adopted if we truly want to support our police officers and our sheriffs' departments throughout this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I would like to address a question to the chairman of the Subcommittee, the Senator from New Hampshire, regarding funding for the Civil Division of the Justice Department. 
   In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced that the Federal Government intended to sue the nation's tobacco companies to recover billions of dollars in smoking-related health care costs reimbursed by federal health care programs. The administration's FY 2000 budget requested $15 million in new resources for the Civil Division of the Justice Department and $5 million for the Fees and Expenses of Witnesses account support this litigation effort. 
   Unfortunately, we were unable to provide the additional resources requested by the administration for the  Civil Division to carry out this task. While I regret that the committee was unable to provide the new funds, it is my understanding that if the Justice Department deems this activity to be a high priority, base funding, including funds from the Fees and Expenses of Witnesses account, can be used for this purpose. 
   I ask the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee if my understanding of the bill and the report language is correct?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Mr. HATCH, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. BROWNBACK, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mr. BIDEN, Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. ROCKEFELLER, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. AKAKA, Mr. FEINGOLD, Mr. LAUTENBERG, and Mr. BRYAN. I thank the managers of the bill for their willingness to accept this. 
   What this amendment would do is restore the funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program to the fiscal year 1999 level. In the bill before us, the Byrne grant was cut by $100 million from the fiscal year 1999 level; I might point out, on a bipartisan basis. This was cut first by the President. It was kept in as the bill came to the floor. 
   I am grateful they accepted this amendment because these grants go directly to local and State law enforcement. For fiscal year 1999, $552 million was distributed to State and local law enforcement agencies through Byrne grants. But for fiscal year 2000, the Byrne grant was cut by the White House and by the initial actions before we got to the floor by more than 18 percent. This amendment would restore the fiscal year 1999 funding level for the Byrne program. 
   The Byrne program is one of the most successful Federal anticrime programs ever. It pays for drug enforcement task forces, more cops on the streets, improved technology, and countless other valuable antidrug and anticrime efforts in local communities. 
   Restoring the Byrne funds is a top priority of law enforcement groups who know the impact the program has had on crime and drugs. The National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the International Association of Police Chiefs have all contacted me, urging full funding of this program. 
   I have received dozens of letters from Iowa police chiefs and sheriffs describing the kinds of setbacks they would suffer if these cuts go through. The Byrne grant provides critical staff and resources for Iowa's 24 drug enforcement task forces working to stem the methamphetamine epidemic in the region. 
   Iowa and the Midwest have made great strides in reducing methamphetamine production and supply over the last few years. The proposed cuts to the Byrne program would only set them back in their uphill battle. 
   Sgt. Tom Andrew, head of the Southeast Iowa Inter-Agency Drug Task Force that covers six rural counties, wrote me saying that his task force was made possible through the Byrne grant. Without it, most of the small agencies in that region would lack the manpower, funds, training, and technology necessary to combat the methamphetamine problem. Sergeant Andrew said:  
   A funding cut of this magnitude would have a detrimental effect on our program and would, in all probability, result in the elimination of the task force.  
   I have heard this story over and over again from my contacts in Iowa. These drug task forces are funded primarily by the Byrne grants, and they are desperately needed to fight our State's battles against methamphetamine use. I know this is the case in most States across the country. 
   We just cannot afford to have an 18-percent cut in the Byrne grants in our States next year. It makes no sense to cut such a successful program that directly benefits our local communities. 
   I thank the managers for accepting this amendment, and I trust we will keep the Byrne memorial grants at least at the same level next year as they were this year. 
   Again, I thank my colleague from Kansas also for his strong support of this program. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about America's farmers and ranchers and the promise they hold for us and the future for our environment, for production of bountiful, safe, and nourishing food for us and for the population around the globe. 
   Specifically on the issue of conservation, it became a national priority in the days of the Dust Bowl, leading to the creation in the 1930s of the Soil Conservation Service at the Department of Agriculture, which is now the Natural Resources Conservation Service. With the very foundation of our food supply at risk, the Government stepped forward with billions of dollars in assistance to help farmers preserve their precious soils. 
   Since that time, Federal spending on conservation has steadily declined. Yet today agriculture faces a wide range of environmental challenges, from overgrazing and manure management to fertilizer runoff and water pollution. Urban and rural citizens alike are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of agriculture. 
   Farmers and ranchers pride themselves on being good stewards of the land, and there are farm-based solutions to these problems being implemented all over the country. But every dollar spent on constructing a filter strip or developing a nutrient management plan is a dollar that farmers don't have in hard times like these. And even in better times, there is a lot of competition for that dollar. 
   So who benefits from conservation on farm lands? As much or more than the  farmer, it is the rest of us, who depend on the careful stewardship of the water that travels across fields and pastures before reaching rivers, streams, and our groundwater. Farmers and ranchers tend not only to their crops and animals, but also to our public resources. 
   Since we all share in these benefits, it is only right that we share in their costs. It is time to enter into a true conservation partnership with our farmers and ranchers to help ensure that conservation is not a luxury that comes and goes but an essential and permanent part of sustainable agricultural production nationwide. 
   In the 1985 farm bill, we required that farmers who wanted to participate in USDA farm programs develop soil conservation plans for their highly erodible land. This provision helped put new conservation plans in place for our most fragile farmlands. In the most recent farm bill, we streamlined conservation programs and established new cost-share and incentive payments for certain practices. 
   Today I am introducing the Conservation Security Act of 1999, proposed legislation that builds on our past successes and takes a bold step forward in farm and conservation policy. 
   My bill would establish a universal and voluntary incentive payment program to support and encourage conservation activities by all farmers and ranchers. Under this program, farmers and ranchers could receive up to $50,000 per year in conservation payments. Under this conservation security program, farmers would enter into 3- to 5-year contracts with USDA and choose from one of three classes of conservation practices for which they would receive a payment based on the number of acres covered and the county rental rate for those acres. 
   This program is directed toward conservation on working lands. It is not a set-aside. It is not an easement program. 
   It is not a conservation reserve program. It is a conservation program so that we farm in the best way possible to conserve our resources and to prevent pollution. 
   For implementing a basic set of practices, farmers would receive an annual payment of 10 percent of the rental rate of the land covered. I call this basic category class I, and it would include such practices as nutrient management, conservation tillage, and runoff and drainage control. 
   There would be a class II under which farmers could receive up to 20 percent of the rental rate, where farmers would add to their class I practices by choosing from a menu of class II practices that would be established by the USDA--such things as nutrient management, composting, intensive grazing, partial field practices such as buffer strips and windbreaks, wetland restoration, and wildlife habitat enhancement. 
   Then the third class, farmers who wanted to do class III conservation practices would enroll their whole farm under a total resource management plan that addresses all aspects of air, land, water, and wildlife. For that, the farmers would receive a 40-percent payment, 40 percent of the rental rate of land in that county. 
   This bill also provides an incentive for livestock producers. In payment for preparing and adopting comprehensive manure management plans, producers raising under 1,000 animal units at any given time--that would be 2,500 hogs, 1,000 beef cattle, 700 dairy cattle, 55,000 turkeys, or 100,000 chickens--they would be given a per animal incentive payment equal to 10 percent of the 5-year average market price. 
   This program would not replace or otherwise affect any other conservation program, not at all, this is to add on, except that a farmer could not receive incentive payments under this program in addition to incentive payments under another program in addition to incentive payments for land already enrolled in a program such as the Conservation Reserve Program. In other words, you couldn't have your land in the Conservation Reserve Program and then enter this program with that same land. 
   Again, I emphasize, the Conservation Security Program would be totally voluntary. It would be up to the farmer to decide if they want to do it. If they do, then they would get additional payments. A lot of these practices farmers are already doing now, for which they receive little or no support. 
   Again, these practices don't just benefit the farmer; in fact, a lot of times it may burden the farmer. That farmer may have to do extra work, require a little extra time. Maybe some equipment for these kinds of conservation practices. The beneficiaries of this are all of us. We all will benefit from cleaner air, cleaner streams and rivers, protecting our groundwater, wildlife habitats for those of us who like to hunt and fish. 
   Our private lands are a national resource, and conservation on farm and ranchlands provides environmental benefits that are just as important as the production of abundant and safe food. I am introducing the Conservation Security Act because I believe it will help secure both the economic future of our farmers, help them a little bit with the safety net, and it will be a cornerstone, I think, of our national farm policy and the environmental future of agriculture. 
   I am introducing this bill for myself, Senator DASCHLE, Senator LEAHY, Senator KERREY of Nebraska, Senator CONRAD, and Senator JOHNSON. 
   I ask other Senators who are interested to contact my staff. We are now actively seeking cosponsors for this new voluntary conservation program. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from New Mexico. Together, we are cosponsoring this very important, vital amendment. 
   Again, I will repeat some of what the Senator said. The most important thing I heard him say was, in the State of New Mexico, only 65 percent of the State has nurses that provide anesthesiology. 
   I have a map of my State of Iowa. There are a lot of different colors on it, and I will not go into all the explanation, but the reality is, the vast majority of the State of Iowa only has certified nurse anesthetists to provide services to all of the State of Iowa. We have a few counties, about nine or 10, that have doctors, MDs. The rest are registered nurses. That is all. So someone up here in northwest Iowa or southwest Iowa, someplace up in this area, would have to drive hundreds of miles just to access an MD who is an anesthetist. 
   Here is a letter from Preferred Community Choice PPO. I will not read the whole thing. It says:  
   At this time, participation is limited to MD and DO degrees only.

   Mr. HARKIN. That is what we are trying to get over with our amendment. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, this would cover such things as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, psychologists, optometrists, chiropractors, et cetera. This is not an ``any willing provider'' amendment. We are not saying that. We are not saying that we require a plan to open up to any provider who wants to join. We are simply saying a health plan cannot arbitrarily exclude a health care professional based on his or her license. That is all we are saying: They cannot do it based upon licensure. 
   Second, this provision does not require health plans to provide any new benefits or services. It just says, if a particular benefit is covered and there is more than one type of provider that can provide a service under their State license or certification, the health plan cannot arbitrarily exclude this class of providers. For example, if a plan offers coverage for the treatment of back pain, it cannot exclude State-licensed chiropractors. 
   Third, and I want to make this point very clearly, this provision would not expand or modify State scope-of-practice laws. Decisions about which providers can provide which services are left where they belong: to the States. 
   Again, I just want to remind everyone, this Congress supported this concept when we passed provider nondiscrimination language as part of the Balanced Budget Act for Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Senator from Massachusetts made an inquiry. He said: How is this working? I can tell you, it is working great in my State for elderly people under Medicare because now a lot of elderly people, who live in sparsely populated areas of my State, can access, for example, for back pain, chiropractors. They can access nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, a whole host of different providers under Medicare who are licensed by the State of Iowa. That is what our amendment does. 
   Again, I have to ask, if people in these programs, people in Medicare and Medicaid, have the right to choose their provider, should not all Americans? 
   That is why this is a very simple and straightforward amendment. Thirty-eight States have recognized the need for this provision by passing similar legislation. Thirty-eight States have passed legislation providing that people can have their choice of providers as long as they are licensed or certified by the State. 
   You might say, why would we do it here if 38 States already cover it? The problem is, the State laws do not apply to the 48 million Americans who are in self-funded ERISA plans. That is the problem. That is the loophole we are plugging. 
   This provision is critically important for those who live in rural areas; those who do not have access to an MD or a DO; those who rely upon others who have State licensure or State certification to provide the kind of medical services they need. 
   In our amendment, the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, and me, we are basically saying we want to give people a little more power, to empower them a little more, and to provide freedom of choice for the American consumers. It is very simple. This provision says a managed care plan cannot arbitrarily exclude a health care professional on the basis of the license or the certification. 
   It is a simple and straightforward amendment. It has broad-based support. I have a list of all the different associations supporting it. I would point out the broad-based support that it indeed does have, by everything from the American Academy of Physician's Assistants, nurse anesthetists, chiropractors, nurse midwives, the American Dental Association, American Nurses Association, Occupational Therapy Association of America, the American Optometric Association, the Physical Therapy Association, Speech, Language, and Hearing Association, and the Opticians Association of America. 
   A broad range of providers support this provision.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier today Senator BINGAMAN and I offered an amendment to provide nondiscrimination, so the plans could not discriminate against providers on the basis of their license or certification. 
   Now I see the Republicans have offered that amendment. I read through it. It is almost word for word the same as ours. Gee, here is an amendment I could vote for on the Republican side, until I read the fine print. What is the fine print? The fine print is this: Senator BINGAMAN, in our amendment, covers 161 million people; the Republicans' amendment covers only 48 million people. 
   It is sort of like this. A doctor prescribes an antibiotic for you to take every day for 7 days. The Republicans come in and say you can only take it for 2 days. It is probably better than nothing, but it is not going to cure the illness. 
   The Republican amendment on provider nondiscrimination is not going to cure the discrimination against chiropractors, against optometrists, against nurses and nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants. That is why I cannot support it.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I will address the issue that was brought up by the Senator from Idaho who stated that women are going to be driven out of cancer care because of this legislation. I could not believe what I was hearing. I asked the Senator from Idaho to yield for a question, but he would not yield to me. Therefore, I will bring it up now. 
   The Senator from Idaho stated that, because of this bill, thousands of people with breast cancer and lung cancer will be 
   denied coverage. Why then, I ask, do the following organizations support our bill: The Alamo Breast Cancer Foundation, the Alliance for Lung Cancer, Advocacy Support and Education, the American Cancer Society supports this bill, the California Breast Cancer organization, Cancer Care, Inc., Minnesota  Breast Cancer Coalition, National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, the North American Brain Tumor Coalition, the Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the YME National Breast Cancer Organization--on and on. Why do all these cancer organizations support our bill? 
   If you listen to the Senator from Idaho, it is because they do not want anyone treated for cancer. How ridiculous. It just shows the ridiculous nature of the arguments made on the Republican side on this bill. What absolute, total nonsense. 
   That brings me to another ridiculous assertion made earlier. Someone on the other side of the aisle stated that to have people in clinical trials is going to be very expensive. 
   Sloan-Kettering did a study of the costs associated with clinical trials. They looked at a number of people over 3 years, and here is what they found: Hospital stays, 24 percent lower for clinical trials; radiation therapy, 25 percent lower cost; drugs and supplies, 25 percent lower cost; operating room, 8 percent lower cost. These are for clinical trials. 
   That was backed up by another study done by M.D. Anderson in Houston, and this was done on 3,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials. They found costs for ovarian cancer patients were 35 percent less. They found lung cancer costs 36 percent less. In prostate cancer trials, there was a negligible difference between research and standard care patients.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an extremely important issue that Senator BINGAMAN has come up with. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment with him. I will just read the list of additional cosponsors: Senators DODD, MURRAY, REID of Nevada, EDWARDS, BOXER, DURBIN, GRAHAM of Florida, KENNEDY, DASCHLE, FEINGOLD, ROCKEFELLER, FEINSTEIN, and REED of Rhode Island. 
   This is an important issue. I have worked, as Senators know, for a long time on issues dealing with disabilities, people with disabilities in this country. 
   This is an extremely important issue for people with disabilities and people with long-term chronic health conditions such as cancer and others. The Bingaman amendment would ensure access to specialty care would be guaranteed to individuals in a group health plan so they have access to the specialty care they need. The inability to access specialists is the No. 1 reason people give for leaving HMOs. When I hear criticism of managed care from my constituents, it almost always involves some sort of problem with access to specialists. 
   Senator BINGAMAN has articulated the differences in the bill. I want to review them again so people have a clear understanding of what the Bingaman amendment does. 
   First, the amendment guarantees patients access to specialists who are qualified to treat their conditions. If the specialist in the plan's network cannot meet a patient's needs, this amendment allows the patient to see a specialist outside of the HMO's network at no additional cost.  
   For example, there are several rare and deadly forms of cancer that strike children at an early age. Pediatric oncologists often have advanced skills and technical knowledge that general oncologists do not possess. We have to make sure the parents of these kids can gain access to such specialists, even if the plan they have doesn't have pediatric oncologists in its network. We have to ensure they can get these without additional cost. The Republican proposal fails to provide this basic protection. 
   Secondly, our amendment allows a specialist to be the primary care coordinator for patients with disabilities or life-threatening or degenerative conditions. For example, imagine a woman with severe heart disease who also has diabetes and hepatitis. She recently had heart surgery and wants her cardiologist to coordinate her care. The Bingaman amendment would allow her to have her cardiologist as her primary care coordinator, who would then coordinate her care under a treatment plan in collaboration with her internist, endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, and the health plan. 
   Again, the Republican proposal fails to provide this logical protection. According to their version of patients' rights, a patient with a serious illness could be required to entrust important decisions to a primary care doctor who has no knowledge of the specific disease the patient may have. If someone has a chronic or degenerative illness or disability, it is only logical to have a specialist who understands those special needs to coordinate the patient's care. 
   The third element of this amendment provides for standing referrals for people who need ongoing specialty care, which enables them to go straight to the specialist instead of jumping through hoops time after time after time with primary care doctors or insurance companies. 
   Here is a true story: A San Diego woman with paraplegia wanted a standing referral to a rehab specialist, but her HMO primary care physician refused that. After she developed a severe pressure wound, something a rehab doctor would have caught and treated, her primary care physician still refused a referral. Eventually this woman had to undergo surgery and spent a year on her back in the hospital with round-the-clock nursing care. Later the HMO's medical director was quoted as saying, managed care ``doesn't accurately meet the needs of the special patient.'' 
   Again, the Republican proposal fails to provide this commonsense protection. According to the Republican's version of patients' rights, a patient receiving ongoing care from a specialist would have to go back and go back and go back to her or his primary care doctor whenever he or she needed to visit the particular specialist. 
   From anyone's point of view, this does not make sense. By requiring a patient with an ongoing medical condition to continue to go back time and time again to a primary care doctor, every time they need to be treated by a specialist, inhibits the process of making the patient well. 
   Some people say our amendment would create onerous new burdens on plans. In fact, many plans already allow specialists to be primary care coordinators, and they let people have standing referrals. In addition, the numerical estimates don't factor in the importance of Americans' trust in the health care industry. The patients' rights we are legislating on will build consumer trust in the health care industry and consumer satisfaction. I believe that is in the best interest of our entire health care system. 
   Most importantly, when you step back and consider the policy of the Bingaman amendment, it is very simple: Insured Americans should get access to specialty care when and how they need it. They shouldn't be charged a single dime more than what they bargained for--nothing more and nothing less. 
   A lot of organizations support this amendment, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, and the Patient Access Coalition. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join in supporting the Bingaman amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I stand in support of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. S. 6, the Democratic leadership bill, is of immense importance to the American people. 
   Some may ask, is such a bill necessary? Without question, it is. Currently, over 160 million of our family, friends, neighbors and children, are paying good money for health care with no guarantee of proper and appropriate treatment. 
   We don't have to look too hard to see that there are too many cases where appropriate care is not being provided. We have all heard horror stories of individuals unable to see their doctor in a timely manner *.*.* of patients unable to access the specialist they need *.*.* of individuals unable to get coverage for the type of care they believed and expected was covered under their plan. 
   It's very simple. Insurance either fulfills its promises or it doesn't. And we've heard enough to know that in too many cases it doesn't. Employers and patients pay good money for health care coverage, only to find that they're not getting the coverage they expected. In too many cases, the coverage they expected disappears when the need arises. I didn't have to look very hard to find such situations in my own state of Iowa. 
   Let me tell you a story about Eric, from Cedar Falls, Iowa, who has health insurance through his employer. Eric is 28 years old, with a wife and two children. He suffered cardiac arrest while helping out at a wrestling clinic. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was resuscitated. 
   Tragically, while in cardiac arrest, Eric's brain was deprived of oxygen. He fell into a coma and was placed on life support. The neurosurgeon on call recommended that Eric's parents get Eric into rehab. 
   It was then the problems began. Although Eric's policy covered rehabilitation, his insurance company refused to cover his care at a facility that specialized in patients with brain injury. 
   Thankfully, Eric's parents were able to find another rehab facility in Iowa. And Eric began to improve. His heart pump was removed, his respirator was removed, and his lungs are now working fine. 
   But, even with this progress, Eric's family received a call from his insurance company saying they would no longer cover the cost of his rehab, because he is not progressing fast enough. 
   Eric's mother wrote to me, saying, ``This is when we found out we had absolutely no recourse. They can deny any treatment and even cause death, and they are not responsible.'' 
   This week, here on the Senate floor, we have a critical choice before us. A choice for Eric and his family. A choice between real or illusionary protections. A choice between ensuring care for millions of Americans or for perpetuating the already burgeoning profit margins of the Managed Care industry.  
   The Republicans have offered a bill that leaves out 115 million people because most of the patient protections in the plan apply only to self-funded employer plans. This would protect only 48 million of the 161 million with private insurance. 
   Our bill establishes a minimum level of patient protections by which managed care plans must abide. States can--and it's my hope that states will--provide even greater protections, as necessary, for the individuals in such plans in their states. As a starting point, however, we need to pass a strong and substantive managed care reform bill. 
   The American people want real patient protections. 
   Our bill, the real Patients' Bill of Rights Act, delivers on what Americans want and need, real protection against insurance company abuse. The bill provides basic protections for Americans, such as: 
   Access to needed specialists, including access to pediatric specialists; 
   the guarantee that a patient can see a doctor who is not on their HMO's list if the list does not include a provider qualified to treat their illness; 
   access to the closest emergency room and coverage of needed emergency care; 
   the guarantee that patients with ongoing serious conditions like cancer, arthritis, or heart disease can see their oncologist, rheumatologist, or cardiologist without asking permission from their HMO or primary care doctor each time; 
   the guarantee that patients can continue to see their doctor through a course of treatment or a pregnancy, even if their HMO drops their doctor from its list or their employer changes HMOs; 
   the guarantee that patients can get the prescription drug their doctor says they need, not an inferior substitute the HMO chooses because it's cheaper; 
   access to quality clinical trials for those with no other hope; 
   the ability to appeal an HMO's decision to deny or delay care to an independent entity and receive timely, binding decisions; 
   and, finally, the right to hold HMOs accountable when their decisions to deny or delay care lead to injury or death. Most situations will be resolved through our appeals mechanism. However, I believe that HMOs and insurers should not have special immunity when they harm patients. 
   No one can argue with the need to ensure access and quality of care for Americans. Over 200 organizations representing patients, consumers, doctors, nurses, women, children, people with disabilities, small businesses, and people of faith support the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The Majority pretends that their bill offers real patient protections, but when you read everything below the title, it reads more like an insurers' bill of rights. 
   We have a chance to pass real and responsible legislation. The time for real reform is now. The American people have been in the waiting room for too long.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. I compliment him on his foresight for bringing this amendment up. 
   We will have a 5-year media campaign, with $1 billion targeted at youth so they don't get into drugs and start taking drugs. The drug czar himself, General McCaffrey, said that alcohol is the gateway drug. Mr. President, 42 percent of Iowa teens seeking substance abuse treatment in 1998 were being treated for alcohol addiction; three out of five teens have had an alcoholic drink in the last month.  
   We have a 5-year, $1 billion ad campaign to tell teens don't take cocaine, don't take meth, don't smoke marijuana, and we are not going to say anything about beer and alcohol? These are the first drugs these kids take. 
   That is what the Senator from New Jersey is saying. Let's require in this package of ads over 5 years that they also target drinking by kids. 
   I understand that the amendment is supported by Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors, and the National Association of Alcohol, Drugs, and Disability. 
   It is time we took teen drinking seriously. I heard that the National Beer Wholesalers Association is opposed to the amendment. If I am wrong, someone please correct me. It is this association that has always said they are against teen drinking. If they are against teen drinking, why would they be opposed to this amendment to put ads out showing teens what happens if they drink? 
   Eight young people every day die in alcohol-related car crashes. It is time to stop this epidemic.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator DASCHLE, Senator GRAHAM, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator MURRAY, and Senator JOHNSON. Our amendment is simple and I believe makes common sense. It would give a needed shot in the arm to our war against drugs by modestly increasing funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas--so-called HIDTAs--under the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
   The bill before us freezes funding for this important and successful program. It provides no increases for the existing 31 HIDTAs across the Nation and it provides no funding for new HIDTAs. Our amendment would increase HIDTA funding by $17 million. It would provide $7 million to combat the rising scourge of methamphetamine abuse. It would  provide $5 million to increase existing HIDTAs. And it would allot $5 million to allow the establishment and funding of new HIDTAs. 
   I fully recognize the challenges faced by the distinguished chair and ranking member of this Subcommittee. They were dealt a bad check and they have done a commendable job within the allocation they were given. However, we believe that we have found a reasonable offset--one that will not undermine the effective functioning of the government. 
   We would take $17 million--less then 2.5 percent from the General Services Administration account dedicated to the repair and alterations of federal government buildings. There is $624 million in this account and over $300 million of its goes for unspecified projects. I have no doubt that much of these funds are needed, but clearly $17 million could be absorbed or a short deferral of a project could be made in order to make room for a modest increase in our war on drugs. 
   The need for this increase in the HIDTA program could not be clearer, particularly as it relates to combating methamphetamine abuse. 
   There is a plague sweeping across our Nation, ruining an untold number of lives, and claiming countless numbers of our children. 
   On our streets as well as well as our classrooms, drugs have become more abundant. But there is a new drug, one that is far more addictive and readily available than heroin, cocaine, or any other illegal narcotic. Methamphetamine is fast becoming the leading addictive drug in this nation. From quiet suburbs, to city streets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth is destroying thousands of lives every year. A majority of those lives, unfortunately, are our children. 
   Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as Iowa's drug of choice. This drug is reaching epidemic proportions as its sweeps from the west coast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to reach the east. The trail of destruction of human life as a result of methamphetamine addiction stretches across America from coast to coast. 
   To illustrate the violence meth elicits in people, methamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of domestic violence cases in Iowa and a leading factor in a majority of violent crimes. 
   The $17 million we provide would be used for increased enforcement and prosecution of drug dealers, additional undercover agents, and to help pay for the tremendous cost of confiscation and clean up of clandestine meth labs. 
   I believe that we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a stand right now to defeat the meth scourge plaguing our nation. Our amendment will not solve all of these problems, but it will give law enforcement the support that they vitally need in their efforts to defeat this dangerous drug. 
   While we debate this modest proposal, another family is being devastated, another community is fighting an uphill battle, and another child is getting hooked by this deadly drug. The time is now to make a stand to protect our communities and schools by passing this important amendment. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, genetic discrimination is a terribly important issue and one that I have been following for quite some time now. I am pleased to be here today with Senator DASCHLE, SENATOR DODD, and Senator KENENDY to introduce the ``Genetic Non-discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act of 1999.'' 
   The advances we have made recently in the study of the human gene are mind-boggling. The identification of a number of disease-related genes is providing scientists with important new tools for understanding the underlying mechanisms for many illnesses. Genomic technologies have the potential to lead to better diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately to the prevention and cure of many diseases and disabilities. 
   Yet discrimination in health insurance and employment, and the fear of potential discrimination, threaten our ability to conduct the very research we need to understand, treat, and prevent genetic disease. Moreover, discrimination--and the fear of discrimination--threaten our ability to use new genetic technologies to improve human health. 
   Let me give you just a few examples: 
   In the early 1970's some insurance companies denied coverage and some employers denied jobs to African-Americans who were identified as carriers for sicklecell anemia, even though they were healthy and would never develop the disease. 
   More recently, in a survey of people in families with genetic disorders, 22% indicated that they, or a member of their family, had been refused health insurance on the basis of their genetic information. 
   And a number of researchers have been unable to get individuals to participate in cancer genetics research. Fear of discrimination is cited as the reason why. 
   But this is more than just about numbers and anonymous individuals, it's about real people--including my own family. As many of you know, both my sisters died from breast cancer. And other members of my family might be at risk. Should I counsel them to get tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations? Should I counsel them to disclose our family history to their health care providers? 
   Right now, I'm torn. I know that if my family is to have access to the best available interventions and preventive care, they should get tested, and they should disclose our family's medical history to their physicians. But, conversely, if they are to get any health care at all, they must have access to health insurance. Without strong protections against discrimination, access to health insurance is currently in question. 
   In 1995, I introduced an amendment during the markup of 
   the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. My amendment clarified that group health plans could not establish eligibility, continuation, enrollment, or contribution requirements based on genetic information. My amendment became part of the manager's package that went to the floor, and it ultimately became law. 
   HIPAA is a good first step. We should be proud of that legislation. Yet if our goal is to ensure that individuals have access to health insurance coverage and to employment opportunities--regardless of their genetic makeup--we must pass comprehensive anti-discrimination protections. 
   Our proposed legislation offers such protections. Let me describe them in brief: 
   First, this legislation prohibits insurers and employers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information. It is essential to prohibit discrimination both at work and in health insurance coverage. If we only prohibit discrimination in the insurance context, employers who are worried about future increased medical costs will simply not hire individuals who have a genetic predisposition to a particular disease. 
   Second, under our proposal, health insurance companies are prohibited from disclosing genetic information to other insurance companies, industry-wide data banks, and employers. If we really want to prevent discrimination, we should not let genetic information get into the wrong hands. 
   Finally, if protections against genetic discrimination are to have teeth, we must include strong penalties and remedies to deter employers and insurers from discriminating in the first place. 
   In closing, let me say that this legislation will ensure that every American will enjoy the latest advances in scientific research and health care delivery, without fear of retribution on the basis of their sensitive genetic information. All of us should be concerned about this issue, because all of us have genetic information that could be used against us. As we move into the new millennium, everyone should enjoy the benefits of 21st century technologies--and not be harmed by 21st century discrimination. 
   I applaud the committment of my fellow co-sponsors on this important issue and look forward to working with the rest of my colleagues to pass federal legislation that will prohibit genetic discrimination in the workplace and in health insurance.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators THURMOND and HOLLINGS, I am submitting today a sense of the Senate resolution to right a wrong perpetrated against one of the greatest American baseball players of all time--Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson. 
   In 1920 ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson was banned from the game of baseball, the game he loved. He was banned from Major League baseball for allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series, in what has become known as the ``Black Sox'' scandal. While ``Shoeless Joe'' did admit that he received $5,000 from his roommate, Lefty Williams, to participate in the fix, evidence suggests that Jackson did everything in his power to stop the fix from going through. He twice tried to give the money back. He offered to sit out the World Series in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. And, he tried to inform White Sox owner Charles Comisky of the fix. All of these efforts fell on deaf ears. 
   Perhaps the most convincing evidence of Jackson's withdrawal from the conspiracy was his performance on the field during the series. During the 1919 World Series--which he was accused of conspiring to fix--``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's batting average was .375, the highest of any player from either team. He had 12 hits, a World Series record. He led his team in runs scored and runs batted in. And, he hit the only home run of the series. On defense, Jackson committed no errors and had no questionable plays in 30 chances. 
   When criminal charges were brought against Jackson in trial, the jury found him ``not guilty.'' White Sox owner Charles Comiskey and several sportswriters testified that they saw no indication that Jackson did anything to indicate he was trying to throw the series. But, when the issue came before the newly-formed Major League Baseball Commissioner's office, Commissioner Judge Kenesaw ``Mountain'' Landis found Jackson guilty of taking part in the fix, and he was banned for life from playing baseball. The Commissioner's office never conducted an investigation and never heard a hearing, thus denying ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson due process. 
   Major League Baseball now has an opportunity to correct a great injustice. I wrote recently to Commissioner Bud Selig urging him to take a new look at this case. I was very pleased when the Commissioner responded to my inquiry by saying he is giving the case a fair and objective review. Restoring ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's eligibility for the Hall of Fame would benefit Major League Baseball, baseball fans, and all Americans who appreciate a sense of fair play. 
   ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson is an inspiration to people of all generations. Babe Ruth was said to have copied Jackson's swing. I was touched by Jackson's story through the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' which recounted his story. The movie was filmed in Dyersville, Iowa. Thousands of Iowans, young and old alike, have come to embrace ``Shoeless Joe.'' In fact, there is an annual Shoeless Joe Jackson celebration and celebrity baseball game in Dyersville. This year it will be attended by a cast of baseball greats, including Tommy Lasorda and Bob Feller. 
   Jackson's career statistics and accomplishments throughout his thirteen years in professional baseball clearly earn him a place as one of baseball's  all-time greats. His career batting average of .356 is the third highest of all time. In addition, Jackson was one of only seven Major League Baseball players to top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a season. 
   The resolution we submit today states that Major League Baseball should honor Jackson's accomplishments appropriately. I believe Jackson should be inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. If that is to happen, Jackson must first be cleared for consideration by the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee, which will stand as the jury which decides whether Jackson's accomplishments during his playing career are worthy of recognition in the Hall of Fame. 
   Mr. President, we are involved in many important issues. Clearly, this matter will not and should not take up the same amount of time this body devotes to critical issues like health care, education, or national defense. But, restoring the good name and reputation of a single American is important. This resolution gives us an opportunity to right an old wrong. It gives us an opportunity to honor one of the all-time great players of America's pastime, ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator HATCH and Senator MCCONNELL in introducing the Food Stamp Vitamin and Mineral Improvement Act of 1999. 
   Mr. President, this bipartisan legislation is very simple and I believe makes just plain common sense. It would give those Americans using food stamps the ability to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements for themselves and their families. 
   The change called for in this legislation has been supported by a broad coalition of groups and nutrition experts. For example, it is backed by the Alliance for Aging Research, the Spina Bifida Association of America, the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the National Nutritional Foods Association. Nutrition experts such as Dr. Paul Lachance, Chair of the Department of Food Science at Rutgers University, Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg of Tufts University, Dr. Charles Butterworth, Director of Human Nutrition at the University of Alabama Birmingham, and Dr. Dennis Heldman, Chair of the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Missouri have also called for making this common sense change to food policy. 
   Mr. President, I believe this legislation would contribute substantially to improving the nutrition and health of a segment of our society that too often falls below recommended levels of nutrient consumption. 
   Scientific evidence continues to mount showing that sound nutrition is essential for normal growth and cognitive development in children, and for improved health and the prevention of a variety of conditions and illnesses. 
   Studies have also shown, unfortunately, that many Americans do not have dietary intakes sufficient to meet even the conservative Recommended Daily Allowances or RDA's for a number of essential nutrients. Insufficient dietary intakes are especially critical for children, pregnant women and the elderly. 
   A recent study conducted by the Tufts University School of Nutrition, and based on government data, showed that millions of poor children in the United States have dietary intakes that are well below the government's Recommended Daily Allowance for a number of important nutrients. The study found that major differences exist in the intakes of poor versus non-poor children for 10 out of 16 nutrients (food energy, folate, iron, magnesium, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc). Moreover, the proportion of poor children with inadequate intakes of zinc is over 50 percent; for iron, over 40 percent; and for vitamin E, over 33 percent. 
   For some nutrients, such as vitamin A and magnesium, the proportion of poor children 
   with inadequate intakes is nearly six times as large as for non-poor children. 
   Pregnant women also have high nutritional needs. Concerns about inadequate folate intake by pregnant women prompted the Public Health Service to issue a recommendation regarding consumption of folic acid by all women of childbearing age who are capable of becoming pregnant for the purpose of reducing the incidence of spina bifida or other neural tube defects. That is why this change has long been a priority of the Spina Bifida Association of America. 
   Furthermore, the percent of pregnant and nursing women who get the RDA level of calcium has dropped from just 24 percent in 1986 to a mere 16 percent in 1994. That's 84 percent of women who aren't getting enough calcium--which we know is critical to preventing the debilitating effects of osteoporosis. 
   And again, the evidence is that lower income women, many of whom are eligible for Food Stamps, are more likely to have inadequate intake of key nutrients. Women with income of 130 percent or less of the poverty level have higher rates of deficiencies in intake of Vitamins A, E, C, B-6 and B-12, as well as Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin and Niacin than those with higher incomes. 
   Obviously, the best way to obtain sufficient nutrient intake is through eating a variety of nutritious foods, but some groups--particularly those at the greatest risk, including children, pregnant women and the elderly--may find it significantly difficult to obtain sufficient nutrient intake through foods alone. Accordingly, many people in our nation do rely on nutritional supplements to ensure that they and their families are consuming sufficient levels of key nutrients. 
   This legislation would enable low-income people to have greater access to nutritional supplements to improve their nutrient intake. Currently, recipients of food stamps are not allowed to use those resources to purchase nutritional supplements. This restriction clearly serves as an impediment to adequate nutrition for low-income people who may need supplements to ensure they are consuming sufficient levels of nutrients. It defies common sense. 
   This restriction also prevents food stamp recipients from exercising their own responsibility and choice to use food stamps for purchasing nutritional supplements that they determine are important to adequate nutrition for their children or themselves. It is a glaring inconsistency that food stamps may currently be used to purchase a variety of non-nutritious or minimally nutritious foods but not to purchase nutritional supplements. Incredibly, you can use Food Stamps to buy Twinkies, but not Vitamin C or a multivitamin. 
   Opponents of this legislation will argue that food stamps are most effectively used to improve nutrition through purchasing food rather than nutritional supplements, and that if food stamps may be used for nutritional supplements, households will be less able to stretch their resources to purchase sufficient quantities of food. 
   The available evidence indicates, however, that food stamp households actually make more careful and effective use of their resources in purchasing nutritious foods than consumers in general. Since food stamp households necessarily have a limited amount of money to spend on food--and generally already find it difficult to meet their food needs--they simply cannot afford to make unwise or unnecessary purchases of nutritional supplements using food stamps which would otherwise be used for food. 
   In addition, a month's worth of daily multivitamin supplements can cost as little as one can of soda. So I believe the concerns that food stamps will be wasted or unwisely used for nutritional supplements is unfounded. 
   Our proposal is also clearly consistent with the stated purpose of the Food Stamp program, that is to ``promote the general welfare and to safeguard the health of the nation's population by raising the nutrition among low-income households.'' 
   So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation designed to improve opportunities for low-income Americans to ensure adequate nutrition for their families and themselves. Simply put, if you think it doesn't make sense that Food Stamps can be used to buy twinkies and doughnuts but not Vitamin C or a daily multi-vitamin supplement, you should support this bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, older workers across America have been paying into pension plans throughout their working years, anticipating the secure retirement which is their due. And now, as more Americans than ever before in history approach retirement, we are seeing a disturbing trend by employers to cut their pension benefits. 
   Many companies are changing to so-called ``cash balance'' plans which often saves them millions of dollars in pension costs each year by taking a substantial cut out of employee pensions. This practice allows employers to unfairly profit at the expense of retirees. 
   Employees generally receive three types of benefits for working: direct wages, health benefits and pensions.  Two of those are long-term benefits which usually grow in value as workers become older. Pensions are paid entirely after a worker leaves. Reducing an employee's pension years after it is earned should be no more legal than denying a worker wages after work has been done. 
   In fact, our laws do prohibit employers from directly reducing an employee's pension accrued benefit. Unfortunately, however, these protections are being sidestepped and workers' pensions are being indirectly reduced through the creation of cash balance pension plans. 
   Under traditional defined benefit plans, a worker's pension is based on their length of employment and their average pay during their last years of service. Their pension is based on a preset formula using those key factors rather than the amount in their pension account. Under the typical cash balance plan, a worker's pension is based on the sum placed in the employee's account. That sum is based on their wages or salary year to year. 
   When a worker shifts from a traditional to a cash balance plan, the employer calculates the value of the benefits they have accrued under the old plan. The result for many older workers who have accrued significant sums in their pension that are higher than it would have been under the new cash balance plan. In that case, under many of these cash balance plans the employer simply stops contributing to the value of their pension till the value reaches the level provided for under the new plan. And this can go on for significant periods--five years and sometimes more. Pension experts call this ``wear away'' others call it a ``plateau.'' 
   This is not right. It is not fair. In fact, I believe it is a type of age discrimination. After all, a new employee, usually younger, would effectively be receiving greater pay for the same work: money put into their pension plan. And, there are some who believe this practice violates the spirit and perhaps the letter of existing law in that regard. 
   What does this mean to real people? 
   Two Chase Manhattan banking executives hired an actuary to calculate their future pensions after Chase Manhattan's predecessor, Chemical Bank, converted to a cash balance plan. The actuary estimated their future pensions had fallen 45 percent. John Healy, one of the executives, says ``I would have 
   had to work about ten more years before I broke even.'' 
   Ispat Inland, Inc, an East Chicago steel company, converted to a cash balance plan January 1. Paul Schroeder, a 44-year-old engineer who has worked for Ispat for 19 years, calculated it could take him as long as 13 years to acquire additional benefits. 
   Why are companies changing to these cash balance plans? They have lots of stated reasons: ease of administration, certainty in how much is needed to pay for the pension plan and that the plan is beneficial to those workers who move from company to company (with similar pension plans). But, the big reason is the companies save millions of dollars. They save it because the pensions provided for with almost all cash balance plans are, on average far less generous, and they immediately reduce their need to pay anything into a pension plan at all for a while, sometimes for years, because of this wear away or plateau feature. 
   At one conference of consulting actuaries, Joseph M. Edmonds told companies:  
   ......it is easy to install a cash balance plan in place of a traditional defined benefit plan and cover up cutbacks in future benefit accruals. For example, you might change from a final average pay formula to a career average pay formula. The employee is very excited about this because he now has an annual account balance instead of an obscure future monthly benefit. The employee does not realize the implications of the loss of future benefits in the final pay plan. Another example of a reduction in future accruals could be in the elimination of early retirement subsidies. 
   Because traditional pension plans become significantly more valuable in the last years before retirement, the switch to cash balance plans also can reduce older workers' incentive to stay until they reach their normal retirement age. 
   I support Senator MOYNIHAN'S legislation that requires that individuals receive clear individualized notice of what a conversion to a cash balance plan would do to their specific pension. There is no question that shining the light on this dark practice can reduce the chance that it will occur. I certainly agree with his view that those notices should not be generalized where obfuscation is easier and employees will pay less attention to the result. 
   I also believe that more must be done. For that reason, I am introducing the Older Workers Pension Protection Act of 1999 which prohibits the practice of ``wear away.'' It provides that a company cannot discriminate against longtime workers by not putting aside money into their pension account without any consideration for the long term payments made to the employee's pension for earlier work performed. Under my bill, there would be no wear away, no plateau in which a worker would be receiving no increases in pension benefits while working when other employees received benefits. The new payments would have to at least equal the payments made under the revised pension plan without any regard to how much a worker had accrued in pension benefits under the old plan. 
   Some suggest that if such a requirement were put in place, companies could and would opt out of providing any pension at all. I do not believe that would happen. Companies with defined benefit plans do not have them because they are required to do so. They do it because of negotiated contracts or because the company has decided that it is an important part of the benefits for employees to acquire and maintain a productive workforce. Many suggest that the simple disclosure alone might prevent a reduction in payment benefits. 
   Much is made about the gains of younger workers when companies switch to cash benefit plans. There is greater portability. But, none of the experts I've consulted believes that is a dominant motivation of the companies for proposing these changes in pension law. And, the changes I am proposing would not reduce the benefits for younger workers. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a fresh look at the spirit of the current law that prevents a reduction in accrued pension benefits. I believe it is only fair to extend that law with its current spirit by simply requiring that any company which changes to a cash balance or similar pension plan treats all workers fairly and not penalize older employees whose hard work has earned them benefits under the earlier pension plan.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act of 1999. I am joined in this effort by Senators FRIST, KENNEDY, CHAFEE, REED of Rhode Island, MACK, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, CLELAND, HELMS, WARNER, SARBANES, SCHUMER, COCHRAN, DURBIN, MOYNIHAN, BOXER, ROBERTS, and REID of Nevada. I want to thank my colleagues for cosponsoring this legislation. 
   First though, let me say how pleased I was that we were able to provide the biggest increase ever for medical research last year. The Conference Agreement of the Fiscal 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, provided a $2 billion, or 15 percent, increase for the National Institutes of Health. And this year, I and Senator SPECTER will continue our work to make sure that Congress stays on course to double funding for the NIH over the next five years, a target that was agreed to by the Senate, 98 to 0, in 1997. 
   However, as Congress embarks on this important investment in improved health, we must strengthen the totality of the biomedical research enterprise. While it is critical to focus on high quality, cutting edge basic and clinical research, we must also consider the quality of the laboratories and buildings where that research is being conducted. 
   In fact, Mr. President, the infrastructure of research institutions, including the need for new physical facilities, is central to our nation's leadership in medical research. Despite the significant scientific advances produced by Federally-funded research, most of that research is currently being done in medical facilities built in the 1950's and 1960's, a time when the Federal Government obligated from $30 million to $100 million a year for facility and equipment modernization. Since then, however, annual appropriations for modernization of our biomedical research infrastructure have dramatically declined, ranging from zero to $20 million annually over the past decade. As a result, many of our research facilities and laboratories are outdated and inadequate to meet the challenge of the next millennium. 
   In order to realize major medical breakthroughs in Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, cancer and other major illnesses, our Nation's top researchers must have top quality, state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment. Unfortunately, the status of our research infrastructure is woefully inadequate. 
   A recent study by the National Science Foundation finds that academic institutions have deferred, due to lack of funds, nearly $11.4 billion in repair, renovation, and construction projects. Almost one quarter of all research space requires either major renovation or replacement and 70% of medical schools report having inadequate space in which to perform biomedical research. 
   A separate study by the National Science Foundation documents the laboratory equipment needs of researchers and found that 67 percent of research institutions reported an increased need for laboratory instruments. At the same time, the report found that spending for such instruments at colleges and universities actually declined in the early 1990's. 
   Several other prominent organizations have documented the need for increased funding for research infrastructure. A March 1998 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges stated that ``The government should reestablish and fund a National Institutes of Health construction authority. .....'' A June 1998 report by the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology stated that ``Laboratories must be built and equipped for the science of the 21st century ..... Infrastructure investments should include renovation of existing space as well as new construction, where appropriate.'' 
   As we work to double funding for medical research over the next five years, the already serious shortfall in the modernization of our Nation's aging research facilities and labs will continue to worsen unless we take specific action. Future increases in NIH must be matched with increased funding for repair, renovation and construction of research facilities, as well as the purchase of modern laboratory equipment. 
   Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today expands Federal funding for facilities construction and state-of-the-art laboratory equipment through the NIH by increasing the authorization for this account within the National Center for Research Resources to $250 million in FY 2000 and $500 million in FY 2001. In addition, the bill authorizes a ``Shared Instrumentation Grant Program'' at NIH, to be administered by the Center. The program will provide grants for the purchase of shared-use, state-of-the-art laboratory equipment costing over $100,000. All grants awarded under these two programs will be peer-reviewed, as is the practice with all NIH grants and projects. 
   We are entering a time of great promise in the field of biomedical research. We are on the verge of major breakthroughs which could end the ravages of cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's and the scores of illnesses and conditions which take the lives and health of millions of Americans. But to realize these breakthroughs, we must devote the necessary resources to our Nation's research enterprise. 
   The Association of American Universities, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology have all expressed their support for this legislation. 
   I hope the rest of my colleagues will soon sign on as cosponsors to this important effort to improve the research capacity of this country.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member, the managers of the bill, for including the amendment I had offered in the managers' packet. I thank Senators WELLSTONE, KOHL, LAUTENBERG, KENNEDY, DODD, TORRICELLI, WYDEN, and FEINGOLD for cosponsoring this sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the recent adoption in Geneva by the International Labor Organization of the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 
   June 17, 1999 marked a historic event in the battle to end the scourge of abusive and exploitative child labor. By a unanimous vote, the International Labor Organization's member states approved a new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 
   For the first time in history, the world spoke with one voice in opposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from across the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jewish to Muslim, from Buddhists to Christians--came together to proclaim unequivocally that ``abusive and exploitative child labor is a practice which will not be tolerated and must be abolished.'' 
   Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an acceptable practice because of a country's economic circumstance. Gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable because of cultural traditions. And gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the road to economic development. The United States and the international community as a whole unanimously for the first time laid those arguments to rest and laid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the scourge of abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   Mr. President, for the better part of a decade, I have been in my own capacity working to do what I can to end abusive and exploitative child labor around the globe, including in the United States. The ILO estimates that there are about 250 million children worldwide, many as young as 6 or 7, who are working, economically active. These are not just part-time jobs. Many of them work in dangerous environments which are detrimental to their emotional, physical, and moral well-being. 
   Just last year, I traveled to Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh where I witnessed the travesty of abusive and exploitative child labor firsthand. 
   This chart is a picture I took myself. This is in a small plant, a factory, to use the term loosely, hidden away on the 
   outskirts of Katmandu. I was there on a Sunday, and Sunday evening I was accompanied by a young man who is a former child laborer. He took me to this place on the outskirts of the city where, because of friends working there who said the owner was gone and he knew the guard at the gate, we got in surreptitiously. In fact, the sign on the outside of the gate said no one under the age of 14 was permitted to work there. It was a big sign in both English and in Nepalese. 
   Once we got in, we saw kids as young as 6 and 7. This is just one of the many pictures I took depicting these kids working full time, and this was in the evening. This was probably about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening on a Sunday. 
   In India, I met children who were liberated from hand-knotted carpet factories where they were chained--chained, Mr. President--to looms and forced to work as many as 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. These children were nothing more than slaves. They earned no money. They received no education. They had no hope for a future until they were freed by the South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, headed by Kailash Satyarthi. I can tell you that I myself have only glimpsed into the dark world of exploitative child labor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was talking this morning about a very significant event that transpired last week in Geneva on June 17. It was a historic event in the battle to end the scourge of abusive and exploitative child labor. By a unanimous vote, the International Labor Organization's member states, including the United States, approved a new convention banning the worst forms of child labor. 
   For the first time in history, the world spoke with one voice in opposition to abusive and exploitative child labor.

And gone is the argument that abusive and exploitative child labor is a necessary evil on the road to economic development. The United States and the international community as a whole unanimously for the first time laid those arguments to rest and laid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the scourge of abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   Mr. President, for the better part of a decade, I have been in my own capacity working to do what I can to end abusive and exploitative child labor around the globe, including in the United States. The ILO estimates that there are about 250 million children worldwide, many as young as 6 or 7, who are working. These are not just part-time jobs. Many of them work in dangerous environments which are detrimental to their emotional, physical, and moral well-being. 
   Last year, I traveled with my staff to Katmandu, Nepal, and also to Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. We were able to witness firsthand the abuse of child labor. 
   This chart shows a plant we went to in Katmandu. It was on a Sunday. I was taken there by a young man who had previously been a child laborer. On the outside of the gate there was this sign in both Nepalese and English: Child labour under the age of 14 is strictly prohibited. 
   I actually took this picture. Because we had information that the owner was gone and this young man I was with knew the guard at the gate, we were let in. When we were let in, I started taking pictures. This is one of many pictures I have of some of the young children working in that plant. We determined their ages to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 or 8 years. This was about 7 or 8 o'clock on a Sunday night. These kids were working in very dusty, dirty conditions, and this shows them as virtual slaves, unable to leave, unable to do anything but work at the rug plant. 
   This gives a little idea of the child labor I was able to glimpse on my trip. Had they known we were coming to that plant, they would have taken the children out the back door and we would not have seen any children there. They would have said: See, we don't have any child labor. 
   That is why it took a surreptitious action on my part to get in and take the pictures, so that I could get proof of the child labor and the deplorable conditions which occur not just in Nepal, but all over the world. 
   In India, I met children who were liberated from hand-knotted carpet factories where they were chained--chained, Mr. President--to looms and forced to work as many as 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. These children were nothing more than slaves. They earned no money. They received no education. They had no hope for a future until they were freed by the South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, headed by Kailash Satyarthi. 
   I have a chart prepared with ILO data. We see Latin America and the Caribbean have about 17 million children working; Africa, 80 million; Asia, 153 million; and about half a million in Oceania. That comes down to a total of about 250 million children worldwide. 
   Again, I want to be clear that we are not just talking about kids working after school, working part-time. That is not it at all. The convention that the ILO adopted deals with children who are chained to looms, handle dangerous chemicals, ingest metal dust, are forced to sell illegal drugs, forced into prostitution, forced into armed conflict, some of whom who work in glass factories where furnace temperatures exceed 1,500 degrees. These children are forced to work with no protective equipment. They work only for the economic gains of others. This is in sharp contrast to any kind of a part-time job for some spending money for the latest CD. 
   In this picture, taken in the Sialkot region of Pakistan, 8-year-old Mohammad Ashraf Irfan is making surgical equipment. He is 8 years old working around hot metal and sharp instruments. He has no protective clothing on at all, not even for his eyes. This is his lot in life at the ripe old age of 8. This is what the convention, adopted in Geneva last week, will start preventing. 
   Mr. President, as you and many of my colleagues know, President Clinton traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, last week to address the International Labor Organization's conference. He is the first President in U.S. history to address the ILO in its 80-year history. Imagine that. I was privileged to be asked to accompany the President for this historic event. 
   In his address to the ILO, President Clinton spoke eloquently of the crying need to protect all children from abusive and exploitative labor. The President said, in part: 
   There are some things we cannot and will not tolerate. We will not tolerate children being used in pornography and 
   prostitution. We will not tolerate children in slavery or bondage. We will not  tolerate children being forcibly recruited to serve in armed conflicts. We will not tolerate young children risking their health and breaking their bodies in hazardous and dangerous working conditions for hours unconscionably long--regardless of country, regardless of circumstance. 
   I cannot agree more. I was very proud of President Clinton--proud that he was the first U.S. President in history to address the ILO, proud that he focused his remarks on the issue of child labor and on his support for this convention.

   Mr. HARKIN. The convention defines the worst forms as being all forms of slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, the sale and trafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict, child prostitution, children producing and trafficking in narcotic drugs, or any other work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, the safety, or morals of children. It also defines a child as any person under the age of 18. 
   Mr. President, this is what we are talking about. Look at this young girl in this photograph. We do not know her age, but from all accounts, people who know this area say she is probably less than 9 years old. She and her two friends have straps around their heads, and she is carrying what looks like seven big blocks or bricks on her back which are much to heavy for such a small child and are doing permanent damage to her spine and neck. She is barefoot and hunched over. As you can see, her friends of an equal age are carrying a similar load. 
   These are the worst forms of child labor. That is what this convention is all about. The convention calls on the ILO member states to take immediate and effective actions to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labor. 
   I am looking at a chart, which is a photo of another young girl in India carrying construction material on her head. One can see her arms are straight, her face is dirty and sweaty, and she should be in school rather than having all this construction material, about 30 or 40 pounds piled on the top of her head. She is also doing permanent damage to her neck and spine. This is the sort of gross labor abuse the convention seeks to end. 
   As I said, the convention defines a child for these purposes as any child under the age of 18. It calls on member states to implement action plans to move children from the workplace to the classroom. UNICEF reports that over 1 billion adults will be functionally illiterate on the eve of the new millennium because they worked as children and were denied an education. 
   That is why I am especially pleased about the importance the convention placed on education as a principal means for reducing instances of abusive and exploitative child labor. I believe very strongly that these child laborers must go from exploitation to education. 
   This chart shows a list of what the convention abolishes: Child slavery, child bondage, child prostitution, children in pornography, trafficking in children, forced recruitment of children for armed conflict, recruitment of children in the production or sale of narcotics, and hazardous work by children. 
   But, let me come back to the forced recruitment of children for armed conflict for just a moment. We do not have forced recruitment in the United States for children. But I am aware our Armed Forces are able to recruit children who are 17 years of age. Quite frankly, we need a debate in this body about whether or not we ought to allow that to continue. I, for one, believe that the armed services ought to be held in abeyance from recruiting and signing up young people in the armed services until they at least reach the age of 18. But that is a debate for another time. 
   As I stated earlier, I believe that children should go from exploitation to education. We visited a very important milestone in this effort in Dacca, Bangladesh, last year when we found almost 10,000 young children, mostly girls--about 90 percent--who had been working in the garment factories. After an historic agreement with the help of the ILO and the Bangladeshi Garment Manufacturers Export Association, these children were moved out of the garment factories and into about 353 schools established in Dacca for this sole purpose. 
   We visited a couple of those schools, and I will just tell you, looking at these young girls, who maybe a year before could not read or write, now were standing up and reciting whole passages from books, being able to write, and you could see in their eyes they are not going to go back to exploitation. 
   The people in Bangladesh, in the government and in industry, said it is probably one of the best things that has happened to them, because they are going to have a more highly educated workforce, a more productive workforce, and that means their whole standard of living is going to increase. 
   The convention adopted last week also calls on all member nations to identify and reach out to children at special risk and to take into account the special situation of girls with regard to education. And I am also very pleased about that provision. 
   There are many other important elements contained in the convention which I have not mentioned. I encourage all of my colleagues to read this document thoroughly. 
   I would also mention another historic fact about this convention. 
   For the first time in its history, the U.S. tripartite group to the ILO, which consists of representatives from government, business and labor, went to Geneva to negotiate on this important convention, and they unanimously agreed on the final version. 
   So I commend Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman and the other members of the U.S. delegation, including Mr. John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, and Ed Potter, from the U.S. Council on International Business, for their leadership on this convention. 
   With the adoption of the new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, the ILO has written an important new chapter in our effort to honor our values and protect our children. 
   Today, in recognition of this effort, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the International Labor Organization's new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor which was accepted as part of the managers' package. This amendment calls upon the President to promptly submit to the Senate the new convention. It commends the ILO member states for their negotiating efforts and states that it should be the policy of the United States to work with all foreign nations and international organizations to promote an end to abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   Again, it is my understanding that very shortly President Clinton will be transmitting this convention to the Senate for our consideration. I am hopeful that the Committee on Foreign Relations will take up the convention, have hearings on it, and report it out as soon as possible. 
   Again, with the unanimous support of labor, government and business, I see no reason why the United States should not be one of the first countries to ratify this new convention. So I am hopeful that before this session of the Congress ends that the Senate will act on it and ratify the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 
   Once again, I thank Senators WELLSTONE, KOHL, LAUTENBERG, KENNEDY, DODD, TORRICELLI, WYDEN, and FEINGOLD for cosponsoring this important amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as my good friend from Delaware is aware, last week the International Labor Organization (ILO) unanimously adopted a new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. This Convention calls on ILO Member States to take immediate and effective actions to prohibit and eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Convention also defines the worst forms of child labor as: all forms of slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, or the sale and trafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict; child prostitution; children producing and trafficking of narcotic drugs; or any other work which by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals of children. It also defines a child as any person under the age of 18. 
   I was privileged to travel with the President to the ILO where he addressed the delegates on child labor and affirmed the United States Government support of this important Convention. 
   Would the Senator from Delaware agree that this important and historic Convention should be considered as a high priority item and considered in a timely fashion after submission to the Senate by the President?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will make a few comments about the importance of managed care reform and the importance of passing a strong Patients' Bill of Rights in this Congress. 
   The bill that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want us to consider, I believe, is fundamentally flawed. First, it fails to cover two-thirds of privately insured Americans. Secondly, it fails to prevent insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of a patient's treating physician. And, third, it is weak in giving consumers the right to sue their insurance companies for faulty decisions to withhold care. 
   Today, I want to focus on a few issues that have critical importance to me: access to specialty care, network adequacy, and genetic discrimination. 
   When we marked up the bill in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I offered an amendment to ensure that patients have access to the specialty care they need. I intend to offer it again if we are ever allowed a full and fair debate on this bill. 
   This is a critical issue for people with disabilities, women with breast cancer, and others with chronic health conditions. But it is important for all Americans. The inability to access specialists is the number-one reason people  give when they leave a health plan, and it is a top issue they want Congress to address. 
   The Republican bill is deficient in this area. Aside from two minor provisions regarding access to OB/GYNs and pediatricians--access that almost all health plans already provide--there is nothing in the Republican bill that guarantees access to specialty care such as that provided by neurologists, pediatric oncologists, rehabilitation physicians, and others. 
   We need to ensure that people can see specialists outside of their HMO's network at no additional cost if specialists in the plan's network cannot meet their needs. We need to allow a specialist to be the primary care coordinator for patients with disabilities or life-threatening or degenerative conditions. And we need to provide for standing referrals for people who need ongoing specialty care, which enables them to go straight to the specialist instead of jumping through hoops with primary care doctors or insurance companies. 
   These provisions would not create onerous new burdens on plans. In fact, many plans already allow specialists to be primary care coordinators, and they let people have standing referrals. Most importantly, they address the tragic cases we have heard about that stem from delay or denial of access to specialists. 
   Finally, helping people get timely access to specialty care is not just smart and compassionate policy; it will also help minimize the need for litigation that results from a failure to have access. 
   Another amendment I have been working on ensures that each insurance plan has sufficient providers in its network to deliver the care that is promised. Again, this is an area where the Republican bill is, I think, very inadequate. There is no provision in the Republican bill to ensure network adequacy. This is a very important issue in my State of Iowa. 
   My amendment ensures that every network plan has a sufficient number and mix of providers to deliver the covered services. 
   It also requires plans to incorporate a primary care physician in their network who is within 30 minutes or 30 driving miles of a patient's home. If the plan cannot include patients within that distance, patients need to be allowed to go ``out-of-network'' to obtain the care they need. In other words, no one should have to drive more than 30 miles or 30 minutes to see a primary care physician. 
   It is important to understand what is happening now. Many managed care companies now contract only with urban-based providers. Not only does this require patients to travel considerable distances to receive basic health care, but these urban-based networks also weaken the rural health infrastructure by shutting local doctors and local clinics out of the network. This is wrong and must be stopped. 
   I have been working also on the genetic issues of this since the early 1990s when I introduced an amendment to the HIPAA that prohibited genetic discrimination by group health plans. As ranking member of the Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee, I have also been and continue to be a strong supporter of the Human Genome Project. In the HELP Committee, the authorizing committee, I worked with Senators DODD and KENNEDY on a genetic discrimination amendment. I intend to continue working on this issue when and if we get a Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor. 
   We have all discussed at length the importance of prohibiting discrimination on the basis of all predictive genetic information in all health insurance markets. I am pleased that the Republican bill recognized that we need to prohibit discrimination in the group and in the individual markets, and that we need to prohibit discrimination not only on the basis of genetic tests but on the basis of a person's family history. 
   Still, the Republican bill failed to address several other equally critical issues in this area. The bottom line is that we must prohibit discrimination by insurers and employers. 
   To prohibit discrimination in one context only invites discrimination in the other. 
   For example, if we only prohibit discrimination in the insurance context, employers who are worried about future increased medical costs will simply not hire individuals who have a genetic predisposition to a particular disease. 
   Similarly, we must prohibit health insurance companies from disclosing genetic discrimination to other insurance companies, to industry-wide data banks, and employers. If we really want to prevent discrimination, we should not let genetic information get into the wrong hands in the first place. 
   Finally, if we really want a prohibition of genetic discrimination to have teeth, we have to have strong remedies and penalties. The $100-a-day fine against health insurers that my colleagues across the aisle have proposed will do little to prevent health insurers from discriminating, and it does nothing to compensate a victim of such discrimination. We must do better than this. 
   Mr. President, let me say that we must not pass up this chance to make true and significant reforms to managed care programs. This is the issue that the American people have said they most want the Congress to address. And they are watching us carefully to see if we will enact real reform or a series of meaningless sound bites. 
   If we take strong action that allows clear-cut access to specialty care, ensures network adequacy, and prohibits genetic discrimination, we will have gone a long way to providing real reform and providing for a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. In listening to the Senator's very eloquent remarks, the Senator from North Dakota really does understand the depth of the problems in agriculture. He has been one of our great leaders in fighting for family farms and our rural communities, in making statements and comments about the lack of free trade and the other economic conditions that are working against the farmer. 
   What I really wanted to ask the Senator is, What role do the increasing sorts of conglomerates, vertical integration, the fact that we are getting fewer and fewer hog farms, for example, that we are experiencing in Iowa and other places, smaller and smaller numbers of meatpackers and slaughterers in this country--when you look at the increasing concentration, what, I might ask, is this doing, and what effect does this increasing concentration have in reducing the price that the farmer gets? 
   In other words, we saw the cartoon about the person in the grocery store saying, ``It only pays pennies. Who gets the rest?'' I ask the Senator from North Dakota again, what is the effect on the farmer?--in other words, what the farmer is getting from the consumer's dollar, because in the past you had a lot of competitors out there competing against one another to take the raw product and get it to market. Now you have just a few. You have a very narrow funnel now. It has been my opinion and observation, based upon a lot of economic data, that this small funnel now they have to go to, the few meatpackers and processors, vertical integration, 
   basically that is where the consumer dollars stops, and it is not getting back to the farmer. 
   The Senator has been very eloquent on this issue of the increasing concentration and what that means for family farming; does the Senator share that feeling?

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for 25 years, Bread for the World has been putting principles of faith to work in pursuit of justice for the world's hungry people. Bread for the World members are now in Washington for their National Gathering, Silver Anniversary Celebration, and Annual Lobby Day. I want to take this opportunity to welcome them and to congratulate Bread for the World and its tens of thousands of members for 25 years of accomplishment in the service of humankind. It is a great honor for me to be a member of Bread for the World's board. 
   Bread for the World remains true to its origins as a grassroots organization working from local churches on through to the national and international levels to address the fundamental causes of hunger and poverty. The organization was founded in 1974 by a small group of Catholics and Protestants who sought to mobilize persons of faith to influence United States policies relating to hunger and poverty. Bread for the World grew rapidly under the outstanding leadership of the Reverend Arthur Simon, and now includes more than 44,000 members and churches. The Reverend David Beckmann serves very capably as the group's current President. 
   As a nonpartisan citizen's movement based in the Christian community, Bread for the World members work hard to promote policies that will improve the lives of hungry and poor people in the United States and around the world. Through their dedicated advocacy, Bread for the World members have been instrumental in winning key victories in the fight to alleviate hunger and poverty. They have, for example, worked successfully to improve and devote more resources to WIC and other child nutrition programs, to enhance food security in Africa by increasing investment at the farm and village level where it really counts, and to restore food stamp benefits to vulnerable legal immigrants. This year Bread for the World members are participating in the laudable worldwide effort, known as Jubilee 2000, to reduce poverty in developing nations through critically needed international debt relief. 
   I am proud to be able to give thanks for the moral commitment and grassroots mobilizing of Bread for the World members as they celebrate their 25th anniversary year. I sincerely wish them continued blessings as they carry on their efforts toward seeking justice and ending hunger.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to speak about why I was necessarily absent from voting yesterday and explain how I would have voted had I been here. 
   For the better part of a decade, I have been working to help end abusive and exploitative child labor around the globe and even in our backyard. I have come to the floor many times over the last several years to speak about this issue, submitting resolutions, working with the International Labor Organization, and others, to do what we can to end abusive and exploitative child labor. 
   The ILO, the International Labor Organization, estimates that 250 million children worldwide are economically active--that means they are working--and many work in dangerous environments which are detrimental to their emotional, physical, and moral well-being. 
   Yesterday was a very historic day. For the first time in the 80-year history of the International Labor Organization, the President of the United States addressed that body. The President traveled to Geneva and asked me to accompany him because of my work on this issue. 
   I cannot really find the words to describe the impact of the President of the United States standing in front of a couple thousand people, all of whom have been working for years to end child labor, speaking as the President of the United States--it was the first time in the history of the ILO that a President ever spoke to this organization--about one issue: child labor. 
   I could not have been more proud of our Nation and of President Clinton for the words he spoke, for the position he took on this issue. He endorsed this new convention. There is a new convention that was just signed today, a new convention to end the most abusive and exploitative forms of child labor around the globe. We were there. We signed it at the meeting. I am hopeful the President will very soon transmit this new convention to the Senate for ratification.

   Mr. HARKIN. One of the very important things he said in his speech was:  
   You have taken a vital step by adopting this new convention. We will do everything we can to join with you. 
   We will not tolerate children being used in pornography and prostitution. 
   We will not tolerate children in slavery or bondage. 
   We will not tolerate children being forcibly recruited to serve in armed conflicts. 
   We will not tolerate young children risking their health and breaking their bodies in hazardous and dangerous working conditions for hours unconscionably long--regardless of country, regardless of circumstance. These are not some archaic practices out of a Charles Dickens novel. These are things that happen in too many places today.  
   The President said:  
   I am proud of what is being done at your meeting. In January, I said to our Congress and the American people in the State of the Union address, that we would work with the ILO on a new initiative to raise labor standards and to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world. I am proud to say that the United States will support your convention. After I return home I will send it to the U.S. Senate for ratification, and I ask all other countries to ratify it, as well.  
   Mr. President, today I had delivered to every office a letter, a cover letter, and a copy of the new convention on the worst forms of child labor. It has all the information in here that Senators and their staffs would need to understand what that new convention is. 
   I did that because it is my intention to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the State Department authorization bill stating our support for this historic convention. I hope my colleagues will take the time to look at the material that I sent to their offices. I hope that we can all join together in a bipartisan effort to support this convention. This convention offers a brighter tomorrow for all of our world's children. 
   Yesterday, because I was in Geneva with the President for this very historic gathering and for this very historic speech by the President of the United States, I was necessarily absence from the Senate floor. 
   Had I been here, on the military construction appropriations bill, I would have voted yes. 
   Iowa is deeply saddened that I could not be here to vote on a bill for which I had worked for a long time with Senator KENNEDY and Senator JEFFORDS, and so many others. I am happy to see that it passed the Senate 99-0. Had I been here, it would have been 100-0; and that is the Workforce Incentives Act. 
   As the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, this was sort of one of the final building blocks of ensuring that people with disabilities not only have the right and the civil rights to go out and get jobs and work, but this bill provides them with the necessary support in the health care that they need. Too often, people with disabilities go out to get a job, and under the Americans with Disabilities Act they can get that job, but then they lose their health care. Because many of these jobs are low-paying, entry-level jobs, they simply cannot afford to take them. So I am really proud that the Senate, in a strong bipartisan fashion, passed the Workforce Incentives Act yesterday. Had I been here I would have of course voted yes. 
   On the lockbox provision that came up, again, I would have voted no on that because there were no amendments allowed. I feel very strongly that the provision, the loophole that I felt was in the bill, that said that this was only good until Social Security reform was passed, I do not believe was adequate enough. The question is, What reform are we talking about? I think we needed to define the reform before we voted for the lockbox. 
   On the energy and water appropriations, I would have supported that. 
   On the legislative branch appropriations, I would have voted yes on that had I been here. 
   I wanted to state for the RECORD why I was necessarily absent yesterday, and how I would have voted had I been here. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. I was an original cosponsor of the Work Incentives bill when we introduced it last year, and again this year, and was at the White House when the President endorsed the bill. 
   Almost nine years ago, the Americans With Disabilities Act became law. On that day, we told Americans with disabilities that the door to equal opportunity was finally open. 
   And the ADA has opened the doors of opportunity--plenty of them. Americans with disabilities now expect to be treated as full citizens, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. And they are participating in American life like never before in our Nation's history. 
   But we have not been as successful in employment. Far too many people with disabilities who want to work are unemployed. More than eight million people between 18 and 64 are on SSI and SSDI--and less than one-half of one percent of them return to work each year. 
   Clearly, there are barriers to be torn down. 
   Let me tell you the story of a young woman from Iowa named Phoebe Ball. Phoebe just graduated from the University of Iowa and she was shocked when she found that if she took an entry level job paying $18,000, she would suffer a huge loss--her health insurance. 
   Phoebe wrote an article for an Iowa City newspaper. Here is what she said:  
   I want off SSI desperately ..... I want to work. I want to know that I have earned the money I have ..... I don't feel good about the money the government sends me each month. I don't feel entitled to it because I know what I am capable of. 
   My parents and my society made a promise to me. They promised me that I can live with this disability, and I can. ..... What is limiting me right now is not this wheelchair, and it's not this limb that's missing. It's a system that says if I can work at all, then I'm undeserving of any assistance, I'm undeserving of the basic medical care that I need to stay alive. 
   ..... What is needed is a government that understands its responsibility to its citizens ..... then we'll see what we are capable of, then we will be working and proving the worth of the ADA.  
   Mr. President, the Work Incentives Improvement Act is a well-crafted, comprehensive bill that would be the answer to Phoebe Ball's dilemma. 
   It provides health care and employment preparation and placement services to individuals to reduce dependency on cash assistance; 
   It creates new options for States to allow people with disabilities to purchase Medicaid coverage; 
   It lengthens the current period of extended eligibility for Medicare coverage for working disabled individuals; and 
   It establishes a return to work ``ticket'' program that will allow people with disabilities to secure the best possible services they can find to get and keep jobs. 
   If only 1 percent--or 75,000--of the 7.5 million people with disabilities, like Phoebe, who are now on benefits were to become employed, Federal savings would total $3.5 billion over the work life of the beneficiaries. That not only makes economic sense, it also contributes to preserving the Social Security Trust fund. 
   Mr. President, the disability community and members from both sides of the aisle here in the Senate have wholeheartedly endorsed this bill. The Work Incentives Improvement Act has 78 cosponsors. 78! Rarely do we see in this chamber such broad bipartisan support. 
   The Work Incentives Act will open the door to full participation by people with disabilities in our workplaces, our economy, and our American Dream, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am joining with Senator BOXER in offering this amendment to strike the provision that allows the Pentagon to lease six of these executive aircraft. The military designation is C-37A. We know them as Gulfstreams in the civilian world. They are very lavish and very nice aircraft. In fact, I will show you what we are talking about. 
   This is a Gulfstream V. It is a very nice airplane. I am sure that millionaires who have made a lot of money in the stock market probably have those. Billionaires have them. I am sure they fly them around. It is a very nice, luxurious aircraft. All of the statistics are very good on that aircraft. It is quiet. It flies high. It goes long distances nonstop. It is quite luxurious on the inside. 
   As you can see, this is a very nice business executive jet. I wouldn't deny that it is a good tool for a lot of businesses to use in fact. I am not here to say that Gulfstream V is a bad aircraft, or that it shouldn't be built, or that there is no reason to have this in anybody's inventory--not in the least. This aircraft serves a very valuable purpose for a lot of businesses here and around the world. In fact, the Gulfstream corporation has to be a good corporation, for all I know, and builds a pretty darned good airplane. That is not our point. 
   Our point is--the more I have looked into this the more it has become apparent to me--that all branches of the military have become top-heavy, not only top-heavy in terms of the command structure itself but top-heavy in the number of executive jets they have to ferry them around from place to place. I am beginning to wonder if these are really all that necessary. Are they really for wartime use, or are they really more for just convenience? 
   For example--I will get more into this in detail later--we are told that a lot of these executive jets such as this can go 4,000 or 5,000 miles without refueling, as necessary to get to theaters of operation around the world. But the fact is, during the gulf war operations very few of these were used. We have to ask the question: Is it really for the benefit of generals to use for rapid movement during war, or is it more for convenience in peacetime? 
   As the Senator from California said, we have a lot of budget problems here at the military. I, for one, have been trying to do something about getting WIC programs, as the Senator said, for our military personnel overseas. It is a blot on our national character and on our military that we have military personnel on food stamps. That is not right. It is not right that we have enlisted personnel who need the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Feeding Program. 
   Last year, the Senator from California and I tried to offer an amendment here that would say at least when they go overseas they get the same WIC Program as they got here. If I am not mistaken, I think it came to the grand total of right around $5 to $20 million. The military said they couldn't afford to do it, but they can afford $40 million for six of these aircraft. Something is wrong when the military says they can't afford it, that the Department of Agriculture has to  pay for it; the Defense Department can't, but they can afford a business jet such as this. That got me when I saw that. Something has to be done about this. 
   I understand they want to lease several of these Gulfstream V aircraft. I would like to have one to go back and forth to Iowa. I wouldn't have to go through Chicago anymore--probably nonstop right to Iowa. The Senator from California could use one, get on the jet right here and go to 
   any airport in California nonstop. 
   Let me show you the interior of the aircraft: A nice, luxurious interior. Lean back, have your own personal TV set, a glass of wine. That is pretty nice travel. 
   Again, I am not saying that we have to strip down everything, that a general has to ride in a harness on a side bucket strapped onto a C-130. That is not what I am saying. There probably is a need for some of these aircraft to transport these people rapidly. My question has to do with the number of aircraft. 
   For example, I note that there are now over 300 aircraft in inventory, over 150 jets. I can't quite get an accurate count. Last time I counted, there were 154 jets, 70 Learjets. Regarding the C-9, the same as a Douglas DC-9, the Navy has 27, the Marines have 2, and the Air Force has 5. Gulfstreams, we have 16 already. We have some Gulfstream IIIs and IVs, the predecessor to the Gulfstream V. They are about as nice, but they can't go as far. They are a good airplane. We have 70 Learjets total; 727s, we have 3. I am reading just the jets. And I didn't realize we already have two Gulfstream Vs in our inventory. Cessna Citation 560, which is pictured here, is a pretty nice jet, not quite as big as the Gulfstream V and doesn't go as far, but we have 14 of those. The old Saberliners, we have three still in existence. We have seven 707s in our inventory. 
   There are quite a lot of jets to be flying around. Again, I am wondering, with the inventory that we have, why do we have to lease seven more? Or are we cutting back on some of the aircraft? Again, they may serve a legitimate purpose, but I am wondering, and I go back to a GAO report that the Senator referred to from 1995, ``Travel by Senior Officials,'' dated June 1995. One of the their recommendations in that report was to develop the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the availability of each service's aircraft to help fulfill the OSA, operation support needs, of other services. The third recommendation, reassign or otherwise dispose of excess OSA aircraft. 
   Now, the chairman and ranking member may know better than I, but it seems to me that a lot of the services have the aircraft and they just don't go from one service to the other. It seems to me what we really need is an effective structure in DOD that puts these business jets and other aircraft under one operational command that really works. If a senior officer in the Navy needed one for something, they should go to this command to get it; Marines the same, Air Force--all this would be the same. The Navy/Marine should go to one central structure to get the aircraft and have them assigned from that structure. That is how it should work. 
   It looks as though we are in the same old military gamesmanship: Air Force, ``I got mine''; Navy, ``I got mine.'' The Navy has Navy markings and the Air Force has Air Force markings and the Army has Army markings and never the twain shall meet. 
   I am curious as to how much money we waste and how much operational support aircraft we waste because we don't have that one effective integrated command structure working as it should. That was the suggestion made by GAO in 1995. If nothing else comes out of this, I hope we might move ahead in some way to provide an effective overall operational structure. 
   I said earlier that there is a DOD Directive 4500.43 that requires that OSA aircraft inventories must be based on wartime 
   needs. However, few OSA aircraft were used in theater during the Persian Gulf war. 
   From the GAO report:  
   Actual use of OSA aircraft during the Persian gulf war suggests that the primary role of OSA is not wartime support but peacetime support.  
   Again, I quoted that from the GAO report of June of 1995.

   Mr. HARKIN. The basic answer to that is, yes--depending on the mission, of course. 
   Now, if a general or a four-star wanted to fly from here nonstop to Europe, they couldn't take this airplane which only has about a 2,000-mile leg. However, I might add, it could fly to Reykjavik and refuel. 
   It can fly to Shannon and refuel. It will take an hour and a half or more; you have to land, refuel, and get out of there. But it is perfectly capable of doing that. A lot of businesses fly these overseas all the time. You just have to stop and refuel in one place, that is all. It even has a bathroom on board.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator asking that question because I think it points up--first of all, I am not saying we do not need any of this; I am saying we do need some of these planes. I was talking with the chairman about this. Let's say a four-star officer has to go from Washington to Florida to Texas to Chicago for a series of meetings. He possibly cannot do it with a civilian plane. I understand that, if one has to go overseas for a certain meeting and get back. There are times when you cannot use civilian airplanes. But this type of a jet could be used for any kind of domestic travel in the continental United States. You might have to land and refuel. That does not bother me a whole heck of a lot. 
   I am saying with the Gulfstream Vs that we have now--which I said we have two or so right now in inventory, plus we have a number of Gulfstream IVs and Gulfstream IIIs--let's say a general needed to get from the Pentagon to someplace overseas in a big hurry for something. OK, requisition one of them and use it for that. But if they have to go to Florida and then to Texas and then to California and make all these meetings, use one of these smaller aircraft because they are going to land anyway, while they are at the meeting, they can refuel, take off and go. It is a much cheaper way of operating. 
   I seriously question whether we need six Gulfstream Vs for whatever purpose they are asking--I really question that--and I question whether or not other versions of aircraft like this or others can be used more for domestic travel. 
   I have a letter to Chairman STEVENS dated March 8, 1999, from the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Hamre, and General Ralston, U.S. Air Force. I was reading it over and was struck by a paragraph. It is an assessment of CINC support aircraft. This was required by the Senate Appropriations Committee  report last year. I was struck by this paragraph which says:  
   This study evaluated all military and representative commercial aircraft to determine which aircraft would both be configurable and available for CINC support airlift.  
   It goes on. This is the paragraph:  
   The study revealed that when CINC--  
   Commanders in Chief--  
   requirements, combined long, unrefueled range--4,200 to 6,000 nautical miles--more than 18 passengers and short runway capabilities--5,000 to 7,000 feet--a modern commercial aircraft was needed.  
   I find it interesting. If you go to the CINCs and ask, ``What are your requirements?'' and they define their requirements, guess what. They meet the requirements of the Gulfstream V. If you ask me what my requirements are to fly around the United States, I bet I can come up with a set of determinants that I need a Gulfstream V: I travel a lot; I go to the coast once in a while; I am always in Iowa; sometimes I have to be in one place for a meeting and then another place for a meeting. I would love to have a Gulfstream V. And I have 
   short runways, too, sometimes. 
   It is not surprising that we ask the CINCs, ``What do you need?'' and they then define their needs and come up with Gulfstream Vs. It seems to me we ought to have someone else defining the needs rather than the commanders in chief, because they are the ones who use the aircraft. 
   They said:  
   Based on historical CINC support aircraft usage and future requirements, and discounting the probable need of backup aircraft inventory, seven C-37A aircraft--  
   that is the Gulfstream V--  
   should minimally satisfy the existing CINC requirements.  
   What I cannot figure out--does the Senator from California know?--is, how many CINCs are there? Do we know how many CINCs there are?

   Mr. HARKIN. They may want to travel in this kind of luxury, but I am not certain we ought to just give it to them. There are nine CINCs. Each one now would have their own Gulfstream V. Do we know what the per-hour operating cost is of a Gulfstream V? As best I can determine, the per-hour operating cost is over $2,000. I think it is actually higher than that, because I do not think that takes into account depreciation; I think that is just fuel and other requirements. 
   Let's just say it is $2,000 an hour. A four-star officer gets on one of those Gulfstream Vs and flies 2 hours someplace for a meeting and 2 hours back; that is 4 hours, 
   $8,000 just to go to a meeting someplace and come back. That is a good use of taxpayers' dollars? 
   I will lay you odds that 7 times out of 10 that four-star officer could go right out here to National Airport or Dulles, get on an airplane, and get a first-class ticket--How much is a first-class ticket?--fly to that meeting, and fly back for less than $1,000. 
   I ask you: When is the last time you ever got on a commercial aircraft in the United States flying anywhere and saw a general or admiral on that plane? I cannot remember when. I see a lot of lieutenants and commanders and captains, but I never see an admiral or general. Then again, why would you? They are on their Gulfstream Vs, jetting around. 
   I am not saying there is never a purpose--there may be--but I think this is just a little bit too much. There are about 36 four-star officers in the U.S. military, I am told--about 36 four-star officers--and for that, we have over 154 jets in inventory to fly people around. What is going on here? 
   In fact, I know our proposal only deals with the Gulfstreams, but if I am not mistaken, the bill also provides for the purchase of five additional C-35s.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Those are the Cessnas. We are already going to buy five of these, and we are going to lease six more of the Gulfstream Vs. So it is not just the Gulfstream Vs. The Navy already has six Gulfstreams, the Air Force already has Gulfstreams, and, as I said, 70 Learjets, C-21s. 
   I remember one time when I went on a congressional trip--was I still in the House or the Senate? I can't remember. I may have been in the Senate. We went to Central America. It was during that war in Central America. 
   We flew from here to Florida, to MacDill, refueled, and we were in a little Lear. There were about six or seven of us crammed into that thing with no bathroom. But obviously, because of my Senate duties, I had to get down there to go on a trip that could not be done commercially. So we went from here to MacDill, refueled, then went to Guatemala and Honduras; and then I think we went to El Salvador; then we went to Panama City, had to refuel again, fly to MacDill, refuel again, and then fly home. 
   I tell you, it was not that comfortable a flight if you are one of those in a little Lear, six or seven people crammed in there. For a Senator, that is fine. I bet you a general or admiral would never do that. But we had staff. We had committee staff along with us. 
   I am just saying, sometimes if you are going to do these things, sometimes you have to put up with that. There is no way I could have done it commercially, so I had to take a military aircraft. You do not have to go in elaborate luxury every single time. 
   That is my point. I do not think there is a critical shortage of these executive jets that should take precedence over the immediate needs of our military. 
   Besides the sheer numbers of aircraft in each of the armed services indicating there is no shortfall, again, I repeat from the 1995 GAO report that said the armed services should ``develop the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the availability of each service's aircraft to help fulfill the OSA needs of the other services.'' In other words, the GAO concluded the armed services needed to learn to share. This is a simple concept that should be used to relieve any conceivable strain on the number of executive aircraft. 
   The Pentagon counters this sensible solution by claiming that existing aircraft are being fully used. However, the GAO also found that DOD's operational support aircraft fleet ``far exceeds any possible wartime requirement.'' 
   The Defense Week article that the Senator from California referred to of May 24, 1999, had some interesting things in it. They said:  
   In particular, the article said, ``There are about 600 to 800 users in the DC area authorized to request SAM [VIP Special Air Mission] support for missions'' which meet prescribed criteria.  
   As I understand, that does not include Senators and Congressmen. At least that is what I am told. When I first read there are 600 to 800 authorized users for VIP special air missions, I thought that must include the 435 Members of the House and the 100 Senators. I am told that is not so. 
   I am wondering, who are these 600 to 800 people? I am wondering if some of  these jets are being used for less than really vital needs and perhaps could be used to meet the needs of the military CINCs. 
   Again, quoting from the Defense Week article of May 24:  
   Brig. Gen. Arthur Lichte, the Air Force's director of global-reach programs, says these support aircraft are all meeting other requirements [all these other aircraft that we have in inventory] so [they] could not be used by the commanders.  
   Again, I am wondering, why not? What are these other requirements? If the commanders cannot use them, who is using them?  
   Hamre says most of these support aircraft are too small for commanders' staffs. Plus, the four-stars need to be able to fly non-stop intercontinental trips while staying in contact with the president.  
   I am not so certain about that. I am not certain that a refueling stop in Shannon is all that burdensome. 
   The article goes on to say:  
   Some on Capitol Hill respond that the CINCs could get by with smaller staffs on board and could live with refueling stops, but Hamre and Lichte don't agree.  
   I do not know why not. I know a lot of times we go on congressional factfinding trips. We stop and refuel different places. I don't know why generals can't. They can still be in contact. That does not stop your contact with the White House, simply because you land and refuel--not at all.  
   What about the existing support fleet? 
   ``No,'' Hamre said, ``we don't have aircraft that can fly from here to the Persian Gulf. I suppose you could go on a C-12. You could island-hop like you did in World War II, but I mean that doesn't make any sense. This big inventory of 500 [operational support aircraft]--most of them are tiny airplanes, four-passenger, six-passenger kind of airplanes.''  
   That is just not so. These are not four-passenger airplanes.

   Mr. HARKIN. These are eight right here. How much staff does a general have to take with him when he goes to a meeting? I would like to find that out. 
   He said, ``The CINCs aren't [even] happy they have to live with a 12 passenger aircraft.'' 
   Again I ask, how much staff do they need to take to these 
   meetings they go to? 
   So, again, the Senator from California and I have this amendment that says basically: We ought to put this lease aside. Let's take a look at this. Let's get a good report in. Do these really meet the warmaking needs of the Pentagon? 
   Plus, I do not know where the facts lie on this one, but I will just say that, according to the New York Times, the lease will cost the taxpayers more than $475 million over 10 years. Purchasing the planes may prove cheaper. Some say purchasing is going to cost more; some say it will cost less. But we do know that for these aircraft, for the cost of the aircraft, plus the operation of them over the next 10 years, it is going to come in at somewhere---- 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-15-19990608</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I think the lease is going to cost over $475 million. And then there are operational costs. Now you are up to $600 or $700 million over the next 10 years just for these aircraft. That may be small change to the Pentagon, which is used to operating with $270 billion budgets, but that is a lot of money for our taxpayers. I just do not know where the facts lie in whether or not leasing is better than purchasing. 
   We have seen very little information as to the cost tradeoffs of leasing versus purchasing. We have not seen a full report from the Pentagon covering all possible options to cover these CINCs' needs, nor do we have much information as to the needs of the military for all of these such aircraft. That is why our amendment requires a report detailing the requirements and options for such aircraft as an important first step. We do not have that. 
   Quite frankly, regardless of how our amendment fares, I say to the chairman, and others, I plan to come back to this issue, along with my colleague from California, year after year, until we get a clearer picture. How many flights do senior officers take with senior executive aircraft? We do not even know that. What are the costs? What are the per-hour costs? What are the costs for that trip? Could that trip have been utilized with an alternative such as commercial aircraft? At what cost savings? Could some of these aircraft be sold off as excess aircraft if we better managed the total number of executive aircraft that we have? 
   For example, we know that senior officials and officers fly from base to base and facility to facility. They fly from Andrews Air Force Base to NAS Jacksonville or to MacDill or to other air bases around the country. Could you utilize commercial aircraft for that? Sometimes yes; sometimes no. But we need to ensure that the DOD is looking for cheaper alternatives, including commercial airline alternatives. It may be slightly less convenient, but it sure would be a lot less costly, and it would free up existing DOD aircraft we have now for the unique missions for which they say they are needed. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska has made a good point that the military should consider leasing and not consider purchasing. That is what our amendment does. Read our amendment. It says:  
   Not later than March 1, 2000, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the inventory and status of operational support aircraft, Commander-in-Chief support aircraft, and command support aircraft of the Department of Defense. The report shall include a detailed discussion of the requirements for such aircraft, the foreseeable future requirements for such aircraft, the cost of leasing such aircraft, commercial alternatives to use of such aircraft, the cost of maintaining the aircraft, the capability and appropriateness of the aircraft to fulfill mission requirements, and the relevancy of the missions of the aircraft to warfighting requirements.  
   That is exactly what our amendment does. But we want to know, should we even lease them?

<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-19-19990608</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. It strikes the provision which allows the Department of Department to go ahead and lease. It says: Let's do a study before next March 1. What are our requirements? What are our alternatives? And let's examine the leasing versus the purchasing. We don't even have that documentation yet. 
   So I don't think there is such a need that we have to rush ahead and allow them to go ahead and enter these long-term leasing agreements before March 1 of next year. There is not that requirement there. They tried to put this into the supplemental appropriations bill, and that was knocked out because it wasn't an emergency. Now they have come back on the regular appropriations bill. 
   So all our amendment is saying, fine, leasing may be the best way to proceed, but we haven't gotten to that point yet. Do we even need these aircraft? We haven't gotten to that point yet. I make the point that I am not certain we need this. Let's take it one step at a time and see if these are really operational requirements. 
   The Senator also said that it would be costly; we have these old aircraft in inventory we have to repair and keep them up and put new engines in them and all that stuff. It is sort of like my old car. I have an old car, and it needs a new engine. 
   I can put a new engine in that car, and it is going to cost me about $1,300. The car runs fine. In fact, it is a pretty darned nice car. It is just a little old and has a lot of miles on it. If I go out and buy a new car, it will cost me about $20,000. I ask you, which is the better alternative, if I am looking at it costwise? It is a lot cheaper for me to put a new engine in that old car. 
   These are 30-year-old, well-maintained aircraft. They are the best maintained aircraft in the world. They go through their periodic inspections, their 100-hour inspections, their annual inspections, and they have all kinds of new engines on them and everything. It is much cheaper to keep those flying, to repair them, and to keep them up than it is to go out and pay $40 million for one of these, I can assure you. 
   Second, my last point: The chairman says that this will not affect the number of aircraft that we have out there now. I beg to differ. It will affect the number of aircraft we have out there now, because if in fact the amendment of the Senator from California and myself is adopted, it is going to require them to take a really hard look at what they have in their inventory, at what their needs are, and at how they can better utilize them. That may affect the other aircraft out there. We may be able to meet the mission requirements of the CINCs with all of the Gulfstreams, the Learjets, the Citation jets, the 707s, the 757s, the 727s, and the DC-9s that we have out there if they are better utilized. That is the missing ingredient. We don't have that kind of an accounting. That is what our amendment calls for. 
   If it turns out that they really need these aircraft to meet the warmaking capabilities, and it proves that it is cheaper to do it this way than to repair and fix up the older aircraft--if that can be shown--I will be first in line to vote to make sure they get the aircraft. 
   But I am telling you, this Senator does not have adequate information right now to vote to spend probably upwards of $600 million to $700 million over the next 10 years to lease these Gulfstream Vs and operate them for that period of time. 
   That is why we need to just step back, take a deep breath, and have them to report back. One year is not going to be a big loss to them, if they have to wait one year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, as an old military pilot myself, I must say that if the generals want to get someplace in a real hurry--it may be necessary--and if it is part of our warmaking capabilities, they can get in the back seat of an F-16, get inflight fueling, and they can be there a lot faster than any commercial aircraft or a Gulfstream or anything else. That is the fastest way to get there.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to speak about the Civil Air Patrol, a unique group of volunteer civilian airmen and others, who support this nation in a variety of ways. 
   CAP members represent a cross-section of America and include pilots, emergency medical technicians, and teachers who use their professional skills to provide emergency services, youth programs, and aerospace education. Its more than 60,000 senior and cadet members are located in small towns and large cities across this country. Day in and day out, its aircrews fly search and rescue, disaster relief, counter-drug and Air Force operational support missions while teachers and others run a youth program for thousands of cadets and support aerospace education programs in hundreds of schools. 
   CAP began its service to the nation under very unusual circumstances. As World War II approached, civilian pilots began to look for ways to help with the expected war effort. They organized together as an air arm of the Office of Civil Defense and, in the first months of the war, they were quick to respond as ships were torpedoed within sight of land. During a period when we lacked the Army and Navy aircraft needed to patrol thousands of square miles off our coasts looking for German submarines, the CAP was there. 
   Flying their own aircraft, sometimes using automobile inner tubes for life preservers, CAP pilots did what the military could not, find enemy submarines in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. They spotted so many submarines, in fact, that they finally convinced the military that they should be armed. At first they simply carried the bombs on their laps and dropped them out the door of the aircraft, later they improvised homemade bomb aiming sights and put bomb racks under their Beech, Fairchild, Sikorsky, and Stinson aircraft. It was over a year and a half before the military could accomplish this mission without CAP's help. 
   By July of 1943, CAP pilots had flown over 24 million miles on anti-submarine combat missions and had spotted and reported the location of 173 submarines to the military. CAP itself attacked 57 of those submarines and sank or damaged two. Hundreds of survivors from sunk ships and military  aircraft crashes (at sea) were rescued as part of CAP's anti-submarine patrol efforts. Twenty-six CAP volunteer lives and 90 aircraft were lost on these civilian-flown combat missions. 
   CAP's World War II service also set the foundation for its modern day service to America. During the war, CAP became a part of the Army Air Force and flew hundreds of thousands of hours nationwide on border patrol, search and rescue, forest fire watch, target-towing, courier flights, and military training exercises. It began its cadet program to help the military recruit young Americans and to teach them about aviation. These were invaluable missions that contributed greatly to the war effort. Many of the same missions and the tradition of service established then, continues today. 
   Today, CAP again flies support missions off the coast of America in support of another kind of war, the war against drugs. Since 1985, CAP has flown hundreds of thousands of hours in support of the U.S. Customs, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and other federal and local law enforcement agencies. CAP aircrews fly reconnaissance, communications relay, and transport missions which take place over water along the 12-mile territorial limit, along the nation's borders, and in most of the 50 states. 
   The cost to the taxpayer is very little as CAP aircraft are flown by volunteer aircrews for about $55 a hour. Aircrew members donate their time, often using their own personal leave from work to fly these missions. They provide essential support to the government, which would cost the taxpayer, even if the government had the pilots and aircraft to use, up to $2,000 an hour. In 1998 alone, Civil Air Patrol flew 41,721 hours in support of counter-drug efforts. 
   CAP also flies and conducts more traditional missions. While it is the official auxiliary of the Air Force, it also performs numerous emergency services missions, youth programs and aerospace education programs in support of states and local communities across this nation. It's pilots routinely fly about 85 percent of all the search and rescue hours flown in the United States. Whether searching for a lost child in a state park or looking for downed military aviator, Civil Air Patrol is there. In 1998, Civil Air Patrol conducted 3,155 search and rescue missions and saved 116 lives. CAP also supports local communities and states during time of disaster. In 1998, during a period lasting weeks, hundreds of CAP members in drought-stricken Florida and Texas flew emergency fire watch while others maintained airborne communications relay stations, around the clock, supporting fire fighters on the ground. As recently as three weeks ago, when the Oklahoma tornadoes killed 45, CAP aerial and ground units quickly joined with community and state disaster relief efforts. Other emergency and humanitarian missions include flood surveillance, tornado and hurricane reconnaissance, blood collection and distribution flights, and the emergency airlift of medical material. 
   Over 26,000 young people participate in CAP's growing cadet program where they not only have opportunities to fly, but they too learn discipline, leadership and public service skills. Not only are many of these cadets model citizens but they help their communities and states during times of emergency. Indeed, during CAP's emergency operations cadets operate many of its radios and make up the bulk of its ground rescue units. The cadet program also includes local unit activities, physical fitness, leadership laboratories, aerospace education, and moral leadership. A wide range of annual special cadet activities include nationwide flight encampments where cadets each summer, working with adult flight instructors, learn how to fly powered aircraft and gliders. In 1998, 180 young men and women learned how to fly at these encampments. CAP also conducts nearly 200 aerospace education workshops that reach over 5,000 educators annually and routinely provides Air Force ROTC and CAP cadets in a series of orientation flights--over 17,500 in 1998--to introduce them to modern aviation. 
   It is impossible to adequately capture the essence of the Civil Air Patrol in just a few short words, however, I hope it is clear that the CAP is a unique organization that touches Americans at all levels. While it is the official auxiliary of the Air Force, it is also a benevolent, civilian non-profit corporation 
   chartered by Congress to support emergency service and educational organizations such as the American Red Cross, all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as well as thousands of local communities across the nation. Its more than 50,000 members, 1,700 squadrons, 535 light aircraft and thousands of communications stations stand ready to support not only the Air Force and other Federal agencies but all the citizens of the United States, no matter where they live. Civil Air Patrol does this valuable humanitarian and public service mission 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with little or no fan fare. Its volunteers deserve our thanks and appreciation.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. 
   I ask, where is the sense in doing this? Again, I am not going to say we should not make some changes in the Civil Air Patrol. I believe some changes are warranted. I have been involved in this a long time. I am not going to say I have all the knowledge on exactly how to do it, but I believe we ought to bring the Air Force and Civil Air Patrol together and hammer this thing out. We need hearings, a GAO investigation, an IG investigation, and then let's do it in a logical manner, in a manner which really is going to keep the civilian nature of the Civil Air Patrol and even make it better than it is today. I believe that can be done. 
   That is why I am so strongly supportive of the Allard amendment. I think it takes that kind of a commonsense, logical approach to improve and make the Civil Air Patrol even better in the next century. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. HARKIN. I think maybe we are going to reach a good resolution on this and accept the amendment. I have no problems with a voice vote. That is fine. I know the Senator from Oklahoma is sincere. We have talked about this. He has been involved in the Civil Air Patrol for a long time. I believe we can work this out. Again, I hope we can do it in a logical approach. 
   I have to chide my friend from Oklahoma a little bit here on reading a letter on the web. I say to my friend that I know there are probably disgruntled people in the CAP, like in the Air Force or anywhere else. 
   We are going to get those kinds of letters. 
   Again, I just repeat for the sake of emphasis that the best way to do that is to get the IG to look into the darned thing and see what type of basis there is on that. I just want to add in my little time remaining that I really want to examine, perhaps, this oversight board. 
   The Air Force wanted to have a military oversight board. I personally don't think that is the way to go. For the Civil Air Patrol, I agree, the present structure of the board is not right. I want to say that publicly to my friend from Oklahoma. That is not right. But I hope to work with him in thinking about an oversight board that would be more akin to the civilian oversight board of the academies or something like that, or maybe Congress would appoint some and the President would appoint some where we would have a blend of civilians with the background that would give them the kind of knowledge they need to have an oversight of the Civil Air Patrol. 
   I hope that might be a better way of proceeding on an oversight board to keep it in civilian hands, but to do it in the way that is not the present structure of how the board is set up, which I, quite frankly, think invites a lot of problems, the way the board is set up with the commander. I am willing to work on that. I think we can work that out, but to have some kind of a civilian oversight board. 
   Again, I appreciate the debate we have had. I think we all are very justly proud of the Civil Air Patrol and what they have done in the past. I really believe that in the future, with drug interdiction, with national disasters, the Civil Air Patrol will continue to play a vital role in our society. Plus, I also want to work with my friend from Oklahoma and my friend from Colorado. 
   I have been trying for a long time to beef up the cadet program in the Civil Air Patrol. We need to strengthen the cadet program. These inner-city kids especially are looking for things to do. They need some order. They need some structure and discipline in their lives.  This is what the Civil Air Patrol can do for them. It will help build up our summer camps where these kids get to go for a couple of weeks. They can learn some technology and get some discipline and order in their lives. They can wear a uniform of which they can be proud. Believe me. I think we ought to do more to strengthen and to build up the cadet program in the Civil Air Patrol. I think it would be one of the best things we could do for the future of our country. 
   Again, I appreciate all the work that Senator ALLARD has done on this. I have talked to so many Democrats on my side who are supporting the Allard amendment. I believe there is overwhelming support on both sides for this approach. 
   Again, if we want to have a voice vote on it, that is fine with me. 
   I thank my colleague from Colorado. 
   I thank my friend from Oklahoma. I think he has done a service here by at least highlighting the problem and pointing out that we have to do something. We may have disagreed a little bit on how to do it, but that is normal. I think now we are set on a course that is really going to improve and make the Civil Air Patrol even better. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to briefly speak on an amendment I offered today that was accepted by unanimous consent in the Defense authorization bill. My amendment will address an unfulfilled obligation to our nation's veterans. The problem is a substantial backlog of requests by veterans for replacement and issuance of military medals. At a time when our troops are engaged overseas, and with the Memorial Day weekend approaching, it is all the more important to ensure we are recognizing the sacrifices of our veterans. 
   Believe it or not, it can take years for veterans to receive medals earned through their service to our nation. My state offices are involved in a number of current cases where veterans have been waiting two to three years for medals they earned, but were never awarded. While my staff and I pursue these cases aggressively, the reality is that no amount of pressure and follow-through can overcome what is essentially a resource problem. 
   The medal issue revolves around a huge backlog of requests. The personnel centers, which process applications for the separate services for never-issued awards and replacement medals, have accumulated huge backlogs of requests by veterans. In one personnel center alone, 98,000 requests have been allowed to back up, resulting in years of waiting time. These time delays have denied veterans across the nation the medals and honors they have rightfully earned through heroic actions. 
   Let me briefly share the story of Mr. Dale Holmes, a Korean War veteran. I have shared this story on the floor before, but I think it bears repeating. Mr. Holmes fired a mortar on the front lines of the Korean War. Stacy Groff, the daughter of Mr. Holmes, tried unsuccessfully for three years on her own, through the normal Department of Defense channels, to get the medals her father earned and deserved. Ms. Groff turned to me after her letter writing produced no results. My office began an inquiry in January of 1997 and we were not able to resolve this issue favorably until September 1997. 
   Ms. Groff made a statement about the delays that sum up my sentiments perfectly: ``I don't think it's fair. My dad deserves, everybody deserves, better treatment than that.'' Ms. Groff could not be more correct. Our veterans deserve better from the country they served so courageously. 
   DOD claims that it does not have the people or resources to speed up the process. But it would not take much to make a dent in the problem. For example, the Navy Liaison Office was averaging a relatively quick turnaround time of only four to five months when it had five personnel working cases. Now that it has only three people in the office, it is having a hard time keeping up with the crush of requests. DOD must make putting more resources towards this problem a priority. However, it seems like the same old story--our government forgets the  sacrifices servicemen and women have made as soon as they leave military duty. We can do better. 
   Last year, during the debate over the FY99 Defense Appropriations bill, the Senate passed my amendment urging the DOD to end the backlog of unfulfilled military medal requests. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has not moved to fix the problem. In fact, according to my information, the problem has worsened. 
   Therefore, here I am again. My amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish and carry out a plan to make available the funds and resources necessary to eliminate the backlog in decoration requests. 
   Specifically, my amendment says the Secretary of Defense shall make available to the Army Reserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Air Force Personnel Center, the National Archives and Records Administration, and any other relevant office or command, the resources necessary to solve the problem. These resources could be in the form of increased personnel, equipment or whatever these offices need for this problem. 
   My amendment also directs that funding and resources should not come at the expense of other personnel service and support activities within DOD. It is a commonsense approach which will allow DOD to structure a quick and direct solution to the problem. 
   Our veterans are not asking for much. Their brave actions in time of war deserve our highest respect, recognition, and admiration. My amendment will help expedite the recognition they so richly deserve. Our veterans deserve nothing less. 
   I thank the Veterans of Foreign Wars for strongly supporting this amendment. Their support meant a great deal to my efforts. 
   I thank the managers of the Defense Authorization bill, Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN, for their cooperation and understanding in agreeing to accept this important amendment. 
   While this is only a small change to the Defense authorization bill, it will send a clear message to our Nation's veterans and active duty personnel: we recognize and value the sacrifices you have made on our behalf.

   Mr. HARKIN. 
   Mr. President, today I am introducing important legislation to assist rural America, the Rural Telecommunications Improvement Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by our distinguished Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, as well as Senators DORGAN, BAUCUS, CONRAD, WELLSTONE, JOHNSON, WYDEN, REID, KERREY, ROCKEFELLER and MURRAY. I would like to thank each of them for joining me in this effort to promote the interests of rural America within the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
   Our legislation will establish an Office of Rural Advocacy within the FCC to promote access to advanced telecommunications in rural areas. The Rural Advocate will be responsible for focusing the Commission's attention on the importance of rural areas to the future of American prosperity, as well as on ensuring that Universal Service provisions mandated by the Communications Act and the Telecommunications Act are being met and implemented. 
   Our proposal is modeled on the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, which has been very successful in promoting the interests of small business within the U.S. government. 
   Under our bill, the Office of Rural Advocacy will have 9 chief responsibilities: 
   To promote access to advanced telecommunications service for populations in the rural United States; 
   To develop proposals to better fulfill the commitment of the Federal Government to universal service and access to advanced telecommunications services in rural areas; 
   To assess the effectiveness of existing Federal programs for providers of telecommunications services in rural areas; 
   To measure the costs and other effects of Federal regulations on telecommunication carriers in rural areas; 
   To determine the effect of Federal tax laws on providers of telecommunications services in rural areas; 
   To serve as a focal point for the receipt of complaints, criticisms and suggestions concerning policies and activities of any department or agency of the Federal Government which affect the receipt of telecommunications services in rural areas; 
   To counsel providers of telecommunications services in rural areas; 
   To represent the views and interests of rural populations and providers of telecommunications services in rural areas; and 
   To enlist the cooperation and assistance of public and private agencies, businesses, and other organizations in providing information about the telecommunications programs and services of the Federal Government which benefit rural areas and telecommunications companies. 
   Mr. President, such an office within the FCC is needed for one very important reason, no bureau or Commissioner at the FCC has as an institutional role with the responsibility to promote the interests of rural telecommunications. The FCC has a great number of issues to consider due to the ever changing role of communications. 
   Our legislation will ensure the FCC has the resources necessary to focus the Commission's attention on rural issues and will help establish an agenda at the FCC to address rural America's telecommunications needs, something the Commission has not done in the recent past. For example, the FCC's report on Advanced Telecommunications Services stated ``deployment of advanced telecommunications generally appear, at present, reasonable and timely.'' I can tell you Mr. President, this is not the case in Iowa where, according to the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB), approximately 8% of our exchanges have no access to the Internet. Additionally, access in many rural areas is of low speed and poor quality. This doesn't even include access to broadband, or high-speed Internet access, which is not available in numerous rural areas and small towns in Iowa and across the country. 
   Other examples of the FCC's lack of focus on rural issues include a failure to understand how rural telephone cooperatives interact with their members, such as preventing rural telephone cooperatives from calling members to check on long distance preference changes, and an FCC definition that establishes a 3000 hertz level of basic voice grade service, when such a low level prevents Internet access on longer loops in rural areas. 
   In order to effectively influence policy on rural telecommunications, this legislation gives the Rural Advocate the rank of a bureau chief within the FCC. The Rural Advocate will also have the authority to file comments or reports on any matter before the Federal Government affecting rural telecommunications without having to clear the testimony with the OMB or the FCC. Additionally, the Rural Advocate can file reports with the Administration, Congress and the FCC to recommend legislation or changes in policy. Finally, the Rural Advocate will be appointed directly by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 
   Mr. President, in short, this legislation would allow rural America to enter the fast lane of the Information Superhighway. Again, thank you to my colleagues who have joined me in sponsoring this proposal. I urge all Senators to consider joining us in moving this initiative forward.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just say that being for or against this bill is basically a tossup, as far as I am concerned. It is one of those 51-49 types of propositions. So that is how I am going to come down on the 51-percent side, and vote for the conference report. 
   First of all, this is not a time to indicate anything less than full support for our troops in Kosovo and the surrounding areas. 
   There is also in this conference report some much-needed farm assistance and disaster assistance for the United States and Central America. However, I must say there are parts of the bill to which I register my stiff opposition. 
   First, this bill forfeits the opportunity to ensure that tobacco settlement money is used to fight smoking and to promote health--that is not in here. In fact, just the opposite. 
   Second, the bill provides only a fraction of critically and urgently needed farm assistance. Let me just talk for a moment about that subject. 
   This is an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We take care of emergencies in Central America and other places. But one of the very biggest emergencies facing us today is the emergency in American agriculture. Export prospects are dismal. Exports for this year are projected to fall to $49 billion, which is a 19-percent decline from 1996. Asia still hasn't recovered. Net farm income for major commodities could drop to $17 billion compared to an average of $23 billion a year for the previous 5 years. Net farm income for major field crops will be 27 percent below what it was for the last 5 years. 
   It is true that there is some farm assistance in this package, and I was pleased to work with my colleagues to get it in the bill. But it is not enough, and it is too late. 
   The White House sent up the supplemental appropriations request for additional farm loan funds and Farm Service Agency funding on February 26. Now here we are just getting to it, nearly three months later. 
   This money was critically and urgently needed for the planting season. Now we are just getting around to it, even though the planting season is well over halfway past. The farm assistance that we have in the bill is good. Sure, an aspirin is good, if you have a major illness and you have some pain. But it doesn't get to the real root cause of it, and neither does the assistance in this bill. It falls far short of what is needed. 
   I offered an amendment in the conference committee to address the deepening crisis in the farm economy. The amendment addressed a range of farm income problems in the crop, livestock and dairy sectors, and it dealt with agriculture's economic crisis around our nation, not just in one or two regions. Regrettably, that amendment failed on a 14-14 tie vote of Senate conferees. 
   The amendment lacked just one vote. So we will be back again on whatever measures we can get up on the floor this year to provide critically and urgently needed economic assistance to our farm families and our rural communities. 
   All I can say is that when it came to the issue of Kosovo, we were willing to meet our obligations and respond to the emergency. In fact, the conferees had no trouble coming up with $5 billion more than what was asked for in  military spending. But we couldn't come up with the money needed to help our beleaguered farmers and the rural economy. 
   Finally, I also want to say a word about offsets for this bill. For the small portion of the bill that is offset, there was a beeline to go after programs that are vital to the most vulnerable in our society: food stamps and housing. Hunger and poverty remain persistent and pervasive problems in our society. Now we know these rescissions are not genuine offsets, since there are not outlay reductions associated with them. So perhaps there is no harm, but clearly these offsets should not lay the groundwork or create a precedent for future rescissions that actually reduce program benefits. 
   Again, on the whole, I will vote for the conference report. 
   I just want to register my objections to two major portions of the conference report, farm assistance and tobacco, which I consider to be totally inadequate. 
   I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.

I have been more than willing to set everything aside and to let the process go ahead since yesterday. But I must tell you that since yesterday I have been waiting to get at least 15 to 20 minutes where I could just lay out my  case on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment on IDEA, the background of it. I just believe I have to. I want to be able to fully make my case against the amendment. I do not want to take a lot of time, I do not want to filibuster it, but I would like to have 15 or 20 minutes just to lay out my case. That is all.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know the recent school tragedies--again, even another this very morning--are a call to action to us as families and churches and schools, as communities, as leaders in government, to take positive, constructive steps to make our schools places of learning and not of fear. But let's not use these tragedies of Littleton and other schools to take emotional, 
   unfounded--although well-intentioned-actions which actually will make our schools and communities more unsafe and less secure. 
   I want to make this point very, very clear. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous amendment. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment guts IDEA. It actually will make our communities and our schools more unsafe. 
   The purpose of this bill is to help make our schools and communities safer. That is the purpose of the bill in front of us. I must ask, is putting a child with a disability on the street and cutting off all services to that child something that will make our communities more safe? Frankly, it will have the opposite effect. 
   This amendment, would, for example, lead to a child with an emotional disturbance being put on the street and end the counseling and behavioral modification services they had been receiving--end, them, cold turkey. No more counseling or behavioral modification services. And this kid is now on the street. Tell me, is that community safer? Obviously not, but that is just what this amendment would lead to. Troubled children out on the street with no supervision, no tracking, no education, no mental health services. 
   This amendment targets a group of students who are more likely to be victims of school violence than perpetrators. Again I want to point out: Not any of the nine--now nine school shootings--in the last 39 months was done by a child in special education. Not one. Yet we have this amendment that targets kids with disabilities. This amendment is scapegoating--and I use that word, ``scapegoating''--scapegoating kids with disability. And it is destroying an important safety feature of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
   The supporters of the amendment say they need it because the law erected barriers that kept them from taking students who had guns in their possession out of schools. We showed yesterday--and the authors of this amendment agreed with me on this point--that a child with a disability who brings a gun to a school can be removed from that school immediately, just like any other child. We settled that yesterday. For a kid with a disability who brings a gun or firearm to school, right now, the principal can call up the sheriff or the police. They can come haul him away, book him, put him in jail, whatever the law is. 
   So I hope no Senator votes on this amendment thinking that under the law as it exists today, a kid with a disability who comes to school with a gun can't be kicked out immediately. That is simply not true. Nothing in Federal law limits them from immediately removing him and keeping him out as long as that child is a threat to himself or others. Let me repeat that, the school can remove that child immediately and keep them in an alternative setting indefinitely as long as that child is a threat to himself or others. It couldn't be more clear than that. 
   We worked long and hard, 3 years of hearings, hammering out the IDEA bill in 1997. And we passed it here in the Senate by a vote of 98 to 1, 98 to 1. We have had no hearings on this amendment, none whatsoever. But we had plenty of hearings to set up a framework in IDEA to make sure our schools and communities were safe. First, we wanted to make sure the schools were safe. Second, we wanted to make sure the communities were safe. Third, we wanted to make sure students with disabilities were held accountable for their actions and that schools have the flexibility to take appropriate and timely actions. Last, we wanted to make sure that decisions were based on facts relevant to the child, not just on emotions. 
   Right now under the law, school authorities can unilaterally remove a child with a disability, first of all, for the first 10 days, and provide no services whatsoever. Second, if it is found that their actions were not a manifestation of their disability, then of course he is treated in the same manner as nondisabled children, and can be kept out in an alternative setting forever. 
   If it is found by that the child's action was a manifestation of their disability, that child then is put into an alternative setting for up to 45 days. That alternative setting is determined by the local school districts. 
   Now we heard yesterday that after 45 days the kid will be put back in school. That is just not so--only if he or she is no longer a danger. If that kid continues to pose a danger to himself or others, the school can repeat that 45 days again and again and again--for as long as it deems necessary. 
   Finally, as I said, there is no way the law prohibits anyone from calling the police to come take any student out who has a gun. I also want to point out, IDEA specifically provides that school officials may obtain a court order anytime to remove a child with a disability from school or to change a child's current educational placement if they believe that maintaining the child in the current educational placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. So it is clear, current law addresses the issue. Frankly, we have a commonsense structure now. And, again, it was carefully designed to make schools and communities safer. 
   The Senator from Missouri yesterday put up a chart showing the manifestation determination process, how you  have to go through all these processes. Why do we do that? He made it seem like it was some bureaucratic maze, or jungle. The reason that we have this manifestation determination is so we can address the behavior of the child with the disability, to determine why that child acted the way the child did, and then to have the proper interventions so that child does not behave that way in the future. That's just common sense and it should not be eliminated as this amendment would do. 
   Who does that process help, and who does that protect? Does it not protect the school? Does it not protect the local community? Of course, it does. If we can intervene and provide the proper kind of psychological help, maybe even medical help, educational help so that the child with a disability modifies his or her behavior, it seems to me that is what we want. 
   Or are we saying under the Frist-Ashcroft amendment: We do not care; if a kid with a disability brings a gun to school, we do not care about that behavior; kick him out, put him out on the street, cut off all his services? 
   Is that going to make our community safer? Is that going to make our schools safer? Is that going to protect students? If there is a question about that in anyone's mind, I point to the fact that the shooting in Oregon where students were tragically killed was committed by a kid who had been suspended without services from school. He went home, got a gun, and came back to school. I ask, what if a child in that circumstance was put in an alternative setting with supervision, with appropriate psychological help, behavior modification, supporting services? Would that kid have gone home to get the gun and come back to school? I think the odds would have been great that that kid would not. But instead he was put on the street unsupervised--just as this amendment allows for. That is the ``level playing field'' the supporters of this amendment advocate. 
   Mr. President, that is why over 500 police leaders from this country are opposed to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from Fight Crime, Invest in Kids. The board of directors includes the president of the Fraternal Order of Police. It encompasses 500 police leaders--many of them the police chiefs in major cities from around the country. It says in part:  
   ..... we urge you to oppose the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, and support the [amendment] to be offered by Senator Harkin.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, these are the policemen talking. Do you know why they are saying this? Because they know if Frist-Ashcroft is adopted, they are going to dump these kids on the streets--kids with problems, emotional problems, kids with mental problems and behavioral problems, kids who are mentally retarded and may have other problems. They are going to dump them out on the street. That is safe? That is going to make our schools and our communities safe? Please, someone tell me how that is so. That is why the police are opposed to this amendment. 
   I will read a portion of another statement:  
   As police chiefs in America's largest cities, we know that investments today to help kids get the right start are among America's most powerful weapons against crime. Quality child care, parenting, coaching, and afterschool programs can help kids learn the values and skills they need to become good neighbors instead of criminals. We, therefore, call on all our public officials to adopt the policies described in Fight Crime, Invest in Kids. Help schools identify troubled and disruptive children and provide children and their parents with the counseling and training that can help get the kids back on track.  
   These are not social scientists; these are policemen from around the country. 
   Let me also read from the testimony of the Police Executive Research Forum--a leading national organization of police chiefs and senior law enforcement officials. Gil Kerlikowski, who at the time was president of this group and the police chief in Buffalo, New York testified at a recent congressional hearing on this topic. He said:  
   Students who are expelled or suspended from school and left at home or on the street become my problem, and the problem of police across this country. They have greater opportunity to commit crimes, abuse drugs, or engage in disorderly behavior that affects the quality of life in any given neighborhood. They are also vulnerable to gangs and predators who can victimize and exploit them in ways that will impede any later efforts to put them on the right track. Today's police forces are ill-prepared to deal with these individuals--the rest of the criminal justice system even less so.  
   I also have a letter from the Correctional Educational Association again stating that the Frist-Ashcroft amendment is more dangerous to our schools and our communities.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Council for Exceptional Children saying:  
   While we ..... strongly support the removal of a student who endangers the safety or well-being of themselves or other students, we strongly oppose the cessation of services for any student.  
   The Frist-Ashcroft amendment ceases those services. What they say is that the school districts may provide the services--may. We already heard one Senator yesterday say how much this costs. It may cost too much, and schools will say: It costs too much money; we are not going to do it; let somebody else provide the services. And the kid falls through the cracks. That is what happens. 
   If you do not think the police know what they are talking about or the Council for Exceptional Children or the Correctional Education Association, how about the Parent Teacher Association? Do you honestly believe that the National PTA wants more dangerous schools? Here is a letter from the National PTA strongly--strongly--opposing the Frist-Ashcroft amendment:  
   The National PTA supports Sens. Ashcroft's and Frist's goal of keeping children safe in school. Their amendment, however, would allow for the expulsion of special education students who possess a handgun in school, without ensuring alternative education services are provided. National PTA supports removing students who bring guns to school, but believes students should receive education services in an alternative setting. 
   National PTA supports Senator Harkin's amendment, which clarifies that schools have the authority to remove any child who brings a gun to school [and continues to provide them services].

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   There is no loophole here. The equity they keep talking about is an equity for danger. We keep hearing they are for safety in schools. We all are for safety, of course. 
   Why is the National PTA opposed to this amendment? Why are 500 police leaders around the country opposed to this amendment? Why is the National Association of the State Boards of Education opposed to this amendment? Because they all know that the amendment we are about to vote on is a recipe for disaster. 
   It will increase crime. It will increase drug use. It will increase the dropout rate. Why? I am really disappointed that anyone would say that we can take these kids who have severe problems, kick them out of school and cut off all supporting services and make communities safer. The police chiefs who have to deal with the aftermath know better. That is why they are opposed to this amendment. We know more than they do, and the Parent Teacher Association? Why are they opposed to the Ashcroft-Frist amendment? Because they realize it is a formula for disaster. That is what it is. 
   This is a dangerous, dangerous amendment and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against it. 
   Mr. President, after the vote on this amendment--by unanimous consent--the Senate will adopt the Harkin amendment. This is an amendment I have drafted and is cosponsored by the distinguished ranking member of the HELP committee, Senator KENNEDY. Our amendment is supported by the police and other groups who oppose the Frist-Ashcroft amendment because it would make schools and communities safer. I'd like to say a few words about it and its intent. 
   Passage of our amendment is very important. It is very important, because it requires that all children--whether they have a disability or not--are not just dumped in the streets after they commit an act of violence, including bringing a gun or firearm to school. Our amendment would require that schools provide immediate and appropriate supervision, tracking, educational, behavioral, health and related services to these children in order to reduce the likelihood that the child will repeat their anti-social and dangerous behavior. The interventions would be tailored to the individual child. This is absolutely critical and is demonstrated to actually make a difference. It will save lives and money in the long run. It makes common sense. 
   The Harkin amendment also authorizes the funds necessary to assist our schools in providing this critical intervention. 
   So passage of the Harkin-Kennedy amendment--which will occur by voice vote after this roll call vote on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment--is a very important amendment. Its adoption puts the Senate on record as supporting the recommendations and pleas of the police, parents and teachers.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, four weeks ago, an unspeakable act of violence occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado when 12 innocent students, a heroic teacher and the two student gunmen were killed. This incident was the 8th deadly school shooting in 39 months. 
   The tragedy at Columbine High School is still very fresh in our minds  and our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Littleton, Colorado. 
   The students of Columbine have returned to classes in a neighboring school. They have taken an important first step in the healing process. Unfortunately, the scars of this tragedy will remain with them, their families, the Littleton community and the nation for a long time to come. 
   In the aftermath of this most recent school shooting, we must examine the causes of the outbreak of violence and work on initiatives that will prevent such occurrences in the future. 
   During the course of the debate on the pending legislation, Juvenile Justice Bill we have already discussed many of the issues related to violence. We must examine the impact that movies, music, television and video games have on outbreaks of violence. We must also curtail the easy access to guns that enable individuals to commit such acts of violence. 
   We must also talk about how we can prevent such heinous acts from happening again. I would like to take a few moments to discuss one innovative program that can help us prevent violent acts from happening in the first place. 
   Two weeks ago, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, of which I am a member, held a hearing on the important topic of school safety. We heard testimony from many experts about the extent of the problem and began an important search for solutions so that it will never, ever happen again. 
   One of the witnesses was Jan Kuhl, the Director of Guidance and Counseling for the Des Moines School District. Jan talked about an innovative elementary school counseling program called Smoother Sailing and the impact the program has had on students in the Des Moines schools. 
   Smoother Sailing operates on a simple premise--get to kids early to prevent problems rather than waiting for a crisis. As a result, the district more than tripled the number of elementary school counselors to make sure that at least one well-trained professional is available in every single elementary school building. 
   Smoother Sailing began in 1988 as a pilot program in 10 elementary schools. The program increased the number of counselors in the elementary schools so there is one counselor for every 250 students--the ratio recommended for an effective program. The participating schools began seeing many positive changes. 
   After two years, the schools participating in Smoother Sailing saw a dramatic reduction in the number of students referred to the office for disciplinary reasons. 
   During the 1987-88 school year, 157 students were referred to the office for disciplinary action. After two years of Smoother Sailing, the number of office referrals in those schools dropped to 83--a 47% reduction in office referrals. 
   During the same period, Des Moines elementary schools with a traditional crisis intervention counseling program had only a 21% reduction in office referrals. 
   There were other changes as well. Teachers in Smoother Sailing schools reported fewer classroom disturbances and principals noticed fewer fights in the cafeteria and on the playground. The schools and classrooms had become more disciplined learning environments. It was clear that Smoother Sailing was making a difference so the counseling program was then expanded to all 42 elementary schools in Des Moines in 1990. 
   Smoother Sailing continues to be a success. 
   Smoother Sailing helps students solve problems in a positive manner. Assessments of 4th and 5th grade students show that students can generate more than one solution to a problem. Further, the types of solutions were positive and proactive. We know that the ability to effectively solve problems is essential for helping students make the right decisions when confronted with violence or drugs. 
   Smoother Sailing gets high marks in surveys of administrators, teachers and parents. They report a high degree of satisfaction with the program. 
   95% of parents surveyed said the counselor is a valuable part of my child's educational development. 93% said they would seek assistance from the counselor if the child was experiencing difficulties at school. 
   Administrators credit Smoother Sailing with decreasing the number of students suspensions and referrals to the office for disciplinary action. In addition, principals report that the program is responsible for creating an atmosphere that is conducive to learning. 
   Experts tell us that to be effective, there should be at least one counselor for every 250 students. Unfortunately, the current student-counselor ratio is more than double the recommended level--it is 531:1. That means counselors are stretched to the limit and cannot devote the kind of attention to children that is needed.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee knows I have the highest respect for him. In fact, I have always found him to be a very thoughtful Senator, especially when it comes to the issues of disability policy. 
   When the Senator first came to the Senate, he became chairman of the then-existing Disability Policy Subcommittee in the Labor and Education Committee, and I was his ranking member. I thought he did a great job. 
   As a matter of fact, under his chairmanship, we were able to get through the revisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which we had been attempting to do for several years. In fact, it took 3 long years to get all the groups to finally agree on the revisions and the amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. I say that as a way of background. 
   The Senator from Tennessee was very heavily involved in that process. We were able to get the bill passed in May, I think it was, of 1997. It was strongly supported in the Senate and in the House, and passed, and was signed into law by the President. 
   My friend from Tennessee gave an example of the students in his home community. He gave an example of eight students, six of whom were disabled, at least under an IEP, as I understand it; and that three, as I understand it, were expelled right away because it was not a manifestation; but then he made the statement that three went right back into the classroom. 
   The Senator, in a private conversation, told me about this once before. If I am not mistaken, was this not during the school year of 1995-1996 or 1996-1997?

   Mr. HARKIN. It was 1997-1998. So the regulations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act amendments did not go into effect until March of 1999. That is 2 months ago. 
   I say to the Senator from Tennessee that school he is talking about was still operating under the old system. The old system said you could place a child with a disability in an interim educational setting for up to 45 days if the child brought a gun to school. That is the old bill. 
   The new bill says, the one for which the regulations just came out a couple months ago--the Senator is right, a decision is made, and if it is not a manifestation of a disability, they can be expelled immediately. If, however, it is a manifestation of a disability, the child can be placed, under the old bill, for up to 45 days in an interim educational setting, and then if the school officials believe the child is still a danger, if the child is likely to injure himself or others, they can go to an impartial hearing, order that the child be placed for an additional 45 days in the interim educational setting, 
   then at the end of that 45 days, they can do another 45 days, as long as it is decided that child is a danger either to himself or to others. 
   I ask the Senator from Tennessee, the example you gave is under the old bill. The new bill says that at the end of 45 days, the school can go to an impartial hearing officer and keep that child out for another 45 days. I ask the Senator if that is not a correct interpretation?

Did they do that?

   Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from Tennessee--and surely we can get this right; it may take a little bit of discussion, but I think we can get it right--the situation he just described is true to the point where the child can be put in an alternative setting for up to 45 days. Under the new law, which, I again point out, just went into effect this year, the school can keep that 
   child out not only for 45 days but for another 45 days and another 45 days. All the school has to do is go to the impartial hearing officer and say: This kid brought a gun to school. It is a manifestation of his disability, but under these circumstances, this kid is a danger to these other students and should be kept in an alternative setting for another 45 days. 
   Is it not true that the school can do that? So that if the facts are, as the Senator said, the kid is back in the classroom; obviously the school officials felt the kid was not a danger to anyone and they let him back in the school. 
   So I ask the Senator, is that not local control? The local school officials had to decide that child was not a danger and let him back in. There is no other way it could happen. I ask the Senator if that is not so?

   Mr. HARKIN. Well, let us look at that. I think the Senator said he supports IDEA. He supports the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The fact is that we do treat children with disabilities different than we treat other children. Does every child in a school have an IEP, I ask the Senator? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-15-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Let me respond to the Senator on that. I am trying to follow this logically and not to get too inflamed here. 
   If we believe that a child with a disability is treated differently than a child without a disability--we accept that. A child with a disability has an individual education program. There are certain laws that we have passed which if a State wants to accept Federal moneys, they abide by. No local education agency has to abide by the laws of IDEA if they don't want to take the money. Now, they would still have to provide a free and appropriate public education to kids under Federal court rulings. 
   Again, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, that as long as we treat children with disabilities differently, and we do because they are disabled, we then take it to the step that the Senator said. Should we treat a disabled child who brings a gun to school differently from a child who is not disabled? I think that is a good question. At first blush, it might seem to the casual observer that no, they should be treated the same. 
   I say to the Senator from Tennessee, let's take two children. One is a child with no disability, has an IQ of 120, has good grades, comes from a pretty decent family, who all of a sudden gets a mean streak and brings a gun to school. That is one kid. 
   Let's say we have another kid. He has an IQ of 60. He is mentally retarded. He has cerebral palsy. His lifetime has been one of being picked on by other kids and made fun of. Because of IDEA, he is now in a regular classroom. Some kids come up to him and they say, look, junior, we know your old man has a gun at home and he has a couple of pistols. If you don't bring one of those pistols to us tomorrow, we are going to cut your ears off. The kid has an IQ of 60. He is mentally retarded. He has cerebral palsy, maybe even suffers a little bit from schizophrenia, I don't know. The kid is terrified. He goes home. He sneaks the old man's gun. He takes it to these kids, 
   and he gets caught by the principal or someone who sees the gun. Should that child be treated differently than the kid with a 120 IQ, who knew exactly what he was doing and who had a mean streak and brought that gun to school?

   Mr. HARKIN. Now, I believe the Senator made a very important point there in his first comment to me. The Senator said that if two kids--the ones I described--bring a gun to school, they should be treated exactly the same in terms of removal. I agree with the Senator. In terms of removal, they should be treated the same. Today, under IDEA, they are treated the same. 
   I am going to stick with my example of the two kids who bring a gun to school. Right now, under IDEA, the principal can call up the police and say come and get these kids, and they get them and haul them to the police station. They don't care whether the kid is under an IEP or not. I agree with the Senator; in terms of removal, they should be the same. And they are the same today. In terms of getting them out of the classroom immediately, they are treated the same. 
   Where the difference occurs is later on during the 45-day period, where it is examined as to why the kid brought the gun to school, and whether it was a manifestation of his disability or not. 
   I ask my friend from Tennessee this straightforward question: Is it true that under IDEA, as it is today, if a disabled child brings a gun to school and a nondisabled child brings a gun to school, they are both treated the same in terms of removal?

   Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for an observation and again for a question? 
   I say to the Senator from Missouri, again, I don't mind people making a decision one way or another on these things. I hope we base it on factual circumstances. The fact is that what the Senator, my friend from Missouri, just described is the idea in the old law, going back 20 years. We had the 45-day period, at the end of which kids can go back to school. We changed that. The final regulations on that didn't become final until March of this year when we put the 45 days in, at the end of which, if the school officials believe that the child is still a danger, they can go to a hearing officer, and say, hey, because of all these reasons, that kid should be kept out of school for another 45 days. 
   I say to my friend from Tennessee that I don't have that much lack of faith in my school principals and officials. If they look at this kid and say, wait a minute, this kid is a danger, they are going to throw up their hands and say, oh, my gosh. They want to protect their schools, and they are going to go to a hearing officer and say, wait a minute, keep that kid out. 
   So I want to make it clear that what my friend is talking about is the old law. That is all I want to make clear.

   Mr. HARKIN. The reality of the situation and the reason we have IDEA--and we hear it all the time; I hear it from my principals, too, I say to my friend from Missouri--sometimes it is tough to put up with the kids with special needs. They need a lot of attention. Sometimes they are a little raucous. Sometimes the principals throw up their hands and want to get them out of the classrooms. The teachers want to get them out of the classrooms. They are hard to deal with. These are kids with disabilities. 
   Time after time, for every story either of my friends relates about principals or others who are at wit's end because of a kid, I can come up with ten other stories of parents with kids who are disabled and how those kids were mistreated in school. 
   The reality of the situation is--and this is only my feeling--if you take two kids, one disabled maybe with a learning disability, maybe with other problems, who has been mainstreamed in school, expel him as you do a regular student and leave it up to the principal to say, OK, you can let him back in when you want, I think that principal will have a lot of pressure on him to let one kid back in, maybe, depending on the circumstances, but that disabled kid, that kid causes a lot of problems, costs a lot of money, we will keep him out. 
   I am just telling Senators that has been the situation for the past 30 to 50 years in this country. That is why we have IDEA. That is why we have individualized education programs for these kids. That is the reality of the situation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Step by step. The first step is getting the kid out of school because there is a clear danger. You want to get him out of there. 
   I want to make it clear, we all understand that a principal can get that kid out of school. They can call the police station right now and say: Come and get this kid; he has a gun. They can take him down to the police station. The police can do it. They have that right now. Even if the kid is severely disabled, one can say, please come and pick him up and take him to the police station now. Their hands are not tied. I want to take the first step in getting the kid with a gun out of the school. I just hope that my friend will agree that the principal can do that.

I think then while we agree that the principal can get the kid out right away and can get him out for 45 days, our disagreement, it seems to me, is not so much on getting the kid out of the school immediately and getting the immediate danger out; it seems to me our disagreement is what happens later, what happens with those kids later on, how are they treated and how, if at all, they are let back in the school. That seems to be our disagreement.

   Mr. HARKIN. The point I am trying to make is that in the initial statement of my friend from Tennessee, the Senator talked about the Littleton school shooting and kids bringing guns to school and getting these dangerous kids out of school. I agree. 
   I just wanted to make the point very clearly that in terms of a child bringing a gun to school, a principal right now can deal with a kid who is disabled just as they can with a kid who is not disabled, in terms of getting that kid out of school, having the police haul them away, have them book him, have them charge him with a crime or anything else. I just wanted to make that point very clear, that they can get those kids out of that school. 
   Now we are going to get into the next stage about what happens with those kids. That is the only point I want to make. I thank the Senator.

<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-62-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Missouri that prior to the two 1972 cases, the PARC case and the Mills case, it was found by the courts, and by others, that there were millions of kids in our country who were denied an education simply because of their disability. 
   In both the PARC case--that is the Pennsylvania Association of Retarded Children--and the Mills case here in the District, the courts said, basically, look, if a State provides a free public education to its children--now, a State does not have to, States do not have to provide a free public education; there is no constitutional mandate for that, by the way. But the court said, if a State provides a free public education, under the 14th amendment to the Constitution it cannot deny a free public education, just as it cannot deny it to a child who is black, because of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, it cannot deny a free public education to a child with a disability; and, furthermore, the court said, because of the disability, the education must not only be free but appropriate. 
   So I say to my friend--and I will just go through this a little bit longer--the States, then, were faced with a constitutional mandate that they had to provide a free appropriate public education to kids with disabilities. 
   The States were panic stricken. How were they ever going to 
   afford to do this? They came to Congress. Congress said: OK. We will set up a law. We called it the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, passed in 1975. Both the Senator from Vermont and I were in the House at the time. We set up a law, and we said: OK. We want to have some national standards. We do not want to have 50 different standards. We want to set up national standards for providing services to kids with disabilities. We do not want 50 different things out there. 
   So we set up IDEA. We said our objective was to provide 40 percent of the funding. By the way, we haven't, and we ought to.

<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-63-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I always have. We ought to fully fund IDEA. But I just want to walk through this. 
   So we set up IDEA, and we said, if you, State of Missouri, would like to have the money we can provide, then you have to adhere to IDEA. No State, including the State of Missouri, has to abide by any of the provisions in IDEA if they do not want to accept any of the money.

   Mr. HARKIN. I just wanted to point out, the Senator was questioning about whether or not this was a constitutional mandate. It is a constitutional mandate on the States that they have to provide a free and appropriate public education. IDEA says to the States: We will help you with money. Here are the rules of the game.

   Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to respond to my friend from Alabama. 
   It seems to me the argument is, it costs too much money to take care of kids with disabilities. I remind my friend from Alabama, that Supreme Court right across the street, less than 2 months ago, had a case from Iowa, the Garrett F. case. Here was a kid who was on a breathing device in school every day, had to have a nurse with him every day because they had to clean the phlegm out of his throat and his lungs. He was on a breathing device, severely disabled. His mind was fine, mind was great--the kid knew what was going on, a good student. 
   The school didn't like it because it was costing them a lot of money--I say to my friend from Alabama--so they took the case to the Supreme Court. That Supreme Court over there, in a 7-2 decision, including some of the most conservative Members of that Court, said that under the Constitution of the United States they had to provide that opportunity. We can argue about how we provide it, but, please, don't tell me that somehow, because these kids cost a lot of money, we have to give them less in their lives than kids who are not disabled. 
   I yield the floor.

That IEP will address behavior modification, therapy services, and intervention to make sure the behavior does not occur again. This IEP protects not just the child but protects the school. The only way a school needs to let a kid back in is if that kid is meeting the objectives in the IEP and the school wants them back in. That is the process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Tennessee that the example he keeps using in Tennessee did occur under the old law, not the new law. I hope we can forget about using that example. 
   Under the new law we passed, we do provide that 45 days can be extended indefinitely if the school officials feel that child is a threat either to himself or herself or to the school. 
   Again, I just hope that example is not used because it confuses people. We shouldn't be confusing people when the new law is different than the old law. 
   I take a back seat to no one when it comes to the issue of safety in schools. I just put two daughters through public schools all their lives. One just graduated from college; my second daughter is a senior in public high school--student body president, too, I might add. Why not brag? If you can't brag about your kids, what can you brag about? 
   Both my wife and I have always been concerned about safety at school. We have talked a lot about it with our daughter, Jenny, so I don't take a back seat to anyone in terms of safety. There are few things as critical to any parent as making sure the kids are safe when they go out the door in the morning and when they come home in the afternoon. 
   I think the recent tragedies in Colorado are the culmination, the end result, of eight school shootings in 39 months--Oregon, Kentucky, Mississippi. I point out, again, to my friend from Tennessee, the kid in Oregon was expelled, went home, got a gun and came back and shot kids. I don't know if expulsion helped in that case. 
   If you want to base this on the fact that expulsion will make the kids safer in school, I say look what happened in Oregon. It didn't seem to work there. 
   I do believe that what has happened during these 39 months 
   and what happened in Littleton is, indeed, a call to action to our families, to our churches, schools and communities.

   Mr. HARKIN. Kids with disabilities haven't been shooting anybody. I mean, let's be honest about it. The reason this bill is here on this floor is because of what happened in Littleton, CO. The Senator from Tennessee, when he first started out----

   Mr. HARKIN. Everyone hears talk about school shootings and school violence. As I have pointed out, as I said to my friend from Utah, there have been eight school shootings in 39 months and 27 have been killed. Not one of those involved a kid with a disability. Not one. Two years? We spent 3 long years, and I spent years before that, working with IDEA. We spent 3 years hammering out an agreement because there was this clash between the school boards and the principals and the teachers and the parents of kids with disabilities--3 years we sat in rooms around here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. We finally got it resolved. I can remember as though it was yesterday when we went to the Mansfield Room. It was Newt Gingrich, it was TRENT LOTT, there were Democrats and 
   Republicans and the disability community and representatives of the principals and the school boards. We sat in that room right there, that Mansfield Room, and we all said hallelujah, we all agree. We didn't all get what we wanted. Parents had to give up something. Principals gave up something. But we got a bill we all agreed we were going to live with and work with. 
   We agreed in that room that we were not going to go back and make changes on this bill. We were going to give it a chance to work. These are the changes we made. 
   I say again to my friend from Tennessee, he keeps bringing up this example--that happened under the old law, not the new one. The new law, I say to my friend, the regulations for the new IDEA, just went into effect in March of this year. I have been on the Department of Education for a year to get these regs out, but they received them in March. We have not even given it a chance to work. Yet, that great bipartisan effort, that bipartisan solution that we had that culminated in the IDEA amendments of 1997, somehow is now being torn apart. 
   Why? Because of school shootings--what is going on?--when none of these kids were disabled? 
   I know the Senator from Missouri is a nice guy. The last thing he would want to do is to be mean to anybody. But I have to tell you, if you back up and see it from where I am coming from, I have to tell you honestly, with all my heart, this is almost scapegoating kids with disabilities. I know you do not mean to do that. But I have talked to so many parents out there. They talked to me about this amendment and said: Why are they scapegoating my kids? My kids didn't shoot anybody. My kids with disabilities haven't done anything. Why are we doing this?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Let me please finish. This amendment does not belong in this bill. 
   If I am going--if I am taking time, I say to my friend, the only reason I am taking time is because I think there are a lot of Senators here who do not understand what is going on. They have not had the privilege I have had of working on disability issues for 25 years. I believe they need to be informed. 
   It took us 2 hours today simply to get us to agree that if a kid brings a gun to a school, regardless of whether that kid is disabled or not, they can kick him out right away and take him to the police station. It took us 2 hours just to get that agreement. 
   Now we are onto another phase, and that phase is what happens after they are removed. I do not think it has been fully fleshed out yet as to why there is a process set up for kids with disabilities. Then we have to get to the third stage and that is what happens at that point in time, at the end of 45 days. If I take some time, I say to my friend from Utah, it is because I believe I  have an obligation to my families with kids with disabilities--

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I said, I take a backseat to no one in my concern for safety in schools, having a daughter who is a senior in high school now and a daughter who just graduated from college, both of whom have attended public schools all of their lives. 
   I daresay that what has precipitated this bill has been the recent tragedy in Littleton, CO, and the eight shootings over 39 months in our public schools in America. These tragedies have, indeed, called us to action, called us as families, churches, schools, communities, parents, teachers, and, yes, as lawmakers. 
   I hope these tragedies lead us all to take positive and constructive steps to reduce the likelihood of any recurrence. We want to make sure all of our schools are places of learning, not of fear. 
   But we should not let this tragedy of Littleton lead us into emotional, unfounded, though well-intentioned actions which can harm the most vulnerable in our society, and those are our kids with disabilities. 
   I know that the amendment is well-intentioned. The Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Missouri are good people. But this would amend the Individuals with Disabilities Act, and I believe in the deepest part of my being that this amendment will have just the opposite effect. If enacted, it will do a couple of things. It will make our schools and communities less safe, and it will turn the clock back on all the advances we have made in our country to ensure that kids with disabilities have a fair shot at the American dream. 
   This amendment targets a group of students who are more likely to be the victims of school violence than the perpetrators. It is the kids with disabilities, now mainstreamed into our schools, who are beat up on, preyed upon, made fun of by nondisabled kids. Time and time again, it is the kids with disabilities who are the victims of the violence. This has been true for a long time, a long time. 
   Why are we singling them out with this amendment? None, not one, of the eight school shootings in the last 39 months was perpetrated by a child in special education. So why do we have this amendment? 
   Well, I just want to point out, sadly, four of the students shot in the rampage at Columbine High School were special ed kids --four of them. So why are we singling out kids with disabilities? Why are we changing a law that we passed 2 years ago, that we just got the regulations issued in March of this year, which has not had even an opportunity to work? Why are we doing it? 
   Well, I forget which Senator it was who said, well, we do not want to wait until something bad happens. My gosh, under that philosophy, what else can we do to our schools? How about all the kids with disabilities? What are we going to do with them if we don't want to wait until something bad happens? That philosophy can take you down a lot of alleys, a lot of dead-end alleys. I think the answer to ``we don't want to wait till something bad happens'' is exactly why we passed the amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 2 years ago. That is why we have said, if a kid is violent, brings a gun to school, they can get them out immediately to protect the school. 
   I hope everyone heard here today--we finally got an agreement on that point--that if a kid brings a gun to a school, regardless of whether that kid is disabled or not, they can call up the police and have that kid hauled down to the police station immediately, immediately. Now, when there is some thought around here that somehow because a kid is disabled, the principal has to go through all kinds of hoops to get them out of school, I say that is not true. And we finally at least got that nailed down today. 
   I yield to my friend from Minnesota.

   Under the traditional Medicare program, chiropractic care is a covered benefit. When the Medicare+Choice program was created in the Balance Budget Act of 1997, it was the intent of Congress to ensure that every beneficiary that chooses to enroll in a Medicare+Choice program would have access to all services covered under Medicare Parts A and B--including chiropractic services. 
   In addition, the Balanced Budget Act is explicit in requiring Part C plans to assure continuity of benefits for beneficiaries who switch into these plans from the fee-for-service program. The clear intent is to ensure that beneficiaries who chose Part C plans have uninterrupted access to the same physician practitioners. 
   Finally, the Part C provisions of the Balanced Budget Act contain strong antidiscrimination language prohibiting Medicare+Choice plans from discriminating against any provider solely on the basis of his or her license or certification. 
   Every Medicare beneficiary ought to have access to the range of services covered under the Medicare fee-for-service program. Therefore, as a covered service under Part B of Medicare, chiropractic care should be considered a covered service under Medicare Part C. 
   Mr. President, we were disappointed to learn last year that the Health Care Financing Agency's regulations for this program ignore Congressional intent and do not ensure that beneficiaries participating in Medicare managed care plans will be eligible for the services provided by a chiropractor. Under their Medicare+Choice regulations, managed care plans can limit access to chiropractic care by referring patients to other types of providers. As seniors continue to enroll in Medicare HMOs, we must make sure that they have access to the same services they are promised under traditional Medicare--and chiropractic services are no exception. 
   This legislation will send a strong message to HCFA by clarifying congressional intent to ensure that all chiropractic services covered under traditional, fee-for-service Medicare are also covered under the Medicare+Choice program. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the students and teachers from Valley High School in West Des Moines, IA for achieving the top score in the 1999 National GRAMMY Signature School Competition. 
   It took hard work and dedication to achieve this honor, and I congratulate the students, teachers, and others who make it happen. Valley High School enrolls over 2,200 students, and fully 600 students, nearly a third of the student body, participates in one or more music programs. On February 4, 1999 the GRAMMY Signature School designated Valley High School the best music program among 250 public schools from around the country. They were judged by a panel of top musical educators and professionals and were selected based on their high level of commitment to music education. 
   In light of this announcement, U.S Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley, said, ``At a time when creativity and communication skills are at a premium, schools likes those being recognized at this program are using arts for their rich potential to captivate and engage students in the process of learning. The arts help children learn to solve problems, think creatively, and develop mental discipline, which are valuable skills for any academic endeavor.'' 
   Mr. President, year after year underfunded public schools continue to slash funding for all forms of arts and humanities education, thereby weakening the strong cultural heritage the United States has always enjoyed. We should therefore commend the students and teachers of the Valley High School music program for their commitment to a quality music education, and the benefits their efforts reap upon the cultural landscape of the state of Iowa. It is a true honor to serve as their Senator, and I believe they are examples of what all Americans should strive to be.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for the assurance that we can offer this amendment later on. Again, this is an important amendment and we can't let it go too much longer. So I hope we will have some kind of banking bill this year. I hope it doesn't go into next year, because consumers are getting gouged. Most people don't carry more than $1,000 in their checking accounts and they are the ones who have to pay the fees. In all my life until just recently, checking accounts used to be free. Now if you have less than $1,000, you pay fees. Who has less than $1,000? It is the elderly, the low-income people; they have to pay the fees to keep the checking accounts. It is not fair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators DASCHLE, BAUCUS, THOMAS, CONRAD, ROBERTS, GRASSLEY, COLLINS, and FRIST in introducing a critical piece of legislation for America's rural communities, the ``Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999''. As co-chairs of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Senator THOMAS and I convened this bipartisan group last fall to craft a comprehensive rural health bill, building on the hard work of Senators DASCHLE and BAUCUS from the 105th Congress. I am very proud that today we are able to come together across party lines to introduce a bill that will improve the ability of rural Americans to access good quality health care. 
   Today, the health care system in rural Iowa is on the verge of being admitted to an intensive care unit. Iowans living in small towns and rural areas are facing too many barriers to quality health care. But seniors living in New Hampton, Iowa, pay the same Medicare taxes as those who live in New York City--they should get the same quality health care. 
   This bill aims to improve access, increase choice, and improve the quality of care provided in rural towns in Iowa and around the nation. Current formulas for Medicaid and Medicare payments to hospitals are biased towards urban areas. This bill raises payments for rural hospitals by making it easier for them to qualify for special designations. The bill also strengthens health professional recruitment programs, helps expand access to mental health services in rural areas, requires that rural areas be represented on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and expand the range of Medicare-reimbursed services that can be provided via telemedicine. 
   Health care providers in rural areas like Iowa practice a conservative, cost-effective approach to health care. They should be rewarded for their resourcefulness, not penalized with unfair reimbursement rates. But Medicare payments to hospitals are currently based on formulas that give urban areas an advantage. This bill corrects these formulas so that hospitals can be paid more fairly. It also includes provisions specifically targeted to small, rural hospitals and the unique problems they face. 
   In addition, the bill guarantees that Medicare+Choice plans in rural counties get the increased reimbursement promised in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This provision will help ensure that seniors in rural areas have some of the same health plan choices available to urban seniors. These changes will help to address some of the inequity that exists for Medicare managed care. 
   And I will soon introduce legislation that will take the next critical step: fixing the inequity in Medicare fee-for-service. The vast majority of seniors living in rural areas will continue to receive their care through Medicare fee-for-service, yet the reimbursement rate for rural providers is woefully inadequate. My bill will address the imbalance between rural and urban fee-for-service rates, and I hope to introduce it in the next several weeks. 
   Mr. President, the health care system in this country is undergoing dramatic changes and our rural health care infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with the new landscape. The bill we are introducing today is the product of a bipartisan commitment to make sure that rural Americans have access to the same high quality health care that all Americans have come to expect. I am proud to be a part of this effort.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute and say goodbye to a long time friend, Father Ron Hennessey, whose recent passing is a great loss not only to his colleagues, his family, and his friends but to everyone who knew him. I'm saying goodbye to Father Ron, but we will never say goodbye to his heart, his spirit, or his soul. 
   Father Ron was a native of Iowa and graduated from St. Patrick's High School in Ryan, Iowa. After graduating, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served as a mechanic and later a Motor Sergeant in Korea. While in Korea, he was awarded three Bronze Stars for valor during his military service. Under the Eisenhower Christmas Program, he returned to the United States and was released from active service on December 9, 1953. He entered Maryknoll Junior Seminary in Pennsylvania and five years later graduated from Maryknoll College in Illinois in June of 1958. Father Hennessey was ordained at Maryknoll Seminary in New York on June 13, 1964. 
   Father Ron devoted his life to international peace and justice, Mr. President, dedicating almost 35 years of his life as a Maryknoll priest in Central America. Much of this time was spent in Guatemala and El Salvador. Soon after being ordained, he was assigned to the Diocese of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Several years later, he became the Pastor in San Mateo Ixtatan, Guatemala. It is during this time that Father Hennessey became very involved in the human rights struggle of the local Mayan Indians. He placed himself in great danger by smuggling letters out of Guatemala detailing the atrocities committed against the Mayan Indians in his rural parish. Those atrocities, Father Ron wrote, were being committed by the Guatemalan military under the orders of President Rios Montt. I remember one letter in particular in which Father Ron listed 20 instances in his parish alone in which military forces committed gross acts of violence. 
   Sadly, the United States Government at the time, supported this oppressive regime. In fact, our own State Department downplayed the human rights violations being committed in Guatemala, and in my view making us complicit in those heinous crimes. 
   By shining the spotlight on these atrocities, Father Ron's life was in constant danger. But that did not stop him. He stayed in Guatemala until 1986 despite having three opportunities to leave. 
   From Guatemala he went to El Salvador to re-establish a Maryknoll presence there after a five year absence. There he served in a parish on the outskirts of San Salvador that had had no priest since the Church was bombed in 1980. 
   In 1989, when the Salvadoran military murdered six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter, Father Hennessey and his fellow Maryknollers chose to remain in the country even as scores of North American missionaries and aid workers decided to leave because the situation had become too dangerous for those who stood up for human rights and the rule of law. But Father Hennessey continued his work, standing side by side with his parishioners. 
   Father Hennessey once again took up residence again in Guatemala in 1992 until earlier this year when he was assigned to the Maryknoll mission in Los Angeles. 
   And so, Mr. President, Father Hennessey will be greatly missed by all of us. And while he may have physically departed, his spirit will never desert us. 
   Which is the second reason I rise today, Mr. President--to affirm an ancient native American saying: To live in the hearts of those you love, is not to die. 
   Father Ron, your spirit does live on through who knew you, whose lives you touched, and through them the countless thousands whose lives were enriched because of you. You will be remembered by us, each in a different way. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I can think of no better way to remember my friend Father Ron than with the words of Archbishop Oscar Romero: I have no ambition of power, and so with complete freedom I tell the powerful what is good and what is bad, and I tell any political group what is good and what is bad. That is my duty.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for preserving current law with regard to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and striking the provisions of S. 900 which will harm this important and worthwhile program. CRA was enacted in 1977 to help prevent ``redlining'' of poor neighborhoods by banks, which denied loans to residents and businesses in those areas. 
   For more than twenty years, CRA has been a key means of increasing capital and credit to underdeveloped areas through market based loans. CRA has created jobs and contributed to the economic revitalization of many depressed urban and rural areas. It has been a force for the capital needed to increase home ownership and business development. CRA has contributed greatly toward the revitalization of many areas, helping to generate an estimated one trillion dollars in lending over 22 years. Put simply, CRA is good public policy. 
   Mr. President, community groups, housing groups, farm groups, minority groups, civil rights groups, mayors and rural organizations all support a vibrant CRA and are opposed to S. 900's CRA provisions. 
   In my State of Iowa, many rural residents remain in desperate need of affordable capital, especially during the farm crisis gripping the mid-West. Under S. 900, as it is now written, 276 of the 325 banks and thrifts in rural Iowa counties would be exempt from CRA requirements. That's 85 percent of all the  rural banks in Iowa. If the provision exempting banks under 100 million dollars in assets remains, the benefits of CRA would not be available to a large share of the rural communities in Iowa. 
   I have here a letter from the Iowa Coalition for Housing and the Homeless, which describes the importance CRA has for our communities. It reads, in part, ``Through increasing the access to capital and credit, CRA provides a market-based solution for economic revitalization and even job creation. A strong and vibrant CRA has meant that hundreds of billions worth of new home mortgage loans and small business loans have been made in low and moderate income, urban and rural communities throughout the country in the past several years.''

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would just like to mention briefly the CRA reforms already in place to protect small and rural banks. In 1995, new regulations dramatically simplified the CRA exam process for small banks under 250 million dollars in assets. Under the new rules, small banks are not subject to the lending, investment and service tests applied to large institutions. Additionally, for small banks, examiners look at only five factors: loan to deposit ratio; percentage of loans inside bank's CRA assessment area; record of lending to borrowers of different income levels and businesses of different sizes; geographic distribution of loans; and a bank's record of taking action in response to written complaints about its CRA performance. Finally, small banks are not subject to any data collection requirements for CRA. So, we have already addressed these issues. This Senator would certainly welcome hearings on the current state of those reforms and their effectiveness. In fact, I would ask the Banking Chairman to consider holding such hearings on CRA before we make changes to an important and effective program. 
   Mr. President, CRA has provided jobs, helped our economy to grow, and ensured all of our citizens are considered for loans based on their financial history, not their address. I urge all my colleagues to support removal of these provisions.

    Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with my colleagues, Senator SNOWE and Senator FRIST, the Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act of 1999. 
   Tne Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act would help States establish programs to detect and diagnose hearing loss in every  newborn child and to promote appropriate treatment and intervention for newborns with hearing loss. The Act would fund research by the National Institutes of Health to determine the best detection, diagnostic, treatment and intervention techniques and technologies. 
   Every year, approximately 12,000 children in the United States are born with a hearing impairment. Most of them will not be diagnosed as hearing-impaired until after their second birthday. The consequences of not detecting early hearing impairment are significant, but easily avoidable. 
   Late detection means that crucial years of stimulating the brain's hearing centers are lost. It may delay speech and language development. Delayed language development can retard a child's educational progress, minimize his or her socialization skills, and as a result, destroy his or her self-esteem and confidence. On top of all that, many children are diagnosed incorrectly as having behavioral or cognitive problems, simply because of their undetected hearing loss. 
   In 1988, the Commission on Education of the Deaf reported to Congress that early detection, diagnosis and treatment were essential to improving the status of education for people who are deaf in the United States. Based on that report and others, in 1991, when I was chair of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee on Appropriations, we urged the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Deisorders--NIDCD--to determine the most effective means of identifying hearing impairments in newborn infants. In 1993, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee supported NIDCD's efforts to sponsor a consensus development conference on early identification of hearing impairment in infants and children. And in 1998, the Subcommittee encouraged NIDCD to pursue research on intervention strategies for infants with hearing impairments, and encouraged HRSA to provide states with the results of the NIH study on the most effective forms of screening infants for hearing loss. 
   Mr. President, the Act we are introducing today builds on these earlier efforts. The Act would help states develop programs that many of them already are working on; it would not impose a single federal mandate. At least eight states already have mandatory testing programs; many others have legislation pending to establish such programs. Other states have achieved universal newborn testing voluntarily. These programs can work; they deserve federal help. 
   One of the highlights of my Congressional career, indeed, of my life, has been working on policies and laws to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal opportunity to succeed in our society. This is especially meaningful to me, because my brother Frank became deaf as a child. 
   I watched Frank grow up, and I saw how few options and support services were available for people who were deaf. I remember the frustrations and challenges Frank faced, and I told myself early on that I would do all I could to break down the barriers in our society that prevented people who were deaf from reaching their potential. By supporting early screening, diagnosis, and treatment programs, this act would go a long way toward accomplishing that goal. 
   I would like to thank Senators SNOWE and FRIST for their hard work and support of this act, and I hope our colleagues will join us in this worthy effort.

   Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Congressional Gold Medal is among the most distinguished honors that Congress can bestow on individuals in recognition of their work or accomplishments. Since 1776, this award, initially reserved for military leaders, has also been given to such diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill, Charles Lindbergh and Mother Teresa. 
   Rosa Parks is not a military hero, not a head of state, explorer or adventurer. 
   On December 1, 1955, she was a seamstress on her way to work, who took a seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. For that simple action of sitting on a bus, she was arrested, sent to jail, and convicted of what city laws called a crime and lost her job. 
   Rosa Parks is a living example of how an extraordinary person, engaged in the ordinary matters of life, can change the world. 
   The day that Ms. Parks refused to surrender her seat to a white man symbolizes the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Her arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the catalyst for a mass boycott of the city's buses, whose rider ship had been 70 percent black. The boycott led to the national prominence of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and to a Supreme Court order declaring Montgomery County's segregated seating laws unconstitutional. 
   Ms. Parks, known now as the ``first lady of civil rights,'' later said, ``I felt just resigned to give what I could to protest against the way I was being treated.'' 
   Rosa Parks had been involved in the civil rights movement years before the bus incident and her efforts continued long afterward. She was one of the first female members of the Montgomery Chapter of the NAACP, she joined the Montgomery Voters League and encouraged blacks to register to vote. 
   Despite her civil rights work, Rosa Parks on that historic day actually followed the degrading rules that reserved the first ten seats were reserved for ``whites only.'' If those rows filled up, blacks were supposed to move even further back. Parks, who was sitting just beyond the 10th row, refused to move and the arrest, the conviction and the winning appeal followed. All she had asked for was the basic respect and simple dignity of not being forced to give up her seat to a white man. 
   Rosa Parks actions and her determination to preserve her dignity spread throughout the nation and sparked the end of segregation in the South. She hasn't stopped since. 
   In 1957, she moved to Detroit where she worked for nonviolent social change with Martin Luther King Jr's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She worked for Congressman John Conyers and in 1987 she founded an institute to provide leadership and career training to black youth. Forty-four years after that historic day in Montgomery, she continues to speak out on civil rights issues. 
   We have heard the ``first lady of civil rights'' story over and over again throughout the years and it will own a permanent place in our history books. But we need to keep listening and reminding ourselves of the extraordinary courage and determination that this working woman had to win the most basic rights that everyone in our nation deserves. She serves as a model and inspiration for what each of us can do in our everyday lives toward greater respect, dignity and kindness among humankind. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in bestowing the Congressional Gold Medal to ``the mother of the freedom movement.''

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to bridge obvious gaps in the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables. This legislation will establish basic standards of sanitation for processed fruits and vegetables, simple standards that will help assure that Americans can enjoy these foods safely. 
   American families are on the front lines of this food safety battle three times a day--breakfast, lunch and dinner. Health experts advise us to eat at least five servings a day of fresh fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy lifestyle. Studies show these foods can cut our risks of cancer and heart disease. Americans have listened, and our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has grown every year. We can now find a variety of out-of-season produce, imported and exotic foods. We also enjoy convenience foods, ready-to-eat mixed salads, sprouts, mixed juices, a variety of frozen berries, dried spices, and other treats unavailable a few decades ago. 
   Americans can buy produce that is the safest in the world, and food safety problems from produce are rare. But these problems can be devastating for victims, and consumers are demanding stronger laws to protect themselves from food borne illness. Since 1990, more than 40 outbreaks of foodborne illness have been linked to fresh fruit, vegetable and juice products consumed in the United States. More than 6300 illnesses were reported, with victims in almost all 50 states. Domestic melons, imported strawberries, lettuce, sprouts and orange juice each took their toll. 
   Processed or ready-to-eat produce may be more easily contaminated because it is handled extensively, cut up and rinsed, and then is eaten by the consumer without further preparation. It is essential that the processor handle these foods safely, because there is nothing the consumer can do once these products are contaminated. 
   This bill will improve the safety of these products by requiring that they are always processed under sanitary conditions. These are the same conditions you would use in your own kitchen, and should expect from a processor. The guidelines are simple; that rinse water be clean and sewage be kept  away from the food, that workers can and do wash their hands, that flies, birds and rodents be kept out of the processing plant. 
   Under the bill provisions, FDA will inspect processors, domestic and importing, annually, to be sure they are following sanitary guidelines. FDA will also coordinate with other food safety agencies to develop research programs aimed at setting standards for safe agricultural practices for produce, and for testing methods that can verify that fruit or vegetable products has been processed safely. 
   Last August, the National Academy of Sciences, in evaluating the federal food safety system, advised that food safety agencies be able to ``mandate minimum sanitation standards for food.'' Food safety should be a requirement--not a suggestion. We have had basic sanitation standards in place for meat and poultry for 93 years. FDA needs strong mandatory sanitation guidelines for produce. My bill would establish basic sanitation standards for processed fruits and vegetables. Most processors in the US are already following these reasonable standards, and are keeping their products safe. This bill will bring everyone up to par domestically, and allow FDA to address produce sanitation problems in importing countries. 
   Agriculture is clearly our nation's largest employer, providing jobs for millions from the farm to the corner markets. Agricultural communities cannot afford to have the American public question the safety of the food in their grocery stores. This is not just a public health issue, it is also an economic issue. 
   I believe these simple standards of cleanliness are reasonable, are long overdue, and will help assure that Americans can safely make these foods a part of every meal.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues--Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator ROBB in sponsoring this important amendment which calls on Congress to pass legislation to fix our Nation's crumbling schools. 
   The condition of our Nation's schools is well known--they are in deplorable condition. Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report card on the condition of America's infrastructure. The report made it clear that the physical infrastructure in this  country is in dire need. However, the only area that warranted a failing grade was education. The group was concerned about the condition of things like our roads, bridges, and wastewater systems. But the only area that was deemed inadequate is education. It is clear we must place repair of our nation's schools at the top of our Nation's priority list. 
   There are 14 million children--almost 5 times the number of people in all of Iowa--that are attending classes in buildings that are literally falling down around them. The General Accounting Office tells us that we need $112 billion to modernize our Nation's schools to bring them to good overall condition. The Civil Engineers also say we need $60 billion in new construction to accommodate increasing enrollments. 
   This is a serious problem, and one that is not getting better. As a matter of fact, every day we delay, it gets worse and will cost more money to address. 
   Iowa State University conducted a comprehensive survey on the condition of schools in Iowa. In 1995 the estimated cost over the next 10 years was $3.4 billion. Two years later it was $4 billion and I would guess that if the study were updated for 1999 we would find that the cost has increased even more. 
   There are many that say this is a local problem and federal support is unwarranted and unwise. All across this country school districts are struggling to repair and upgrade their facilities because the cost is enormous. 
   It is simply unacceptable that we tolerate this situation. It is unconscionable that children in this country go to school in buildings where the plumbing doesn't work, the windows are broken, and the roofs leak. 
   This amendment calls on Congress to enact legislation to provide a comprehensive strategy to modernize our Nation's schools. First, we must pass legislation to provide funding for the Education Infrastructure Act. This is an existing federal program which has been on the books since 1994. 
   During each of the last two years, the Senate has passed legislation which included my proposal to appropriate $100 million for this program. Unfortunately, we have been unable to hold the funds in conference with the House. 
   We must redouble our efforts to provide funding for this grant program to assist needy school districts and the resolution calls on our to make this investment. 
   Second, the amendment calls on Congress to pass legislation to provide at least $24.8 billion in tax credits to holders of school construction bonds. These tax credits will make it possible for school districts to build and renovate school facilities at a reduced cost because the holder of the bond would receive a federal tax credit in lieu of interest. 
   Mr. President, We have high expectations for our children. We want them to be the best in the world--to reach the highest academic standards. But then we ask them to attend class in buildings that just don't make the grade--in buildings that are not equipped to provide a quality 21st century education. 
   We must enact legislation now to remedy this situation and I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at first glance, the pending budget appears to place a high priority on education. The resolution invests more money than proposed by President Clinton and highlights increases for elementary and secondary education. 
   This stands in sharp contrast to previous Republican budgets that slashed  funding for vital discretionary education programs, cut college loans and called for elimination of the Department of Education. In some respects, this budget is a welcome change. 
   To highlight elementary and secondary education, the resolution takes the unusual step of providing so-called ``sub-function'' allocations to prominently display the proposed increases for K-12 education. In addition, the resolution calls for an investment of $2.5 billion in special education over the next five years. That sounds pretty good. 
   Unfortunately, a closer examination of the budget exposes serious flaws. On the one hand, the budget touts increases for K-12 schools but plays down the sobering fact that the only way to accomplish that objective is to cut other important education and training programs. 
   Cuts, or in the best case scenario, freezes college grants. 
   Denies 100,000 children Head Start services. 
   Eliminates 73,000 young people from the summer jobs program. 
   Makes it impossible for 102,000 dislocated workers to get the training they need to get new jobs. 
   Unlike previous GOP budgets that launched a frontal assault on education, this budget is a stealth attack. The rhetoric touts education, but the details will spell disaster. 
   That is why we are offering this amendment to fully fund two critically important education programs--special education and the class size reduction act. The amendment will enable us to meet two important goals. 
   First, we will make sure there is full funding for these two initiatives. IDEA will be fully funded for the first time ever and we will meet our national goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size. 
   Second, by providing this mandatory stream of funding, the amendment will free up precious discretionary funds that could be invested in other important national priorities such as college grants, Head Start, Title I, education technology and job training. 
   The amendment is fully offset by reducing the tax breaks by 20%. That still leaves plenty of room for tax cuts for working families. 
   We must renew the bipartisan effort we began last fall to reduce class size. Research has shown that smaller class sizes make a difference. Teachers are able to provide more personalized attention for students and have to spend less time on discipline. As a result, students do better and learn more. 
   We got off to a good start last fall by enacting legislation as part of the omnibus appropriations bill for the first year of the seven year class size initiative. This amendment would enable us to finish the job and fully fund the initiative. 
   The amendment also invests in IDEA. In the early seventies, two landmark federal district court cases--PARC versus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Mills versus Board of Education of the District Court of Columbia--established that children with disabilities have a constitutional right to a free appropriate public education. 
   In 1975, in response to these cases, the Congress enacted PL 94-142, the precursor to IDEA, to help states meet their constitutional obligations. 
   When we enacted PL 94-142, the Congress authorized the maximum state award as the number of children served under the special education law times 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure. 
   Congress has fallen far short of this goal. Indeed, in fiscal year 1999, Congress appropriated only 11.7% of the national average per pupil expenditure for Part B of IDEA. Congress needs to do much more to help and this amendment would fully fund this program for the first time. 
   As an editorial in the March 15 edition of the New York Times explained, ``Educating disabled youngsters is a national responsibility. The expense should be borne on the nation as a whole, not imposed haphazardly on stated or financially strapped districts that happen to serve a large number of disabled students.'' 
   As the ranking member on the education appropriations subcommittee, I am acutely aware of all the things we are unable to do because we do not have sufficient resources to invest. An added benefit of this amendment is to provide $43 billion for education and training programs over the next 10 years. 
   Mr. President, this amendment will place education at the top of the national priority list and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the early seventies, two landmark federal district court cases--PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Mills v. Board of Education of the District Court of Columbia--established that children with disabilities have a constitutional right to a free appropriate public education. 
   In 1975, in response to these cases, the Congress enacted PL 94-142, the precursor to IDEA, to help states meet their constitutional obligations. 
   When we enacted PL 94-142, the Congress authorized the maximum state award as the number of children served under the special education law times 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure. 
   Congress has fallen far short of this goal. Indeed, in fiscal year 1999, Congress appropriated only 11.7% of the national average per pupil expenditure for Part B of IDEA. 
   Congress needs to do much more to help school districts meet their constitutional obligations. Indeed, whenever I go home to Iowa, I am besieged by requests for additional federal funding for special education. 
   These requests increased in intensity following the Supreme Court decision in Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garrett F. That decision reaffirmed the court's longstanding interpretation that schools must provide those health-related services necessary to allow a child with a disability to remain in school. 
   This is a terribly important decision, which reaffirms that all children with disabilities have the right to a meaningful education. As Justice Stevens wrote, ``under the statute, [Supreme Court] precedent, and the purpose of the IDEA, the District must fund such ``related services'' in order to help guarantee that students like Garrett are integrated into the public schools.'' 
   The child in this case, Garrett Frey, happens to come from Iowa. He is friendly bright, articulate young man, who is also quadriplegic and ventilator-dependent. Twenty years ago, he probably would have been shunted off to an institution, at a terrible cost to taxpayers. Instead, he is thriving as a high school student, and will most likely go off to college and become a hard-working, tax paying citizen. 
   An editorial in USA Today summed up the situation well.  
   We've learned a lot about the costs of special education over the past 24 years. In addition to the savings realized when children can live at home with their families, we also know there are astronomical costs associated with not educating students with disabilities. Research shows that individuals who did not benefit from IDEA are almost twice as likely to not complete high school, not attend college and not get a job. The bottom line: Providing appropriate special education and related services to children saves government hundreds of thousands of dollars in dependency costs.  
   The Garrett Frey decision, also underscores the need for Congress to help school districts with the financial costs of educating children with disabilities. While the excess costs of educating some children with disabilities is minimal, the excess costs of educating other children with disabilities, like Garrett, is great. 
   The pending amendment, of which I am pleased to cosponsor, would take two important steps. First, it would fully fund IDEA at the 40% goals. Secondly, the amendment would provide a mandatory stream of funding for this important program. Finally, the amendment is paid for by taking a portion of the funds set-aside for tax breaks and instead invest those funds in IDEA. Mr. President, my amendment would provide real money to help school districts meet their constitutional obligations. Local school districts should not have to bear the full costs of educating children with disabilities. 
   Again, the USA Today editorial said it well.  
   Let's be clear: The job of educating all our children is no small feat. But kids in special education and kids in ``gifted and talented'' programs are not to blame for tight resources. We, as a nation, must increase our commitment to a system of public education that has the capacity to meet the needs of all children, including children with disabilities.  
   Of course, in providing increased funding for IDEA, we must make sure we do not do so at the expense of other equally important education programs. 
   We need to fully fund Head Start so that all children start school ready to learn. 
   We need to fully fund Title I so that all children get the extra help they need in reading and math. 
   We need to fully fund Pell Grants so that all students have a chance to go to college. 
   There are many other important education initiatives, such as reducing class size, improving teacher training, and modernizing our crumbling schools, that will also help children with disabilities. 
   Finally, I'd like to point out that when we reauthorized IDEA in 1997, we made clear that the cost of serving students with disabilities should fall not just on school districts, but should be shared by all responsive state agencies, including state Medicaid agencies and state health departments. While Garrett does not qualify for any state programs, many children in his situation do, and the school districts can and should avail themselves of that money. 
    Mr. President, this amendment is about setting rational national priorities. We must make education our nation's top priority since the real threat to our national security is an inability to compete in the global marketplace. We must have the best-educated, most-skilled, healthiest workers in the world to secure our nation's future. Investments in education are essential if we are to reach that goal. 
   The amendment targets one important area--special education--and fully funds this important program. As an editorial in the March 15 edition of the New York Times explained, ``Educating disabled youngsters is a national responsibility. The expense should be borne on the nation as a whole, not imposed haphazardly on states or financially strapped districts that happen to serve a large number of disabled students.'' 
   By providing these additional resources for special education, we would free up funds both here and in local school districts for other important education priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment to fully fund IDEA by reducing tax breaks in the budget.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I thank him for his leadership on this amendment, and I thank our Democratic leader also for his leadership. 
   Mr. President, last Saturday was National Agriculture Day. Each year on the first day of spring, we celebrate the success and the accomplishment of American agriculture. U.S. consumers today spend less than any country in the world, as a percent of their disposable income, on food. Nine cents out of a dollar, that is all. Think about this, the productivity of American farmers, what it has done for us. In the 1960s, one farmer in America supplied food for 25 people. Now they supply food for over 130 people. Tremendous. 
   Isn't it a cruel irony that we set aside the first day of spring every year to recognize agriculture and the American farmer, yet tens of thousands of American farm families are going under right now? They are on the verge of losing their livelihoods and their life savings. It is devastation in the agricultural sector. 
   What this amendment basically says is that with the expected budget surplus for fiscal year 2000 and greater surpluses in years to follow, we will apply $6 billion of that extra surplus to putting a safety net underneath agriculture. In other words, if we have extra money in the years 2000 to 2004, that money will be made available to agriculture. Of course, if the farm economy improved, then it wouldn't be needed. 
   This chart here kind of tells it all. People say, why do you need $6 billion? Here is last year, 1998. This is all of the farm income; that is, the crop receipts, their AMTA payments, their aid, their loan deficiency payments--$69.5 billion. Expected this year, $64 billion. That is about a $5 billion, $5.5 to $6 billion decrease. But last year this was 17 percent lower than the average 5 years before. This year it is expected to be 27 percent less in income for farmers. That is why this amendment is sorely needed. Those who have much in our society, to whom the Republicans want to give these tax breaks, they are doing well. They are doing well on Wall Street. They are doing well in Palm Beach. They are doing well on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. In the farm sector of America, our families are struggling to survive. All we are asking for is a decent safety net. That is why this amendment is sorely needed.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   I am pleased to join my chairman, Senator SPECTER, in offering this amendment. Two years ago, the Senate went on record, 98 to 0, committing to double the NIH budget over 5 years. 
   Last year, Senator SPECTER and I were able to make good on that pledge by providing the biggest increase ever for medical research. We worked hard to make it happen. I thank all my Senate colleagues for working with us on that historic accomplishment. 
   The omnibus appropriations bill for this year contains a $2 billion, or a 15-percent, increase for the National Institutes of Health. That 15 percent puts us on track to meet our commitment to double the NIH budget for 5 years, which, I repeat, was voted on here 98 to 0. 
   Unfortunately, if we pass this budget resolution as it is, we will fall far short of the 15-percent increase necessary to maintain that commitment. 
   This budget resolution shortchanges Americans' health and shortchanges our efforts to control health care costs and keep Medicare solvent in the long run. 
   At the same time that this budget shortchanges basic investments in health care, the budget before us increases the Pentagon budget by $18 billion--$8.3 billion more than the President's request--to defend America against some ill-defined international threat. 
   What this budget should do is spend at least $2 billion more to defend us against the very real threats here at home every day --the threat of cancer, the threat of Alzheimer's, the threat of diabetes, the threat of osteoporosis. 
   Recently, under the leadership of Senator SPECTER, we had a hearing, and one of our witnesses was Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. He was in town to urge Congress to increase its investment in medical research. He understands better than most that we cannot mount a strong defense without adequate resources. While we made some progress last year, we still have a long way to go. 
   Under the budget before us, NIH will only be able to fund about one in four meritorious research proposals. Those are research proposals that have gone through the peer review process deemed worthy of investigation. Only one in four will be funded. 
   In the next 30 years, the number of Americans over age 65 will double. Medical research is essential to help reduce the enormous economic and social burdens posed by chronic diseases that impact our elderly from Alzheimer's and arthritis to cancer and Parkinson's and stroke. 
   Take Alzheimer's disease. It alone costs the Nation over $100 billion a year. We know that simply delaying the onset by 5 years could save us over $50 billion a year. Delaying the onset of heart disease by 5 years would save over $69 billion a year. That is why I often say to my colleagues and others, if you really want to save Medicare, invest in medical research. That will take care of the looming deficit in Medicare. We are on the verge of breakthroughs in these and other areas. Now is the time to boost our investment to make sure that our Nation's top scientists can turn these opportunities into realities. 
   In addition to funding more research grants, another area that is critical to making the breakthroughs we know are possible is making sure we have state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment. However, most of the research is currently being done in laboratories built in the 1950s and 1960s. 
   According to the most recent National Science Foundation study, 47 percent of all biomedical research performing institutions classified the amount of biological science research space as inadequate, and 51 percent indicated they had an inadequate amount of medical research space. So the need is great. 
   Our amendment is very simple. It ensures that the budget resolution will provide a $2 billion increase to the National Institutes of Health for fiscal year 2000, and it is fully paid for. It is paid for by the very industry that has caused most of the death and disease in this country. 
   As I said before, Mr. President, tobacco kills more Americans each year than alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, and fires all put together. 
   Simply put, our amendment turns tobacco profits toward the cure for the cancer, emphysema, and heart disease that it causes. 
   During the dealings that led to the tobacco settlements, the tobacco lawyers made sure that all the payments they made to the States would be considered ``normal and necessary business expenses.'' But there is nothing ordinary about this settlement. The tobacco industry has peddled a product that has killed millions of Americans through their deceptive advertising and sales practices. As a result of that loophole in the settlement, the tobacco industry can write off 35 percent of their entire settlement payment. That means American taxpayers, not big tobacco, will have to cough up as much as 35 percent of the cost, $2 billion this year alone, and continuing the next 25 years of the tobacco settlement. 
   In effect, the tobacco settlement is a $70 billion tax on the American people. What our amendment says is that basically the tobacco companies will not be able to deduct from their Federal taxes the amount of money that they pay to the States for this settlement. The American people have paid enough. To make them pay an additional $70 billion to cover up for the tobacco companies' tax deductions for their settlements is adding insult to death and injury. 
   Let me add one other thing, Mr. President. I have heard there is some misinformation floating out there about our amendment. Let me be clear. Our amendment would have absolutely no impact on the amount of settlement funds going to the States. The settlement has a clause that requires a dollar-for-dollar reduction in payments to the States if additional taxes are raised on tobacco and spent by the States, if the money is remitted to the States. Not one penny of the SPECTER amendment would go to the States but would all go to the National Institutes of Health. Therefore, it in no way violates that provision of the settlement.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me close by saying that we went on record 98-0 to double the NIH budget over the next 5 years. Last year, Senator SPECTER and I and others were able to put that 15-percent increase in there to get us on that road. This budget this year pulls the rug out from under that. 
   The people of America want us to invest in medical research. They want us to double the NIH budget. They believe it is important. 
   In a recent poll taken of the American people, more than 67 percent support doubling the research budget at NIH; 85 percent said it is important for us to maintain our leadership in medical research; 61 percent of the American people polled said they would be willing to pay $1 more a week in taxes to increase health research. The support is there. 
   There is no reason why the tobacco companies ought to be able to deduct from their Federal taxes the money that they are giving to the States in that settlement. They wrote it in that agreement, but that does not bind us. 
   This amendment does not violate the agreement. What it does is it saves the American taxpayers over $70 billion that they will have to pay to save the tobacco companies their money. 
   This amendment also saves Medicare--by putting this money into medical research to help solve the diseases of Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, arthritis, and diabetes. If you want to save Medicare, adopt the Specter amendment. If you want to save the taxpayers money, adopt the Specter amendment. If you want to save peoples' lives, adopt the Specter amendment. 
   Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is perhaps no other form of discrimination that has as direct an impact on the day-to-day lives of workers as wage discrimination. A recent survey of working women found receiving fair pay is one of their top concerns. When women aren't paid what they're worth, we all get cheated. That's why we are introducing the Fair Pay Act of 1999--to ensure equal pay for work of equal value for all Americans. 
   The Equal Pay Act of 1963 prohibits sex-based discrimination in compensation for doing the same job. However, this statute fails to address other major parts of the pay equity problem such as job segregation. Current law has not reached far enough to combat wage discrimination when employers routinely pay lower wages to jobs that are dominated by women. More than 30 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women's wages still seriously lag behind their male counterparts' wages. The central problem is that we continue to undervalue and underpay work done by women. 
   The Fair Pay Act is designed to pick up where the Equal Pay Act left off. The heart of the bill seeks to eliminate wage discrimination based upon sex, race or national origin. This important legislation would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to make it illegal for employers to discriminate against women and minorities by paying them less in jobs that are comparable in skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions. 
   The Fair Pay Act would apply to each company individually and would prohibit companies from reducing other employees' wages to achieve pay equity. Seven states have passed and implemented laws to close the wage gap for state employees and they didn't go bankrupt doing it. Canada also passed similar pay equity laws that apply to both the government and private sectors. 
   Wage gaps can result from differences in education, experience or time in the workforce and the Fair Pay Act in no way interferes with that. But just as there is a glass ceiling in the American workplace, there is also a ``Glass Wall'' encountered by women who have similar skills and have the similar responsibilities as their male counterparts, but still do not receive the same pay. 
   For example, a study of Los Angeles County employees showed social workers were paid $35,000 a year while probation officers were paid $55,000. That's a $20,000 difference, although the jobs required similar skills, education and working conditions. This is what the Fair Pay Act aims to fix.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it seems we are moving irrevocably towards war in the Balkans. It appears that the U.S. forces along with NATO forces will soon be engaged in open warlike activity against Serbian forces. This Senator took the floor in January of 1991, prior to the engagement of our forces in the Persian Gulf, to state my feelings that before any President commits our troops to a military action of this nature, that President should seek the advice, consent, and approval of Congress. 
   Only Congress has the power to declare war; it is quite clear in the Constitution. It is this Senator's strong feeling that this President would be remiss, and we would be shirking our duties, if in fact we did not, today, set aside whatever other business this Senate has, to debate fully a resolution supporting or not supporting the use of our military force in Kosovo. That debate should be held today and the vote should be held today, or tomorrow, but as soon as possible, so we fulfill our constitutional obligations. 
   I said, in 1991, if the President were to engage in war in the Persian Gulf without Congress first acting, not only would it be a violation of the War Powers Act but I think it would be a violation of the Constitution of the United States. I still feel that way, regardless of whether it is President George Bush or President Bill Clinton. 
   So the sounds of war are about us. I am hearing the rumblings that our planes and our pilots might start flying soon, that bombs might start dropping soon. Our military people will be engaged in military activities of a warlike nature. Now is the time and here is the place to debate that. We cannot 
   shirk our constitutional responsibilities. The debate should be held this afternoon. The vote should be held, no later than tonight or early tomorrow, on whether or not this Congress will support that kind of activity in Kosovo. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. I also want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his remarks and I want to associate myself with the remarks by my friend from Wisconsin. It is clearly our objective to make the administration of farm program as fair as possible, recognizing the geographical differences of agriculture in America. 
   Senator KOHL is correct in his observation that farmers need and deserve a reliable risk management program that will not be tied to the political winds of any given year. For that reason, we must do all we can to improve and promote the availability of crop insurance products to farmers across the country. I point out to my colleagues that farmers could have purchased federal catastrophic coverage for a cost of fifty dollars to cover an entire crop. That is a bargain and I am still troubled by the reluctance of some farmers to invest in that minimal amount. Had a farmer made that simple investment in recent years, the amendment by the Senator from Alabama would not be necessary. 
   I am also concerned, as is Senator KOHL, about the effect this amendment may have on administration of the pending farm disaster program. Secretary Glickman came under criticism lately when he announced that payments to farmers would not begin until this summer. I admonish my colleagues that we must take no action that would exacerbate that problem. Farmers in Iowa, in Wisconsin, and in Alabama all need assistance sooner rather than later.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to address an unfulfilled obligation we have to our nation's veterans. The problem is a substantial backlog of requests by veterans for replacement and issuance of military medals. Today, I have introduced a bill, the ``Veterans Expedited Military Medals Act of 1999,'' that would require the Department of Defense to end this backlog. 
   I first became aware of this issue a few years ago after dozens of Iowa veterans began contacting my State offices requesting assistance in obtaining medals and other military decorations they earned while serving the country. These veterans had tried in vain--usually for months, sometimes for years--to navigate the vast Pentagon bureaucracy to receive their military decorations. The wait for medals routinely exceeded more than a year, even after intervention by my staff. I believe this is unacceptable. Our nation must continue its commitment to recognize the sacrifices made by our veterans in a timely manner. Addressing this simple concern will fulfill an important and solemn promise to those who served to preserve democracy both here and abroad. 
   Let me briefly share the story of Mr. Dale Homes, a Korean War veteran. Mr. Holmes fired a mortar on the front lines of the Korean War. Stacy Groff, the daughter of Mr. Holmes, tried unsuccessfully for three years through the normal Department of Defense channels to get the medals her father deserved. Ms. Goff turned to me after her letter writing produced no results. My office began an inquiry in January of 1997 and we were not able to resolve the issue favorably until September 1997. 
   Ms. Groff made a statement about the delays her father experienced that sum up my sentiments perfectly: ``I don't think it's fair.....My dad deserves --everybody deserves--better treatment than that.'' Ms. Groff could not be more correct. Our veterans deserve better than that from the country they served so courageously. 
   Another example that came through my district offices is Mr. James Lunde, a Vietnam-era veteran. His brother in law contacted my Des Moines office last year for help in obtaining a Purple Heart and other medals Mr. Lunde earned. These medals have been held up since 1975. Unfortunately, there is still no determination as to when Mr. Lunde's medals will be sent. 
   The numbers are disheartening and can sound almost unbelievable. For example, a small Army Reserve staff at the St. Louis Office faces a backlog of tens of thousands of requests for medals. So why the lengthy delays? 
   The primary reason DOD officials cite for these unconscionable delays is personnel and other resource shortages resulting from budget cuts and hiring freezes. For example, the Navy Liaison Office has gone from 5 or more personnel to 3 within the last 3 years. Prior to this, the turnaround time was 4-5 months. Budget shortages have delayed the agencies ability to replace employees who have left, and in cases where they can be replaced, the ``learning curve'' in training new employees leads to further delays. 
   Last year, during the debate over the Defense Appropriations bill, I offered an amendment to move the Department of Defense to end the backlog of unfulfilled military medal requests. The amendment was accepted by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has not moved to fix the problem. In fact, according to a recent communication from the Army, the problem has only worsened. The Army currently cites a backlog of 98,000 requests for medals.  
   So today, I am introducing a bill to fix the problem once and for all. My bill directs the Secretary of Defense to allocate resources necessary to eliminate the backlog of requests for military medals. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense shall make available to the Army Reserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Air Force Personnel Center, the National Archives and Records Administration, and any other relevant office or command, the resources necessary to solve the problem. These resources could be in the form of increased personnel, equipment or whatever these offices need for this problem. In addition, this reallocation of resources is only to be made in a way that ``does not detract from the performance of other personnel service and personnel support activities within the DOD.'' Representative Lane Evans of Illinois has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again I thank my friend and my colleague and my leader, Senator SPECTER, for bringing forth this amendment, which is common sense and which goes to the heart of what the smoking problem in America is all about. It is about health. 
   I might just say, at the outset, really the provision in the supplemental bill we are talking about should not even be on the supplemental. It is not an appropriations measure. It more appropriately ought to be in the Finance Committee, but it was slipped in as a rider on the appropriations bill, the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON. 
   What Senator HUTCHISON's amendment says is all the money already recouped by the States in their settlement with the tobacco companies should be kept by the States and they can do with it whatever they want to do with it. That is all right as far at the State's money goes. 
   I have no problem with that. But that also includes the Federal share of Medicaid. As I have continually pointed out, under the Social Security Act the States are required to go after recoupments in Medicaid from third parties. In fact, they are the only ones who can sue for third party recoupment. The Federal Government is preempted from doing that. Only the States can do that. So they act as an agent for the Federal Government and recoup them. Keep in mind, the law states, regarding any money recouped by the States for Medicaid, the Federal portion has to be returned to the Federal Government. 
   We have to keep in mind what we are talking about here. Are we talking about the fact that the tobacco companies didn't build a number of highways in Texas? Or that they did not build prisons in Alabama? Or they did not build a sports arena in Michigan--or on and on and on? No. That is not why these lawsuits were brought. They were brought because tobacco is the biggest killer we have in America today. You add up alcohol, accident, 
   suicide, homicide, AIDS, illegal drugs, fires--add them all up and tobacco kills more a year than all of these combined. 
   What has this tobacco debate been about, that we have been here for years and years on end debating? That is what it is about. Tobacco is hooking young people, getting them addicted. And the tobacco companies have lied and lied and lied, year after year, and covered up, and fought with powerful money and powerful interests here in Washington to keep us from doing what we need to do to protect the public health. That is what it is all about. 
   Now, the CDC estimates that smoking among high school students has risen 32 percent since 1991--32 percent. The tobacco companies say they are going to cut down on their advertising to kids and stuff. If they really want to do that, get rid of the Marlboro Man. You don't see the Marlboro Man disappearing, do you? No, he is still out there. And the Virginia Slims and all that kind of stuff is still out there; the Marlboro gear--that is all out there. They are still hooking kids. 
   Tobacco, an estimated $50 billion a year in health care costs alone, and a big portion of that is borne by the Federal taxpayers who finance over half the costs of Medicaid. 
   Again, to repeat for emphasis' sake, what does the Specter amendment do? It only would require the States to use 20 percent of the total settlement to reduce tobacco use and 30 percent for public health programs or tobacco farmer assistance, helping some of our tobacco farmers, and we would then waive the Federal claim to the tobacco settlement funds. We do not dictate what the States spend their money on. If the States want to take their portion and build a sports arena, that is up to the voters of that State. I can tell you if it happened in my State, I would be on the side of any other taxpayers in my State, suing the Governor or anybody else who was spending the money that way, because I think that money is held in trust for the very purposes which I just enumerated, and that is to cut down on smoking and to help the public health. 
   CBO estimates the Federal share would be about $14 billion over 5 years.  Others are saying that the Federal Government had no role in these lawsuits. I just covered that. 
   Under the Social Security Act, it is the responsibility of the States to recover any costs and, in fact, the law states that only the States can file such suits. 
   I want to correct something that was said last night by my colleague from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS. He claimed that only one State had filed suit to recover tobacco-related Medicaid costs. Sorry. That is wrong. In fact, the following States had Medicaid claims in their lawsuits: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin--all had Medicaid claims in their lawsuits. 
   I think this is really the crux of it--whether or not a State included a Medicaid claim isn't the issue. The fact is every State that settled in November of 1998, and that included all 50 States and the territories, even those that did not include a Medicaid claim in their suit, waived their right to recover tobacco-related Medicaid costs in the future. Why do you think that was put in the settlement? If, in fact, the lawsuits were not about Medicaid, why do you think that the tobacco companies came in and insisted, as a condition of the settlement, that the States had to waive their right for any future suits based on Medicaid? It is curious. If that is not what this was all about, why did they put that in there? Because the tobacco companies, smart lawyers that they have got, knew this is what it is about. It is about health care. It is about hooking kids on smoking. 
   They could see that the States are going to get all this money. What do the States want to do with it? They want to reduce debt. They want to build prisons and highways. They want to reduce taxes. 
   How many are going to use it to cut down on what the tobacco companies are most afraid of? What they are afraid of is losing young people who would not be smoking, who won't take up the habit. That is what they are afraid of. That is why they put it in there. Not only did the settlement waive the right of the States forever to sue to recoup for Medicaid, it waives our rights, the Federal Government's rights to sue. Why? Because under the Social Security law, only the States can sue for recoupment under third parties. When they waive their right, they waive our rights. The States, in making this deal with the tobacco companies, have effectively taken away the right of the Federal Government to go into court and to go after tobacco companies to get the Federal taxpayers' share of the money for the health care costs of Medicaid. That is what it is about. 
   The provision put in by the Senator from Texas says let them have it. Let the States have all this money. If they want to build highways, let them build them. I tell my colleagues, I know where the tobacco lobby is on this one. The tobacco lobby is foursquare for this provision in the bill, because they do not want States spending money to cut down on teen smoking. Some States will. I compliment and commend the Governor of my own State of Iowa who has said that they will use a large portion of this for education, intervention, cutting down on 
   youth smoking. How much, I do not know, a large portion of it. 
   Again, this is a bipartisan, commonsense amendment. For the life of me, I do not know why anyone would oppose it, unless it is under some theory that we can't tell the States what to do with this money. I don't want to tell the States what to do with their money, but when the Federal taxpayers provide over 50 percent of Medicaid monies to the States and we are paying 50 billion bucks a year in health-related costs and much of that through Medicaid, then I think we have a right and an obligation to say that some portion of that money that is Federal money ought to go for health-related purposes.

   Mr. HARKIN. For example, in Maine, I am told the Governor wants to use it for a tax cut. In Michigan, the Governor wants to use the settlement for college scholarships; no funds for tobacco prevention. The Nevada Governor wants it for college scholarships. New Hampshire's Governor wants the money for education; no proposal on tobacco. In New York, the Governor wants to spend 75 percent for debt relief. In South Dakota, the Governor wants money for prisoners, nothing on tobacco. In Rhode Island, the Governor wants money to cut the car tax. That is all well and good, but that is not what this is about. 
   I say to my friends, we have a statement of policy from the Executive Office of the President which says, referring to the emergency supplemental bill, S. 554:  
   Were the bill to be presented to the President with the Senate Committee's proposed offsets and several objectionable riders discussed below, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.  
   One of the provisions:  
   A provision that would completely relinquish the Federal taxpayers' share of the Medicaid-related claims in the comprehensive State tobacco settlement without any commitment whatsoever by the States to use those funds to stop youth smoking. Federal taxpayers paid more than half, an average of 57 percent of Medicaid smoking-related expenditures. The Administration believes that the States should retain those funds but should make a commitment that the Federal share of the settlement's proceeds will be spent on shared national and State priorities: to reduce youth smoking, protect tobacco farmers, improve public health and assist children.  
   So there we have it. If this amendment stays in there untouched, the President's senior advisors will recommend a veto. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my chairman and friend from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this issue. 
   Again, let's cut through all the arguments, all the smoke and the haze, if you will. What is this about? It is about public health. It is about cutting down on youth smoking. That is what it is about. 
   Now, my friend from Florida--with whom I wanted to engage in a colloquy, but I understand he had to go to a committee meeting--pointed out that a lot of the States sued on 
   different bases--RICO, racketeering, prices--but 32 States, including Florida, included Medicaid. As any good lawyer can tell you, it is the old ``spaghetti theory'' of suing. You just throw the spaghetti at the wall, and whatever sticks, that is what you go on. They just threw a bunch of stuff in there when they sued to recoup from the tobacco companies. 
   But it is interesting to note that, in the final settlement, the States waived their rights in the future to sue to reclaim any moneys under Medicaid. Why was that put in there? I will tell you why. Because the tobacco companies wanted it in there, because it not only precluded the States from suing, it precludes the Federal Government from recouping Federal shares of money for the health costs that we pay out in Medicaid to take care of people who are sick and dying of tobacco-related illnesses. That is what this is all about. 
   Some say we should not mandate to the States how to spend their money. We are not trying to do that. The basis of this is public health. At least a portion of the Federal moneys--not even all of it--ought to go to smoking cessation programs and for a variety of other public health programs. 
   The Senator from Pennsylvania knows as well as I do--we sit on the Appropriations Committee as chairman and ranking member--we have a lot of public health needs out there. We are getting shortchanged. I know States have needs for highways, bridges, sports arenas, prisons and things like that; but I daresay they did not bring these suits against the tobacco companies because the tobacco companies weren't building enough highways or sports arenas or prisons or anything else. What they brought it on was the health problems that tobacco companies are causing their people. 
   Well, I might also point out that, in the previous settlement with the Liggett tobacco company, some States did give back their portion of that settlement to the Federal Government, covering the Medicaid portions of those costs. I don't have the exact figures, but I believe Florida was one of those States--Florida, Louisiana, and Massachusetts were the three States that returned some of that money. So that is really what this is about. 
   I know the Governors have weighed in on this, both Democrats and Republicans. Well, I can understand their point. They are trying to get as much money as they can for their States; that is their responsibility. But it seems to me that we have to look at the national picture and what this is all about. It is about health care and cutting down on teen smoking. That is what this is really about. 
   To cut through all the smoke and haze, let us do our responsibility to the Federal taxpayers, to the Medicaid Program, and give some guidance and direction--not explicitly saying how the States have to spend it; let them use their wisdom--but give them guidance and direction and say that at least 20 percent has to be used for smoking cessation and 30 percent for a broad variety of other public health measures, including helping tobacco farmers switch from that crop to others. It is the only decent thing to do. 
   I reserve the time I have. How much time do I have?

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the arguments made by the author of the amendment, Senator TORRICELLI--of course, I am a cosponsor of the amendment--and the very lucid and well thought out arguments of my friend from Connecticut. 
   First I will respond to my friend from Connecticut by saying that he used the word ``ill-timed'' on a number of occasions in his argument. I quite disagree with my friend on that. I believe this is perfect timing. 
   What are we talking about here? We are on a supplemental appropriations bill. We are making some cuts someplace. We are spending money. We are trying to reach some emergency spending moneys that we need, and we are all looking for places to save money. Here is one place we can save some money. That is what this is about, too. 
   If there is one thing I continually hear from my constituents in Iowa and from people around the country, it is, ``How much more money are you going to pour down that rat hole?'' How much more money are we going to spend on these special prosecutors that go on and on and on? I think the timing is very appropriate right now, when we are on an appropriations bill talking about how much money we are spending and how much money we can save to meet critical needs in this country. I think it is very appropriately timed on this legislation. 
   Mr. President, the Starr investigation has been traumatic for this country, it has been divisive for our national fabric, and these gaping wounds need to be healed. The focus so far has been on allowing the independent counsel statute to lapse on the assumption that it will put an end to the episode. In reality, that is far from the case. 
   The independent counsel statute will lapse on June 30, but it does not put an end to the ongoing investigations. Keep in mind that the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey and others, of which I am a cosponsor, basically goes just to those investigations that have been ongoing for over 3 years. There are a couple that are less than 3 years. Our amendment does not touch them. 
   We are only answering the three--actually there are four. The Senator from Connecticut mentioned the fourth one. It caught me by surprise and I had to look it up. It turns out the fourth one is an ongoing investigation into Secretary of HUD Samuel R. Pierce. If I am not mistaken, he was Secretary of HUD under Ronald Reagan. They still have an investigation going on him. It just goes to show you, these things just go on year after year after year. 
   What we are saying is, if we have an independent counsel who has been operating for more than 3 years, in 6 months--by the end of this year--they have to close up shop and turn it over to the Justice Department. 
   We are not saying that no one will be let off. No appeal is going to be dropped. No valid investigative lead will be abandoned. The cases will be pursued in keeping with Justice 
   Department rules by some of the most experienced prosecutors in the country. 
   Again, I point out there is little doubt that these cases will be under scrutiny internally at the Justice Department, certainly by the media and by the Congress. 
   We have a President, an Executive, of one party, Congress run by another party. I daresay there are going to be some checks and balances here. Anyone who thinks this can be smothered by the Justice Department does not recognize how this town works. What it will do is save us a lot of money, and that is what I keep hearing about from my constituents. 
   Until I started looking at this independent counsel law during the impeachment trial we had in the Senate, I had not paid all that much attention to it. In fact, I admit freely, when the extension passed in 1993, I was one of those who voted to extend it. I wish now I had not, because I think it has run amok. That is why I will be in favor of letting it expire on June 30. 
   In looking at this, I was trying to find out how Ken Starr could rack up a bill between $40 million and $50 million in less than 3 years. How could that be possible? 
   I began trying to find the line items where he was spending the money. Guess what I found out. We cannot get  that information. I can go to the Department of Agriculture and I can find out where every last nickel they spend goes. I can go to the Defense Department and find out exactly where every nickel they spend goes. They have to line item everything. That is true of any branch of Government but not of the independent counsel. Believe it or not, you cannot find out where he is spending the money. All they have to put it under is general broad categories, summaries. 
   For example, here is a bill, and this came from the Los Angeles Times. They said they paid $30,517 for psychological analysis of evidence in the suicide of former White House lawyer Vincent Foster by the same Washington group that looked into the untimely death of rock musician Kurt Cobain. What is that all about? 
   Then there is $370 a month in parking. We do not know who for or what for, but it is there, $370 a month. Here is $729,000 on five private investigators who were hired to supplement dozens of FBI agents. What did it go for? Where did that money go? We do not know. Here is a report that Mr. Starr paid $19,000 a month in rent at a luxury apartment building for staff members--19,000 bucks a month? I would like to know what he was renting. Again, we do not know because we cannot get into the line items. 
   That is just another glaring deficiency in this huge loophole that we opened with the independent counsel law. It is, in fact, a fourth branch of Government with no checks and balances and no accountability to Congress. 
   Despite the fact that Mr. Starr made his referral to Congress, it was considered and dispensed with through a long, tortuous episode in the House and long, tortuous episode in the Senate with the impeachment trial. According to newspaper accounts, Mr. Starr has no plans to wind things down. In fact, there are indications he may keep the investigation going not for 1 year, not for 2 years, but for 3 more years. That is why we are offering our amendment; cut funding in 6 months for any independent counsel investigation that has been ongoing for 3 years or more. That is enough time. 
   The Starr investigation has been going now for almost 5 years, and I think we are pretty darn close to $50 million, maybe more by now. We are just saying, during these 6 months, to Mr. Starr and these other independent counsel, even the one who is investigating Samuel Pierce from the Reagan administration, it is time to put their books together and make any referrals for any additional action or investigations to the Attorney General. 
   This deadline gives plenty of time to the independent counsel to finish their work. And, again, if there is any problem, the American people can rest assured that these cases will be handled by a specialized office of the Justice Department that has been doing this for over 20 years. 
   I think we have all concluded that the independent counsel law is fatally flawed. Under these circumstances, it would be a mistake to let the Starr investigation continue on indefinitely without any end date, without any oversight, without any rein on prosecutorial excess, without any rein on money. 
   I think we ought to listen to people and let the country move on. Mr. Starr has had long enough to investigate Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky. The Senate considered the charges against the President. We dispensed with them. I think 6 months is long enough to wrap things up. Make the referrals he deems necessary so we can put this behind us. 
   Again, I just point out, Mr. President, that Mr. Starr is sort of like a gold-plated energizer bunny--his investigation keeps going on and on, and the money just keeps going up and up and up. 
   Twenty independent counsel investigations have been initiated since 1978, at a cost estimated at nearly $150 million. Here is one. Donald Smaltz began his $17 million investigation of former Ag Secretary Espy in November 1994. He filed 30 counts. The jury threw them all out. The jury threw them all out. He spent $17 million. What happened? Well, it sure ruined Agriculture Secretary Espy, I can tell you that; but the jury found him innocent--$17 million. 
   David Barrett began his investigation, which I understand is now around $7 million, of former Housing Secretary Cisneros 
   in May of 1995. 
   So the bills just keep getting racked up. The independent counsel keep going, and the people of this country are wondering, What in the heck are we doing? Here we are on an appropriations bill, we are trying to scrounge every nickel, every penny we need to meet the critical needs of people in this country. We have it in the farm sector. We have a lot of critical needs in rural America, I can tell you that right now, with the devastating crop prices and livestock prices. And we are looking for money for some assistance for farmers. We can't find it. Yet we have millions for Ken Starr and for all these other investigators to just keep living in luxury apartments and running up the bills to the taxpayers with no accountability. 
   So that is why I think we have to do this. Six months is long enough. I do not know what the Governmental Affairs Committee will report out, when they report it out. It is my own observation that when this law expires on June 30 there are not the votes here to extend it. Some people may want to extend it, but I do not think there will be the 60-plus votes necessary to extend that law. But that does not make any difference; the ones that are going on now can just keep right on going. I just think it is time to heed the common wisdom of the people of this country and shut the spigot off and turn it over to the Justice Department by the end of the year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, for the information of Senators, I intend to withdraw this amendment after talking about it and engaging in somewhat of a colloquy with Senator COCHRAN, and I think Senator LEVIN also wanted to speak on this.  
   Basically, let me describe what the amendment does. It requires that not later than January 1 of 2001, the President will submit to Congress a comparative study. It is a study that would provide a quantitative analysis of the relevant risks and the likelihood of the full range of current and emerging national security threats to the territory of the United States. 
   This says:  
   It shall be carried out in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of all other departments and agencies of the Federal Government that have responsibilities, expertise, and interests that the President considers relevant to the comparison.  
   Then I listed a number of items, including long-range ballistic missiles; bombers and other aircraft; cruise missiles; submarines; surface ships; biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons; and any other weapons of mass destruction that are delivered by means other than missiles, including covert means and commercial methods, such as cargo aircraft, cargo ships, trucks, and any other means. 
   I would like to describe what I am getting at here. As we look at the bill before us, S. 257, which is kind of narrowly drawn in terms of ballistic missile defense, we seem to be getting kind of overfocus on this, a focus that if only we build some kind of a ballistic missile defense system, it will secure us from the weapons of mass destruction that threaten us. But I am not so certain that is really the major threat that we face, and whether or not all of the money put into that, all of our eggs into that basket, so to speak, really would protect us from what I consider to be more viable and determinable threats to our national security. 
   For example, what about some of the key threats we hear about every day? Well, I have a chart that lists some of the typical types of national security threats facing our Nation today. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the chart in the RECORD.

   Mr. HARKIN. For example, a national missile defense system would be ineffective against a truck-bomb attack on the United States. Of course, we have had some experience, regrettably, in that area. It would not be effective against a chemical weapons attack in the United States. Now, we haven't had that, but Japan has. What about biological weapons that would be delivered by a terrorist? No small threat. It seems like there is an anthrax incident every week here in the country. Again, if there is an anthrax scare, the first line of defense is going to be the local police and firefighters struggling to deal with the threat, and our State and local public health officials, and other health care people. 
   However, a national missile defense system is no solution to combat this very viable threat. The list goes on with a cruise missile attack. It is much cheaper for a country to engage in; it would be launched offshore. Yet, a national missile defense would be ineffective. Even a bomber attack, coming in under our radar screens, would be ineffective for missile defense; and even some of the ``loose nukes'' in the former Soviet Union, if in fact there were to be warheads smuggled out of the Soviet Union and enter the country by boat, plane, or truck across our borders. A missile defense is totally ineffective. Also listed is the theater missile defense, which would also be ineffective against those threats. 
   General Shelton of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees and has said:  
   There are other serious threats out there in addition to that posed by ballistic missiles. We know, for example, that there are adversaries with chemical and biological weapons that can attack the United States today. They could do it with a briefcase--by infiltrating our territory across our shores or through our airports.  
   I am just concerned that we are focusing so much on this national ballistic missile defense that we are forgetting about these other more determinable and viable threats. 
   My amendment seeks to provide for a study, sort of a comparative study, and a quantitative analysis of these risks: What is the risk of a ballistic missile attack on the United States? What is that? And what is the risk of, say, a biological weapons attack on the United States? What do we have, either deployed or in development, to protect against each one of those?--thinking about the relative risk. I wanted this study to be done by January 1, 2001, before we go rushing down the road investing more billions of dollars into a ballistic missile defense that would prove absolutely defenseless against these other viable threats. 
   That is what I was seeking to do with this amendment. 
   I have had some conversations with the Senator from Mississippi about this. I yield for any colloquy that we might engage in on this.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Mississippi. I understand that in the intelligence community that they only look at possible threats but they don't make a comparative analysis, nor do they deal with the status of how the United States counters the threats. 
   Again, I am saying we need also to engage those agencies on the front line, not just the Pentagon. But I am talking about the Department of Justice, FBI, and HHS--all of these agencies that handle biological, chemical threats. We need to engage them in this comparative quantitative analysis. 
   Again, I want to make it clear to my friend from Mississippi that I basically was not going to support the bill because I felt that the words ``technologically feasible'' in the bill and saying that we should deploy as soon as technologically possible--that that was kind of putting the cart before the horse. 
   I was also concerned a little bit about what this might mean for further negotiations on arms control, our START II and possibly the START III, and the ABM Treaty. But with the adoption of the Landrieu amendment last night, I think that puts a balance here. I don't mind the research and stuff that goes into looking at a possible ballistic missile defense. I think we have to examine all of these. But it has to be done in a balanced way and in a way that sort of takes into account what those threats are to our national security on kind of a quantitative basis without putting everything in just sort of one basket, so to speak.  
   But I think with the adoption of the Landrieu amendment that it is much more balanced. And I therefore support the bill. I wanted to offer this amendment to try to again put that balance in the bill while looking at these other possible threats. I understand what the Senator says--that perhaps this is more amenable, or a more likely prospect for the armed services authorization bill. I take that in good faith. 
   I spoke with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and also ranking member, Senator LEVIN, about this. I think I can represent that Senator WARNER was open to the idea, without knowing more about it and without having had an opportunity to really fully look at it.

   Mr. HARKIN. I will just take about 5 more minutes. 
   I cannot resist the opportunity to talk a little bit about this concept of the ballistic missile defense system. I was just reading the history of what happened in France prior to World War II. I got to thinking; someone described this ballistic missile defense as sort of our new Maginot Line, so I said I want to find out about the Maginot Line, really what it was. 
   Louis Snyder wrote the ``Historical Guide to World War II.'' It is a basic reference work for anyone studying the history of World War II. I recommend that my colleagues read through this volume of history, especially the story of the Maginot Line. 
   In the late 1920s and 1930s, France constructed a huge series of fortifications on its border with Germany. It was named after Andre Maginot, French minister of war who started the project. A huge workforce constructed the fortifications that were considered impregnable by the French military. More than 26 million cubic feet of cement was used to build a series of giant pillboxes, gun turrets, and dragons teeth. Elevators led to underground passages that included living quarters, hospitals, cafeterias, and storehouses. It sounds like our missile silo bunkers. 
   More than $1 billion was spent by the French military. That is in 1930s dollars. Factored today that would be $12 billion they spent to build the Maginot Line, and from a nation much smaller than the United States. It was truly an awesome endeavor intended to thwart a great threat to France; that is, an invasion by Germany. 
   Of course, there was just one problem. The German military high command were no fools. They developed an adequate counter. They simply went around the Maginot Line. By going through Belgium, the Maginot Line proved almost useless in defending the 
   French homeland, and it did nothing to counter the blitzkrieg tactics used by the Germans to counter static defenses. 
   I might also add here that Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who I believe was not a general at that time but a colonel, opposed the Maginot Line, but the French Government, I am sure, probably in sort of a working relationship with concrete people and builders and those who wanted to make a lot of money building this huge fortification, decided to go down that road. Charles de Gaulle warned of the blitzkrieg coming and that the Maginot Line would do nothing to protect them against it. 
   I think the analogy of the Maginot Line to ballistic missile defense is startling. Are we going to spend tens of billions of dollars on a defense against a single threat? Will our enemies simply go around the ballistic missile defense, our Maginot Line? Of course, they will. The counter is simple. Truck bombs, weapons of mass destruction slipped  into our country by plane, boat, or truck would all go around the ballistic missile defense. 
   Perhaps some of my colleagues want a simple answer to real and potential threats from around the world. We want a simple silver bullet defense against a dangerous world. We may spend billions of dollars for this new Maginot Line, but the result will be the same as it was for the French 60 years ago. Life is just more complicated than what a national missile defense could counter. 
   In fact, the Maginot Line analogy applies, I think, to the psychology of missile defense. As Louis Snyder wrote, ``The French public, too, had an almost mystical faith in the Maginot Line and believed its defense to be absolute and total.'' 
   Mr. President, I hope we don't fall in the same trap, but ever since star wars started under the Reagan administration, we have had this sort of concept that we could build some kind of a dome over the United States that would be impregnable, that would totally and fully protect all of our citizens. That is mythical. There is no such dome. A truck bomb, a terrorist attack by boat, a suitcase, anthrax poisoning, that missile shield would never protect us from anything such as that. 
   So I hope and trust that the authorizing committee will take a look at all these other threats, I think much more real, much more determinable, and I believe much more effectively countered other systems than a national ballistic missile defense system. 
   So that, again, was the purpose of my amendment. It was to try to bring balance. I appreciate the fact that this bill is focused on one area. But I still believe that this is the way we ought to go if we are going to make any rational decisions around here on how we spend our taxpayers' dollars on defense. 
   I think we need this kind of study, and I appreciate what Senator LEVIN has said. I appreciate his leadership. In my conversation with Senator WARNER from Virginia, the chairman, he was open to this, and I hope and trust that the Armed Services Committee will proceed down that line and provide us with the kind of balanced information we need on the Appropriations Committee before we go down this road of spending billions of dollars on a ballistic missile defense.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend and congratulate Senator SPECTER, my chairman, for taking the lead on this issue, for holding the hearings, doing all the work that is necessary to get the information that we need to come up with this amendment. Senator SPECTER has certainly been the lead in addressing this very vital issue of health in the United States, medical research, and all that goes along with making our people healthier citizens. 
   He has always taken a lead on this one issue of how we get tobacco use down among teenagers, which is one of the most serious health risks in our society today. I want to thank Senator SPECTER for taking the lead on this amendment. It is a very, very, very important amendment. The repercussions of this single amendment alone could do more to enhance the health of our young people in the future than perhaps anything we are going to do this year. I will get into more about that later, but this single amendment, if adopted, I maintain, will do more to enhance the well-being and health of our future citizens--the kids today--10, 15, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, than anything that we will do this year. 
   Why do I say that? Look at this chart. This really illustrates what is happening today and continuing to happen with the consumption of tobacco. Tobacco kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs and fires, all combined. I use this chart a lot because I think it just spells it out in stark detail. Add up everything from alcohol to homicides to AIDS and illegal drugs. How much money do we spend every year fighting illegal drugs? Compare it to how many people die of tobacco-related illnesses. It is minute. 
   This is what we are going after--cutting down the illnesses and deaths caused by tobacco uses in this country. It is an epidemic. Tobacco also imposes a heavy financial cost, $50 billion a year estimated in health costs alone. And a big portion of that is borne by Federal taxpayers, who, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, pay over half the cost of Medicaid. The average, as he said, is 57 percent. Sometimes it goes as high as 77 percent. In no case is it less than 50 percent of the Federal taxes used to fund the Medicaid programs in the States. 
   I want to commend the States for their efforts to recover the costs that they and the Federal Government have borne related to tobacco. What our amendment does, as the Senator from Pennsylvania very correctly pointed out, is simply require the States to use 20 percent of the total settlement on reducing tobacco use, mainly going after teen smoking, 
   because if we know we can get it there, we solve the problem, but just to use 20 percent of that and 30 percent for public health programs--again, public health broadly; we did not spell it out, we did not try to micromanage--or for tobacco farmer assistance, to help some of the tobacco farmers in some of our States in their transition away from growing tobacco to doing something else. 
   Again, our amendment did not in any way dictate specific programs the states can spend the money on. It did not require the Federal Government have a role in designing any initiative the states undertake. This amendment simply sets broad, commonsense parameters on a portion of the funds. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Federal share of the State's tobacco settlement would total $14 billion over the next 5 years. That is a lot of money, $14 billion. 
   I know there are some who are saying that the Federal Government had no role in these lawsuits; therefore, no right to these funds. I heard that argument made in the committee when the amendment was adopted. That is not true. If it were true, we would not be here today. 
   Keep in mind that Medicaid is a Federal-State partnership. The Federal Government pays over 50 percent of the cost of each State's Medicaid Program. But here is the real clincher. Under the Social Security Act, it is the responsibility of the States to recover any costs caused by third parties. In fact, the law says that only the States can file such suits. 
   It is really kind of, I think, shading the truth a little bit to say the Federal Government was not involved in the lawsuits. The Federal Government could not be involved in the lawsuits. By law, only the States can file such suits. Then the Medicaid law requires a State to turn back to the Federal Government its share of any money the State recovers. That is the law. 
   A, the Social Security Act says it is the responsibility of the States to recover any costs caused by third parties. 
   B, the law says only the States can file such lawsuits. 
   C, Medicaid law says the States then have to turn back to the Federal Government its share of any Federal money that they recover. 
   All right. What happened? The States settled this case with the tobacco companies, and in November of 1998, when  the States settled this case, even those that did not include a Medicaid claim in their suit, waived their right to any future claims under Medicaid. 
   Think about that. If the States, in conjunction with the tobacco companies--and I have to hand it to the tobacco companies, they have great lawyers; they have the best--they negotiated with the States that if you settle for $206 billion over 25 years, we will agree to that if you waive your right to any future claims under Medicaid. 
   The States said, ``We waive our rights.'' By waiving their rights, they waive our rights, the Federal Government's rights, to go out and reclaim any of those Federal tax dollars that went out. So the States have, by using the law, precluded us on the Federal end from reclaiming any of these moneys. 
   It is just not right. Federal taxpayers have provided over 50 percent of those Medicaid payments to those States. As I said, the law requires the States to file those lawsuits and only the States can file those lawsuits. The States then must, under the law, return those funds to the Federal Government. Yet, they made an agreement with the tobacco companies to waive all of their rights and, thus, waiving our rights. 
   Turning over all of the Federal share of the tobacco settlement to the States without any requirement that a penny of the funds be used to reduce teen smoking defies common sense. The whole purpose of this effort was to protect our kids and to cut down on smoking. Now that the States have settled with the tobacco companies, it only makes sense to use some of those moneys to strengthen the public health system and to fight tobacco use. 
   As the Senator from Pennsylvania said, I have to ask the 
   questions: Did the States file their lawsuits against the tobacco companies because the tobacco companies were not building highways in their States? 
   Did the States file a lawsuit against the tobacco companies because they were not building enough prisons in their States? 
   Did the States file the lawsuit against the tobacco companies because you, tobacco companies, were not building a sports arena in our State? 
   Did they file the lawsuit because you, tobacco companies, were not building enough highways in our State? 
   No, that was not the basis of the lawsuit. The basis of the lawsuit was the health impact on its citizens from smoking. 
   Now we hear from the States, oh, now they want to use the money for highways, they want to use the money to build some prisons, they want to use the money to build a sports arena, they want to use the money for tax relief, and on and on and on and on. That was not the basis for the lawsuits. 
   The basis for the lawsuits were to recoup the costs that Medicaid spent taking care of the health impacts of smoking on our people. It had nothing to do with paving a highway or building a prison or anything else. 
   Again, we are not even saying that the States have to use their money for that. If the States want to use their share of the money to build a prison, that is their business. I can tell you, if I were a citizen of a State, and our State legislature and Governor were spending money that way, I would be vocal about it in my State, and I assume other people would be in their States. But that is not for us here at the Federal level. It is for us at the Federal level to say how about the Federal portion. What should you do with that? Should we be allowed to build highways with it when the basis of the lawsuit had to do with the health impact and the deaths of people that we paid for on Medicaid to take care of them because they got hooked on tobacco, because they were lied to by the tobacco companies? 
   All we are saying is that the Federal share be used to attack tobacco use and to protect the public health. How much are we saying? Fifty percent: 20 percent to reduce teen smoking, 30 percent for a broad variety of public health programs to reduce smoking or to assist farmers, to assist the tobacco farmers. 
   No State receives less than 50 percent of its Medicaid money from the Federal Government. Some States receive as high as 77 percent. The average is 57 percent. So actually we are being somewhat generous in this amendment. We are not saying you have to spend even all of your Federal moneys. 
   Some States are going to get a windfall. Those States that are getting 70 percent of their Medicaid moneys paid for by the Federal Government, if our amendment is adopted, will have at least 20 percent of that Federal money that they can use as they see fit. Rather than trying to draw the line in each State, we just settled on the 50 percent and said that is fair for everybody. It gives some States, I will admit, a bit of a windfall. Again, it does not take away from any State any more than the Federal shares that they already get. 
   Mr. President, this is a bipartisan, commonsense amendment. I hope all of our colleagues can support it. It will be a dramatic step forward in saving lives and protecting children and saving billions of dollars in future health care costs. 
   I know you are going to hear talk about how all the Governors support the Hutchison amendment that was added in committee. By the way, it should not even be on this bill. It should be in the Finance Committee. All the Governors support it. I said to myself, ``If I was Governor, I probably would support it, too.'' But I am not a Governor. 
   I represent my State, but we all have to represent the national interest here. More than that, we have to represent the interest of those people who are getting hooked on tobacco and what this tobacco lawsuit was all about. 
   So I think we ought to keep that in mind as the debate goes forward. I know we will hear some more this evening, but tomorrow morning we will have more debate on the amendment and we will have more to say at that time. 
   Again, what we have to keep in mind is the basic underlying fact: Why was the lawsuit brought? On what basis? On the health basis, Medicare expenditures to pay for the sickness and illness and death of people. Who put the money into Medicaid? The Federal Government, 57 percent average; States, 43 percent average. 
   Law requires the States to file the lawsuits. Law requires the States to return to the Federal Government the Federal Government share of those lawsuits. 
   Law--only the States can file those lawsuits. 
   Settlement facts--States settle with the tobacco companies and strike a sweetheart deal, where they waive all of our rights to ever sue again under Medicaid to recoup those costs--waive our rights. Think about that. That is why this amendment is so important, Mr. President. If this amendment is adopted, it will have a big impact on cutting down on health care costs in the future. That is what it is all about. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation calling  upon the National Park Service to conduct a study of the Loess Hills in western Iowa. This study would be the first official step towards possible national protection for the Loess Hills. 
   Specifically, this legislation would require the National Park Service to monitor the area between Waubansie State Park and Stone Park to study the possibility of a portion of this area to receive National Park status. 
   Loess Hills is a unique national treasure that was formed by ancient glaciers and hundreds of centuries of westerly winds. Only the loess soil in China has accumulated as high as Iowa's. Although these hills have survived for hundreds of centuries, today they are beginning to crumble. Urban sprawl is unfortunately beginning to take its toll on Loess Hills. Protecting this area must be given a high priority. 
   In 1986, the Loess Hills area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. This gives recognition to this area as an area of national significance. Although this designation encourages landowners to use conservation practices in use of the area, this designation does nothing to control land ownership or to restrict land use. 
   The only thing holding the loess in place is the roots of the vegetation. Today, however, as the human exploitation of the hills continues to increase the destruction of the vegetation, loess is left once again blowing in the winds as the fragile hills begins to flatten. 
   This is of great concern to me. This area which marks one of the only remaining natural ecosystems in the state is one of the few areas where Iowans can experience nature. Iowa presently ranks 49th among the 50 states in National Park and Forest space. Iowa is also 400 miles away from a sizable national recreation area (the Boundary Waters Canoe Area). The Loess Hills, however, is an area of national significance and has the potential to be a much needed National Park for the Plains States. 
   Mr. President, since 1992, I have secured funding through the United States Department of Agriculture to design better bridges and other structures in the Loess Hills area to reduce soil erosion. But more needs to be done. 
   One thing I would like to make clear--this study can only be successfully implemented with the participation of local governments in western Iowa and private property owners. 
   The Loess Hills are an Iowa treasure. This legislation would begin the process of making Loess Hills a national treasure.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning Methamphetamine reduction legislation the Senator from the State of New Mexico and I are introducing today. 
   Methamphetamine is fast becoming a leading illegal drug in our Nation. From quiet suburbs, to city streets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth destroys thousands of lives and families every year. 
   This highly addictive drug is reaching epidemic proportions as it sweeps from the west coast, ravages the Midwest, and begins to touch the East. To illustrate the violence it elicits in people, methamphetamine is cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of domestic violence cases in Iowa and a leading factor in a majority of violent crimes committed in the State. 
   In 1996, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Methamphetamine Control Act, which has done some good. However, in talking to local enforcement and concerned citizens across Iowa and the Midwest, its obvious that the methamphetamine problem has exploded beyond anything we envisioned in 1996. 
   The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation on labs continues to escalate. In the Midwest alone, the number of clandestine meth labs confiscated and destroyed for 1998 is five times the number confiscated and destroyed in 1997. The cost of cleanup for each lab ranges from $5,000 to $90,000 and creates a toxic trap to law enforcement officers and children who find them. 
   Mr. President, the Midwest is not alone in this battle. The impact of this epidemic has reached the West and Southwest, including the state of New Mexico. In Albuquerque alone, law enforcement has seized four times as much meth last year as they did in the previous year, and they have identified and shut down twice as many meth  labs as they had in the previous year. New Mexico has also seen an increase in meth trafficking on the New Mexico-Mexico border, as have the States of Arizona and California. 
   The problem has spread to the rural communities and my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, is concerned that the cheap cost of meth will threaten America's youth with yet another life-threatening drug. 
   That's why today, Senator BINGAMAN and I are introducing the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Abuse Reduction Act of 1999. Senators MURRAY and JOHNSON are cosponsoring this measure. A similar bill is being introduced in the House by Congressman BOSWELL. 
   This legislation takes a comprehensive, common sense approach in battling this growing epidemic. It calls for an increase in resources to law enforcement working through the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program and establishes swift and certain penalties for those producing and peddling meth. It also reauthorizes and expands drug courts to help nonviolent drug abusers rid themselves of an addiction that leads them to other crimes. 
   Our legislation expands school and community-based prevention efforts at the local level--targeting those areas that need it the most. That includes funding to allow students to develop their own anti-meth education programs to teach their school peers about the destructive effects of this drug. 
   This proposal calls on the National Institute on Drug Abuse to find exactly what makes methamphetamine so very addictive--especially to our young people--and the best methods for beating the addiction. 
   Finally, the bill calls for a joint strategic plan and national conference involving local, State and Federal law enforcement, education, health and elected officials to discuss solutions to stop the spread and use of this deadly drug. 
   Mr. President, I believe that we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a stand right now to defeat this scourge. Every day, meth infiltrates our city streets and rural towns, leading more and more people down a path of personal destruction. Families are being devastated and communities are fighting an uphill battle against this powerful drug. The time is now to make a stand to protect our communities and schools by passing this legislation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I want to most sincerely compliment the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the committee, and the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, for bringing this bill to the floor so expeditiously. The pay structure of the military needs to be addressed. We are losing too many good people. 
   Last summer I happened to find myself up in Iceland, talking to some of the pilots up there who are performing pretty hazardous flying duty. I remember I met in the Oak Club with a bunch of them. They were pilots, highly trained--maybe they had been in 7 or 8 years--and now they are getting out. A lot of them wanted to stay but simply because of the families they had, the pay just wasn't there. We just cannot afford to keep losing that many good people out of the military. So this bill is long overdue, but it is welcome relief for a lot of our military families. I think it will go a long way toward retaining a lot of our qualified people. 
   I know it is 4.8 percent. Frankly, if it was 5 percent, I would vote for it. If it was 6 percent, I would support it. I know we have budgetary constraints, but with a volunteer force like we have, and with some of the duty these people have to pull now in faraway places for a long period of time, not knowing what is around the corner, we have kind of a different situation than it was when the two of us were in the military some years ago. 
   I think this is a good shot. It is needed right now. I know the chairman well. I know he feels very deeply about this and about the pay of our armed services personnel. But I hope we have an ongoing process to continue to look at this so we do not have these big gaps and lags in time when we lose a lot of our people. To whatever extent I can be helpful, I look forward to working with the distinguished chairman in this regard as we move ahead.

   Mr. HARKIN. And they are up to the hundreds of millions of 
   dollars. You entrust these airplanes to the pilots that are in their twenties. Sometimes I look at these pilots and think: Was I ever that young when I was flying an airplane? And these young men and women take extraordinary risks every day we send them off those catapults and a lot of times into dangerous situations. We just have to keep that in mind. 
   The Senator is right. We can build the best aircraft, and we do, and they are highly sophisticated now, but unless you have that trained individual, who is not only trained but dedicated and wants to stay there, you are lacking something. That machine does not mean a darned thing. So that is why this bill is so important. Again, I compliment the chairman for taking this and really pushing it through. 
   There is one thing, I say to my friend from Virginia, that came to my mind a couple of years ago. I am on the Defense Appropriations Committee, I am not on the authorizing committee, but it came to my attention here 2 or 3 years ago when I got on this issue of military people being on food stamps. It is just something about which I had not thought. It never occurred to me. It never hit me. 
   I am on the Ag Committee, and of course I have been involved in the Food Stamp Program, and it is a good program. The Senator in the chair has been a strong supporter of the Food Stamp Program too, in the past. It is a good thing. But it just hit me as wrong. There is something wrong when our people in uniform qualify for food stamps. For some reason that just did not seem right to me. So I started a process of looking at it and writing letters to the Department of Defense, trying to get as much information as I could on this. 
   Senator DOMENICI and I put some language in a bill once to get some data on this, as much as we could. We got bits and pieces of it, but we never really got all the information we needed. But we did find out that there were literally thousands of military personnel who, today, are on food stamps and who also get the WIC Program, the Women, Infants and Children Program, because they fall below that level. 
   Again, to the chairman's great foresight, he did address this in this bill.

   Mr. HARKIN. Again, the Senator from Virginia shows the gentleman  that he really is by acknowledging the input of others into this issue, and I appreciate that. But the bill we have before us provides for a $180 bonus payment to any person in the armed services who qualifies for food stamps. That is a great step. I applaud it. I support it wholeheartedly. But, again, in looking at it, I think there are some areas that maybe need to be addressed further, and that is the purpose of my amendment. 
   For example, the $180 bonus applies to service people in the country, in the United States, but not to service people overseas. Again, having served in the military and having been 
   stationed overseas, I can tell you a lot of times it is a lot more expensive, especially if you are stationed in Japan or places like that where it is much more costly, much more expensive than it is for the people here in the States. So what my amendment would do would apply the $180 not just to personnel in the United States but to people overseas. It just extends it to them also. 
   Second, under the bill, the process to get the bonus is they would first have to go to the food stamp office and get some paperwork done and show that they qualify. Then they come back to DOD and give them this documentation. Then they take other documentation back to the USDA. It was kind of a three-step process. 
   What my amendment says is all they have to do is go to their personnel office, their paymaster for example, and say: Look, you know what my pay is. Here is my pay. You know how many dependents I have. The only thing that is missing is spousal income. So they would just document what their spousal income is. The military already has records on their dependents and their pay. And if they qualify, that is the end of it. They do not have to go through this bureaucratic nightmare of going to the USDA office and back and forth; it would be just a one-step process. So my amendment tries to streamline that. 
   Third, again--one of these Catch-22 situations we have here--if you live off base and you get a housing allowance, then that is--let me put it this way: It is counted in whether or not you are eligible for the $180. 
   What my amendment says is if you get housing allowance, that is off the table, that is not counted as part of that, because in a lot of cases, housing allowances are eaten up by housing. It really doesn't add anything to their income. That is the third thing the amendment does. 
   The last thing my amendment does is under the WIC Program, the Women, Infants and Children Program, if you are overseas--you can get it here, but you can't get it overseas. You would get the money in lieu of that. I am told that the average basic WIC allowance is about $32 a month for food; $10.50--is that right?--for administration. It is about $42 a month. That will be added for people who are overseas. If they were here, they could get WIC, but if they are overseas, they can't get it. 
   Again, in terms of how much this costs, 2 years ago, we did have an amendment on the bill asking the DOD to give us the numbers on WIC and food stamps, and we have never received those figures from the Department of Defense. I don't know why we can't get them, but we can't get them. I did get a letter last August. I have to tell you, and I say this in all sincerity to my friend from Virginia, this letter disturbed me a little bit. 
   I am going to read one paragraph of it. It is responding to section 655 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998. It required the Department of Defense to conduct a study of the members of the Armed Forces and their families who are at, near, or below the poverty line. It was sent to Chairman THURMOND and Senator LEVIN last August 18. 
   Here is a paragraph that really disturbs me. I quote from the letter:  
   Pay raises targeted to junior enlisted grades with the objective of eliminating poverty or food stamp usage are expensive and not consistent with the objectives of military compensation.  
   Wow. Not consistent with the objectives of military compensation?  
   The Department does not support these measures. Nor does the Department support pay raises that provide greater percentage increases in basic pay and/or allowances to junior members. Such a policy will disadvantage the senior enlisted and officer forces relative to their civilian counterparts.  
   I really don't understand that at all.  
   It will also adversely impact retention, morale, and productivity.  
   Wait a minute, we are going to raise junior enlisted people above the poverty line, give them a bonus in lieu of food stamps here and abroad, and that will adversely impact retention, morale and productivity? I am sorry, I don't understand this.

   Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I will finish my statement very shortly, Mr. President. 
   Again, this one paragraph really bothers me. Again, I don't understand how the Department of Defense can say that:  
   [It does not] support pay raises that provide greater percentage increases in basic pay and/or allowances to junior members.  
   I can see in terms of basic pay, but not allowances in terms of food stamps, for example. Then they say it will adversely impact retention, morale and productivity. I wish someone would explain that one to me. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the executive summary from which I quoted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, lastly, the chairman, I know, is trying to get some figures from the Department of Defense on how much this costs. We have an estimate right now that the provision in the bill itself that provides for the $180 payment in lieu of food stamps will cost, at most, $26 million a year through the year 2004--$26 million a year through the year 2004. 
   What Senator BINGAMAN and I are seeking to do is extending this overseas, streamlining the process--that doesn't cost anything--not counting the basic housing allowance and getting the $42 a month in the WIC payments to troops stationed overseas. 
   Mr. President, I will bet you my bottom dollar and anything I have that it will not even double it. It can't double it. It would be impossible to double it because we have more people in the United States than we have stationed overseas. But even if it did double, we are talking about $52 million a year. I think the DOD budget next year is something like $270 billion. We can't afford $52 million? 
   I am saying that would be the maximum if you double it. We would have exactly the same number of people overseas in the same pay grade than we have stationed here, and we know that is not so. I await the figures from the Department of Defense to see what they say. Since they have already given us an estimate of $26 million on the provision in the bill, I will be surprised if it comes in anything more than perhaps--oh, I will take a guess --$35 million a year probably, just off the top of my head. 
   Even if it doubled it, which it can't--there is no way it can--you are talking about $52 million a year. I think that is a small price to pay to make sure that none of our military people are on food stamps and that they are eligible to get the payment through the WIC Program if they are overseas. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from Marilyn Sobke, president of the National Military Family Association, in which she states:  
   The National Military Family Association strongly supports your amendment that would finally extend the benefits of the [WIC] Program to eligible military families stationed overseas.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will set my amendment aside and await the figures from the Department of Defense. In the meantime, I hope Senators will support this amendment. It is not going to cost that much, but it has the objective of making sure that no one who puts on the uniform of the United States has to go down and stand in line to get food stamps. If nothing else, we ought to end that. Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, in the bill there is an important provision that allows for $180 to be given to help the enlisted personnel who are on food stamps. 
   We have people in uniform today who are eligible for food stamps. There is a $180 special allowance for military personnel in the bill, if they are eligible for food stamps. 
   All my amendment does is the following. I allows military personnel stationed overseas to receive the same $180 special allowance as those living in the United States. The bill only gives the allowance to people stationed here in the United States. It also streamlines the application process. Right now, if a soldier is eligible for food stamps, they have to go to the food stamp office and get a certification, come back to the military personnel office and then go back to the food stamp office. My amendment allows for a one-step process. With my amendment, all they have to do is go to the military to get certified. 
   Secondly, my amendment allows service people living off base to have the same $180 special allowance eligibility as those living on base, in other words, it disregards the housing allowance when determining eligibility. 
   Next, it allows eligible military families to receive the WIC Program if they  are overseas. Right now they can get the WIC Program only if they are stationed in the United States.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I heard some people say I am harming the WIC Program. I disagree. You tell me how fair it is for young soldiers here under the current rules. Military families living in the United States are eligible for WIC, and their wives are pregnant, they have kids, and they are getting the WIC Program, and all of a sudden they are sent overseas. Once they get overseas, they are no longer eligible for the WIC Program. Is that fair? They still have the same needs. All my amendment says is if they are eligible for the WIC Program here in America, they are eligible if they are shipped overseas. The DOD estimates maybe $10 or $20 million more per year in costs. 
   So that is all my amendment does, these modest but important improvement to the underlying bill. It says that if you are a member of the armed forces eligible for a $180 special allowance while stationed in America, you are eligible overseas. That is all it says. If you are eligible for WIC here, you are eligible overseas. It also makes the process streamlined so you do not have to go down to the food stamp office, back to the military, and back to the food stamp office just to qualify for the special allowance. And it treats military housing allowances, as far as eligibility, in a more fair manner. Under the current bill, if you are living on the base you would be eligible for the special subsistence allowance, but if you live off base you may not be eligible because you have the housing allowance. But you use that all up for rent, anyway. This is simply not fair. 
   I think this amendment, again, is one that tries to help people in the military in a fair way. I think it is embarrassing that we have people in the military who have to get food stamps. What this amendment does is end that once and for all, for all military personnel, who should be eligible for some special benefits.

   Mr. HARKIN. A few weeks ago, I used a barnyard term that is quite known in Iowa to describe what I thought of this case. The longer this case has gone on, the more I am convinced this characterization is correct. 
   This case should never have been brought before the Senate. I think it is one of the most blatant partisan actions taken by the House of Representatives since Andrew Johnson's case was pushed through by the radical Republicans of his time. 
   I think it is important for us to take a look at how this case got here. One might ask why is it important how it got here? 
   Well, if you believe that the end justifies the means, it is probably not very important. But if you believe the end doesn't justify the means, that those who are charged with enforcing the law cannot break the law in order to bring someone to the bar of justice, and if you believe the rule of law applies not only to the defendant, the President in this case, but also to the prosecutors and those sworn to uphold that rule of law, then it is important to look at how the case got here. 
   First, we have a statute, the independent counsel statute which at best I believe is flawed and at worst unworkable which allows someone to be targeted without regard to money or time. In fact, it has essentially created a fourth branch of Government with no checks or balances. 
   Again, the conduct, I want to point out, of Ken Starr does not excuse the behavior of the President but has everything to do with our perspective on the case and how we approach it, how we weigh our decision. We are not jurors, we are judges and the supreme Court of Impeachment, which has some of the elements of a court of equity. If somebody approaches this court, they better do it with clean hands. 
   Where the political motivation is so blatant, as it has been in this case, I think we in the Senate should have our guard up, not only on what the case is about, but how it got here. This is the sort of political impeachment case that Madison and Hamilton wanted to avoid, and I refer you to Federalist Paper No. 65, and Hamilton warned the greatest danger would be ``that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.'' That is why he argued for it to come to the Senate and have a two-thirds requirement in order to convict and remove. 
   So in the beginning, Ken Starr is picked by a three-judge panel to investigate Whitewater. Whitewater turns into Travelgate. Travelgate turns into Filegate, and then one wonders, how did Monica Lewinsky ever drop in on this? 
   If we look back, when Ken Starr was a private attorney, in 1994, he had dealings with Paula Jones' attorneys in terms of her then-pending lawsuit. So he had prior involvement himself with the Paula Jones case. 
   So the Paula Jones case proceeds forward. And in October of 1997, an entity  called the Rutherford Institute, funded by conservative forces in the United States, found some new attorneys for Paula Jones and became heavily involved in the case. 
   Now some time around that time, Linda Tripp, with whom Monica Lewinsky had shared her most intimate details of her involvement with the President, begins talking with these attorneys. That is sort of the status of the case as of December 1997. 
   And here I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article from the New York Times, dated January 24, which more or less documents this. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-harkin-ia-2-19990212</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. So now we have the involvement of Linda Tripp giving information to Paula Jones' attorneys. From about late October, early November until January 1998, a lawyer by the name of Jerome Marcus in Philadelphia, who has done extensive work for the Jones legal team, had been talking to a friend of his, Paul Rosenzweig, a prosecutor in Mr. Starr's office, about the Lewinsky matter. We didn't know the exact nature of these discussions, but we do know they talked a number of times. But we do know that on January 8 Marcus contacted Rosenzweig and told him about the relationship of Monica Lewinsky and the President. 
   Right after this, Linda Tripp contacts the Office of Independent Counsel to talk about Lewinsky and tells them about the tapes she has made, the telephone tapes, the tapes of her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky. The day after that, Tripp is wired by FBI agents working with Starr, meets with Lewinsky, and records their conversation without Lewinsky's knowledge--and doing this without any authorization to do it. They didn't get it until 4 days later. 
   Now, all this is done prior to President Clinton ever giving a deposition or testifying before a grand jury. And so Clinton has done nothing yet in terms of testifying. So one might ask, What was Starr and his team after? If, in fact, this was a consensual sexual relationship between Clinton and a young woman who was an adult, what did it have to do with Whitewater or anything else they were investigating? 
   Well, here is why it had something to do with it. Let me quote from an article written by Joseph Isenburgh, a professor of law at the University of Chicago. I happen to have read it because he was supporting this findings of fact procedure, and I wanted to see what his thoughts were. But later on in his treatise he said this:  
   What is perverse about the impeachment of President Clinton is the idiotic premise on which it rests. The President wasn't forced to respond to judicial process in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit because he committed a crime of paramount public concern. That case, remember, was dismissed as meritless.  
   I am continuing to quote him:  
   The misconduct at issue here had no independent significance. It is, itself, merely a byproduct of a judicial process directed at the President, essentially of a ``sting'' set-up in the courts.  
   ``A `sting' set-up in the courts.'' That is what Ken Starr and the Jones attorneys, working in tandem, were doing, setting him up. And you can see this clearly when you watch Clinton on videotape in the deposition before the Paula Jones attorneys. They present him with this definition of ``sexual relations'' that even the judge herself said was confusing. They knew what they were going after. But President Clinton did not know that they had all this information about his involvement with Monica Lewinsky--a classic sting operation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HARKIN. So I just want to end this part of my discussion by saying we have heard a lot about the rule of law recently, about how it applies. Now, how about how it applies to those who are supposed to enforce the law, how it applies to Ken Starr and the Office of Independent Counsel? 
   Mr. HYDE went on many times in his opening and closing arguments about what this teaches our kids about honesty and truthfulness, that the rule of law means something. Well, yes, it means something. It means something to our kids and future generations that honesty and truthfulness and the rule of law also applies to those who are cloaked with the authority to enforce that law. We must teach our kids that the ends do not justify the means, that law enforcement officials cannot break the law in order to bring someone to the bar of justice. 
   So now, in this long process, the case is before the House Judiciary Committee. And only Ken Starr testifies on the facts. He gives them all these documents. But it is interesting to note, he does that before the election. He waits until after the election to give them all the Whitewater, Filegate, and Travelgate charges, which he drops. That happens after the election. They hear Ken Starr. And it is interesting to note that at the end of his long testimony, every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee gives him a standing ovation. What kind of political statement does that make? This was nothing like the kind of balanced evidentiary material given the Judiciary Committee in the House by Leon Jaworski in the Watergate case concerning then-President Nixon. 
   So in summary, what we have here is an out-of-control independent counsel with his own political agenda and vendetta, a blank check to spend millions to look into every nook and cranny of President Clinton's public as well as personal life. You add this to a zealous group of House Republican Judiciary Committee members who fanned the flames, and some Members who already, prior to this, filed a resolution  to impeach the President. What you have here is a blatant, vindictive political case. 
   The American people figured it out a long time ago. They know the truth of what happened. And the truth is very simple. The President had a consensual, illicit affair with a young woman. He tried to cover it up. He misled others to cover it up. That is the truth. All this other stuff we are delving into is the details of about who touched who where, how many times they met, who exchanged gifts. The truth is simple and straightforward, and the American people figured it out, and they have a judgment about this. 
   They said it is wrong, but it's personal. And he violated his marriage oath, not his oath of office. It is a sin, but not a crime. It is between him and his wife and his family and his God. And it is not an impeachable offense. I have said many times the American people can abide sin but not hypocrisy. 
   Throughout this entire case, hypocrisy abounds. Much has been said about the rule of law and the truthfulness and honesty regarding President Clinton. How about as it applies to Starr? How about truthfulness, when he doesn't include, in his presentation, that very important statement that Monica Lewinsky said: ``No one ever asked me to lie''? How about honesty when it comes to him not providing exculpatory material? 
   Having failed to get Bill Clinton on the stated reasons for the independent counsel--on Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate--they shift to illicit sex and a classic sting operation. 
   So we are left with two charges. Perjury. This falls far short, and there is no evidence to support the fact that he perjured himself before the jury. Evasive? Yes. Dodging? Yes. But not knowingly making a false statement under oath material to the case. Doesn't fit. 
   Second article. Obstruction of justice. The House managers built their case on what they called the seven pillars of obstruction, which we have seen turned out to be seven sand castles of speculation. I think the most telling point was Monica Lewinsky, on her own tape last Saturday, when Mr. BRYANT asked her, ``You didn't have a personal reason to file a false affidavit?'' And she said, ``Yes, I did.'' He said, ``Why?'' She said, ``Because I didn't want to get involved with the Jones case. I didn't think it was any of their business.'' End of story on obstruction because everything else rests on that. 
   That is why I have said, the more we look at this case, the more it is a counterfeit case. Like a counterfeit dollar bill, even to a trained eye, you look and it may look real, but you put it under a microscope and you see it's counterfeit. That's what happened in this case. 
   The House managers' case was based on inferences and conjecture. The White House's case was based on direct facts in evidence, and that is the difference. 
   In closing, two wrongs don't make a right. President Clinton did have an illicit affair. It was wrong and demeaning. Ken Starr abused justice, set up a sting operation, the wiring of Linda Tripp, the leaks, the salacious material. 
   Clinton's wrong, I submit, was more of a sin. Ken Starr's wrong is more of a crime. The damage to the rule of law is done more by Ken Starr than by Bill Clinton. At the beginning, I said the House had a heavy burden, given the history and partisanship of this case, to prove articles I and II and that they rise to an impeachable level. They never met that burden. Accordingly, I will vote not guilty on both charges. 
   Finally, as you know, there has been much talk of a censure resolution. As I said before, I said I believe the appropriate form is for each Senator to express his or her opinion on this matter. I personally see no need to join 99 others, and in doing so, set a dangerous precedent that could be easily abused in the future. So here is my censure of the President. 
   I want to state emphatically, I do not condone his behavior that has been so thoroughly exposed and seared in the American conscious ad nauseam. It is the sordid affair of all sordid affairs. The President brought dishonor to himself. He brought tremendous pain and embarrassment to his family, friends and colleagues. And rather than ennobling the Presidency, his behavior has been the butt of jokes and ridicule. 
   This behavior was totally at odds with his many achievements and conduct in his official capacity as President. The President has stated clearly he has sinned and that he has misled his family, his friends, his staff, and the American people. He has said that he is sorry and he has asked for forgiveness. 
   I do so now and say it is time to put this sad chapter behind us; move on to the important work of this Nation.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, in accordance with rule V of the Senate Standing Rules, I and Mr. WELLSTONE filed a notice of intent to move to suspend the rules solely regarding the debate by Senators on the motion to dismiss, so Senators can have open rather than a closed debate on this issue. 
   This motion is offered on behalf of myself and Senators WELLSTONE, FEINGOLD, LEAHY, LIEBERMAN, JOHNSON, INOUYE, SCHUMER, WYDEN, KERREY, BAYH, TORRICELLI, LAUTENBERG, ROBB, DODD, MURRAY, DORGAN, CONRAD, KENNEDY, KERRY, DURBIN, BOXER, GRAHAM, BRYAN, LANDRIEU, and MIKULSKI. 
   My motion is at the desk. However, Mr. Chief Justice, I send a corrected copy of my motion to the desk. There were two typos in it; I want to have it corrected. 
   Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the floor today with my colleague and friend from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, to speak about an issue that is going to be coming up here in the next several days that is going to have an importance to all of the American people and, indeed, to future generations. That is the issue of whether or not the Senate, in its deliberations on the impeachment of President Clinton, will do it in secret or will do it in public; will do it behind closed doors, behind a curtain of secrecy, or do it openly so that the American people know what we are doing. I want to take just a few minutes to lay out the case for why I believe it should be open. 
   Last week, Mr. President, I raised an objection during the trial to the continued use of the word ``jurors,'' as it pertains to Senators sitting in a Court of Impeachment. I did that for a number of reasons, because we are not jurors. We are more than that. We are not just simply triers of fact. We are not just simply finders of law. But sitting as a Court of Impeachment, we have a broad mandate, an expansive role to play. We have to take everything into account, everything from facts--yes, we have to take facts into account--we have to take law into account, but we also have to take into account a broad variety of things: how the case got here; what it is about; how important it is; how important is this piece of evidence weighed against that; what is the public will; how do the people feel about this; what will happen to the public good if one course of action is taken over another. These are all things we have to weigh, and that is why I felt strongly that Senators, in our own minds and in the public minds, should not be put in the box of simply being a juror. 
   One other aspect of that is if, in fact, we are jurors, the argument went, then juries deliberate in secret and, therefore, if we are a jury, we should deliberate in secret. Now that we know we are not jurors, I believe that argument has gone away. I believe that we are, in fact, mandated by the Constitution to be more than that. 
   I quote from an article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune by Professor  Steven Lubet--he is a professor of law at Northwestern University--in which he pointed out that the Constitution does not allow us the luxury of being simply jurors. We have to decide; we have to judge.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a couple of other things regarding openness. The hallmark of our Republic and of our system of government is openness and transparency. The history of this Senate has been one of opening the doors. The first three sessions of the U.S. Senate were held in secret behind closed doors, the whole sessions. Up until 1929, all nominations and treaties were debated behind closed doors. In 1972, 40 percent of all the committee meetings were done behind closed doors. In fact, up until 1975, many conference committees, and still committee meetings, were held behind closed doors. 
   We have washed all that away. We have found through the years that the best political disinfectant is sunshine. I believe we are a better Senate, a better Congress and a better country for opening the doors and letting people see what we do and how we reach the decisions we reach. 
   Mr. President, there has been a spate of editorials recently regarding opening up the trial. I quote from one from the Washington Post dated January 14. It says:  
   It seems only right ..... that the Senate should be expected to debate in public any charge for which it is demanding of the president a public accounting. 
   This is not to prevent senators from caucusing in private or even meeting unofficially, as senators did last week in crafting the procedural compromise that will govern the trial. Confidential contacts of this sort can certainly be constructive. But when the Senate meets as the Senate and considers arguments in its official trial proceedings, it should not do so behind closed doors. Absent the most unusual of circumstances, it should conduct its deliberations openly, thereby ensuring that the final adjudication of Mr. Clinton's case is as transparently accountable as possible.  
   The New York Times basically said the same thing. The Los Angeles Times, the Des Moines Register and Roll Call. I think Roll Call basically said it best, Mr. President, when they said:  
   ..... this is not a court trial ..... It is inherently a political proceeding ..... Their constituents [our constituents], the citizens of America, have a right to see how they perform and to fully understand why they decided to retain or remove their elected President.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me take off a little bit on one aspect of this. Some people say, ``Well, there is a benefit to Senators meeting quietly, privately to discuss these.'' I believe that, and I would not, in any way, want to close, for example, some of the caucuses that we have--the occupant of the Chair remembers we had the closed caucus between the two parties to reach an agreement under which we are operating. I think there is a benefit to that, as the Washington Post article pointed out. That is fine, as we meet unofficially off the floor amongst ourselves to discuss things. But when the Senate meets as the Senate, as soon as that opening prayer is given by the Chaplain, this place should be open, and the trial should be open. 
   Next, I believe that unless we open this trial up, we are going to sow the seeds of confusion, misinformation, suspicion and unnecessary conflict. Here is why I say that. As some wag once said, there is nothing secret about any secret meeting held here in Washington. 
   Think, if you will, of a closed session of the Senate. The galleries are cleared, the cameras are shut off, reporters are gone, and we engage in debate on whatever issue we are going to debate. The debate is over. We open the galleries again, and 100 Senators rush out of here and they see all the reporters standing out here. 
   What happens? ``Well, what happened, Senator?'' 
   ``Well, don't quote me, not for attribution, but guess what this Senator said; guess what that Senator said?'' 
   And so you get 100 different versions of what happened here on the Senate floor. 
   I believe that will sow a lot of confusion, misinformation and unnecessary conflict. If the doors are open and if we debate in the open, there is no filter, it is unfiltered, and the public can see how and why we reached the decisions we reached. 
   The press, quite frankly, obviously, as perhaps is their nature, is quick to pick up on conflict and rumor. I believe if we follow the rules to close the doors of this trial it will turn it more into a circus than anything else. If we open the debate, I don't believe we will have any problems. 
   I was interested in an op-ed piece that was in the New York Times by former Senator Dale Bumpers. I read it, and there is a part in there I think really hits home. Former Senator Bumpers said:  
   In a visit with Harry Truman in his home in Missouri in 1971, he admonished me to always put my trust in the people. ``They can handle it,'' he said.   
   ``They can handle it.'' I believe the American people can handle it, too. I believe they can handle any debate, any discussion, any deliberation that we have on the Senate floor. Not only can they handle it, I believe they have a right to it. 
   So Senator WELLSTONE and I will, at the first opportunity, when the first motion is made to dismiss the case, if that motion is made--obviously the debate about that under the rules would be held in secret--we intend at that point to offer a preferential motion that the debate, the discussion in the Senate on the motion to dismiss be held openly, to suspend the rules. 
   Obviously, that is a hurdle. To suspend the rules requires a two-thirds vote. It means that two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote to suspend the rules. As a further kind of anomaly, Mr. President, the motion to open up the Senate, to open up our debate and deliberation, the debate on that has to be held in private under the rules, strange as it may seem. 
   And so we will at that point ask unanimous consent that the debate and discussion on whether we will open up the debate on the motion to dismiss be held openly. Of course, one Senator can object, and then we would have to go into a secret debate on our motion to open up the deliberation and the debate. And so that will happen sometime soon. 
   Another issue has been raised, Mr. President--I would just like to cover it and then I am going to yield the floor to Senator WELLSTONE. The point has been raised, well, you know, if Senators start debating this and it gets in the open, then they get in front of the cameras, and, why, then this thing can go on and on and on because Senators--you know, we Senators like to talk, we can talk forever. Under the rules of the Senate, when we go into debate and deliberation on any motion, each Senator can be recognized only for 10 minutes--only for 10 minutes. And I think a lot of people are forgetting about that. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, I remember in January of 1991 when I sat at the desk on that side over there and Senators had just been sworn in; housekeeping motions were being made. One motion was being made by the majority leader at that time that the Senate recess or adjourn--I forget--adjourn to a date certain--I think it was for the State of the Union--but during that period of time, that we would not have been in session, and the time would have run out on whether or not we would use force to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait, the gulf war. 
   I stood at that time and raised an objection to the Senate recessing or adjourning over to that point. And I raised an objection that enabled us to have an open and public debate on whether or not we would authorize the President of the United States to conduct military operations in the gulf. We had that debate. And I think it was one of the Senate's finest hours. Even those with whom I disagreed I thought were eloquent and forceful in their arguments. We had the debate, we had the vote, and then we moved on. And I think the American people were better for that debate because it was held in the open. 
   Mr. President, if we in the Senate can debate whether or not to send our sons and daughters off to distant lands to fight and die in a war--something that touches every single American citizen--if we can debate that in open and in public, then in the name of all that is right about our Republic and our country and our openness and our system of government, why can we not debate and deliberate in the open something else that touches every American citizen? And that is, why or if the President of the United States should or should not be removed from office. If we can debate it openly, the issue of war, then certainly we can debate an issue in the open, the issue of whether or not the President would be removed from office. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce S. 18 as part of the Democratic package, the SAFER Meat and Poultry Act, a bill that will make meat and poultry products safer for our families and our children. The bill provisions are simple, obvious authorities the USDA needs to assure that meat and poultry products are as safe as possible. 
   In 1998, we had a record 13 recalls for deadly E. coli 0157:H7, involving more than 2 million pounds of meat products. Tragically, just over the recent holidays, a nationwide outbreak of Listeria was recognized, leading to the massive recall of hotdogs and cold cuts. At least a dozen people lost their lives during that outbreak just over the recent holiday season. 
   Just last Friday, another recall for Listeria was announced. So despite the progress we have made in controlling some foodborne pathogens through improved meat inspection laws, problems with other pathogens may be getting worse. 
   Mr. President, the bill really is targeted at kids, because it is our kids who are the most vulnerable. And this chart shows that. These are the numbers of cases just for the State of Iowa. And as you see by age, here is the number of cases. Here are the ages: 0 to 5, 6 to 10, up to 80 years of age. You can see, the bulk of the illnesses from foodborne pathogens happens when you are less than 6 years of age--our kids who have not built up the immunity that they need that get the sickest from these foodborne pathogens. This is for Salmonella, E. coli, and Campylobacter. It is really necessary to protect our children from these pathogens.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation for myself and Senator JOHNSON providing farmers with the option of receiving a refund from taxes paid in the past 10 years for their current operating losses. 
   I was pleased to see a net operating loss provision included in the Omnibus Appropriations measure allowing farmers to carry back their losses for 5 years. But, a five year period is insufficient given the economic reality in Agriculture. 
   Farmers are suffering huge losses through no fault of their own. No other business has less control of the price they can recieive for what they produce. Farmers cannot control the world's weather or the World economy. But, those factors determine the price of corn, soybeans and wheat. The Freedom to Farm bill passed in 1997 sharply reduced the farmer's safety net. Farm prices have crashed to levels not seen in decades. Many farmers are going to have a very difficult time being able to acquire the funds needed to plant their crops in the coming year or maintain their annual operations. Grain farmers received some assistance in the Omnibus Appropriations measure. But, it was not sufficient. Livestock producers received very limited help in that measure. And, in the last few months we have seen hog prices drop to levels that were, adjusted for inflation, far lower than anything seen at the worst point of the Great Depression. Many farmers could lose the farms that have been in their families for generations. Those low prices and the resulting sharp reduction in hog producers' financial resources is changing the whole structure of hog production. Cattle prices also have been significantly below the cost of production for over a year. And, the economic difficulty is far broader. It is already having a terrible ripple effect on the economies of rural areas. Layoffs have been occurring at agricultural equipment manufacturers and in stores of all kinds in small towns across the country. We are just at the beginning stages of what could become a very severe downturn in rural America. 
   A number of Senators and I are proposing a series of modifications in agicultural programs to help alleviate these programs. But, I believe the Congress needs to also pass a provision broadening existing law allowing farmers to recover taxes paid in the past to cover their net operating losses for 10 years. 
   I propose that the option to carry losses back for 10 years only apply to family farmers. That would include those with gross sales of less than $7 million and the losses covered would be up to $200,000 per year in operating losses. The benefit would only go to farmers whose families are actively engaged in farming and whose business activity is mostly farming. The amount of the rebate would be dependent on the amount of the loss and the  tax rate paid by the farmer for the paid taxes that are being restored. 
   The 10 year provision would only cover losses occurring in 1998 to 1999. For losses occuring in 1998, farmers would be able to calculate their loss now and seek an immediate rebate from the IRS for the taxes paid in earlier years. 
   Current law already allows a few taxpayers in certain circumstances to go back and recover taxes that they paid for 10 years. I believe that it should be broadened to cover farmers in this difficult time. In fact, there is a precedent in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act in which Amtrak was allowed to use net operating losses of their predecessor railroads from over 25 years in the past. 
   I urge that when the Congress considers a tax bill, this provision be considered and passed.

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I object to the use and the continued use of the word ``jurors'' when referring to the Senate sitting as triers in a trial of the impeachment of the President of the United States. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the following: 
   First, article I, section 3, of the Constitution says the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments--not the courts, but the Senate. 
   Article III of the Constitution says the trial of all crimes, except in the cases of impeachment, shall be by jury--a tremendous exculpatory clause when it comes to impeachments. 
   Next, Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the writings in ``The Federalist Papers,'' especially No. 65 by Alexander Hamilton, in which he is outlining the reasons why the framers of the Constitution gave the Senate the sole power to try impeachments. I won't read it all, but I will read this pertinent sentence:  
   There will be no jury to stand between the judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law and the party who is to receive or suffer it.  
   Next, Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the 26 rules of the Senate, adopted by the Senate, governing impeachments. Nowhere in any of those 26 rules is the word ``juror'' or ``jury'' ever used. 
   Next, Mr. Chief Justice, I base my objection on the tremendous differences between regular jurors and Senators sitting as triers of an impeachment. Regular jurors, of course, are chosen, to the maximum extent possible, with no knowledge of the case. Not so when we try impeachments. Regular jurors are not supposed to know each other. Not so here. Regular jurors cannot overrule the judge. Not so here. Regular jurors do not decide what evidence should be heard, the standards of evidence, nor do they decide what witnesses shall be called. Not so here. Regular jurors do not decide when a trial is to be ended. Not so here. 
   Now, Mr. Chief Justice, it may seem a small point, but I think a very important point. I think the framers of the Constitution meant us, the Senate, to be something other than a jury and not jurors. What we do here today does not just decide the fate of one man. Since the Senate sits on impeachment so rarely, and even more rarely on the impeachment of a President of the United States, what we do here sets precedence. Future generations will look back on this trial not just to find out what happened, but to try to decide what principles governed our actions. To leave the impression for future generations that we somehow are jurors and acting as a jury----

   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I was stating the reason because of the precedents that we set, and I do not believe it would be a valid precedent to leave future generations that we would be looked upon merely as jurors, but something other than being a juror. That is why I raise the objection.

   Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. Manager BARR. I thank the Court for his ruling. We urge the distinguished Senators who are sitting as triers of fact in this case not to be fooled. We urge you to use your common sense, your reasoning, your varied and successful career experiences, just as any trier of fact and law anywhere in America might do. Just as other triers of fact and law do, so, too, have each of you sworn to decide these momentous matters impartially. Your oath to look to the law and to our Constitution demands this of you. As this great body has done on so many occasions in the course of our Nation's history, I and all managers are confident you will neither shrink from nor cast aside that duty. 
   Rather, I urge and fully anticipate that you will look to the volume of facts and to the clear and fully applicable statutes and conclude that William Jefferson Clinton, in fact and under the law, violated his oath and violated the laws of this land and convict him on both articles of impeachment. Even though such a high burden--that is, proof of criminal violations--is not strictly required of you under the law of impeachment, in fact, such evidence is here. That higher burden is met. 
   Perjury is here; obstruction is here in the facts and the law which forms the basis for the articles of impeachment in the House which we believe properly would form the basis for conviction in the Senate. Perjury and obstruction, we respectfully ask you to strike down these insidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of Government and laws. Strike them down with the Constitution so they might not fester as a gaping wound poisoning future generations of children, poisoning our court system, and perhaps even future generations of political leaders. 
   Just as Members of both Houses of Congress have unfortunately over the years been convicted and removed from office for perjury and obstruction, and just as Federal judges have been removed from life tenure for perjury and obstruction, so must a President; so sadly should this President. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you, Members of the U.S. Senate sitting here as jurors of fact and law in the trial of President William Jefferson Clinton.
