    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of a young man who passed away unexpectedly on Saturday, December 2, 2000. Gregory W. Moyer was the nephew of my friend and former staffer Pat Morrissey. Greg was a 15-year-old basketball player, honor student, and community volunteer from Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania. He collapsed during a high school basketball game, victim of an undetected heart defect. At six-foot-three-inches and 220 pounds, his classmates knew him as a ``gentle giant.'' Greg's Aunt Patricia says that, ``He could read hearts, young and old alike. He knew what was important.'' 
   Pat, please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Broadcasting Integrity Act of 2000, legislation that would make the Federal Communications Act's political broadcasting provisions inapplicable to noncommercial educational broadcasting stations. 
   I believe the current law is well-intentioned to serve the public interest by allowing federal candidates to communicate their views to the general public. However, these provisions are having some unfortunate side effects as federal candidates are exploiting loopholes in the Act to the detriment of public broadcasting. Many Vermonters and my colleagues have seen in recent news reports that public radio and television stations are being forced to give free, uncensored air time to any Federal candidate under provisions of the Federal Communications Act. As a strong supporter of public radio and television, I find this phenomenon disturbing. 
   I an concerned that this valuable public resource is being commandeered and exploited as a way to get free advertising. Unlike commercial stations, public radio and television are heavily dependent on listener contributions. Many of these listeners are reconsidering their future financial support of these stations if this loophole is not closed and programming is replaced by a flood of political advertising. It seems inevitable that the number of candidates using this avenue will increase dramatically in the next federal election unless we make this minor but important legislative correction. 
   Mr. President, we can not allow this to happen which is why I am introducing this bill today. I believe this narrowly tailored legislation will close this loophole and preserve the integrity of public broadcasting. I call on my colleagues to join me and support this legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure that the Senate is moving to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000. This year is the 35th anniversary of the Older Americans Program. Since 1965, the act has provided a range of needed social services to our Nation's senior citizens. 
   It is the major vehicle for the organization and delivery of supportive and nutrition services to older persons, and it has grown and changed to meet our citizens' needs. In 1972, we created the national nutrition program; in 1978, we established a separate title for Native Americans; and in 1987, we authorized programs to prevent elder abuse and neglect. 
   The act has been reauthorized 12 times, most recently in 1992. Reauthorization legislation was considered in the 104th and 105th Congresses but did not pass due to controversy about a number of proposals. Now, we have the chance to pass this act and provide our elderly with desperately needed help. 
   The Older Americans Act programs play a vital role in all our communities. Because of the Older Americans Act, millions of nutritious meals are delivered each year to the generation that served our country in World War II. It funds the operations of senior centers and other supportive services to enhance the dignity and independence of the Nation's elders; and it provides part-time employment opportunities to tens of thousands of senior citizens.  
   Indeed, virtually all of our Nation's elderly are benefiting from the act. However, more could be done to help our senior citizens and their families. This is why we are here to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000. I want to commend all of the members of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for their work and contributions in this effort. Senator DEWINE and Senator MIKULSKI led the way on this reauthorization effort early in this Congress. The Subcommittee on Aging held a series of seven hearings, receiving testimony from over 30 witnesses. The hearings addressed important issues, including elder abuse, supportive services, State and local views, longevity in the workplace, and long-term family caregiver programs. In March, 1999, we were very fortunate to hear testimony from Ms. Reeve Lindbergh of St. Johnsbury, Vermont. She spoke to our committee about the unacceptable problem of elder abuse which confronts some of our most fragile elders. 
   Then, in April, we heard from another Vermonter, Mr. John Barbour, who serves as the director of the Champlain Valley Agency on Aging, in Winooski, Vermont. He alerted the committee to changes needed in the nutritional programs outlined in title III of the act. This bill improves the Older Americans Act in several key areas. For example, it sets out specific policies objectives related to income, health, housing, long-term care, employment, retirement, and community services that will improve the lives of all older Americans. One of the most important aspects of this Act is the establishment of the Grassley-Breaux, National Family Caregiver Support Program. According to the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey, there are more than 7 million informal caregivers--including spouses, adult children, other relatives, and friends who provide day-to-day care for most of our Nation's elders. 
   The National Family Caregiver Program authorizes $125 million in Federal assistance to help families care for their elderly by providing a multifaceted system of supportive services, including information, assistance, counseling, and respite services. Moreover, it will help older individuals who are caring for relative children, such as their grandchildren. This program will also extend to older folks who are caring for their adult children with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. Significant changes have been made to title V which authorizes community service employment for older Americans to provide part-time community service jobs for unemployed, low-income persons 55 years old and over. 
   There will be 1.4 million more low-income persons over the age of 55 in the year 2005 than there were a decade earlier, and many of them will continue working. Employment obtained through this program provides these workers with needed economic support. It keeps them active and involved in their communities, and it provides them with the opportunity to make important contributions to their communities, learn new skills, and enhance their sense of dignity and self-esteem. The changes made in title V by the bill are a critical part of this legislation, because they strengthen and modernize the Senior Employment Program. 
   To begin, the program will now stress economic self-sufficiency and will increase the number of placements in public- and private-sector unsubsidized employment. The employment program is integrated with the Workforce Investment Act, including one-stop delivery systems and participant assessments and services, while the program itself and the administrative costs are codified. Also, under this title, a State Senior Employment Services Plan is established which provides Governors with greater influence and responsibility concerning the allocation of job slots. The newly established State plan ensures for the first time a planning process with broad participation by representatives from throughout the aging community. 
   Other sections have also been strengthened. It authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Aging to award funds for training, research, and demonstration projects in the field of aging. This act consolidates the demonstration programs from 18 to 10 categories, including sections on violence against older Americans, rural health, computer training, and transportation. Title VI, grants to Native Americans, authorizes funds for social and nutrition services to older Indians and Native Hawaiians. It also adds a provision which authorizes funds for activities that protect the rights of the vulnerable elderly. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the many other individuals and organizations that have contributed to this effort. Senator KENNEDY contributed his long experience to this effort. He helped us find the middle ground and solutions to many thorny issues. Senator HUTCHINSON was especially active on these efforts to address the employment and services needs of the rural elderly. 
   Among the groups in the network of aging organizations, special recognition must go to the National Council of Older Americans and the National Association of State Units on Aging for their insight in proposing a compromise to the employment services program. AARP, with the leadership of Horace Deets, undertook the difficult task of seeking consensus among the many aging organizations. Green thumb tirelessly educated Members of Congress about the importance of these aging populations, especially those Members representing rural constituencies. The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, currently being chaired by the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, provided a continuous forum for many issues to be addressed. Others contributing to this effort include the Southern Governors Association, the National Caucus on Black Aging, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and Meals on Wheels. Finally, the Administration on Aging, headed by Jeanette Takamura, provided ongoing leadership and continuous expert support in strengthening these programs. 
   Yesterday our colleagues in the House passed the Older Americans Reauthorization Act by an overwhelming majority. In summary, S. 1536 goes a long way to improving supportive, employment, and nutritional services for the elderly. This legislation updates the Older Americans Act, making it more relevant and useful to our country's senior citizens. All of these individuals have worked hard to develop innovative strategies to strengthen and modernize the Older Americans Act, and I know that through these efforts our Nation's elders will be better served by this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude and delight because of the successful outcome of a bipartisan, bicameral effort to protect the health of those who protect the health of others. I speak, of course, of our nation's health care workers, who dedicate their lives to caring for others. And I am gratified because today we have enacted legislation, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, which addresses an important health issue threatening our nation's care givers. 
   In March of this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that more than 380,000 percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps occur annually among health care workers in United States hospitals. Estimates for all health care settings are that 600,000 to 800,000 needlestick and other percutaneous injuries occur annually. Due to these injuries, numerous health care workers have contracted fatal or other serious viruses and diseases, including the human immunodeficiency virus, (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. 
   The statistics paint a bleak picture, but there is hope. There has been an explosion of technological development, resulting in a substantial increase in the number and assortment of new, and much safer, medical devices, such as needleless systems, retractable needles, and syringes with needle guards or sheaths. The legislation that we have passed today will require employers to identify, evaluate, and make use of these devices. As a result, lives will be saved. 
   This bipartisan success resulted from a shared concern about this health hazard, and a shared belief of how to resolve it, among myself, and Senators ENZI, KENNEDY and REID. I must also thank our dedicated staffs, and also Representatives CASS BALLENGER, and MAJOR OWENS, and their staffs. Senators ENZI, KENNEDY, REID, and I have also worked together on a Joint Statement of Legislative Intent. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from Charles N. Jeffress, Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, to Senator JIM BUNNING, and a letter from Representatives BALLENGER and OWENS, addressed to me, be made a part of the RECORD. 
   I thank all my colleagues who have joined in helping to adopt this important legislation. It is a vital step in ensuring worker safety in health care settings.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first thank all Members for the support they have given to this legislation during the period it has been under consideration. It has been a long time, some 8 years now, for those of us who have been strong in wanting to get it revised and take a good look at it. Eight years is long enough. 
   I also thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his long-term efforts to reauthorize the act. As the chairman of the Aging Subcommittee during the last Congress, Senator GREGG was instrumental in bringing to light many of the improvements that are now included in this bill. 
   Let me be clear about the changes that have been made to the Senior Employment programs in this bill, the effort that has gone into crafting this balanced agreement, and the broad support this compromise enjoys. 
   This act makes significant reforms to the Senior Employment Program. That is where the problems have been. It focuses the purposes of employment programs on enrollee economic self-sufficiency and on unsubsidized employment in the public and private sectors. It coordinates SCEP with the Workforce Investment Act programs. That is important. Importantly, it implements stringent eligibility and accountability tests for all grant applicants. Administrative and program costs are now defined in statute and capped so that resources are directed into employment services for the elderly. 
   The bill includes new cost controls that will prevent the misuse of funds by grantees. It also would require at least 75 percent of a grantee's funds be used for enrollee wages and benefits, and the bill explicitly states that the funds a grantee receives must be used solely for the employment program. 
   Moreover, the bill expressly requires each grantee to comply with OMB circulars and rules and requires the grantees to maintain records sufficient to permit tracing of funds to ensure that funds have not been spent unlawfully. 
   The bill institutes and requires performance outcome measures, annual grantee evaluations, grantee accountability, and it creates a new grant competition for those not meeting performance measures. 
   It provides Governors and States greater resources and influence over job slot allocations, but also requires broad stakeholder participation in a State Senior Employment Services Plan coordinated through the Governors' offices. 
   This bill marks a landmark agreement between the States and the grantee providers of jobs. The bill allocates new funding above the current level of effort such that any increases up to $35 million will be divided 75 percent to States and 25 percent to other grantees; amounts above $35 million would be divided 50/50. This was very important to the States and a good compromise. 
   Finally, grantees will be required to serve seniors or they will lose their grant. Our bill introduces performance measures and competition into the senior employment program for the first time. The bill would establish a ``three strikes and you're out'' policy to ensure performance goals are met. 
   Failure to meet performance measures will first result in technical assistance and will require the grantee to come up with a plan on how it will meet performance measures in the future. 
   Failure to meet performance standards a second consecutive year will result in a loss of 25 percent of the grant, which will be competitively bid in an open competition. 
   Failure to meet performance standards a third consecutive year will cut off the grantee from the program, and the grant will be competitively bid in an open competition. 
   Failure of a public and private nonprofit agency grantee to meet performance measures in an individual state will also lead to the loss of the grant, which will then be competitively bid in an open competition. 
   These reforms significantly improve the Older Americans Act, protect the taxpayers and, and provide seniors with a jobs program that works. Failure to pass these reforms this year will maintain the status quo. It will only continue a system that does not serve the job placement needs of seniors in many states, and will not correct the deficiencies in the administration and planning of the program. The only way these improvements will be realized is to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000, a bipartisan, bicameral initiative. 
   The bill will bring agreement for the first time in almost 10 years. It is supported by the National Governors Association, the Southern Governors Association, the Administration, and over 40 national aging groups. Yesterday, the House passed this measure on a vote of 405-2. This measure has 73 cosponsors in the Senate. 
   This is a delicate compromise, and any further amendments to this measure will surely prevent it from being enacted this year. I urge all of my colleagues to vote against any amendments and join in the bipartisan and bicameral effort to pass the Older Americans Act.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, earlier I recognized the many contributions made by Senator GREGG to the provisions contained in our bill. We were glad to add those provisions. I regret that my colleague does not find them sufficient. But I must say that his amendment goes too far, and if adopted it will kill any chance of reauthorizing the Older Americans Act this year. I urge all of the Senators to vote against the amendment. 
   On its face, this proposal may look reasonable, but it is not. 
   It sets standards that would penalize all grantees and would preclude them providing these valuable services without the opportunity to have what are book keeping disputes adjudicated.  
   Moreover, the bill expressly requires each grantee to comply with OMB circulars and rules and requires the grantees to maintain records sufficient to permit tracing of funds to ensure that funds have not been spent unlawfully. 
   The bill institutes and requires performance outcome measures, annual grantee evaluations, grantee accountability and it creates a new grant competition for those not meeting performance measures. 
   It provides Governors and States greater resources and influence over job slot allocations, but also requires broad stakeholder participation in a State Senior Employment Services Plan coordinated through Governor's offices. 
   Our bill introduces performance measures and competition into the senior employment program for the first time. The bill would establish a `three strikes and you're out' policy to ensure performance goals are met. 
   Failure to pass these reforms this year will maintain the status quo. It will only continue a system that does not serve the job placement needs of seniors in many states, and will not correct the deficiencies in the administration and planning of the program. The only way these improvements will be realized is to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000, a bipartisan, bicameral initiative. 
   This amendment is not opposed by just the aging organizations like AARP. It is also opposed by the Southern Governors Association. Yesterday, Governor Bush of Florida urged us to pass this bill and send it the President for his signature. Governor Huckabee of Arkansas said.  
   The Senate must move expeditiously to pass this bill without any amendments.  
   I urge all the Senators to vote against the Gregg amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

Then, in April, we heard from another Vermonter, Mr. John Barbour, who serves as the Director of the Champlain Valley Agency on Aging, in Winooski, Vermont. He alerted the Committee to changes needed in the nutritional programs outlined in Title III of the Act. 
   This bill improves the Older Americans Act in several key areas. For example, Title I sets out broad policy objectives related to income, health, housing, long-term care, employment, retirement, and community services that will improve the lives of all older Americans. Modifications under this title establish a Federal definition of ``in-home services'' and give both State units and area agencies on aging the ability to include locally significant in-home services in their service definition. 
   Title II identifies the Administration on Aging as the chief Federal agency advocate for older persons and also establishes the Eldercare Locator Service and Pension Rights and Counseling as ongoing programs. 
   Significant modifications have been made to Title III, grants for State and community programs. One of the most important aspects of this Act is the establishment of the Grassley-Breaux National Family Caregiver Support Program. According to the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey, there are more than 7 million informal caregivers--including spouses, adult children, other relatives, and friends who provide day-to-day care for most of our Nation's elders. The National Family Caregiver Program authorizes $125 million in Federal assistance to help families care for their elderly by providing a multifaceted system of supportive services, including information, assistance, counseling, and respite services. Moreover, it will help older individuals who are caring for relative children, such as their grandchildren. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 1997, almost 4 million children were living in homes maintained by their grandparents. This program will also extend to older folks who are caring for their adult children with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. 
   Other changes to this title clarify the role of area agencies on aging with respect to case management, information and referral services, and also strengthen their obligations to coordinate volunteer programs and efforts with other community organizations providing similar services. In addition, the interstate formula allotments are updated, with appropriations being tied to minimum-growth hold harmless amounts, so that no State receives less than it did in FY 2000. 
   Title V authorizes community service employment for older Americans to provide part-time community service jobs for unemployed, low-income persons 55 years old and over. There will be 1.4 million more low-income persons over the age of 55 in the year 2005 than there were a decade earlier, and many of them will continue working. Employment obtained through this program provides these workers with needed economic support. It keeps them active and involved in their communities, and it provides them with the opportunity to make important contributions to their communities, learn new skills, and enhance their sense of dignity and self-esteem. 
   The changes made in Title V by this bill are a critical part of this legislation, because they strengthen and modernize the Senior Employment Program. To begin, the purpose statement is amended to stress economic self-sufficiency and to increase the number of placements in public- and private-sector unsubsidized employment. The employment program is integrated with the Workforce Investment Act, including one-stop delivery systems and participant assessments and services, while the program itself and the administrative costs are codified. Also, under this title, the State Senior Employment Services Plan is established which provides Governors with greater 
     influence and responsibility concerning the allocation of job slots. The newly established State Plan ensures for the first time a planning process with broad participation by representatives from State and area agencies on aging; State and local workforce investment boards; public and private non-profit providers of employment services; businesses and labor organizations; and other aging network stakeholders. 
   The remaining sections have also been modified. Title IV, training, research, and discretionary projects and programs, authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Aging to award funds for training, research, and demonstration projects in the field of aging. This Act consolidates the demonstration programs from 18 to 10 categories, including sections on violence against older Americans, rural health, computer training, and transportation. Title VI, grants to Native Americans, authorizes funds for social and nutrition services to older Indians and Native Hawaiians. The modifications by this Act authorize the Family Caregiver Support Program for tribal organizations. Then, a provision is added under Title VII, vulnerable elder rights protection activities, which authorizes funds for activities that protect the rights of the vulnerable elderly. The new provision requires that ombudsman programs coordinate with ``law enforcement'' agencies. 
   I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the many other individuals and organizations that have contributed to this effort. In addition to leadership Senator DEWINE and Senator MIKULSKI, Senator KENNEDY contributed his long experience to this effort. He helped us find the middle ground and solutions to many thorny issues. Senator GREGG was instrumental in focusing the Committee's attention on the much-needed reforms in the employment services program, and the program is much strengthened by his work. Senator HUTCHINSON was especially active on these efforts to address the employment and services needs of the rural elderly. 
   Among the groups in the network of aging organizations, special recognition must go to the National Council of Older Americans and the National Association of State Units on Aging for their insight in proposing a compromise to the employment services program. AARP, with the leadership of Horace Deets, undertook the difficult task of seeking consensus among the many aging organizations. Green Thumb tirelessly educated members of Congress about the importance of these aging populations, especially those members representing rural constituencies. The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, currently being chaired by the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, provided a continuous forum for many issues to be addressed. Others contributing to this effort include the National Caucus on Black Aging, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and Meals on Wheels. Finally, the Administration on Aging, headed by Jeanette Takamura, provided ongoing leadership and continuous expert support in strengthening these programs. 
   Many of our staff deserve considerable recognition for their dedicated work. Daphne Edwards in the Office of the Legislative Counsel worked tirelessly on countless drafts of this legislation. Carol O'Shaughnessy of the Congressional Research Service lent her counsel, as well as her years of experience with aging programs, to this bill. Abby Brandel and Rhonda Richards of Senator MIKULSKI's office, and Jeffrey Teitz of Senator KENNEDY's staff, worked diligently to reach accords on many of these difficult issues. Alan Gilbert with Senator GREGG provided invaluable guidance on the employment services program. Kate Hull, of Senator HUTCHINSON's staff, also dedicated many hours of effort to the final product. Recognition is deserved especially by Karla Carpenter, the staff director of the Aging Subcommittee, who with Senator DEWINE developed the framework for this modernization bill and who stuck with the effort to see it finished. Finally, on my own staff, I want to acknowledge and commend the efforts of Hollis Turnham and Sean Donohue. Hollis came to my office as the Senator John Heinz Fellow on Aging, and her extensive experience with these programs was invaluable to the completion of the bill. Hollis brought with her years of experience in serving our Nation's elders and a full knowledge of just how the Older Americans Act affects our older Americans. After several years of trying, this effort to reauthorize the Older Americans Act could have gone astray at countless points over these past two years. Therefore, much credit must go to Sean Donohue, whose focus, experience, and sheer tenacity guided this successful effort. 
   In summary, our bill goes a long way to improving supportive, employment, and nutritional services for the elderly. This legislation updates the Older Americans Act, making it more relevant and useful to our country's senior citizens. All of these individuals have worked hard to develop innovative strategies to strengthen and modernize the Older Americans Act, and I know that through these efforts our Nation's elders will be better served by this legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on October 11, 2000, I filed Report No. 106-496 to accompany S. 1495, a bill to establish, wherever feasible, guidelines, recommendations, and regulations that promote the regulatory acceptance of new and revised toxicological tests that protect human and animal health and the environment while reducing, refining, or replacing animal tests and ensuring human safety and product effectiveness. At the time the report was filed, the estimate by the Congressional Budget Office was not available. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the CBO estimate be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the final version of fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Included in the legislation is a provision that requires the Department of Energy to spend not less than $2 million on the Small Wind Turbine Project. This effort is vitally important to our Nation's continued development of American wind technology for consumer use. It was added as a program at the Department of Energy in 1995, to develop cost-effective, highly reliable Small Wind Turbine systems for both domestic and international markets. In fact, due to the Small Wind Turbine Program, U.S. companies have been able to advance the performance and cost-effectiveness of small wind turbine systems. The participants in the Small Wind Turbine Project are Windlite Corp, a subsidiary of Atlantic Orient Corp, Bergey Windpower Co., and World Power Technology. Through the Small Wind Turbine Project, these three companies are advancing the technology of wind energy for homes, small businesses, rural development and export. To end the effort that these three companies are undertaking at this time would be a giant setback and for this reason the Congress has included funding to continue the project under their guidance. 
   I worked closely with Senators DOMENICI and REID and Assistant Secretary of Energy Dan Reicher in developing the language in this legislation related to small wind. The language is clear, that the department should spend no less than $2 million on the Small Wind Turbine Project. We must continue to develop, test and certify the wind turbines being developed under this program to date.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to echo my colleagues' support of the National Rural Development Partnership and its affiliates, state rural development councils. These councils, in Vermont and over 35 other states, are playing an important role bringing together the many governmental and non-governmental entities that work to improve conditions in rural areas. I sincerely hope that Secretary of Agriculture will continue to support this program while authorization legislation is finalized by the Congress.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to urge my colleagues to support this Agriculture appropriations conference report. I want to thank Senator COCHRAN, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee, for his work on this important legislation. In particular, I want to thank him on behalf of the dairy farmers across the nation, New England and Vermont. Included in this agriculture spending bill is badly needed support for dairy farms. These dairy assistance payments will bring approximately six thousand, four hundred dollars for the average 80-cow dairy farm. At a time when the nation's dairy farmers are facing low milk prices, these payments will help make ends meet. 
   In Vermont, these payments will give our dairy farmers a much needed boost heading into the long winter. I also want to make a few brief remarks to reiterate my support for the prescription drug provision included in this bill, and to address some of the unfortunate rhetoric that I have heard during this debate. 
   We all know why this provision is in this bill. The American people are fed up with the situation that exists today, where Americans pay far more for FDA-approved, American-made prescription drugs than patients in any other country in the world. I am not here to demonize the drug industry. It's true that these companies are making some miraculous breakthroughs and improving the lives of many Americans. But why must Americans have to shoulder seemingly the entire burden of paying for research, development and a healthy return to shareholders? I believe it is time we put an end to this unfair burden. I don't think it is fair to expect Americans, especially our senior citizens living on fixed incomes, to pay the highest costs in the world for prescription medicines, many of which are manufactured within our borders. That's why more than a year ago I started working with the Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for overseeing the safety of the drug supply in this country to see if there were a way we could safely reimport prescription medicines into our country. 
   In July, on an overwhelming vote of 74-21, the United States Senate agreed to an amendment I offered with Senators WELLSTONE, DORGAN, GORTON, SNOWE, and others to do just that. Just three weeks ago, President Clinton endorsed the Jeffords language, saying ``I support the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 which the Senate passed'' and ``I urge you to send me the Senate legislation.'' The negotiators for the House and Senate on the agriculture appropriations bill have now completed their work. Unfortunately, the process used in reaching this agreement was marred by partisanship. That is regrettable. But the product is as strong as the one endorsed by the Clinton administration, and even stronger in some respects. 
   Some of my Republican colleagues have criticized this proposal for going too far. My Democratic friends have criticized this for not going far enough. The legions of lobbyists for pharmaceutical industry vigorously oppose this proposal, and tried their best to get it stripped from this legislation. I continue to believe that the proposal before the Senate today, while slightly different from my plan, is a strong and workable proposal. Critics have argued that the proposal has been weakened because it allows drug companies to frustrate the intent through manipulations of sales contracts. The fact is, this bill is stronger than either the House-passed or Senate-passed versions because it includes a clear prohibition of such agreements--something that was missing in the House and Senate bills. 
   In fact, let me quote from that  section of the bill: ``No manufacturer of a covered product may enter into a contract or agreement that includes a provision to prevent the sale or distribution of covered products imported pursuant to subsection (a).'' 
   I don't know how to be more clear and simple than that. But just in case my colleagues think that stronger language is needed, the bill grants to the Secretary the ability to react to unanticipated challenges through language in another section which requires that the Secretary issue regulations containing any additional provisions necessary ``as a means to facilitate the importation of such products.'' Such broad authority will ensure that this provision works. In fact, less than 10 days ago, at the very time that the Clinton administration was changing its position on the Jeffords amendment, the New York Times reported that it planned to implement the Patient's Bill of Rights by regulation. It is hard to understand why the administration so eagerly sees regulatory authority where many do not, yet cannot see it when plainly written in the statute. Critics have claimed that the latest version of the bill contains a loophole regarding the labeling requirements. The fact is, the bill requires manufacturers to provide all necessary labeling information, and the provision that I just quoted gives the FDA very broad power to write any other rules necessary to accomplish the intent of the provision. Moreover, this labeling language is unchanged from the version that adopted by the Senate and endorsed by President Clinton. 
   Critics have claimed that the bill unfairly restricts the countries from which these products may come. The fact is that the bill lists 23 countries to start the process, and lets the FDA expand the list at any time. Critics have complained that this bill will expire after about 7 years. The fact is that this is a vast improvement over the House-passed version which would have expired after only one year. As we all know, major legislation is frequently required to be reauthorized on 5 year cycles in order to force Congress to make improvements, and popular effective laws always survive this process. 
   Mr. President, this bill, like any other, may not be perfect, but the fact is that it is stronger than the original Jeffords amendment. That is why John Rector, senior vice president for the National Community Pharmacists Association who has been a leader in the effort to reimport lower cost drugs and whose members would be importing under this provision. Mr. Rector recently indicated that this bill, ``will result in the importation of far less expensive drugs.'' This is a workable bill, and that is why the pharmaceutical industry is fighting this tooth and nail--they know it will work. They would like nothing more than to see us to kill this bill. One of our colleagues in the House, who has complained that this provision does not go far enough, noted that this is ``the first defeat ever suffered by the pharmaceutical industry in memory.'' 
   Now I ask you, if this bill is unworkable as the critics have charged, why is the pharmaceutical industry so opposed to the bill, and why are even our critics calling this a defeat for the industry? That should tell you something about what they really think the effect will be of this provision. As I said before, Mr. President, I am disappointed with how partisan this issue has become, but I am glad that the President has said he will sign the bill. I am calling on Congress to put partisanship aside and pass this bill. And I am calling on the Clinton administration to quickly write these regulations so that ordinary Americans can realize savings on prescription drugs as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, I rise also today in support of two important food stamp provisions included in this conference report. These provisions are based upon S. 1805, the Hunger Relief Act of which I was proud to be an original cosponsor. 
   The language in the bill will allow low-income people who spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing to receive food stamp benefits at a level that more accurately reflects their need. Additionally, it will allow low-income people who need a car to find or keep work to still receive food stamp benefits and continue to own a reliable car. 
   These provisions will provide important relief for needy families in Vermont and all around the United States. In Vermont alone, 42,000 people, the great majority families with children or senior citizens, are on food stamps. 
   Both provisions in this conference report are important to my state of Vermont. First, the increase in the maximum amount of excess shelter expense deduction to qualify for food stamps is important as we have lately seen housing prices increasing rapidly in Vermont. Without the increase contained in the conference report, rapidly rising housing prices are diluting the effectiveness of the food stamp program because the true need for food stamps is not being adequately represented. The vehicle allowance provisions are vital in a rural state like Vermont where a reliable car is almost a necessity to get to or find work. Providing flexibility in the vehicle allowance will allow low-income individuals to qualify for food stamps while being able to continue to own a reliable car. 
   While I would have liked to have seen the entire Hunger Relief Act included in this appropriations bill, the inclusion of these two provisions is an important first step forward. I will continue to push for Congressional passage of the entire Hunger Relief Act, but wanted to express my gratitude to the conferees for the inclusion of these provisions which are so important to my constituents. 
   Mr. President, as the principal author of the drug importation amendment included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill, I am taking this opportunity to provide a detailed explanation of the provisions of the drug importation section. 
   The conference report to H.R. 4461 amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and expands the entities permitted to import certain drugs into the U.S. under Section 801 of the Act, to include pharmacists and drug wholesalers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will promulgate regulations to carry out the importation provisions after consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Commissioner of Customs. 
   Under the new section 804(b), the regulations promulgated by the Secretary must ensure that each drug product that is imported under this section complies with section 501, 502, and 505, and any other applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFD&C Act) and is safe and effective for its intended use, as well as the provisions of this section. This provision also grants broad discretionary authority to the Secretary to include any additional provisions in the regulations that are necessary to protect the public health and to facilitate the importation of drug products under this section. 
   Subsections (c) and (d) outline extensive record keeping requirements that must be met in order to import under this law, including:

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to join with my colleagues in the Senate and House in a bipartisan effort to address the relatively new development of Internet pharmacies. The ever-increasing cost of prescription drugs has led a growing number of Americans to turn to Internet pharmacies to try to find savings. Our goal with the Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act is to allow American consumers to place the same confidence and trust in Internet pharmacies as they do in traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The bill we are introducing today is a starting point in addressing this issue. If there is not enough time to pass this bill in the remaining days of the session, then I hope to return to this issue early in the next Congress and finish what we have started. 
   We are well aware that the explosion of Internet commerce has put all manner of goods and services literally at our fingertips. In this respect, health care products and prescription drugs are no different from books, compact disks, or the many other products sold online. But there is a potential for very serious dangers when purchasing prescription drugs online. On March 21 of this year, I chaired a hearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to examine this issue. 
   In the search for lower-priced prescription drugs, American consumers can, unwittingly, order prescription drugs from rogue web sites that appear to be American-based companies, but are actually overseas sites offering low-priced prescription drugs that are unapproved, counterfeit, contaminated, expired, mislabeled, manufactured in unapproved facilities, or not stored or handled in a proper manner. 
   I believe legitimate Internet pharmacies that operate legally and ethically can offer valuable services to many Americans and have an important role in E-commerce. But there must be an appropriate regulatory system that protects American consumers from illegal and unethical behavior which can endanger lives, and which combats any rogue Internet operators. 
   Our legislation contains several provisions to protect consumers. But the most important is clearly the one that allows states to obtain nationwide injunctive relief against unlawful Internet sellers, as requested by the National Association of Attorneys General. Currently, in their efforts to combat illegal actions by a few Internet pharmacies, several states' Attorneys General have filed suit against the same companies and the same doctors. To simply prevent those bad actors from doing business in their state, each Attorney General has to file an action in his or her state court. This duplication of effort drains resources that could be utilized against other offenders. Since the states' primary goal is to prevent rogue sites from harming citizens, nationwide injunctive relief would allow each state to help protect all the citizens of this nation. This power would be directly analogous to the national injunctive relief contained in the federal telemarketing statute. 
   A number of witnesses at our hearing testified that the most prominent danger presented to consumers is the rogue pharmacies operating in countries other than the United States. In this case, the federal government is clearly the most appropriate entity to deal with international rogue pharmacists, and this legislation provides remedies. Our bill also provides for better coordination between federal and state authorities. 
   Mr. President, this legislation represents a great deal of work by Senator KENNEDY and myself. Representatives BLILEY, KLINK, and UPTON have worked on this issue as well, and I understand that they are introducing companion legislation in the House. I am pleased that we have been able to work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion on such a complicated issue. Any time Congress attempts to respond to emerging technologies, similar challenges are faced. 
   I recognize that we are introducing this bill late in the session and that several members have expressed concern with certain aspects of our proposal. I want to assure my colleagues that this legislation is a starting point. This will provide my colleagues with the opportunity to make comments and suggestions on the different policy areas. We have written this bill with bipartisan cooperation, and I look forward to continuing in that spirit as we work to ensure the safety of Internet pharmacies.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support the Agriculture appropriations conference report that will be considered by this body in the next few days. I think it is a good bill with a number of desperately needed aid provisions for our Nation's farmers. The provisions included in the bill for prescriptions are also desirable. 
   First, though, I want to talk a little about my own family history and why I am so proud and honored to be the author of the legislation with respect to prescription drugs and pharmacies. My family, on the Jeffords side, came to Vermont back in 1794. At least, that is the first time they bought a piece of land. They settled in the northern part of Vermont up on the Canadian border. Gradually, they moved down to a community a little further south, about 20, 30 miles from the Canadian border. The family ran a drugstore in Enosberg Falls called Jeffords Drug Store for over a hundred years. 
   I remember the summers so vividly. We always spent 2 weeks in Enosberg Falls, spent a week on the family farm, and then spent a week down in town with Roger Pratt and Cora Pratt, my uncle and aunt who ran the drugstore. I remember some wonderful times there. I could go up to the soda fountain, without having to do anything, and I could get a soda. Sometimes, I would be given the job of trying to swat the flies and keep the flies away. That was before we had insecticides. I know sometimes I would probably get a little annoying when I was 8 or 9 years old while swatting them too close to the patrons sitting at the little tables where they got sodas. Later, I had the great thrill of being able to stand behind the pharmacy's soda fountain and make sundaes and all sorts of things. It was a wonderful experience. 
   But what I learned more than anything else was the importance of a pharmacy to a small town. In those days, it was probably as much of the health care plan as you could get, along with the local doctor. The pharmacy was your health care, unless you got really sick and you would go to the hospital. But more people came in to get advice from the pharmacist as to what they should take for this or for that. Things went along very fine for many years. 
   As time went on, my uncle died. My aunt, who was not a pharmacist, was working the drugstore and she had to hire a pharmacist to do that work. Unfortunately, she died. When she died, the question was, Who is going to get the drugstore and the property? I took the position that I would be willing to sell it to the pharmacist. I got it appraised, and a price was set. He said, ``I'm sorry, but I'm going to go down the street and open a pharmacy and I will run you out of business.'' I said, ``Okay, go right ahead''--because I am a stubborn Vermonter--``I will run you out of business.'' So I had to go around the State and find a pharmacist. So we kept the competition going. 
   I finally sold the drugstore for twice what he wanted to pay, and I learned important things such as if you want a generic aspirin, you can look right next to the Bayer aspirin, and you will find an aspirin that is identical but in a different bottle, and it is cheaper. I have used that knowledge all through the years to save a buck on aspirin and other things. Many useful lessons have come from that experience. 
   What I also understood by being near the Canadian border was what it meant to that pharmacist in recent years. The drugs his pharmacy purchased cost twice as much as the pharmacist paid across the border in Canada. 
   It is more than just a casual knowledge that led me to become deeply involved in the bill which we now have as part of the appropriations bill. 
   I thank Senator SPECTER and Chairman COCHRAN for their very kind words about me and my work in this area. I deeply appreciate that.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report that will be considered by this body within the next few days. I think it is a good bill, with a number of desperately needed aid provisions for our nation's farmers. But today I would like to address the Prescription Drug Importation provision included in the bill. 
   We are all familiar with the problem. The cost of drugs, as a percentage of our health care dollar, is skyrocketing to the point of unaffordability for average Americans. During a time when we are experiencing unprecedented economic growth, it is not uncommon to hear of patients who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to make prescriptions last longer, because they can't afford the refill. Prescription medicines have revolutionized the treatment of certain diseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the medicines that their doctors prescribe. The fact is, failure to take certain medicine can be just as deadly as taking the wrong pill. 
   Today we are confounded by the question: Why do drugs cost so much more in the U.S. than in Canada or abroad? It's a good question--one for which the drug companies don't have any good answers. 
   It's true that these companies are making some miraculous breakthroughs. But why must Americans have to shoulder seemingly the entire burden of paying for research, development and a healthy return to shareholders? 
   I believe it is time we put an end to this unfair burden. I don't think it is fair to expect Americans, especially your senior citizens living on fixed incomes, to pay the highest costs in the world for prescription medicines, many of which are manufactured within our borders. 
   That's why more than a year ago I started working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for overseeing the safety of the drug supply in this country, to see if there were a way we could safely reimport prescription medicines into our country. 
   In July, on an overwhelming vote of 74-21, the United States Senate agreed to an amendment I offered, based on S. 2520, cosponsored by Senators WELLSTONE, DORGAN, SNOWE, COLLINS, and others, to do just that. Importantly, for the first time, we had developed and passed a proposal that did not, in the eyes of FDA, present public health and safety concerns. This was critical to me, because we have the gold standard in the U.S. when it comes to drug safety, and I don't want to do anything to undermine it. 
   Over the past few months, the drug companies have waged a furious campaign against my amendment, taking out advertisements and sending legions of lobbyists to Capitol Hill to argue that it would undermine safety. I don't think my amendment will undermine safety, but I do think it will undermine the price Americans pay for prescription drugs. 
   I was heartened by the positive movement in the Clinton administration over the past few weeks, from neutrality in July to outright support for my amendment, provided Congress gave enough money--$23 million this year--to FDA to carry out its responsibilities. Congress has agreed to do so, and if my proposal works out as I hope, it will be a small price to pay on the  potential billions of dollars that Americans will save on prescription drug costs. 
   The negotiators for the House and Senate on the agriculture appropriations bill have completed their work. Unfortunately, the process used in reaching this agreement was marred by partisanship. But the product is as strong as the one endorsed by the Clinton administration, and even stronger in some respects. 
   The proposal before Congress, while slightly different from my plan, is a strong and workable proposal. Critics have argued that the proposal has been weakened because it allows drug companies to frustrate the intent through manipulations of sales contracts. The fact is, this bill is stronger than either the House-passed or Senate-passed versions because it includes a clear prohibition of such agreements--something that was missing in the House and Senate bills. 
   Critics have claimed that the latest version of the bill contains a loophole regarding the labeling requirements. The fact is, the bill requires manufacturers to provide all necessary labeling information, and gives the FDA very broad power to write any other rules necessary to accomplish the intent of the provision. How much stronger can we get than that. 
   Critics have claimed that the bill unfairly restricts the countries from which these products may come. The fact is that the bill lists 23 countries to start the process, and lets the FDA expand the list at any time. 
   Critics have complained that this bill will expire after about 7 years. 
   The fact is that this is a vast improvement over the House-passed version which would have expired after only one year. As we all know, major legislation is frequently required to be reauthorized on 5 year cycles in order to force Congress to make improvements, and popular laws always survive this process. 
   This bill, like any other, is not perfect. But critics are wrong to suggest that it is weaker than the original Jeffords amendment. I ought to know. And so should John Rector, senior vice president for the National Community Pharmacists Association who has been a leader in the effort to reimport lower cost drugs and whose members would be responsible for making this proposal work. 
   Mr. Rector recently took the position that the bill, ``will result in the importation of far less expensive drugs.'' 
   Might the drug companies try to evade the spirit of this legislation? some probably will. Have we anticipated every action they might take? Of course not. 
   But I am confident that our proposal will work, and that the process has improved it. That is why the pharmaceutical industry is fighting this tooth and nail--they know it will work. They would like nothing more than to see us defeat this bill. That should tell you something about what they think the effect will be of this provision. 
   Mr. President, I must say--I am disappointed with how partisan this issue has become, and I am disappointed that the White House has moved the goal posts on this issue. In fact, I'd like to quote from the letter that President Clinton sent to Speaker HASTERT and Majority Leader LOTT less than 3 weeks ago. In that letter, he said ``I support the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 which the Senate passed'' and ``I urge you to send me the Senate legislation--with full funding.'' Mr. President, that is exactly what we are doing, except that the bill we are sending the President is even stronger than the original language. 
   But I am glad that the President has said he will sign the bill. I think this is because he knows that, at the end of the day, this provision will work, despite all of the political rhetoric. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this provision and support this Agriculture appropriations conference report. 
   I also would like to discuss the chart that is behind me that very succinctly asks and answers questions about the differences between the House amendment, the Senate amendment, and the conference agreement. 
   I think you will find by just looking at the complete list on the conference agreement, the important improvements that were made as it wondered through the normal legislative process which we all have to follow.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound disappointment that the Conference Report to the Fiscal Year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization bill does not contain language that was in the Senate passed bill to expand Federal jurisdiction in investigating hate crimes. 
   The language in the Senate passed bill was adopted by the Senate on June 20th by a vote of 57-42, and endorsed in the House on September 13th by a vote of 232-190. This language would expand Federal jurisdiction in investigating hate crimes by removing the requirement in Federal hate crime law that only allows federal prosecution if the perpetrator is interfering with a victim's federally protected right like voting or attending school. It would also extend the protection of current hate crime law to those who are victimized because of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability. 
   Mr. President, any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by hate are especially harmful. Many states, including my state of Vermont, have already passed strong hate crimes laws, and I applaud them in this endeavor. An important principle of the amendment that was in the Senate-passed bill was that it allowed for Federal prosecution of hate crimes without impeding the rights of states to prosecute these crimes. 
   The adoption of this amendment by the Senate was an important step forward in ensuring that the perpetrators of these harmful crimes are brought to justice. The American public knows that Congress should pass this legislation, and it is unfortunate that the conferees did not retain this important language. 
   Congress should pass this legislation, and I will continue to work to ensure that this legislation is enacted into law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to enthusiastically support this conference report which contains the important reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). 
   Over five years ago, Congress recognized the need for the Federal Government to take action and help combat domestic violence by passing VAWA. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that important legislation and have been pleased with the positive impact it has had in Vermont and around the United States. 
   The Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault has been a leader in creating innovative and effective programs toward our goal of eliminating domestic violence. Vermont has used funding under VAWA to provide shelter to battered women and their children and ``wrap-around'' services for these victimized families. Through VAWA, Vermont has also been able to help victims access legal assistance in the form of trained attorneys and advocacy services. In addition to fully utilizing funding available to train and educate law enforcement and court personnel, I am proud to say that Vermont is a national leader in the education and training of health care, welfare and family service workers who are likely to come in contact with victims of domestic violence. 
   While we have made advances in combating domestic violence in Vermont and all around the United States by programs funded through VAWA, there is still more work to be done. Every nine seconds across the country an individual falls victim to domestic violence. Recently, this statistic was brought home when churches and town halls in Vermont rang their bells in recognition and to raise awareness of this tragic violence that impacts so many lives. We must continue and strengthen our focus on this important issue. 
   I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this reauthorization when it was introduced this June, and feel that this legislation made many important improvements and additions to the programs and funding of VAWA while ensuring the maintenance of its core focus of combating domestic violence. Some important provisions of this legislation to Vermont include: 
   Reauthorization of current domestic violence programs through the Department of Health and Human Services and increasing funding for these programs so they can provide more shelter space to accommodate more people in need; 
   Extension of the discretionary grant program which mandates and encourages police officers to arrest abusers; 
   Creation of a five percent set aside towards State domestic violence coalitions; 
   Extension of state programs that deal with domestic violence in rural areas; and 
   Establishment of a new grant program to educate and train providers to better meet the needs of disabled victims of domestic violence. 
   In addition, I want to thank Senator HATCH and Senator BIDEN for including a reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act in the Violence Against Women Act. As the primary source of funding for local shelters, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act is a vital cornerstone in the Federal response to domestic violence. This reauthorization ensures that this program can continue to grow with an increased authorization level. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act is normally part of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act reauthorization process which is scheduled to be completed next year. As Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, I will be working with domestic violence organizations to see what, if any, changes need to be made in the Family Violence Prevention and Treatment Act to increase its capacity to serve the victims of family violence. 
   I am pleased with the fine work of Senators BIDEN and HATCH in crafting the original VAWA, and that these two Senators were able to further formulate a bipartisan, compromise version of this reauthorization which I was happy to cosponsor. 
   Since July, I have both written and talked to the Majority Leader calling for Senate consideration of this important legislation. While it was somewhat delayed, I am grateful that the Senate will be endorsing the reauthorization of VAWA today. While the reauthorization of VAWA is an important step, I remain committed to continuing to enact legislation to eliminate domestic violence in Vermont and all around the United States.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the excellent service of Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN as co-chair of the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition. Senator MOYNIHAN, as we all know and regret, will be retiring from the United States Senate at the end of this year. Many people have commented on his excellent service to the nation and to New York State. I want to pay tribute to his leadership on regional issues. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN was elected co-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition in April 1987. A bipartisan group of senators had formed the Coalition in 1978 with the goal of promoting regional economic and environmental interests. Senator MOYNIHAN replaced Senator Alan Dixon, and served for several years with Senator John Heinz. Upon his election as co-chair, Senator MOYNIHAN said, ``States in the frost belt have of late shared a burden of heavy losses in manufacturing jobs, military installations and contracts. Environmental concerns, from the rising waters of the Great Lakes to acid rain, occupy us all.'' 
   Over the past seven Congresses, Senator MOYNIHAN persistently has advanced investments in our region's infrastructure, job-training and education programs, and basic industries. A stickler for accurate and timely data in order to judge our challenges and progress, he has documented the flow of federal funds from the Northeast and Midwest. Working with both Republicans and Democrats, he also has been a champion of the Great Lakes and the region's other great environmental assets. 
   Now, Lake Champlain may not be a great Lake to the rest of you, but in our part of the world, it is revered in the same way. And it is the reason behind my earliest work with Senator MOYNIHAN. 
   In the summer of 1989, when I was a freshman Member of the minority party and Senator MOYNIHAN was Chair of the Environment Subcommittee on Water Resources, he scheduled a field hearing to gather information on the water quality status of Lake Champlain. The hearing was split into two sessions, one on each side of the lake. We heard from Vermonters in Burlington, then enjoyed a boat ride across the lake to hear from upstate New Yorkers in Plattsburgh. 
   As his first act after commencing the hearing in Burlington, Chairman MOYNIHAN graciously handed the gavel to me so that I might preside over the Vermont portion of the hearing. That marked the first time I ever chaired a Senate hearing, and was made ever more memorable by the fact that DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN had bestowed the honor. 
   We had an enjoyable, productive day, during the course of which Chairman MOYNIHAN entertained and enlightened the participants with his intimate knowledge of the history of Lake Champlain, one our nation's most historic water bodies. Moreover, he demonstrated a keen knowledge of the science, hydrology and ecology of Lake Champlain. Senator MOYNIHAN was bestowed a hero's welcome by his constituents upon disembarking on the Adirondack coast of Lake Champlain that day. He earned an everlasting respect among all who participated in the hearing. 
   We returned to Washington to draft the Lake Champlain Special Designation Act, in concert with Senators LEAHY and D'Amato, and promptly moved the bill through the scrutiny of the Water Resources Subcommittee, then the full Environment Committee and on to the Senate floor. Before the year had ended, that bill had become law. And it has proven to be a great success for the benefit of Lake Champlain, as well as a model for cooperation between different states, distinct federal regional jurisdictions and separate nations. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, I commend you for your leadership on this important law. And I thank you for the latitude you gave me, in my first year in this United States Senate, to put my mark upon this legislation which continues to have a profound and positive influence on the ecology of Lake Champlain and the quality of life for the hundreds of thousands of people who live, work and recreate. 
   Aside from this example, there are many others. Senator MOYNIHAN took his assignment as co-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition during a time when our region was being less than affectionately referred to as the ``rust belt.'' Manufacturing plants were closing, unemployment was high, and many workers needed to be retrained for new challenges. Senator MOYNIHAN led the Coalition in trying to identify and promote public policies that would take advantage of the region's common assets--its plentiful natural resources, distinguished university and research centers, significant financial centers, and a history of entrepreneurship. 
   Although he would be the first to admit that challenges remain, this region's progress over the past decade and a half results, in part, from Senator MOYNIHAN's consistent leadership. 
   With Senator MOYNIHAN's leadership, the Coalition has advanced numerous policy initiatives. It authored the nation's first pollution prevention law and promoted the National Invasive Species Act to block the proliferation  of biological pollution. The Coalition has protected the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and achieved increased appropriations for several energy efficiency programs. It held the first hearings and developed legislation on brownfield redevelopments, as well as on leaking gasoline storage tanks. The Coalition advanced increased trade with Canada, our nation's largest trading partner, and it spearheaded a range of initiatives to enhance the region's and the nation's economic competitiveness. 
   Mr. President, allow me to highlight a few other of Senator MOYNIHAN's specific efforts to advance economic vitality and environmental quality in the Northeast-Midwest region. In recent days, for instance, Senator MOYNIHAN has helped lead the Coalition's efforts to prepare for this winter's pending fuel crisis. Noting the rise in prices for heating oil and natural gas, he argued effectively for an emergency allocation of Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding. And he has been a consistent champion of Weatherization and energy conservation programs that help our region and nation to use energy more efficiently. 
   In order to block the introduction of invasive species in ballast water, Senator MOYNIHAN helped lead the charge for the National Invasive Species Act. He continues to work to expand that legislation beyond aquatic nuisance species to address the array of foreign plants and animals that cause biological pollution and economic loss throughout this country. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN and the Northeast-Midwest groups have highlighted the economic and environmental benefits of cleaning and redeveloping the contaminated industrial sites that plague our communities. He has sponsored Capitol Hill conferences on brownfield reuse, and distributed scores of Northeast-Midwest publications, including case studies of successful redevelopment projects. Senator MOYNIHAN also has helped push several bills that would provide financial, regulatory, and technical assistance for brownfield reuse. 
   To help provide financing and technical assistance to manufacturers, which remain critical to our region's economy, Senator MOYNIHAN and the Northeast-Midwest Coalitions have advanced the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, trade adjustment assistance, and industrial technology programs. He has sponsored an array of Capitol Hill briefings on robotics, optoelectronics, machine tools, electronics, and other industrial sectors. 
   In an effort to protect the Northeast and Midwest, Senator MOYNIHAN has been willing to face the criticism that comes from highlighting egregious subsidies going to other regions. He has noted, for instance, that taxpayers in the Northeast and Midwest subsidize the electricity bills of consumers in other regions, only to have those regions try to lure away our businesses and jobs with the promise of cheap electricity. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN has paid particular attention to the flow of federal funds to the states, tracking both federal expenditures as well as taxes paid to Washington. In his own annual reports and those by the Coalition, he documented the long-standing federal disinvestment in New York State and throughout the Northeast and Midwest. The Northeast-Midwest groups, for instance, found that our region's taxpayers received only 88 cents in federal spending for every dollar in taxes that they sent to the federal Treasury. In comparison, states of the South received a $1.17 rate of return, while western states obtained a $1.02 return. In fiscal 1998, the Northeast-Midwest region's subsidy to the rest of the nation totaled some $76 billion. Senator MOYNIHAN has led the effort to reverse this trend. 
   It has been a pleasure to work in a bipartisan coalition with Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. He has demonstrated that good public policy results from cooperation among Democrats and Republicans. His intellectual rigor and his demand for quality data have elevated policy discussions within both the Northeast-Midwest Coalition and throughout the entire United States Senate. 
   My colleagues from northeastern and midwestern states join me in thanking Senator MOYNIHAN for his consistent leadership and effective advocacy.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to file an amendment on behalf of myself, as chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and Mr. KENNEDY, Ranking Member of the Committee to H.R. 1102, the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2000, as reported by the Committee on Finance on September 12, 2000. Our amendment concerns pension issues within our jurisdiction. It would simplify and modify provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 relating to employer pension plans.
   More specifically, the amendment would expand the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (PBGC) Missing Participants program; reduce PBGC premiums for new plans of small employers; authorize the PBGC to pay interest on premium overpayment refunds; simplify the substantial owner benefit rules for terminated defined benefit plans; increase the PBGC guarantee of benefits in multiemployer plans; allow the Secretary of Labor to reduce or waive civil penalties for breach of fiduciary responsibility; make parties that are jointly and severally liable for fiduciary violations also jointly and severally liable for the related penalty; and improve and better target notices of benefit suspension to pension plan participants.
   Mr. President, I ask that our more detailed description of the amendment be entered into the RECORD.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure that the Senate is moving to pass the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources and Emergency Act Amendments of 2000, a measure that will reauthorize a national program providing primary health care services to people living with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to commend Senators HATCH and KENNEDY for the leadership they have provided since the inauguration of the legislation establishing the Ryan White programs over a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator FRIST whose medical expertise played a critical role in key provisions of the bill and continues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts on the range of health issues that come before the Senate. I want to recognize Senator DODD for his unwavering support for this legislation and people living with HIV and AIDS. Finally, I want to acknowledge Senator ENZI's recognition of the growing burden that AIDS and HIV have placed on rural communities throughout the country and the need to address those gaps in services. 
   It is also important that we recognize the dedicated efforts of our colleagues in the House of Representatives. Chairman BLILEY supported this bill through its passage and provided critical guidance through the negotiations. Representatives BILIRAKIS, COBURN, and WAXMAN have demonstrated time and time again their commitment to people living with AIDS and each has worked diligently to find a compromise to ensure the continued services for people with HIV/AIDS. Representatives BROWN and DINGELL have also played important roles in shepherding this bill through the legislative process. 
   Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. During the last reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act in 1996, the measure garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final passage. As evidence that strong bipartisan support continues, I am happy to report that this reauthorization bill was passed unanimously by this Chamber in June of this year. The bipartisan support for this important legislation underlines the critical need for the assistance this Act provides across the Nation. 
   With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the Ryan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support services to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II have provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by this disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in providing healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White program dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting this epidemic and have allowed States and communities around the country to successfully address the needs of people affected by HIV disease. 
   In recent months a number General Accounting Office studies have shown that the CARE Act is providing services and support to people with HIV who are most in need and most deserving of our help. The GAO found that CARE Act funds are reaching the infected groups that have typically been underserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, and ethnic minorities. These groups form a majority of CARE Act clients and are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions than their representation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found that CARE Act funds support a wide array of primary care and support services, including the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for people with HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and deaths. 
   Previous efforts to improve this legislation have led to incredible reductions in the number of HIV infected babies being born each year and, equally important, to increased outreach, counseling, voluntary testing, and treatment services being provided to women with HIV infection. Between 1993 and 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases declined 74 percent in the U.S. In this bill, I have continued to support efforts to reach women in need of care for their HIV disease and have included provisions to ensure that women, infants and children receive resources in accordance with the prevalence of the infection among them. 
   The AIDS Drug Assistance Program has been another critical success. This program has provided people with HIV and AIDS access to newly developed, highly effective therapeutics. Because of these drugs, people are maintaining their health and living longer. The AIDS death rate and the number of new AIDS cases have been dramatically reduced. From 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54 percent while new AIDS cases have been reduced by 27 percent. In this reauthorization bill we have improved access for underserved and poor communities and increased support for services that help maximize the impact of these therapies. 
   Despite our great success, the Ryan White program remains as vital to the public health of this Nation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. While the rate of decline in new AIDS cases and deaths is leveling off, HIV infection rates continue to rise in many areas; becoming increasingly prevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; and also among  women, youth, and minority communities. Local and state healthcare systems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our success in treating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. Rural and underserved urban areas are often unable to address the complex medical and support services needs of people with HIV infection. As the AIDS epidemic continues to expand into these areas across the country, this legislation will allow us to adapt our care systems to meet the most urgent needs in the communities hardest hit by the epidemic. 
   The bill being considered today was developed on a bipartisan basis, working with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and elected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought input to ensure that we addressed the most important problems facing communities of people with HIV infection. Finally we have worked closely with our colleagues in the House of Representatives to produce this agreement. This morning, our colleagues in the House of Representatives unanimously passed this legislation that we have before us. The agreements we have reached with our House colleagues have been fully explained in an Statement of Explanation and I would like unanimous consent that this document be printed as part of the RECORD.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues today in celebrating the passage of Children's Health Act, which Senators FRIST, KENNEDY, myself, and many others introduced earlier this year. The Children's Health Act passed the Senate on September 22, the House on September 27, and is now one step closer to becoming law. 
   The Children's Health Act will significantly improve the well-being of children in this nation. This bill authorizes prevention and educational programs, clinical research, and direct clinical care services for child specific health issues. 
   President Clinton needs to sign this legislation into law now. Our nation's medical research and treatment systems must be encouraged to recognize that children have unique needs. Without the initiative of the Children's Health Act, research into many of the diseases and disorders that effect children will be overlooked and neglected. 
   I am also excited that the Children's Health Act includes legislation that the Senate passed last year to reauthorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act is critically important for strengthening community-based mental health and substance-abuse prevention and treatment services. 
   We introduced SAMHSA reauthorization with strong bipartisan cosponsorship of many members of the HELP Committee. The service and grant programs administered by SAMHSA have gone far too long without being reauthorized. We will now be able to improve access and reduce barriers to high quality, effective services for individuals who suffer from, or are at risk for, substance abuse or mental illness, as well as for their families and communities. 
   This legislation includes the formula compromise for the Substance Abuse Treatment Block Grant that was originally included in the 1998 omnibus appropriations bill. This is an issue of paramount importance to small and rural states, and I am pleased that this legislation ratifies and continues the agreement reached in 1998. 
   The Children's Health Act and the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act are both the product of many months of work and collaboration among its many stakeholders. We have come this far because of the bipartisan dedication of members of HELP Committee and especially the leadership of Senator FRIST and Senator KENNEDY. I commend them both for their considerable efforts to help so many children and American families. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues in the House for their strong cooperation and support. I am so proud of being involved in this effort and I think the entire House of Representatives and Senate should be very proud of approving the Children's Health Act.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Educational Assistance for Military Connected Children Act of 2000,'' legislation that would transfer from the Department of Education to the Department of Defense financial responsibility for impact aid payments used to support the education of military dependents. 
   The impact aid program is authorized as Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Unlike other ESEA programs, however, impact aid payments are not used to support specific educational activities. Rather, these payments serve as general aid to local educational agencies to replace tax dollars which are foregone as the result of the presence of the Federal government. For example, Federal property--such as military installations--is not subject to property taxes. In addition, under the terms of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, many military personnel do not pay taxes in the States and localities where their children attend school. 
   Replacing lost revenues that would otherwise have been available to support local schools is an obligation of the Federal government in those cases where the revenue loss is directly related to Federal action. The Department of Education, through the impact aid program, provides nearly $1 billion each year for this purpose. 
   Over the past two years, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has been reviewing all ESEA programs. In the course of that review, I have come to the conclusion that the children of military personnel would be better served if the impact aid provided on their behalf were offered through the Department of Defense. 
   For one thing, DOD officials are in a far better position than are Education Department personnel to assess the needs of schools on or near military bases and to be aware of activities--such as downsizing or the construction or renovation of base housing--which can have a major effect on the amount of the impact aid assistance available to a school. In many cases, my committee has been asked, after the fact, to address specific impact aid problems which have confronted schools as a result of such decisions. 
   In addition, problems such as inadequate funding, overcrowded conditions, and lengthy delays in the issuance of impact aid payments could be better addressed if their resolution were the responsibility of those who are most familiar with the needs of these schools and their students. 
   On a number of occasions in the past, defense-related legislation has included provisions which have directly changed impact aid or have supported parallel programs. I do not see that the interests of schools or students are best served by this duplication of effort. 
   The Department of Defense currently offers of variety of services to military dependents--ranging from child care to health services. I believe the education of these children to be equally important. The legislation I am offering today is, I believe, a good starting point for impact aid reform designed to improve the educational opportunities available to military dependents.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Carolyn C. Roberts, an outstanding Vermonter and a national leader in the area of health care reform. As she prepares to retire from her position as President and Chief Executive Officer of Copley Health Systems in Morrisville, Vermont, it is important to reflect on how much one person can accomplish in serving others. 
   Carolyn was the first Vermonter and the second woman to serve as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the American Hospital Association. While Carolyn worked to represent all hospitals in this country, she stressed the importance of ensuring residents of rural communities access to health services in their communities. Carolyn also fought hard to preserve the role of community hospitals by advocating for relationships with other health systems. In this, as in every other capacity, her mark has been felt far beyond the boundaries of Lamoille County, Vermont. 
   Carolyn began her vocation as a nurse and quickly rose to leadership positions as a direct provider, clinical administrator, and executive. Since 1982, Carolyn has been at the helm of Copley, a rural, community-wide, health delivery system in Morrisville, Vermont. Under her leadership, Copley Hospital received the 1987 Foster G. McGaw Prize for Excellence in Community Service in 1987. 
   During Carolyn's career, she has frequently held leadership positions on national boards, including the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, The Hospital Fund, the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, the American Academy of Medical Administrators, and the American College of Healthcare Executives. 
   I must also acknowledge Carolyn's willingness to advise me personally over the years on critical health care policy issues. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I have been gratified to know that I could always rely on Carolyn's expertise in such arenas as rural health care, integrated systems of care, and Medicare reform. 
   Vermont has much to be grateful for, in view of Carolyn's steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life in our State. Whether serving on Governor Snelling's Blue Ribbon Health Care Commission or on Governor Dean's Task Force on Medicaid Managed Care, she always brought a sense of knowledge, dedication, and grace to solving the problem at hand. It is reassuring to know that her legacy will lead Copley Health Systems and the greater community of Vermont itself into the next millennium. 
   Mr. President, Carolyn's unwavering commitment toward improving the health status of Vermont and its citizens serves as a testament to us all. Vermont is truly indebted to her. Her deep commitment to the citizens of the Green Mountain State has endeared her to us. She has our sincerest good wishes for the future.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the Home Health Care Protection Act of 2000. This legislation has been written to make sure that qualification for Medicare home health services does not negatively impact other area's of a patient's recovery process, or preclude participation in important personal activities, like religious services. 
   The homebound requirement to qualify for Medicare home health services has been applied restrictively and inconsistently by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and its various Medicare contractors. In April 1999, the Secretary of Health and Human Services sent a report to Congress on the homebound definition. The report identifies the wide variety in interpretation of the definition and the absurdity of some coverage determinations that follow. While I do not support all the conclusions of the report, I do agree with the Secretary that a clarification of the definition is needed to improve uniformity of application. 
   Of particular concern to me is the disqualification of seniors who,  through significant assistance, are capable of attending adult day care programs for integrated medical treatment that has been empirically recognized as effective for some severe cases of Alzheimer's and related dementia's. A close reading of current law does not preclude homebound beneficiaries from using adult day services, yet some fiscal intermediaries are establishing reimbursement policies that force beneficiaries to forgo needed adult day services in order to remain eligible for home health benefits. 
   The Home Health Protection Act states that absences for attendance in adult day care for health care purposes shall not disqualify a beneficiary. It is inappropriate and counterproductive to force seniors to choose between Medicare home health benefits and adult day care services in circumstances where both are needed as part of a comprehensive plan of care. 
   I have also heard from numerous beneficiaries who fear that absences from the home for family emergencies or religious purposes could disqualify them from the home health benefit. Current law attempts to address this situation by allowing for absences of infrequent or short duration. However, one Vermont senior, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and numerous complications, cannot leave the home without a wheelchair and a van equipped with a lift. She left the home once a week, for three hours at a time, to visit her terminally ill spouse in a nursing home and attend religious services there together. She was determined to be ``not homebound.'' 
   There are more stories like this. At the same time, visiting nurses have identified individuals who are healthy enough to leave the home without difficulty, but because they never do, they retain home health benefits at the expense of the Medicare program. Our legislation specifically clarifies that absences from the home are allowed for religious services and visiting infirm and sick relatives. In a time of great need or family crisis, seniors should feel comforted that the government won't stand in their way. 
   Federally funded home health care is an often quiet but invaluable part of life for America's seniors. We in Congress have an obligation to make sure that the Medicare program lives up to its promise and that home health will be available to those who need it. I would like to thank my cosponsors, Senators REED and LEAHY for their dedication to this issue. We look forward to working with the rest of Congress to turn this legislation into law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Younger American's Act with Senators KENNEDY, CLELAND, and MURRAY. This legislation embraces the belief that youth are not only our nation's most valuable resource, they also are our most important responsibility. The needs of youth must be moved to a higher priority on our nation's agenda. 
   It is not enough that government responds to youth when they get into trouble with drugs, teen pregnancy, and violence. We need to strengthen the positive rather than simply respond to the negative. Positive youth development, the framework for the Younger American's Act, is not just about preventing bad things from happening, but giving a nudge to help good things happen. And we know that it works. 
   Evaluations of Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other youth development programs have demonstrated significant increases in parental involvement, youth participation in constructive education, social and recreation activities, enrollment in post-secondary education, and community involvement. Just as important, youth actively participating in youth development programs show decreased rates of school failure and absenteeism, teen pregnancy, delinquency, substance abuse, and violent behavior. 
   We also know that risk taking behavior increases with age. One third of the high school juniors and seniors participate in two or more health risk behaviors. That is why it is important to build a youth development infrastructure that engages youth as they enter pre-adolescence and keeps them engaged throughout their teen years. The Younger American's Act is targeted to youth aged ten to nineteen. This encompasses both the critical middle-school years, as well as the increasingly risky high school years. 
   The Younger American's Act is about framing a national policy on youth. Up until now, government has responded to kids after they have gotten into trouble. We must take a new tack. Instead of just treating problems, we have to promote healthy development. We have to remember that just because a kid stays out of trouble, it doesn't mean that he or she is ready to handle the responsibilities of adulthood. Research has shown that kids want direction, they want close bonds with parents and other adult mentors. And I believe we owe them that. Ideally, this comes from strong families, but communities and government can help. 
   In order to keep kids engaged in positive activities, youth must be viewed as resources; as active participants in finding solutions to their own problems. Parents also must be part of those solutions. This legislation requires that youth and parents be part of the decision-making process on the federal and local levels. 
   The United States does not have a cohesive federal policy on youth. Creating an Office on National Youth Policy within 
   the White House not only raises the priority of youth on the federal agenda, but provides an opportunity to more effectively coordinate existing federal youth programs to increase their impact on the lives of young Americans. The efforts of the Office of National Youth Policy in advocating for the needs of youth, and the Department of Health and Human Service in implementing the Younger American's Act will be helped by the Council on National Youth Policy. This Council, comprised of youth, parents,  experts in youth development, and representatives from the business community, will help ensure that this initiative continually responds to the changing needs of youth and their communities. It will bring a ``real world'' perspective to the efforts of the Office and HHS. 
   The Younger American's Act provides communities with the funding necessary to adequately ensure that youth have access to five core resources: 
   Ongoing relationships with caring adults; 
   Safe places with structured activities in which to grow and learn; 
   Services that promote healthy lifestyles, including those designed to improve physical and mental health; 
   Opportunities to acquire marketable skills and competencies; and 
   Opportunities for community service and civic participation. 
   Block grant funds will be used to expand existing resources, create new ones where none existed before, overcome barriers to accessing those resources, and fill gaps to create a cohesive network for youth. The funds will be funneled through states, based on an allocation formula that equally weighs population and poverty measures, to communities where the primary decisions regarding the use of the funds will take place. Thirty percent of the local funds are set aside for to address the needs of youth who are particularly vulnerable, such as those who are in out-of home placements, abused or neglected, living in high poverty areas, or living in rural areas where there are usually fewer resources. Dividing the state into regions, or ``planning and mobilization areas,'' ensures that funds will be equitably distributed throughout a state. Empowering community boards, comprised of youth, parents, and other members of the community, to supervise decisions regarding the use of the block grant funds ensures that the programs, services, and activities supported by the Act will be responsive to local needs. 
   Accountability is integral to any effective federal program. The Younger American's Act provides the Department of Health and Human Services with the responsibility and funding to conduct research and evaluate the effectiveness of funded initiatives. States and the Department are charged with 
   monitoring the use of funds by grantees, and empowered to withhold or reduce funds if problems arise. 
   The Younger Americans Act will help kids gain the skills and experience they need to successfully navigate the rough waters of adolescence. My twenty-first century community learning centers initiative supports the efforts of schools to operate after-school programs that emphasize academic enrichment. It's time to get the rest of the community involved. It's time to give the same level of support to the thousands of youth development and youth-serving organizations that struggle to keep their doors open every day. 
   I remember a young man, Brad Luck, who testified before the H.E.L.P. Committee several years ago. As a 14-year-old, Brad embarked on a two-year mission to open a teen center in his home town of Essex Junction, Vermont. He formed a student board of directors, sought 501(c)(3) status and gave over 25 community presentations to convince the town to back the program. Demonstrating the tenacity of youth, he then spear-headed a successful drive to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund the start-up of the center. Today, the center is thriving in its town-donated space. This is an example of the type of community asset building supported by the Younger Americans Act. The Younger Americans Act is about an investment in our youth, our communities, and our future. I want to thank America's Promise, the United Way, and the National Collaboration for Youth for their work in providing the original framework for the legislation. I am proud and excited to be part of this important initiative.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have had an invigorating debate on a very important and complex issue--whether to grant permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, status to China. There are many aspects to this debate: expansion and regulation of the international trading system; realignment of the US position within that system; review of China's internal policies--in particular its human rights record; assessment of the prospect for constructive and systemic change in China; and the effect of PNTR upon U.S. businesses and consumers. 
   As many of my colleagues may remember, 2 months ago in the Finance Committee I cast the sole vote in opposition to granting PNTR to China. Although I believe in engagement with China, not isolating China, I felt strongly that I could not in good conscience vote to make this status permanent at that time. I told my colleagues about Ngawang Choephel, a Fulbright student from Middlebury College in Vermont, who was arrested by Chinese authorities while filming traditional song and dance in Tibet in 1995. Intent only on preserving traditional Tibetan music, Ngawang was charged with espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison. I strongly protested his arrest and incarceration, together with the other Members of the Vermont delegation, the administration, and human rights supporters all over the world. 
   For 5 years, we received virtually no information on Ngawang's whereabouts and his condition. In spite of a Chinese law guaranteeing every prisoner the right to receive regular visits from next of kin, Chinese officials ignored the repeated pleas from Ngawang's mother, Sonam Dekyi, to visit him. During Finance Committee discussion of the PNTR legislation, I made clear my anger over the Chinese Government's unconscionable refusal to adhere to its own laws. I am pleased to report that a couple weeks later, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States called to inform me that Sonam Dekyi would be granted permission to visit her son. I thank my many colleagues who raised this case with the Chinese, and I particularly thank the Chinese Ambassador for his efforts on Sonam Dekyi's behalf. 
   Last month, Sonam Dekyi and her brother traveled to China to see Ngawang Choephel. They were 
   treated very well and were allowed two visits with Ngawang. In addition, they had a meeting with the doctors at a nearby hospital who recently have treated Ngawang for several very serious illnesses. While Sonam Dekyi was very appreciative of the chance to see her son, she was disappointed to be granted only two visits and quite saddened to be denied her request just to touch her son after all these years. Most alarmingly, she found her son to be in very poor health. Despite receiving medical attention, he is very gaunt and reported ongoing pains in his chest and stomach. His mother fears for his life. 
   I fervently hope that in the wake of his mother's visit, greater attention will be paid to Ngawang's health, and that every effort will be made by Chinese medical personnel to treat his illnesses. However, I believe that the only solution to his health condition is medical parole. Ngawang needs extensive treatment and considerable rehabilitation. This cannot be accomplished under the harsh conditions of prison, especially a Chinese prison. 
   On humanitarian grounds, I appeal to the Chinese authorities to release Ngawang Choephel. This is the right thing to do, the decent thing to do, the human thing to do. Until Ngawang Choephel is released, I cannot in good conscience vote for PNTR. I urge the Chinese authorities to recognize the length of time Ngawang has already spent in prison and to move now before his 18 year sentence becomes a death sentence. I urge the immediate release of Ngawang Choephel. 
   I have not come to this position of opposition to PNTR easily. For the past 10 years, I have supported engagement with China and renewal of most favored nation status. The benefits of international trade for the Vermont economy are very clear, and Vermont businesses have proved very resourceful at developing high paying and desirable jobs for Vermonters. In 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen Square uprising, this was a particularly tough position. It was difficult to know how to channel my profound outrage over Chinese behavior and how to bring about the greatest degree of change in the shortest period of time. After considerable research and much discussion with people holding many points of view, I concluded that change in China would be most rapid if the channels of communication were open to 
   the rest of the world. Engagement with China on all fronts, including economic engagement, is going to be necessary to produce the long-term, systemic change required for expression of personal freedom and personal initiative. 
   The past decade has proven that change is slow and difficult. But there is progress, nonetheless. The reformers in the Chinese hierarchy are now pushing for membership in the World Trade Organization, WTO. They wish to be part of the global trading system and to open their country and their economy to international investment and influences. While there are some significant problems with the WTO system that need to be addressed, I am convinced that we must be a part of that system and we must exert a strong influence on its development. Our national interests are best served if all major economies are a part of this system, agree to play by the same rules, and are subject to the same enforcement mechanisms if they do not. 
   We have a very strong interest in encouraging diversification and decentralization in the Chinese economy and greater freedom of expression for Chinese citizens. The less citizens are dependent directly on the government for their jobs and housing, the more likely they are to get involved in local issues, to advocate for causes that concern them, to develop advocacy and democracy at the grass roots. In the long run, I believe this is also the best way to improve the human rights situation. It will take time. It will be incremental. Chinese society will never look just like American society, but hopefully it will be reconfigured more to the advantage of the average Chinese citizen. 
   Today, my overwhelming concern is for a young man who committed his life to the preservation of his own musical heritage. He found shelter in the green mountains of Vermont, even though his heart always lay in the rugged mountains of his homeland. Ngawang touched many Vermonters with his quiet manner and intensity of purpose. Vermont will not forget Ngawang Choephel. I have not forgotten Ngawang Choephel. I will not vote for PNTR until he is free. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to introduce today, along with Senators ENZI, KENNEDY, and REID, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. This legislation will ensure that our nation's health care workers, who tend to our citizens when care is urgently needed, will no longer be risking their own health, and, perhaps, their own lives, when providing this life giving work. 
   Statistics paint a stark picture of the risks from accidental sharps injuries that health care workers face daily on the job, injuries that can be prevented, and, when Congress passes this legislation, will be prevented. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that as many as 800,000 injuries from contaminated sharps occur annually among health care workers. Due to these injuries, numerous health care workers have contracted fatal or other serious viruses and diseases, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. 
   ``Needlesticks'' refer to the broad category of injuries suffered by workers in health care settings who are exposed to sharps, including items such as disposable syringes with needles, IV catheters, lancets, and glass capillary tubes/pipettes. The true shame in these alarming statistics is that accidental needlestick injuries can be prevented. Technological advancements have led to the development of safer medical devices, such as syringes with needle guards or sheaths. 
   The heart of the ``Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act'' is its requirement that employers identify, evaluate, and make use of effective safer medical devices. And the legislation emphasizes training, education, and the participation of those workers exposed to sharps injuries in the evaluation and selection of safer devices. The Act also creates new record keeping requirements, a ``sharps injury log,'' to aid employers in identifying high risk areas, and in determining the types of engineering controls and devices most effective in reducing or eliminating the risk of exposure. Importantly, the legislation we introduce today will not impede, but will encourage technological development, as it does not favor the use of a specific device, but requires an employer to evaluate the effectiveness of available devices. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join us in supporting the ``Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act.''

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act--known today as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. I am joined in this effort by many of my colleagues in the Senate and by Chairman GOODLING and others in the House, who are proposing a companion resolution today. 
   On November 29, 1975, President Gerald Ford signed landmark legislation which became Public Law 94-142. With the stroke of his pen, he opened the doors of our public schools to millions of children with disabilities. Public Law 94-142 serves as the foundation of our national commitment to assuring that children with disabilities have the same opportunity as all other American children to develop their talents, share their gifts, and contribute to their communities. Over the years, we have built upon this foundation by expanding its reach to pre-school children through early intervention programs. 
   This anniversary holds a special meaning for me. I am one of the few members now in this body who were present at the time the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was approved. It was one of the first pieces of legislation I worked on as a freshman member of the House of Representatives. At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate all children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students were denied access to a public education. 
   I was an original sponsor of Public Law 94-142 and had the opportunity to serve on the House-Senate conference committee which developed the final bill. Since then, I have actively supported the improvements made to the legislation over the past quarter century. I take great satisfaction in the extraordinary record of success this Act has built. 
   IDEA currently serves an estimated two hundred thousand infants and toddlers; six hundred thousand pre-schoolers; and almost 5.5 million children aged 6 to 21. The drop-out rate for this population has decreased, while the graduation rate has increased substantially. The number of young adults with disabilities enrolling in college has more than tripled. The number of children with developmental disabilities who live in state institutions, away from their families, has also been dramatically reduced. 
   Each one of these numbers represents a child whose life has been improved because we recognized the value of educating all our children. The contribution we made through legislation is an important one, but the real credit belongs to the people on the front lines who have seen to it that our goals have become realities. Teachers, related services personnel, administrators, professional and advocacy organizations, parents of children with disabilities, and the children themselves work each day to assure the promise of IDEA burns brightly. 
   Today we celebrate the progress that we have made in special education since 1975. It is also an appropriate time to consider the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead. I cannot talk about IDEA without mentioning yet again our unfulfilled promise. In 1975, Congress promised our 16,000 school districts that we would provide special education funding at 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure. As we all know, IDEA has never been funded at that level. We have improved our record in recent years, with large increases in appropriations. Even with this infusion of funds, the federal government provides less than 13% of the cost of special education services. We need to do more, and now is the time to do it. 
   The knowledge base we have developed over the past 25 years, coupled with continued advances in technology, hold the promise for astonishing progress in the future for students with disabilities. These students can now communicate, explore the world through the internet, and be mobile in ways we could not have imagined in 1975. If we are willing to commit the necessary resources, there is virtually no limit to the advances we could see over the next 25 years. I urge all my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution and in reaffirming the values and principles underlying IDEA.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr President, I rise today to join my good friend and colleague from Vermont in introducing a Resolution commending and congratulating Middlebury College on 200 years of providing quality higher education in Vermont. It gives me great pleasure in wishing this prestigious institution a very happy anniversary. 
   When Middlebury College first opened, seven students and one professor made up the entire faculty and student body. Two hundred years later, this institution has grown to include over 2000 and nearly 200 professors, and continues to remain a top rated liberal arts school. 
   As Middlebury College nears the culmination of their year-long celebration of their bicentennial, it is only fitting that we take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments and achievements of Middlebury College and the many graduates thereof. 
   Therefore it gives me great pleasure in joining Senator LEAHY in introducing this resolution and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am announcing my support for the Medicare Temporary Drug Assistance Act, introduced by Senator ROTH. The Act will immediately provide funding for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries who are having difficulty paying for the medicines that they need to live longer, happier lives. 
   Mr. President, we all know that as the baby boomers become eligible for Medicare the program needs to be reformed due to the increased population. As a part of Medicare reform, we must have a broad prescription drug benefit that ensures that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to affordable medications. It doesn't make any sense for Medicare to pay for the cost of hospital stays, but not cover the drugs that can keep patients out of the hospital. The best medicines in the world will not help a patient who can't afford to take them. That is why I will continue to do all that I can, as the Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and member of the Finance Committee, to assure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to affordable prescription drugs this year. 
   Today Chairman ROTH has introduced two bills--one version that stays within the Budget Resolution, and one that exceeds our budget restraints--and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, because I am convinced that it will immediately help millions of Americans who need but can't afford their medications. My own state of Vermont, which has already acted responsibly by extending prescription drug coverage to many low-income seniors through the Vermont Health Access Plan and the Vscript pharmacy program, will be rewarded with millions of federal dollars to extend its coverage to even larger numbers of Medicare beneficiaries. Under this bill, federal dollars will begin paying for prescription drugs for Vermonters on October 1 of this year--that's only about three weeks from now. 
   Mr. President, I commend Chairman ROTH for his outstanding leadership on this issue. Chairman ROTH has worked tirelessly with me and the other members of the Finance Committee, clearly demonstrating that he supports Medicare reform, including coverage of prescription drugs, and that he believes that this can only be achieved through a bipartisan process. I have strongly supported his efforts to build a bipartisan consensus on this issue through the Committee process. 
   Several weeks ago, Chairman ROTH acknowledged the difficulty in finding a bipartisan consensus during this election year, and announced that if the Finance Committee is unable to report out a bipartisan Medicare reform bill, he would propose a plan to cover prescription drugs for the most needy Medicare beneficiaries, through grants to the states, as a stop-gap measure until Congress is able to pass larger-scale Medicare reform. He also acknowledged that even if we were able to enact a prescription drug benefit this year, it would be almost impossible to implement such a plan for at least two years. The bill he has introduced today addresses both of these problems. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear. This proposal is a stop-gap measure that will be put into place only until we are able to achieve broad Medicare reform, including prescription drug coverage that benefits all Medicare beneficiaries. This is not a substitute for Medicare reform, and it does not mean that we have given up on enacting Medicare reform this year. We must also attack the problem of affordability by passing my bill, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (S. 2520), which already passed the Senate by a vote of 74-21 as a part of the Agriculture Appropriations bill. These efforts will be undertaken simultaneously. I consider this bill to be emergency aid for prescription drugs that will be the bridge to a comprehensive plan. It is a very important down payment that will benefit Vermonters and all Americans immediately. That is why I am an original cosponsor of Chairman ROTH's proposal, I urge my colleagues support. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to introduce legislation that will restore to state employees the ability to bring claims of age discrimination against their employers under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967. The Older Workers Rights Restoration Act of 2000 seeks to provide state employees who allege age discrimination the same procedures and remedies as those afforded to other employees with respect to ADEA. 
   This legislation is needed to protect older workers like Professor Dan Kimel, who has taught physics at Florida State University for nearly 35 years. Despite his years of faithful service, in 1992, Professor Kimel found that he was earning less in real dollars than his starting salary. To add insult to injury, his employer was hiring younger faculty out of graduate schools at salaries that were higher than he and other long-service faculty members were earning. In 1995, Professor Kimel and 34 colleagues brought a claim of age discrimination against the Florida Board of Regents. 
   Dan Kimel and his colleagues brought their cases under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 (``ADEA''). In 1974, Congress amended the ADEA to ensure that state employees, such as Dan Kimel has full protection against age discrimination. I stand before you today because this past January the Supreme Court ruled that Dan Kimel and other affected faculty do not have the right to bring their ADEA claims against their employer. The Court in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, held that Congress did not have the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity to individuals under the ADEA. As a result of the decision, state employees, who are victims of age discrimination, no longer have the remedies that are available to individuals who work in the private sector, for local governments or for federal government. Indeed, unless a state chooses to waive its sovereign immunity or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decides to bring a suit, state workers now find themselves with no federal remedy for their claims of age discrimination. In effect, this decision has transformed older state employees into second class citizens. 
   For a right without a remedy is no right at all. Employees should not have to lose their right to redress simply because they happen to work for a state government. And a considerable portion of our workforce has been impacted. In Vermont, for example, the State is one of our largest employers. We cannot and should not permit these state workers to lose the right to redress age discrimination. 
   This legislation will resolve this problem. The Older Workers Rights Restoration Act of 2000 will restore the full protections of the ADEA to Dan Kimel and countless other state employees in federally assisted programs. The legislation will do this by requiring the states to waive their sovereign immunity as a condition of receiving federal funds for their programs or activities. The Older Workers Rights Restoration Act of 2000 follows the framework of many other civil rights laws, including the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. Under this framework, immunity is only waived with regard to the program or activity actually receiving federal funds. States are not obligated to accept such funds; and if they do not they are immune from private ADEA suits. The legislation also confirms that these employees may bring actions for equitable relief under the ADEA. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the managers of this bill for their commitment to renewable energy. I particularly want to thank Senator HARRY REID for his leadership in bringing additional funding to advance the cause of clean energy in this nation. 
   Earlier this year the Senate renewable energy caucus, led by Senators ROTH, BINGAMAN, ALLARD and myself, sent a letter to the bill managers asking that they put the U.S. Senate on  record in support of wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and other renewable energy resources. 
   Mr. President, 54 of our colleagues signed that letter and they should know that the bill before us today boosts funding for renewable energy by $87 million over last years levels. This is a great achievement. And unlike in past years, I come to the Senate floor without the annual renewable energy funding amendment but with what will hopefully be an annual effort praising the managers of this bill. 
   We thank you Senator REID for your vision and commitment to reducing this nation's reliance on foreign oil and advancing our investment in clean, domestic energy resources. 
   This increase puts our country back onto the path of a sustainable energy policy. 
   In recent years, the U.S. trade deficit has soared. The number one contributor to the trade deficit is imported foreign oil--and its contribution has reached record levels. 
   Since the oil embargo of 1973-74, imports of foreign oil have risen from a little over 30 percent to 55 percent, and will hit 65 percent in a decade. By then, most of the world's oil will come from potentially unstable Persian Gulf nations. 
   These imports account for over $60 billion. That is more than 36 percent of the U.S. trade deficit. These are U.S. dollars being shipped overseas to the Middle East when they could be put to better use here at home. 
   In 1976, myself and a number of freshmen Members of the House of Representatives proposed such a provision and nearly passed it to the exact same 10 percent. Unfortunately, that failed. But at that time we, a number of us working together, did start the wind energy program, which is now blossoming, with Vermont being the leader in that field, and also, with a very good amendment I was able to get on, we started, really, the solar voltaic program at that particular time. During the period since that time, a couple of times we have come very close to putting into a mandatory situation where we would decrease the consumption of oil by 10 percent through renewables. 
   Now we are on our way, finally. Hopefully, this bill will pass. 
   We are lowering our balance of payments. 
   We are providing an invaluable insurance policy to enhance our national security. 
   And we are protecting our environmental and reducing air pollution. 
   Federal support for renewable energy research and development has been a major success story in the United States. Costs have declined, reliability has improved, and a growing domestic industry has been born. 
   Through this boost in the renewables budget, we are building upon our successes. We are helping to develop industries which reduce our trade deficit and boost national security. We are helping farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and small businesses. 
   The 54 Senators who signed this letter--and in particular--Senator REID, deserve a great deal of credit for protecting the environment, promoting job growth, and advancing America's future. 
   Again, I thank the two sponsors of the bill, Senators REID and DOMENICI. I praise them for their efforts and helping in any way possible. I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we consider preceding to legislation to grant permanent normal trade relations to China, I would like to alert my Colleagues to an important development. It is my understanding that a frail, elderly Tibetan woman will soon see her only son, who is in prison in Tibet. My colleagues on the Finance Committee may remember my raising my deep concern over the case of Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright student at Middlebury College in Vermont who is serving an 18 year sentence in Tibet on charges of espionage. As we debate entering a new relationship with China, based on mutual commitments to adhere to an international set of principles and regulations, I was increasingly angered by the refusal of the Chinese government to grant Ngawang's mother, Sonam Dekyi, permission to visit him in prison, a right guaranteed her by Chinese law. I spoke out about this case during the Finance Committee's mark-up of this legislation. 
   I am pleased to inform my colleagues that thanks to the skillful intervention of the Chinese Ambassador, the Honorable Ambassador Li, Sonam Dekyi will soon be in Tibet for a rendezvous with her son. Many of my colleagues have expressed their support for Sonam Dekyi's request, and I want to make sure they are aware of the Chinese government's decision to allow this meeting. Sonam will be in Lhasa all next week, and we are hoping that she will be allowed several lengthy visits with her son. Because Sonam is in poor health and travel to Tibet is very difficult for her, we are hoping that her visits will be of appropriate length and quality. I will be happy to share with my colleagues Sonam's report of her visit upon her return to India. 
   I continue to be worried about the health of Ngawang Choephel, and I will continue my efforts to obtain his release. But at this moment I wish to express my appreciation to the Chinese Ambassador for helping to make this humanitarian mission happen. I know that many Vermonters share my joy at this development and my hope that this is indicative of further progress in matters of great concern to our two countries.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Henri Nsanjama, a champion of conservation who died on July 18, 2000. At the time of his death, Mr. Nsanjama was serving as vice president and senior advisor on Africa and Madagascar for the World Wildlife Fund here in Washington. Henri was an ardent supporter of measures to protect Africa's elephants and of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. I worked with him on both of these important issues. Henri would have been pleased to know that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to vote in September to recommend that the full Senate ratify the Desertification Convention. So far, 168 countries have ratified the Desertification Convention and the U.S. is the only major industrial nation that has not done so. Henri worked hard to change that and ensure that biodiversity is protected in Africa and other parts of the world facing desertification. 
   A native of Malawi, Henri dedicated his life to the challenge of linking wildlife conservation with the needs of local communities. He believed that the most challenging aspect of his work was conserving wildlife without undue hardship to human beings. 
   Henri built his distinguished career through formal education and hands-on field work. He served as a Trainee Game Ranger in his native Malawi, where he recalled being inspired by the sight of more wild animals than people. He attended the College of African Wildlife Management in Mweka, Tanzania, and became a Warden at Kasungu National Park in Central Malawi. 
   Henri then moved to the United States, and earned a Bachelor's Degree in wildlife biology and natural resources economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After Amherst, Henri returned home to Kasungu National Park and eventually was hired as Malawi's Deputy Director of National Parks and Wildlife. Three years later, he attended the University of Stirling, Scotland, where he received a Master's Degree in environmental management.  
   Anxious to apply his new knowledge, Henri returned home once again to become the Director of National Parks and Wildlife for Malawi. He also served as the Coordinator of Wildlife Activities of the ten countries of the Southern African Development Coordination. 
   In 1989, Henri was nominated Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a post he held for a year before beginning work with WWF in 1990. Henri led WWF's program in Africa for 10 years. During that time he focused in particular on the areas of building the capacity of people and institutions to manage natural resources, community based natural resources management, protected areas management and species conservation. He was co-author of ``Voices from Africa: Local Perspectives on Conservation.'' 
   A strong African voice for conservation, Henri also knew how to reach Americans. About Henri, Kathryn Fuller, President of WWF, said, ``Throughout his 10 years with WWF, Henri was an inspirational ambassador for conservation with the American public and our partners in Africa. He was also at the forefront of efforts to include women in conservation and increase their educational opportunities.'' 
   Beyond his professional accomplishments, Henri is remembered as a gifted storyteller who touched the lives of everyone he encountered. In a profile five years ago, he was asked to describe his idea of perfect happiness. He answered, ``As a Christian, it's believing in what good was given to you and to be able to do good things for others. This is my 19th year of working in conservation. I've never done anything else and I never want to.'' 
   In Henri's honor, the World Wildlife Fund will establish a fund to ensure that Africans are given the opportunity to care for and manage their natural resources, a fitting tribute for one who believed so strongly in the importance of empowering Africa's people to sustainably manage their natural heritage. 
   Henri's funeral in Malawi this week was attended by 3,000 people, including eight ministers of the Malawian government. He was clearly loved and respected by many and has left a lasting legacy of sustainable management of wildlife and wildlands in Africa. For this we should all be enormously grateful.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I introduce the Wage Awareness Protection Act. 
   We have made great strides in the fight against workplace discrimination. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act more than 30 years ago served to codify this Nation's commitment to the basic principles of equal opportunity and fairness in the workplace. At the time, we enacted not one, but two laws, aimed at ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work: the Equal Pay Act (``EPA'') of 1963, and to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. More recently, Congress reaffirmed this commitment by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which expanded the 1964 Civil Rights Act and gave victims of intentional discrimination the ability to recover compensatory and punitive damages.  
   Certainly a lot has changed since we first enacted these laws. It should come as no surprise that more women are participating in the labor force than ever before, with women now making up an estimated 46 percent of the workforce. Women are also spending more time in school and are now earning over half of all bachelor's and master's degrees. In addition, women are breaking down longstanding barriers in certain industries and occupations. 
   Despite these advances, the unfortunate reality is that pay discrimination has continued to persist in some workplaces. In a recent hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, we heard testimony that a principal reason why gender-based wage discrimination has continued is that many female employees are simply unaware that they are being paid less than their male counterparts. These unwitting victims of wage discrimination are often kept in the dark by employer policies that prohibit employees from sharing salary information. Employees are warned that they will be reprimanded or terminated if they discuss salary information with their co-workers. 
   I believe that a fundamental barrier to uncovering and resolving gender-based pay discrimination is fear of employer retaliation. Employees who suspect wage discrimination should be able to share their salary information with co-workers. I am not alone in my belief. According to a recent Business and Professional Women/USA survey, Americans overwhelmingly support anti-retaliation legislation. And, 65 percent of those polled, said they believe legislation should protect those who suspect wage discrimination from employer retaliation for discussing salary information with co-workers. 
   The Worker Awareness Protection Act will prohibit employers from having blanket wage confidentiality policies preventing employees from sharing their salary information. In addition, this new legislation will bolster the Equal Pay Act's retaliation provisions including providing workers with protection from employer retaliation for voluntarily discussing their own salary information with coworkers. I am excited about this legislation. It is my hope that it will help point the way to elimination of any pernicious discriminatory pay practices. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes today to join in paying tribute to our former colleague, PAUL COVERDELL. Memories of PAUL consistently paint a picture of a hard-working, even-tempered consensus-builder. He sought results, not headlines. He was not one who basked in a national spotlight, but his quiet influence within this body has made a profound impact on public policy affecting all Americans. 
   My last opportunity to work with PAUL was during consideration of the Educational Opportunities Act this spring. It is fitting that our final work together addressed the subject of education, as this is an area where we had many dealings over the years. We did not always agree on the specifics, but the one thing about which we wholeheartedly agreed is the importance of education. 
   During the S. 2 debate, PAUL made a compelling case for the need to assure a good education for all of our citizens. He said:  
   From our very founding, we have understood that a core component of maintaining a free society is that the population is educated. To the extent that any among us who are citizens do not have the fundamental skills, the basic education, they are truly not free. They cannot enjoy the full benefits of American citizenship because they are denied the ability to think for themselves, for their families, for their communities, for the Nation.  
   In all my work with PAUL, I found him to be fair and accommodating. He was always one to search for the areas of consensus, and he was enormously successful in finding ways to reach accommodation to move things forward. His persistence and his commitment to making things happen--no matter how many obstacles were placed in the path--earned him the respect of all who had the privilege to work with him. 
   I join in extending my deepest sympathy to his wife Nancy. I also offer my condolences to members of his staff, who have lost not just an employer but an inspiring example of the work and rewards of a life devoted to public service. 
   We will miss PAUL, but his inspiration to me and to all the others of this body will continue until we are gone from here also. I join all my colleagues in the deep sympathy that we feel at this moment. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank Senators for their eloquent words about the passing of PAUL COVERDELL. I see no one else seeking recognition for that purpose, so at this time I move back to the bill. If there is anything PAUL COVERDELL disliked, it was quorum calls and delaying the process. We worked together on the education bill, and I know he was proud when it moved expeditiously and the debate was lively. 
   In that spirit, I think we must return to the business before the Senate. 
   Therefore, I call up amendment 3925.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will now discuss a problem we have relative to the cost of prescription drugs. 
   I am joining several of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in offering an amendment that will take a giant step toward providing access to affordable prescription drugs for Vermonters, and all Americans. 
   Our amendment will allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import safe, U.S.-made, FDA-approved lower-cost prescription drugs from other countries. We maintain the gold standard of safety in this country, but hope to rein in the platinum standard we have for prices. 
   Prescription drugs have revolutionized the treatment of certain diseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the medicines that their doctors prescribe. The best medicines in the world will not help a person who can not afford them. 
   Americans pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and for many the price is just too high. 
   What's worse is that those Americans who can least afford it are the ones paying the highest prices. Americans who don't have health insurance that covers drugs are forced to pay the ``sticker price'' off the pharmacist's shelf. 
   In short, the practice of price discrimination hits the uninsured and low-income Medicare beneficiaries the hardest. 
   It is sad that during a time when the United States is experiencing unprecedented economic growth, it is not uncommon to hear of patients, like we heard in my committee's hearing yesterday, who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to make prescriptions last longer, because they can't afford the refill. 
   The question that we must ask is, can we put politics aside and work in a bipartisan manner to deal with this national crisis? I say we must. And I am hopeful that today we can. 
   This bipartisan amendment I am offering is based on legislation I introduced, S. 2520, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act, or the MEDS Act. Joining me in introducing that legislation were Senators WELLSTONE, SNOWE, and COLLINS and joining as cosponsors are Senators DORGAN and GORTON. 
   The hearing I held yesterday allowed all of the parties to fully examine and articulate their views on this legislation. 
   Our bill, which we have revised and are offering as an amendment, gives pharmacists and wholesalers the ability to negotiate more favorable prices with manufacturers. They can do so because they will have the ability to purchase in other countries--this is important--where exactly the same drugs are sold for far less. These are areas that have been approved by the FDA. There is no question about that aspect. 
   The drug industry has argued that this amendment compromises safety. As chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, safety is my first concern. That is why these imports will be limited to FDA-approved drugs that are made in the United States or FDA inspected facilities. And that is why this amendment reflects weeks of discussions with the people who enforce our drug safety laws. 
   The amendment before us is a revision of the MEDS Act based on input from government experts who raised issues of public health and safety. Specifically, I asked FDA for technical assistance on this bill, and addressed each safety concern that the agency raised. 
   I also point out to my colleagues that this amendment specifically authorizes FDA to incorporate any other safeguard that it believes is necessary to ensure the protection of the public health of patients in the United States. 
   This amendment is about free trade. Why should Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? All this amendment does is allow international competition to bring rational pricing practices to the prescription drug industry. It introduces competition which is the hallmark of our success in this Nation. 
   I point out this bipartisan amendment also drops a provision in our original bill that would have allowed personal imports, which I would have liked to retain because I think it is important. 
   We dropped the personal use provision in order to answer concerns that some raised about safety. I was willing to compromise on that point at this time in order to get a bill that raises no safety concerns at all. 
   I want the record to clearly reflect that I still feel strongly that Vermonters should not be in violation of federal law if they go a few miles across the border into Canada to get deep discounts on prescriptions. We do nothing in here to indicate they should not be allowed to do so. 
   This amendment will provide equitable treatment of Americans, particularly those who do not have insurance, or access to big discounts for large purchases like HMOs. As I said before, this is not the only solution. I strongly believe we need a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare system for those people who are eligible for Medicare. But it is a commonsense measure that we can enact now to ease the burden of expensive prescription drugs on our people, for those on the borders, and all Americans. I ask for the support of my colleagues. 
   I yield the floor.

This amendment is worded in such a way as to prevent the proposal from ever taking effect because they know it will be impossible, certainly so difficult as to be unworkable, to prove prospectively that all savings will be passed on to the patients. There is no way that can happen. This is just in there to clean this bill up. I strongly oppose this amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have heard long arguments today about the bill. I think there is general agreement, however, that if it is safe and possible, we should allow our people in this country to be able to take advantage of international competition to bring the cost of pharmaceuticals down to a reasonable rate and to that which other people in this world are able to receive.  
   Keep in mind, that is what the goal is. Right now, the bill requires the FDA to ``contain such additional safeguards as the Secretary may specify in order to ensure the protection of the public health of patients in the United States.'' 
   I would like to pose a question to the chairman on his amendment. The amendment requires that the section may not operate unless it poses ``no risk.'' Am I correct in assuming that the author's intent is that there be ``no risk'' above that which prevails today?

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in the introduction of the ``Early Learning Opportunities Act of 2000''. We first brought this legislation to the floor of the Senate as an amendment to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In fact, it is the pending amendment when we return to consideration of S.2. 
   Simply stated, this bill is designed to help parents and others who care for young children acquire the resources and tools that they need to do their most important job---nurturing and teaching our children. There is broad, bi-partisan support for this legislation because many of my colleagues recognize the importance of learning in the first few years of life. 
   Science has taught us that the most explosive time of learning for humans is during the first few years of life. Parents and others who provide care for our children need some help and support to make the most of these early years. Changes in family structures, the weakening of the role of the  extended family, and the rise in the number of working mothers have increased the need for communities to provide additional support for parents. 
   The Early Learning Opportunities Act builds on existing state and federal efforts by expanding the range of programs, the types of activities, and the populations served by other early learning initiatives. Current federal efforts focused on early childhood learning promote programs that provide full- or part-day out of home care and education. Rather than duplicate these programs, the Early Learning Opportunities Act places its emphasis on helping parents and other caretakers increase their abilities to support positive child development. 
   The Early Learning Opportunities Act will provide funding for parent support programs. Parents are their child's most important teachers. Before anyone thinks about kindergarten, teaching the alphabet, or counting the number of blocks in a tower, children are learning from their parents. When a parent talks and sings to an infant, the baby is learning about sounds and words as a method of communication. When children are fed and then rocked to sleep, they learn about security and love, which will contribute to their sense of self and autonomy. Long before they walk through the schoolhouse door, children have learned important lessons from their parents and others who have taken care of them during the first few years of life. 
   Funding for the Early Learning Opportunities Act can be used to promote effective parenting and family literacy through a variety of community-based programs, services and activities. If parents are actively engaged in their child's early learning, their children will see greater cognitive and non-cognitive benefits. While all parents want their children to grow up happy and healthy, few are fully prepared for the demands of parenthood. Many parents have difficulty finding the information and support they seek to help their children grow to their full potential. Making that information and support available and accessible to parents is a key component of the Early Learning Opportunities Act. 
   Early Learning Opportunities Act funds can be used to provide training for child care providers on early childhood development, child safety, and other skills that improve the quality of child care. For many families it is not possible for a parent to remain home to care for their children. Their employment is not a choice, but an essential part of their family's economic survival. And for most of these families, child care is not an option, but a requirement, as parents struggle to meet the competing demands of work and family. Just as it is essential that we provide parents with the tools they need to help their children grow and develop, we also must help the people who care for our nation's children while parents are at work. 
   States can use a portion of the funds made available for the Early Learning Opportunities Act for statewide initiatives, such as wage and benefit subsidies which encourage child care staff recruitment and incentives to increase staff retention Today, more than 13 million young children--including half of all infants--spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. In Vermont alone, there are about 22,000 children, under the age of six, in state-regulated child care. 
   The Early Learning Opportunities Act will improve local collaboration and coordination among child care providers, parents, libraries, community centers, schools, and other community service providers. By assessing existing resources and identifying local needs, the community organizations receiving funds will serve as a catalyst for the more effective use of early learning dollars and the removal of barriers that prevent more children, parents and caretakers from participating in good programs. Parents and child care providers will be able to access more services, activities and programs that help them care for children. 
   An investment in early learning today will save money tomorrow. Many of America's children enter school without the necessary abilities and maturity. Without successful remediation efforts, these children continue to lag behind for their entire academic career. We spend billions of dollars on efforts to help these children catch up. Research has demonstrated that for each dollar invested in quality early learning programs, the federal government can save over five dollars. These savings result from future reductions in the number of children and families who participate in federal government programs like Title I, special education, and welfare. 
   The Early Learning Opportunities Act is designed to be locally controlled and driven by the unique needs of each community. The legislation authorizes $3.25 billion in discretionary funding over three years for early learning block grants to states. The bill ensures that the majority of the funds will channeled through the states to local councils. The councils are charged with assessing the early learning needs of the community, and distributing the funds to a broad variety of local resources to meet those needs. In Vermont, the Success by Six initiative has demonstrated the importance of placing the resources and responsibilities at the local community level. 
   The Early Learning Opportunities Act will serve as a catalyst to engage diverse sectors of the community in increasing programs, services, and activities that promote the healthy development of our youngest citizens. Funds may be used by the local councils in a variety of ways: to support reading readiness programs in libraries, parenting classes at the local health center, parent-child recreation programs in the park, and child development classes at the school. Access to existing early learning programs can be increased by expanding the days or times that young children are served, by increasing the number of children served, or by improving the affordability of programs for low-income children. Transportation can be provided to increase participation in early learning programs, activities and services. By keeping the use of the funds flexible, local councils can work with parents, health care professionals, educators, child care providers, recreation specialists, and other groups and individuals in the community to create an affordable, accessible network of early learning activities. 
   The Early Learning Opportunities Act will help parents and care givers who are looking for better ways to integrate positive learning experiences into the daily lives of our youngest children. When children enter school ready to learn, all of the advantages of their school experiences are opened to them--their opportunities are unlimited. I urge my colleagues to support and co-sponsor the ``Early Learning Opportunities Act of 2000''. I urge you to give our nation's children every opportunity to succeed in school and in life.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues today in introducing the Children's Health Act of 2000. This bill authorizes a variety of programs and initiatives that promise to significantly improve the health of children in this nation. I want to commend Senators FRIST, KENNEDY, DODD, GREGG, DEWINE, REED, BOND, GORTON, ABRAHAM, and DURBIN for their work and commitment to protecting and improving the health of our children. 
   This bill takes a multifaceted approach in addressing the most pressing healthcare problems facing our children today, such as brain injury, birth defects, asthma, and obesity. The bill authorizes prevention programs, educational programs, clinical research, and direct clinical care services. It also enhances the training and knowledge base of pediatric healthcare researchers through training and loan repayment programs. In the face of so many dangerous diseases and conditions, the holistic approach taken by this bill offers the best hope for protecting and improving our children's health. 
   This bill provides funding for critical research on children's heath. The Pediatric Research Initiative, based in the National Institutes of Health, will lay the foundation for comprehensive, cross cutting pediatric biomedical research. Such a center has the potential to yield valuable new information on child growth and development. 
   The Child Development Study, a long term study of environmental influences on children's health, will also yield important insights into the environmental factors that influence the growth and development of our children. This understanding will play a critical role in shaping future policy and programs for children's health. This research, in addition to other research opportunities provided in this bill promises to significantly improve our ability to protect the health of our children. 
   In addition to research, this bill provides resources for care and prevention programs. For example, this bill authorizes aggressive programs to prevent and treat one of the most challenging childhood health problems, traumatic brain injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is directed to conduct research on prevention and to implement public education and information programs. The Health Research and Services Administration is authorized to fund community support services to develop support or enhance care systems for individuals with brain injuries. These programs, coupled with research at NIH, address both the causes and the consequences of traumatic brain injury. 
   This bill authorizes the creation of a National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities to collect, analyze, and distribute data on birth defects. This provision will allow for important data to be developed to guide the development of programs and policies to assist children and families coping with disabilities. Having worked for many years to improve the quality of life of people living with disabilities, I strongly support this effort to address the challenges of disabilities at the earliest age possible. This center will help to coordinate and focus our approach, and serve as a clearinghouse for information that will improve both healthcare and quality of life for children with disabilities. 
   By targeting asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, this bill will make a difference in the lives of thousands of children and young people who suffer with this disease across the nation. Asthma jumped by 75 percent in the general population between 1980 and 1994. Among children under four there was a rise of 160 percent. It is estimated that this condition debilitates about 33,000 Vermonters (22,000 adults and 11,000 children). Grant programs authorized under this bill will fund comprehensive asthma services, mobile health care clinics, and patient and family education to reduce the impact of this dangerous disease. As this disease continues to strike more and more of our youth, it is critical that programs to reduce asthma have priority. 
   Oral health is also improved under this legislation, which targets the disparities in access to dental care and preventive therapies among poor children. In addition to direct care services, this provision enhances community based research and training to improve our knowledge of effective clinical and preventive measures. With 20 percent of children experiencing 80 percent of the dental cavities, it is time we focus on this neglected population and make a difference in their health. 
   An investment in the health of the nation's children will undoubtedly have long term rewards, as we move our understanding of and ability to treat childhood diseases far beyond current capabilities. Clearly, the time has come to comprehensively and aggressively tackle the primary causes of poor health for our children. I strongly support this legislation. The health of the nation rests on the health of our children, and we must do all we can to prevent and treat diseases that strike at the most vulnerable members of society.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this discussion of a national missile defense system comes at a timely moment. As we struggle to complete action on our thirteen appropriations bills that fund the Federal Government, we are confronted with many unmet needs and the desire to reduce the amount the Federal Government takes from the American taxpayers' hard earned income. The budget agreement locks in spending limits and requires a balanced budget, thereby preventing us from increasing spending on missile defense without cutting other programs. The debate over how much to spend in research on a national missile defense (NMD) system and whether it is time to make a decision on deployment strongly effects both the government's ability to meet the needs of Americans and the likelihood that we will be able to return money to the taxpayers of this country. The costs of such a system and the choices it would force us to make must be carefully weighed against the benefit of an NMD system, the chances that it would work, and the effect that deployment would have on the arms control agenda of the United States. 
   The decision on how much to spend on an NMD research program cannot be made without considering these questions. We must ask how much we can afford to spend on defense. I argue that national security also has a social component: affordable health care for all Americans, better job opportunities, a strong education system and economic security for America's seniors are all facets of a strong America. Without these things, military technology cannot protect America from the real threats against us. 
   I have long supported a reasonable program of research and testing of anti-ballistic missile technologies, while opposing efforts to throw huge increases at the program. I hope that thoughtful research will lead to some technological breakthroughs on ways to counter ballistic missiles. Their proliferation, especially in the hands of irresponsible leaders such as North Korea's Kim Jong Il, requires that we actively investigate possible defenses. We cannot ignore the emergence of new nuclear threats to the United States. 
   A premature decision to deploy an inadequately tested national missile defense system would also be a risk to national security. We cannot afford to spend huge amounts of money on a system we are not certain would work, or on a system that might provoke the very reaction from rogue states that we are ultimately trying to prevent. I  am a strong believer in strengthening international non-proliferation regimes such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which I am very disappointed the Senate has failed to ratify. Successful non-proliferation efforts are worth every penny! The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty has also served us well for many years, and we must be careful to not throw out a valuable asset in our rush to jump on the newest technology. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator DURBIN's amendment to add some important requirements to any national missile defense testing regime. This amendment would require realistic testing of an NMD system against the countermeasures that might be deployed against it. Senator DURBIN's amendment would help ensure that if we move to consider deployment of an NMD system, we would have a realistic assessment of that system's expected performance. Any evaluation of the effectiveness of an NMD system must consider not only the capabilities of the system itself, but its ability to survive what we expect might be thrown up to defeat it. Without this information, it would be hard to judge the true utility of such a system, and easy to overestimate its performance. 
   This past Friday's failed test of a space intercept brings into sharper focus the issue of claims and performance of an NMD system. Without realistic tests proving the expectations of researchers, we can never be sure that laboratory results can be duplicated in practice. It might be tempting to rush to deploy a system that appeared to provide significant protection for the American people. Passage of this amendment would help ensure that any system have a reasonable chance of working before it is considered for deployment. 
   I continue to believe that our greatest vulnerability to nuclear attack is not from a nuclear bomb delivered by an intercontinental ballistic missile, but rather from a nuclear devise slipped into the country in some much less visible way, like hidden in some cargo coming into a major U.S. seaport. Committing many billions of dollars to deploy the proposed defense systems would do nothing to protect us against this very real threat. At this time, it would be much more productive to invest these funds in stopping the spread of nuclear technologies and in using other means to counter terrorist organizations and other rogue elements. 
   Personally, I believe that the politics of missile defense have gotten way out ahead of the science of missile defense. This amendment would help restore the proper order of these concepts. I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to bring to my colleagues' attention a truly remarkable program that, unfortunately, is not located in my home state of Vermont, but nonetheless, does great work for Vermonters. Let me talk for a moment about the ``Wonders of Ward 8.'' To enlighten my colleagues, ``Ward 8'' houses the inpatient Post Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment program at the Northhampton VA hospital. According to Friends of Ward 8, a group of veterans whose lives have taken on new meaning as a result of their treatment at this facility, there is no better place on earth to deal with the psychological wounds of war. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is recognized worldwide as a true leader in the area of PTSD research and I applaud my friend Dr. Matt Friedman and his staff at the National Center for PTSD for the incredible work they have done to bring this often debilitating condition to the forefront of public recognition and scholarly research. Thanks also go to Dr. Friedman for making treatment of PTSD a priority for the VA. Ward 8 is a shining example of what an inpatient program specializing in trauma treatment should look like. Although Ward 8 is located in Massachusetts, veterans from all over the country have benefitted from this program--including many, many Vermonters. It was established to offer inpatient rehabilitative treatment to veterans suffering from PTSD as a result of their wartime service and is one of eight inpatient VA programs. Ward 8 provides this high quality service while running one of the most efficient and cost effective inpatient treatment program in the VA system. 
   According to the Friends of Ward 8, the staff at this facility are the reason for its success. I would like to recognize and thank the ``heroes'' of Ward 8 beginning with the Program Director Dr. Sonny Monteiro and his dedicated staff of men and women including Dr. Richard Pearlstein, Bruce Bennett, Sherrill Ashton, John Christopher, Ken Zerneri, Gary Kuck, Fran Lunny, Joe Polito, Brooks Ryder, Judy Zahn, Heather White, Wayne Lynch, Alec Provost, Mike Connor, Barbara Graf and Delores Elliott. I hear again and again from Vermonters about how they bring compassion and healing to the science of mental health. It is the human touch that they so generously dispense that makes such a difference in the lives of veterans who struggle to recuperate from their wounds of war. Their dedication to their jobs and to the lives they touch has built a legacy for this program unrivaled by any other PTSD program in the country. 
   I thank you, Ward 8, and the many veterans from around the country who have crossed your threshold, thank you.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. First, Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for your hard work on this appropriation bill, and your dedication to the LIHEAP program. Next, I would just like to emphasize the importance of the forward funding provision contained in the 1990 reauthorization statute--the Augustus F. Hawkins Human Services Reauthorization Act. 
   This provision responds to the states' need to budget and plan their LIHEAP programs in advance of the fall/winter heating season, allowing them to effectively meet their obligations under the law. Timely energy assistance in the form of consistent advance LIHEAP funding is critical to the success of LIHEAP. For planning purposes, the states have come to rely on the predictability that your advance funding mark provides them. 
   Our Northeast-Midwest region has experienced extreme fuel price spikes during the last six months, highlighting the vulnerability of our low income energy consumers. With fuel prices projected to be even higher this winter than last, we need an effective LIHEAP program more now than ever. It is the most effective tool we have to ensure the safety of our low income households during severe weather conditions.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week's announcement of the completion of the rough draft of the human genetic map is cause for both celebration and concern. 
   One of the challenges that comes to mind immediately is that we must protect Americans against genetic self-incrimination. What we are, should not be used against us. 
   This vast new storehouse of knowledge must be used to advance, not retard, individuals' health and welfare. 
   In 1998, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee held a hearing on genetic information and health care which proved to be one of the most important of the 105th Congress. 
   Following the hearing, I and Senator FRIST, with the other members of the HELP Committee, together with Senator MACK and Senator SNOWE, began drafting legislation that builds on Senator SNOWE's bill, S. 89, to ensure that individuals would be able to control the use of their predictive genetic information. 
   After a lot of hard work, we agreed to a set of strong protections against the use of genetic information to discriminate in health care. The results of these efforts are reflected in the genetic information provisions of The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.  
   As Dr. Francis Collins, director of the public genomic effort, pointed out this week:  
   Most of the sequencing of the human genome by this international consortium has been done in just the last fifteen months.  
   The pace of change is rapid, and this issue has increased in importance since our hearing two years ago. 
   Everyone in this Chamber and outside of it agrees we need to guard genetic privacy and guard against genetic discrimination. 
   Citing a study that found that 46 percent of Americans thought that the consequences of the Human Genome Project would be negative, Dr. Craig Venter said:  
   New laws to protect us from genetic discrimination are critical in order to maximize the medical benefits from genome discoveries.  
   That's why it's included in the Bill of Patients' Rights passed by the Senate as our body of scientific knowledge about genetics increases, so, too, do the concerns about how this information may be used. 
   There is no question that our understanding of genetics has brought us to a new future. Our challenge as a Congress is to enact legislation to help ensure that our society reaps the full health benefits of genetic testing, and also to put to rest any concerns that the information will be used as a new tool to discriminate against specific ethnic groups or individual Americans. 
   Our amendment which is already in the Patients' Bill of Rights, addresses the concerns that were raised at our hearing two years ago: 
   First, it prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies in all markets from adjusting premiums on the basis of predictive genetic information; 
   Second, it prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies from requesting predictive genetic information as a condition of enrollment. 
   Finally, it bars health plans from requiring that an individual disclose or authorize the collection of predictive genetic information for diagnosis, treatment, or payment purposes. A plan or insurer may request such information, but if it does, it must provide individuals with a description of the procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of the information. 
   Our amendment is identical to the provision adopted by the Senate last July. We should adopt it again today. 
   Technology and scientific developments, stimulated by the Human Genome Project, have led to remarkable progress in genetics and better understanding of alterations in genes that are associated with diseases in humans. We should witness extraordinary opportunities to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. 
   With the enactment of this amendment, we will be able to ensure that these breakthroughs will be used to provide better health for all members of our society. 
   A second challenge that we face is the possibility that employers might use genetic information to screen employees for various purposes, discriminating against one group or another based on genetic information. This, too, I think we should prevent. 
   I am not sure, and I do not think anyone in this Chamber can be sure, that we do not already do so. It was my understanding that the Americans With Disabilities Act already outlawed genetic discrimination in employment. 
   That was certainly Congress' intent when we enacted the ADA. 
   I am not alone in my belief. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has interpreted the ADA as including genetic information relating to illness, disease or other disorders and the Supreme Court issued a decision that provided further support for this position. 
   As recently as March of this year, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller stated that the ADA does indeed cover genetic discrimination. However, if I am mistaken, then this just highlights the need for further examination of the issue. 
   I am also concerned that Senator DASCHLE's amendment contains new statutory language that is different from the ADA, which would result in treating genetics differently than other health care information. 
   More and more, I think this will be an increasingly difficult line to draw. 
   If that is not confusing enough, there is yet another definition of genetic information that is part of the rule being promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services to protect individually identifiable health information. 
   I want to guard against employment discrimination, but I want to do it right. 
   The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee will hold a hearing in the next month or two on genetic discrimination in the workplace. 
   In the hearing, the committee will explore whether the ADA adequately covers genetic discrimination in the workplace. If we find that the ADA does not provide adequate coverage for genetic discrimination in the workplace then we will work to enact legislation that will provide adequate protection. 
   However, I think it is important that any law we enact is in parity with the ADA and our other employment discrimination laws. 
   Senator DASCHLE's amendment has good intentions, but putting provisions regarding genetic discrimination in employment into an appropriations bill, without studying the issue further, is inappropriate. This issue deserves and requires a thorough discussion in its own forum. 
   Again, I urge adoption of my amendment. It has already been agreed to by the Senate, and it is the product of two years of thought and hard work. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Although many of us came into today's debate believing that the ADA did in fact cover genetic discrimination in the workplace, we certainly understand the importance of this issue and of the need to hold a hearing on this issue. However, I would like to emphasize that as recently as a few months ago experts in employment law and, in particular, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller is quoted as stating that  
   *.*.* discrimination against an employee on the basis of diagnosted genetic predispositions toward an asymptomatic condition or illness is covered under the ADA's ``regarded as disabled'' prong.  
   So it is not as if we approached this debate believing that employees should not be protected against genetic discrimination in the workplace. We simply thought that they already were covered. 
   I want to reassure my colleagues that the HELP Committee will hold a hearing in the near future on this issue and that if we find that the ADA is not providing protection to workers we will develop and pass legislation to ensure that genetic information is properly protected. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if we are going to talk about improving patient care, we should talk about improving quality of care. We believe that every patient is entitled to the best medicine available. Reducing medical errors is an important part of improving quality. In fact, it is a critical issue. 
   The Institute of Medicine released a report late last year, which I requested. It focused our attention on the need to reduce medical errors to improve patient safety. The IOM report said that more people in this country die of medical errors than die of breast cancer, AIDS, or motor vehicle accidents--the one statistic we cannot ignore. In response to this report, the HELP Committee held four hearings. On June 15, Senator FRIST, Senator ENZI, and I introduced S. 2738, the Patient Safety and Errors Reduction Act. 
   This amendment, which is based on our legislation, will attack the problem of medical errors in several ways. First, it will provide a framework of support for the numerous efforts that are underway in the public and private sectors. Second, it will establish a center for quality improvement and patient safety within the agency for health care research and quality. Finally, it will provide needed confidentiality protections for voluntary medical error reporting systems. These provisions are consistent with the Institute of Medicine's recommendations. 
   The IOM report calls on Congress to establish a center for quality improvement and patient safety at the agency of health care research and quality. 
   This Center will take the lead on patient safety research and knowledge dissemination so that what is learned about reducing medical errors can be communicated across the country as quickly as possible. 
   The Institute of Medicine's report also calls on Congress to provide confidentiality protections for information that is collected for the purposes of quality improvement and patient study. This is the only way to get doctors and nurses to begin to voluntarily report their errors. These protections apply only to medical error reporting systems and do not diminish the current rights of injured patients. They will still have access to their medical records and they will still have the same right to sue as they do now. 
   We heard loud and clear at our four hearings that we need to encourage the reporting of close calls. A close call is a situation in which a mistake is made, but it does not result in injury to the patient. No harm is done, but the potential for harm is there. 
   Many times these ``close calls'' or ``near misses'' are the result of problems with the system. The nurse calculates the dose incorrectly because the medication name ordered was folinic acid and she is accustomed to giving folic acid. The doctor orders an inappropriate medication because he has no way to know that another doctor has given his patient a medicine that will interact. 
   Studies show that mandatory systems may actually suppress rather than encourage reporting. Punishment of individuals who make mistakes is not only ineffective, it is not the goal. The goal is patient safety. 
   It is time that we include our health care industry in the list of industries that have adopted continuously quality improvement and have taken significant steps to reduce human errors. Good people make mistakes. We need to do everything we can to put the systems in place to ensure that health care mistakes are very hard to make. 
   Neither the Institute of Medicine nor Congress discovered this medical error problem. Health care professionals have been at work for some time in trying to address medical errors. I hope that by becoming a partner in this process, the federal government can accelerate the pace of reform and provide the most effective structure possible. 
   I am pleased that this confidential, voluntary, non-punitive approach to addressing medical errors has the support of both the provider community and their oversight agencies. 
   We cannot afford to wait on this issue. The Nickles amendment will raise the quality of health care delivered by decreasing medical errors and increasing patient safety.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chairman STEVENS, Chairman ROTH, and Chairman SPECTER for their commitment to working in conference to restore funding to the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX), the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). These programs provide a vital safety net for our most vulnerable citizens. 
   The Social Services Block Grant program provides critical services for abused children, low-income seniors, and other families in need of assistance. For example, my own State of Vermont uses 80 percent of its Title XX funds to help abused and neglected children. Much of this money goes to assist the roughly 300 children in foster care in our State. This block grant was created under the Reagan Administration to provide States with a source of flexible funding to meet a variety of human service needs. It was the success of the Social Services Block Grant that paved the way for welfare reform. 
   When welfare reform was passed, Congress made several agreements with the states. One such agreement was that funds for the Social Services Block Grant would be reduced to $2.38 billion with States permitted to transfer up to 10 percent of allocated TANF funds into the block grant to ``make up the difference.'' 
   Since making that agreement in 1996, Congress and the Administration have repeatedly cut the funds appropriated for the Block Grant to its current year funding level of $1.775 billion. I am grateful that there is a strong commitment to maintain this year's funding level in conference. However, the reduction of the amount of TANF funds that States can transfer also must be addressed. Vermont is one of several States which transfer the entire 10 percent that is allowable under TANF. Unfortunately, even with full use of the transferability, many states are no longer able to make up for the repeated reductions in Social Service Block Grant funds. 
   I believe that the amount of TANF funds that States are permitted to transfer should not be cut in half, as current law requires, but should be increased to help mitigate the loss of Title XX funds that States have experienced since the 1996 agreement. The commitment to restore Social Services Block Grant funds to the current level is a good first step, but we should keep in mind that it is just a first step. 
   In creating the TANF program, the Federal Government limited the amount of welfare funds that would be provided to States in exchange for giving States more flexibility in the use of those funds. The booming economy combined with successful State efforts to move more people from welfare to work have allowed States to reduce the costs of welfare. Congress urged States to save a portion of their TANF grants for the inevitable ``rainy day'' when additional funds would be needed. Many States did save part of their TANF allocation, and Congress has threatened to reduce the TANF allocations promised to the States, because the funds have not been fully expended. I thank Senators STEVENS, ROTH, and SPECTER for their commitment to uphold the promises we made in 1996 during conference negotiations on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. 
   My home State of Vermont has an unparalleled track record in extending health insurance coverage to children and families, and the S-CHIP has played a key part in contributing to this success. While Vermont has achieved its enrollment goals for this program to date, it continues to reach out to enroll eligible children. Restoration of the S-CHIP funding is essential for Vermont and other States in order for them to continue enrolling children in this program. It is essential for Congress to keep its commitment to the S-CHIP program, otherwise States are not likely to continue their aggressive outreach and enrollment efforts and children may be left without health care. 
   I believe strongly that it is important for Congress to keep its agreements with the States---particularly regarding the Social Services Block Grant, TANF, and S-CHIP. The success of States in implementing these programs and the extent to which Congress and the administration maintain promised funding levels for these critical programs will help determine the future of State block grants. 
   How can we expect States and advocates to agree to flexible block grant initiatives, if Congress cannot fulfill its promise to maintain adequate funding?

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to note the 100th anniversary of the Charter of Manchester Village. 
   Manchester Village lies in the valley of the Battenkill River nestled between the Green Mountains to the east and the Taconic Mountains to the west. Due to its geography and topography, Manchester Village has been at the crossroads of the earliest trails and roads in Vermont. The slopes of Mount Equinox, which rise 3,800 feet above the village, provide numerous fresh water streams and natural springs for the enjoyment of the resident and visiting populations. 
   From its earliest days to the period of the Civil War, Manchester was very much frontier country with numerous inns and taverns at its crossroads. In 1781, according to the town history detailed in the 1998 Village Plan, ``there were no churches, but there were four taverns, a jail, a pillory and a whipping post.'' But by 1840, Vermont was the slowest growing state in the Union, as much of the natural resources of the state had been depleted, and wool imports from Australia had brought an end to a brief boom of sheep raising in Manchester and other parts of the state. 
   Beginning just prior to the Civil War, however, tourists began to discover Manchester. In 1853, the Equinox Hotel was opened by Franklin Orvis, who converted an inn that had begun in 1770. In 1863, when Mrs. Abraham Lincoln and her son, Robert Todd, stepped off the ten o'clock train, Manchester's reputation was made. Later, Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, and Vice-President James S. Sherman would follow as visitors to Manchester Village. 
   Today, the Equinox remains as one of Vermont's grandest establishments. The Village is also home to Hildene, the summer home of Robert Todd Lincoln and now operated as a house museum. The Southern Vermont Art Center, the Mark Skinner Library, Burr and Burton Academy, and two world class golf courses can be found in Manchester Village, along with numerous delightful inns and hotels, charming churches, exquisite restaurants, engaging museums, enchanting galleries and unique shops. 
   Manchester Village thrives today in large part due to careful planning and the guardianship of an impressive streetscape characterized by marble sidewalks, deep front lawns, large, historic buildings, and an absence of fences. Village residents have faced the challenge of responsible and active stewardship since the tourist boom of the second half of the 19th century, and the Village Charter is an important part of that history.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to join in introducing the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act. This important bill has been crafted to help Americans navigate our increasingly complex and ever changing health care system. I want to recognize the leadership of Senator JACK REED in bringing this issue forward for consideration. 
   Americans need and want help with their health care. In a recent national survey, Consumers Report and the Kaiser Family Foundation learned that half of all managed care plan members have had a problem with their plan in the last year. The vast majority of those ``problems'' were minor and successfully resolved in a very short period of time. However, a large number of Americans report significant financial consequences, lost time at work, or actual health declines as a result of these disputes. 
   The same survey reports that 84% of Americans want ``an independent place to turn for help'' with their health care rights. In fact, Americans prefer, by a wide margin, an independent source of help, as provided for in the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act, rather than a right to sue. 
   Three years ago, my own state recognized that Vermonters needed an independent program to help them navigate the complex health care delivery system. The state offices of the Division of Banking and Insurance and the Office of Vermont Health Access (our Medicaid agency) jointly administer the Vermont Ombudsman. It has helped Vermonters find care providers and use appeal procedures. 
   It is time for the federal government to play a constructive role in aiding states like Vermont that will answer the needs of their citizens for a consumer-focused, consumer-directed health care assistance program. This bill builds on the existing state-based programs to provide an office that provides consumers with the basic and credible information they want and need to make all kinds of important health care decisions. 
   The bill gives each State the opportunity to design a consumer assistance program that meets local needs. At the same time, the grant program calls upon the state to coordinate this overall health care consumer assistance office's activities with its existing consumer assistance offices such as the long-term care Ombudsman program for long term care consumers and its work in registering children and families for S-CHIP. 
   Access to quality health care services is a priority for every American family, every state, and this nation. It is clearly time for a federal commitment to help families get the health care information and assistance they want and need. 
   Once again, I want to thank Senator REED for this bipartisan effort on such important health legislation. Health care consumers, plans, providers, and states will be well served by enacting our legislation as soon as possible.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senators ROCKEFELLER and BREAUX to introduce a bill that will provide a third-tier earned income tax credit (EITC) for families with three or more children. I believe that the additional tax credit provided by this bill could be of significant help to working low-income families. 
   The EITC is a refundable tax credit to low-income families. It is only available to taxpayers who work and earn wages. Indeed, the EITC was enacted to encourage taxpayers to work--even at low-paying jobs--rather than relying on government programs. The EITC  has played a key role in reducing the poverty rate for families. By some estimates, it has been the single most important factor in removing children from poverty. 
   As currently structured, the EITC provides a credit to families with one child, and a higher credit to families that have two or more children. Families with three or four children receive the same EITC as families with two children. 
   For low-income families of four, we have seen significant progress in reducing the incidence of poverty. The combination of the minimum wage, the EITC, and food stamps can raise a family of four with a full-time year-round minimum wage worker close to the poverty line. But poverty persists in large families where there are more than two children. In families with three or more children, the official poverty rate is 29 percent--twice the rate for families with two children. While children in families with three or more children were 37 percent of all children in the United States in 1998, they comprised 57 percent of the children living in poverty. 
   It is not surprising that reducing poverty is more problematic in large families. As family size rises, so do family expenses. Welfare benefits increase with family size; wages, however, do not. For a large family, moving from welfare to work may actually mean less money. In addition, with more children, child care is not only more expensive, it is also more complicated. 
   With surplus projections now reaching $1.7 trillion, there are a whole host of tax reform proposals--many meritorious--circulating on Capitol Hill. In the debate about tax cuts, we must not lose sight of our most vulnerable workers. We should build on the proven success of the EITC to help these workers. I believe a larger earned income tax credit for families with three or more children will help put more low-income families on the path to self-sufficiency, while at the same time helping welfare reform succeed.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I begin by commending my colleague from Pennsylvania for his leadership as chairman of the Labor, HHS, Education, and related agencies subcommittee. His efforts to increase funding for education and health care often receive too little attention. I offer him my thanks on behalf of all Members who share our dedication to education. 
   He has had a challenging job crafting appropriations bills that balance the many real and competing needs of the Nation. He has been a strong advocate for education funding and an even stronger advocate for the funding of IDEA. He has been an equally strong advocate for more funding for the National Institutes of Health. This year he has once again taken up the challenge of balancing competing needs. The appropriations bill he brought to the Senate is a product of difficult negotiations between competing viewpoints. 
   Because of my respect for my friend from Pennsylvania, I come to the floor with an amendment only because of my conviction that there is an unmet Federal obligation that must now be met in full. Almost all the Members of this body have gone on record in support of fully funding our commitment to our local schools. We should fully fund IDEA for special education. 
   I also commend my good friend from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, who has been a tireless champion of education funding and health care funding. 
   I anticipate that the opponents of my amendment may argue that this amendment should be defeated because it takes funds from one education program and provides it to another. I, too, support increased funding for education, and have voted repeatedly over the past several days to waive the Budget Act in order to secure additional funds for education. It is clear, however, that this does not reflect the will of the Senate. 
   Because it is very clear that there is not sufficient support for an amendment which would exceed the budget caps, we must make difficult choices regarding which programs should be given priority. I have been a longtime advocate for funding for the title VI block grant program. This appropriations bill provides this program with a $2.7 billion increase, while providing a $1.3 billion increase for IDEA. I believe, and this belief is held by every school board in Vermont, that IDEA should be our very first priority. 
   In 1974 we made a commitment to fully fund IDEA. If 25 years later we cannot meet this commitment in an era of unprecedented economic prosperity and budgetary surpluses, when do we plan to keep this pledge? 
   When I first arrived in Congress, one of the very first bills that I had the privilege of working on was the Education of All Handicapped Act of 1975. 
   As a freshman Member of Congress, I was proud to sponsor that legislation and to be name as a member of the House and Senate conference committee along with my chairman Johns Brademus and then Vermont Senator Bob Stafford. 
   At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate all children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students were denied access to a free and appropriate public education. Passage of the Education of All Handicapped Act offered financial incentives to states to fulfill this existing obligation. 
   Recognizing that the costs associated with educating these children was more than many school districts could bear alone, we pledged to pay 40 percent of these costs of educating students. 
   I know that there is some disagreement about whether or not a commitment was made. I want to tell you as someone that was there at the time that we made a pledge to fully fund this program. 
   I have in my hands a petition from every school board in my State. I urge all of my colleagues to come by my desk and look at these petitions. They know we made that commitment. Passing this amendment will do more to help our school districts meet their obligation to improve education in this country than nearly anything else we can do. 
   In 1997 Congress once again took up this landmark legislation. This a complex bill that has profound impact on classrooms across the Nation. With the strong leadership of Senator LOTT, Senator FRIST, Senator GREGG, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DODD, Senator HARKIN, and many others, we passed the first reauthorization of IDEA in 22 years. It is an accomplishment that many of us are very proud of. 
   At that time, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay 40 percent of the costs of educating children. We made this pledge to families, to school boards and to the Governors of our States. Over the past 3 years, we have made some progress. 
   But as my good friend from New Hampshire has pointed out several times over the past year, we are only supporting 13 percent of these costs. In 1975, we made a pledge which we did not keep. In 1997 we made that same pledge once again when we reauthorized IDEA. 
   In the 105th Congress we felt it important to reaffirm our commitment to full funding for IDEA. We added language to the fiscal year 1999 Budget that stated that IDEA should be fully funded as soon as feasible. And it is feasible now. We know that. This language was adopted unanimously by the Senate. At that time, we still faced budget deficits and it was argued that full funding was not feasible. 
   In the 106th Congress we continued to press for full funding for IDEA. The fiscal year 2000 appropriations provided a $600 million increase in funding for IDEA. During the debate over the 2001 Budget Resolution the Senate adopted language that I advocated calling for full funding of IDEA as soon as feasible. 
   The appropriations bill that is before us raises funding for IDEA by $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2001. I commend Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN for providing for this historic increase in funding for IDEA. Nonetheless, this increase does not put us on the path toward fully funding this program. 
   Our amendment is simple. It doubles the increase that is provided in the bill  and provides IDEA with an increase that is comparable to the increase that Senators SPECTER and HARKIN have provided for the National Institutes of Health. 
   It provides a path by which we will achieve full funding for IDEA by fiscal year 2005. It sends a clear message to the Nation that we, as a body, make good on the commitment we make. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. 
   Good Lord, if we can't do it now with budget surpluses and the economy we have, if not now, when will we do it? I do not believe anyone can rationally argue this is not the time to fulfill that promise. I intend to do all I can to make sure we do. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I did not say it was. I carefully deleted that and said it is the cost of educating a child. 
   Mr HARKIN. A child? Then the Senator is correct. Usually it is stated the other way around. The Senator correctly stated the law. 
   But back to the point I wanted to make. Should we reach that 40-percent goal? Absolutely. We should have reached it a long time ago. I agree the Federal Government has fallen down on its effort to reach that goal. 
   What I rise in opposition to is how my friend from Vermont does this. What my friend is doing is he is taking money out of title VI, which was put in there for school construction and modernization--$1.3 billion. 
   He is taking that money and saying it should be used to help meet our goals on IDEA. 
   Again, it is a classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Do we have a need for the Federal Government to educate kids with disabilities and meet its goals to our States? Yes. We ought to fully fund IDEA. 
   Do we also have a responsibility to help States and our local school districts rebuild our dilapidated and crumbling schools? I believe the answer to that is yes. The average school in America now is over 40 years old. They are crumbling. They need to be modernized. They need to be updated. 
   I say to my friend from Vermont--and he is my friend and he is a great supporter of education, I know that--but I ask my friend to consider this: When we modernize schools and rebuild schools, one of the biggest beneficiaries is a kid with a disability. I want the Senator to consider that because when many of our old schools were built, they were not accessible. The doors are too narrow, the bathrooms are not accessible, and even the drinking fountains are not accessible, especially for someone who uses a wheelchair. 
   When we talk about school construction and modernization, we talk about $1.3 billion, which is a mere pittance of what is required. What the Senator from Vermont is actually doing by taking that money and putting it into IDEA, is penalizing kids with disabilities who need these schools modernized and upgraded. But then the Senator proposes that he is putting the money in IDEA to help kids with disabilities. Please, someone make some sense out of that for me. 
   As I said, the Senator's intentions are very good and laudable to increase funding for IDEA. If he were to do this in an open way and say we ought to increase money for IDEA, I would be on his side, but not at the expense of school modernization and construction because it is kids with disabilities, maybe above all others, who need to have some of these schools modernized, I say to my friend from Vermont. 
   Second, we just adopted an amendment offered by Senator Voinovich from Ohio. I said: Yes, we will accept it. The amendment of the Senator from Ohio says the schools can use title VI money, an allowable expense, to meet the requirements of IDEA. I submit to my friend from Vermont that the acceptance of the Voinovich amendment takes care of that. It leaves the money in there for school modernization and construction. However, out of the total pot of title VI money, the VOINOVICH amendment says that one of the allowable uses would be to use it to meet the requirements of IDEA. 
   I hope that will satisfy the Senator from Vermont. It still leaves the money in there for construction and modernization. I want to make that clear. Because this is where I differ with my friend from Vermont. Under his amendment we will have zero dollars for school construction and modernization. Zero. At least with the Voinovich amendment, they will be able to decide what they want to do. They will have money in there for school modernization and construction. 
   I hope the Senator from Vermont will perhaps reconsider this amendment. I know the goal is laudable. Heck, I support that. We ought to fund IDEA, but not take it out of school construction and modernization. 
   I hope we can move beyond this and meet our obligations to all our children in this country in education and not penalize one group to help another group. In this case, we penalize kids with disabilities to help kids with disabilities. That does not seem to make much sense to this Senator. I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Again, I want to point out that the people's understanding of our responsibilities are pretty clear in this case. If there is a statutory obligation and a commitment to fully fund a program--as there is in IDEA--this should be our highest priority. And again, I remind my colleague that this body has gone on record in vote after vote that we should fully fund IDEA. To suggest that fully funding IDEA should not be given higher priority than our desire to create a new construction program, is to abandon our original commitment. Certainly, if you owe money to a bank, that is a first priority over putting money in your savings account. 
   We made these pledges. The people back home know that the best way to improve education using Federal money is to have financial relief from the pressures of IDEA. It should be obvious what our conscience is telling us. We should fully fund the obligations we made back in 1975. That should be our primary priority. We said it over and over again and now we are turning our  back on our commitment. We say: No, we are going to use it for other things, and we are going to use it for things for which we have not already made a commitment, and that is to help with the construction of schools. School construction has always been a state and local responsibility. Fully funding IDEA will allow local communities to fund their own priorities, including construction. 
   I urge my friends to recognize our commitment to fulfill the promise we made and to use these funds to fund IDEA. 
   Look at these petitions from every single school board in my state. Every school district in the state says that the first thing we should do is fulfill our promise to fully fund IDEA. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I say to the Senator, as you know, I have voted that way. In fact, I offered the amendment to the budget resolution that would have done that. My amendment would have made mandatory money available for IDEA. But it was rejected. I agree with my friend from Iowa that we should dedicate more of the surplus to fully funding IDEA. It is the right route, but we were turned down by three votes. It failed. 
   Now I am trying to use a different route. I am interested in offering an amendment that I hope will be supported by a simple majority of this body. An amendment which funds education using the surplus is in violation of the budget resolution and must be approved by a sixty vote majority. The Senate has repeatedly voted to reject similar amendments. 
   This amendment is the one that has a chance to succeed in spite of the limitations imposed by the budget resolution. We can take the money from a brand new program, which we are doing, and shift it over to IDEA where I believe it ought to be our first priority. That is something we can do on this bill. We can't tap the surplus now, as I tried during the budget resolution. That was turned down.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is the Jeffords amendment relating to title VI of the bill. It takes money which is dedicated to school construction and puts it into IDEA and special education. 
   We have over and over again pledged to fully fund up to 40 percent of the cost of educating children in special education. We have not done that. All of you committed to doing that. We have no comparable historical obligation to contribute money for school construction. That is an option under title VI and will remain an option even if my amendment is approved. We believe we should fund and pay for our current Federal obligations first before we take on new and open ended obligations. It is a promise we have all made. It is a promise we should keep.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to make a statement for myself as well as Senator EDWARD KENNEDY, Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee; Senator SUSAN COLLINS; Senator CHRISTOPHER DODD; Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE; Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN; Senator CARL LEVIN; Senator CHARLES SCHUMER; Senator PAUL WELLSTONE; and Senator PATRICK LEAHY. 
   First, we would like to take this opportunity to commend the hard work and dedication of Senator ARLEN SPECTER. As Chairman of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Committee, he has the formidable task of crafting legislation which funds many of the programs under the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee, which I chair. This year's  bill, like many in recent memory, has proven challenging for Chairman SPECTER and Ranking Member TOM HARKIN, and they have done their best to deliver a fair bill. 
   There is no doubt; funding is tight. However, we would like to make a plea to appropriators as they put the finishing touches on the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. 
   This year, 46 Senators signed a letter in support of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Specifically, we asked for $1.4 billion in regular LIHEAP funding, along with $300 million in emergency funding. In addition, we urged $1.5 billion in advance LIHEAP funding for fiscal year 2002. While funding was not as much as we had hoped for in FY2001, our concern centers around the lack of advance FY2002 LIHEAP funding. 
   As you know, the importance of LIHEAP funding has been demonstrated this past year as many states have faced extreme temperatures and high fuel costs. The clear need for timely energy assistance in the form of consistent regular LIHEAP funding has been demonstrated. For planning purposes, the states have come to rely on the knowledge that our advance funding mark provides them. An advance appropriation allows for orderly planning of programs, as well as creating administrative systems for more efficient program management. 
   Advance appropriations for LIHEAP has been an effective tool that allows states to determine eligibility, establish the size of the benefits, determine the parameters of the crisis programs and enable the states to properly budget for staffing needs. In addition, states need an idea of the anticipated program's size in order to effectively meet their obligations under the law. 
   In conclusion, we appreciate the difficult work facing the Appropriations Committee. However, we feel strongly that this advance funding allocation is a critical tool in assisting our states to have the most effective LIHEAP programs possible, and we look forward to working with Chairman SPECTER to restore this funding in conference. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Americans, we have two vital tasks in our relations with Colombia. We are obligated to help a neighbor that is struggling to build democracy and civil society, and it is in our best interest to assist them in halting the flow of lethal narcotics from the Andean mountains of Colombia to American communities. These are the two underlying grounds for the Clinton Administration's ``Plan Colombia,'' a request for $1.07 billion in emergency supplemental funds over the next two years to aid Colombia. 
   After a painful decade of violence, the Colombian people have boldly elected an unassailable ally of democracy and reconciliation, President Andres Pastrana, and they are demanding an end to human rights abuses and impunity by both the paramilitaries and the FARC guerillas. At the same time, the lawlessness and violence of southern Colombia have permitted the narcotics dealers to widen their cultivation and consolidate their delivery routes into the U.S. With the remarkable success of U.S. Government anti-narcotics programs in Peru and Bolivia, eighty percent of the heroin consumed in the U.S. is now cultivated in Colombia. We have no choice now but to focus our anti-drug efforts in Colombia. 
   While I realize that we must bring pressure to bear on the drug cartels, my experience with Central America in the 1980s leads me to be very skeptical about the utility of the military response to social and political problems. I therefore have been wary of the Administration's Plan Colombia. My chief concerns with it have been the Colombian military campaign against narcotics cultivation, and the abysmal human rights record of paramilitary groups that have frequently been linked to the military forces. I am also concerned that we not get dragged into a major, long-term counter-insurgency effort which is not our fight. 
   In the end, though, I decided to go along with the Administration's proposal as significantly improved by the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee. The Subcommittee downsized the scale of the Colombian military effort, and shifted the funding from Blackhawk to Huey helicopters. Smaller and more agile, the Hueys are more suited to fighting narcotics cultivation, while the Blackhawks are more suited to counter-insurgency combat. The Subcommittee also increased the bill's sizable human rights component, including new programs to bolster the rule of law and fight corruption. The Subcommittee also shares my concern for U.S. Government responsibility for this expensive anti-narcotics effort by increased funding for  end-use monitoring. Given the well-documented human rights problems in Colombia, heightened monitoring is an extremely important component of this program. Although we will be funding a military effort, I note that U.S. military personnel are barred from any military operation, and that the Leahy Amendment puts strict safeguards on the activities of any U.S. funded partner, so that the human rights behavior of the Colombian military will now be under a microscope. 
   An integral component of the final legislation is sizable funding to encourage judicial reform, strengthen the rule of law, and improve the quality of life for all Colombians. Without greater social and income equality and greater respect for human rights, all our efforts will fail. The military aid can only provide an opening for those who are trying to build the foundation for civil society. By electing President Pastrana, the Colombian people have indicated their desire for a future free of drugs and violence. We must ensure that U.S. assistance is instrumental in helping them achieve that goal. 
   Let's make no mistake. If this bill becomes law, the U.S. will have made a major commitment to helping Colombia eradicate the narco-business that plagues both it and us. We are pledging to stand beside President Pastrana, an enlightened and popular leader with a broad mandate to pursue this campaign, while he also resolutely holds negotiations with entrenched but highly unpopular insurgents. I think that, for his sake and ours, we must give him the tools and the confidence to see this through.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me take just a brief moment to explain to my colleagues why they should join me in opposing the Robb amendment. 
   I am going to vote against this amendment because this amendment would stall a very important bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill, and send it back to go through the process again. I have been meeting on a bipartisan basis in the Finance Committee, working in good faith, to come to an agreement to provide prescription drugs through Medicare. I am disappointed that my colleagues have decided to throw bipartisanship aside and offer this politically motivated amendment. The fact is, Mr. President, I got this amendment only a few minutes ago, and it has not even been printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   I have always been very clear that I support a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, and I have several well drafted bills that would help seniors with their drug costs now. I have been working on a bipartisan basis to address the issue of coverage for seniors as well as the issue of the inequity of international pricing disparities for prescription drugs. 
   It is very difficult to understand this amendment because it is actually missing several pages, but from what I can tell, this bill has serious problems that need to be addressed. First, this amendment is drafted in such a way that would threaten the solvency of a Medicare program that is already in financial trouble. This proposal contains no reforms that would make the program more efficient, and in fact could cost as much as $300 billion over 10 years--far more than has been set aside in the Budget. The fact is, this amendment has not been considered by any Committee, and has only been considered for 30 minutes on this floor. In short, Mr. President, this is no way to pass landmark legislation that will affect all of our senior citizens. 
   For these and other reasons that I do not have time to list, I will join a bipartisan group of Senators in voting against this ill-advised procedure and against a politically motivated amendment that will keep us from accomplishing a real, bipartisan prescription drug benefit that will help our seniors right now. It is my intent to vote on a real prescription drug benefit that will benefit all seniors, and to complete legislation this year that will address the inequity of international pricing disparities.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join a number of my colleagues in introducing the National and Community Service Amendments Act of 2000. This legislation will reauthorize the National and Community Service Act and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. 
   The idea of the Federal government becoming a partner in community service originated with President Franklin Roosevelt's creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. It was continued with President Kennedy's development of the Peace Corps and President Johnson's VISTA initiative. President Nixon contributed to the community service movement by expanding senior volunteer programs. In the 1990s, both a republican president and a democratic president strengthened the community service structure. President Bush established the Points of Light Foundation and President Clinton created the Corporation for National Service. The Corporation for National Service not only incorporated the community service programs previously established, but also created AmeriCorps. 
   Since AmeriCorps began more than six years ago, over 40,000 individual shave become AmeriCorps members, serving local and national organizations. Recently, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which I chair, held a hearing regarding the reauthorization of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer 
   Service Act of 1973. One of the witnesses who testified was Emily Zollo, an AmeriCorps member from Cabot, Vermont. Emily serves with the Northeast Kingdom Initiative AmeriCorps Program in Lyndonville, Vermont. Her assignment involves the Cobleigh Public Library in Lyndonville where she works with the ``Books on Wheels'' bookmobile program. Emily drives the bookmobile and as she eloquently stated, ``brings books and stories to seven rural villages and towns that vary in population from 350-5,000 residents.'' Emily Zollo eloquently summed up her AmeriCorps experience by stating: ``Although the best part of my AmeriCorps experience has been meeting with kids at the various stops, learning how they see the world and introducing them to books which help them see a wider world, I have also learned some better ways to work and serve in the community. I feel that service has become a part of me and will be incorporated into my life and career. It's great to feel good about what you do, knowing you are making a difference in your community.'' 
   Other community service programs include Learn and Serve America which provides assistance to over one million students from kindergarten through college who participate in community service activities that are aligned with the students' academic programs. In my home State of Vermont, Learn and Serve is making a difference in a number of elementary and secondary schools, including vocational technical educational centers. Another service program, the National Senior Service Corps, serves nearly half a million Americans, age fifty-five and older, who use their talents as Foster Grandparents, serving as mentors to young people with special needs. In addition, the Senior Companions program helps other seniors live independently. Retired and Senior Volunteer Program members provide an array of services for unmet community needs. The senior programs are very essential to rural communities. In Springfield, Vermont, the Windsor County Retired and Senior Volunteer Program provides services to isolated seniors and persons with disabilities. 
   A key aspect of the National and Community Service Act is the State Commissions. The State Commissions decide which programs are to be funded, recruit volunteers, and evaluate and disseminate information about community and domestic service opportunities. The important role of States was also discussed at the hearing by several witnesses who represented various regions of the country. We heard about the positive impact of organizing service activities in a small rural State from Jane Williams, the executive director of the Vermont Commission on National and Community Service. Under Jane's leadership, the Vermont commission has been instrumental in getting 10,000 Vermonters of all ages and backgrounds involved in 31 community service projects. Governor Marc Racicot of Montana gave an excellent presentation regarding the importance of community service in ``building unique partnerships between public and private agencies by engaging particularly young people in service to their communities.'' 
   Community service is not a democrat, republican, or independent issue--it's an ideal--an ideal that is central to the philosophy of America--neighbor helping neighbor. It is in that spirit that I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the National and Community Service Amendments Act of 2000.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I applaud Senators KENNEDY and SMITH of Oregon, and others for providing us an amendment on the Department of Defense authorization bill which will be of great assistance in the prosecution of hate crimes. 
   This legislation will provide the Federal Government a needed tool to combat the destructive impact of hate crimes on our society. The amendment also recognizes that hate crimes are not just limited to crimes committed because of race, color, religion, or national origin, but are also directed at individuals because of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability. 
   Any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by hate are especially harmful. Hate crimes not only target individuals but are also directed to send a message to the community as a whole. The adoption of this amendment would help our State and local authorities in pursuing and prosecuting the perpetrators of hate crimes. 
   Many States, including the State of Vermont, have already passed strong hate crimes laws. I applaud them for their endeavor. An important principle of this amendment is that it allows for Federal prosecution of hate crimes without impeding the rights of States to prosecute these crimes. 
   Under this amendment, Federal prosecutions would still be subject to the current provision of law that requires the Attorney General or another senior official of the Justice Department to certify that a Federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. Such a requirement under current law has ensured that the States are the primary adjudicators of the perpetrators of hate crimes, not the Federal Government. Additionally, Federal authorities will consult with the State and local law enforcement officials before initiating an investigation or prosecution. Both of these are important provisions to ensure that we are not infringing on the rights of States to prosecute these crimes. 
   Senate adoption of this amendment will be an important step forward in ensuring that the perpetrators of these harmful crimes are brought to justice. I urge my colleagues to take a strong stand against hate crimes by supporting this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter, John James Daley, who passed away last night at the age of 76. Mr. Daley leaves behind a devoted wife, a loving family and a grieving community which will miss his leadership and example. 
   Jack, as he was known, was born in my hometown of Rutland, Vermont on June 21, 1923 to John M. and Bridget C. Daley. He attended Norwich University and proudly served as a member of the United States Marine Corps in the Phillippines and other parts of Asia. He found his niche as a public servant in 1956 when he was elected to the Rutland Board of Aldermen. From there he served as mayor for two years from 1961 to 1965, becoming the youngest man ever to have held the position. 
   In November of 1965 Jack was elected Lieutenant Governor of Vermont and served two terms with Governor Phil Hoff. Jack continued his career as a role model and advisor when he joined the Rutland Public School system as a teacher for many years. Through his lectures and by acting as a role model, he enriched the minds of our Vermont youth as he taught history, citizenship and American government. In 1981  Jack returned to the office of mayor and from there continued his legacy as he was reelected in 1983 and 1985. He continued to represent the interests of his hometown as he sought and served two terms in the Vermont House representing Rutland District 6-2. 
   Jack was a devoted family man. More than fifty years ago he married another Rutland native, Mary Margaret Creed. Together they became the proud parents of eleven children, nine girls and two boys. Mary's everlasting energy allowed her not only to raise their own eleven children but tirelessly work as a nurse in the nursery at the Rutland Hospital helping to care for the children of others. Ceaseless in her dedication, she continues to help out when needed despite her retirement. 
   Today, I pay tribute to the accomplishments of this public servant, father, husband and my friend, John James Daley. Today, Rutland and the entire state of Vermont grieve for a great man. Farewell, Jack. You will be truly missed.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my good friend Senator FRIST to announce the introduction of the Patient Safety and Errors Reduction Act, a bill which will work toward increasing patient safety for all Americans. 
   Late last year, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report citing medical errors as the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, with as many as 98,000 people dying as a result each year. More people die of medical mistakes than from motor vehicle accidents, AIDS, or breast cancer. The IOM report took a serious look at the problem of medical errors and provided some thoughtful recommendations for change. 
   Last year I worked closely with Senator FRIST to ensure that Congress pass Senate Bill 580, the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999. This newly passed legislation reauthorized by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and refocused its mission to support healthcare research on safety and quality improvement. I am pleased that AHRQ has decided to dedicate more than $20 million for research on medical error reduction. This shows a real commitment by Dr. John Eisenberg and his agency to address the problem of medical errors. 
   Our bill will attack this problem in several ways. First, it will provide a framework of support for the numerous efforts that are already underway in the public and the private sectors. Second, it will establish a Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety within the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. And finally, it will provide needed confidentiality protections for medical error reporting systems. 
   I believe we can save thousands of lives by substantially reducing medical mistakes over the next few years. We have a great opportunity to apply the safety lessons that we have already learned--both within health care and in other fields. 
   How can we prevent these mistakes? One lesson we have learned that was repeated time and again in our hearings is that mandatory reporting of all errors and subsequent punishment of healthcare professionals doesn't work very well. 
   Even good doctors and nurses make mistakes during the most routine of tasks. Clearly, the root cause of medical errors is more systemic. Medicine has some of the most advanced technology for treating patients and some of the most rudimentary systems for ensuring quality. Taking a look at the systems that ensure patient safety will go farther in addressing the problem of medical errors rather than reprimanding any one individual or group. 
   Over the past few decades we have seen one industry after another adopt the principles of continuous quality improvement. The government itself has instituted these principles, notably in its regulation of aviation. Focusing on punishment will only deter improvement. 
   Having said that, we are not interested in sweeping problems under the rug, but bringing them out into the open. And if an individual is harmed, this bill in no way limits the legal recourse that patients have now. The confidentiality protections are just for information that is submitted under quality improvement and medical error reporting systems. Patients and their lawyers will still have access to the entire medical record just like they do now. 
   Our bill also creates a new center for patient safety through AHRQ as the IOM report recommended. This Center will collect information on medical errors and serve as a center to develop strategies to reduce them. It is likely that additional funding beyond the $20 million recommended by the President will be needed for AHRQ's new role overseeing this center for patient safety. 
   We also need to allow for confidentiality--through peer review protections--for information that is voluntarily submitted regarding medical errors. This legislation provides for these protections. 
   Once the information is collected and analyzed, either through AHRQ or another deemed institution, such as the Vermont Program for Quality in Health Care, recommendations on ways to prevent errors need to be developed and disseminated throughout the health care industry. 
   It is my hope that these recommendations will continue to be incorporated into survey instruments by organizations such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the accrediting body responsible for hospitals and other inpatient healthcare settings. In this way, the health care industry can engage in the kind of continuous quality improvement that is vital to curbing errors and saving lives. But a medical errors program will only succeed if hospitals, doctors and other health professionals support it and participate in it willingly. 
   Neither the IOM nor Congress discovered this problem. Health care professionals have been at work for some time in trying to address medical errors. I hope that by becoming a partner in this process, the federal government can accelerate the pace of reform and provide the most effective structure possible. 
   I am pleased that our legislation has the support of many, including the United States Pharmacopeia, the American Hospital Association, the American Health Quality Association, the American College of Physicians/American Society of Internal Medicine, the American Psychological Association, and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices. 
   Mr. President, we cannot afford to wait on this issue. This legislation will raise the quality of health care delivered by decreasing medical errors and increasing patient safety and I will work to ensure its enactment this year.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to the 99 Vermont Farms that have been recognized by the Northeast Dairy Farms Beautification Program and received the Dairy of Distinctions Award. 
   The Dairy of Distinction Awards are given in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Vermont. The award was originally designed to help boost confidence in the quality of the milk, therefore increasing the milk sales. This is the fifth year that the honor has been bestowed on Vermont. 
   The criteria each farm must meet in order to receive this award are extremely stringent. According to the Vermont Department of Agriculture, Food, and Markets, the farms must include: clean and attractively finished buildings; neat landscaping, ditches, roads, and lanes; and well-maintained fences. Also taken into account are the conditions of other aspects of the farm operations such as cleanliness of animals, the barnyard, feed areas and manure management. This is a great feat considering that the average farm in Vermont is 217 acres. 
   Vermont is fortunate to have so many citizens who hold such pride in the presentation of their farms. I offer my congratulations to all of the farms that received the Dairy of Distinction Award, and may they be a shining example to all of the farms in Vermont. The winners are:

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of a pressing problem that affects not only the streams and rivers of Vermont, but the land and people who live and work along their winding routes. Vermont is home to over 2,000 dams of all sizes that clog Vermont's 5,000 river miles. Many of these dams were built in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when industries were located along rivers to utilize dams for running machinery, dispose of waste, and transport raw materials and goods. Currently, most of these dams no longer serve any commercial purpose and sit in disrepair, posing a significant safety threat and fundamentally altering the surrounding environment. 
   There are 150 dams in Vermont listed as either ``high'' or ``significant'' hazard, meaning that the failure of one of these dams presents a real threat to human life, property, and the environment. Last week, a Vermont newspaper highlighted the extreme danger if one of these dams were to fail by describing the 80 feet high wall water that would crash down the river valley if the Waterbury dam were to fail. Such a structural failure would mean that 22 square miles would be flooded, and a 15 foot high wall of water would hit the city of Burlington. 
   A disaster of this scope would be caused by the breakage of only a few dams across the state, but serious and extensive damage could also be caused by many smaller, similarly weak dams. Not only could damage occur due to failure, but many of the dams pose a significant threat to people using rivers for recreational purposes. The dams contain broken concrete, protruding metal, rotted timber cribbing and other hazards that threaten fisherman, boaters and swimmers with a serious threat of injury or death. 
   Not only are people and property at risk, but significant harm is being inflicted on the environment. Dams alter the basic characteristics of the rivers in which they are constructed and directly affect the features that comprise a riverine habitat. Non-functioning dams unnecessarily block wildlife, including fish that are attempting to migrate to spawn. 
   The Vermont Dam Remediation and Restoration Program allows the Army Corps of Engineers to enter into partnership with State, municipal, and private dam owners to assess and modify dams. The expertise and resources of the Corps would provide the much needed assistance to dam owners who would otherwise be unable to properly assess and modify dangerous, structurally unsound or environmentally harmful dams. I urge my colleagues to join me in addressing this critical problem and quickly pass this much needed authorizing legislation. 
   By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. KERREY, Mr. LAUTENBERG, and Mr. JEFFORDS):

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the McCain amendment on Section 527 organizations. I would first like to thank Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator MCCAIN for their work in focusing the attention of the nation on the problems Section 527 organizations are creating in our campaign finance system. 
   Most people don't know what a Section 527 organization is, and that is understandable, it is a highly complex issue. But what many people do understand is that our campaign finance system is broken and that we must do something to fix it. 
   A recent report by Common Cause reinforces the point that there are serious loopholes in our campaign finance system. 
   We must close the loophole allowing so-called ``Stealth PAC's'' organized under Section 527 of the tax code, to hide their donors, activities, even their very existence from public view. 
   Many years ago, James Madison said, ``A popular government without popular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' 
   In clearer terms, Francis Bacon conveys the same principle in the saying, ``Knowledge is Power.'' 
   Mr. President, the passage of this amendment would help arm the people with the knowledge they need in order to exercise their civic duty and sustain our popular government. 
   I have also long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' People deserve to know before they step into the voting booth which individuals or organizations are sponsoring the advertisements, mailings, and phone banks they may see or hear from during an election. We need to shine some sunlight on these secretive Section 527 organizations so that people will know who or what is trying to influence their vote. 
   I have watched with growing dismay the increase in the number of troubling examples of problems in our current campaign finance system. These problems have led to a perception by the public that a disconnect exists between themselves and the people that they have elected. I believe that this perception is a pivotal factor behind the disturbingly low voter turnouts that have plagued national elections in recent years. 
   It is time to restore the public's confidence in our political system. It is time to increase disclosure requirements and ban soft money. It is time to work together to pass meaningful campaign finance reform. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the McCain amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have been in Congress now for 25 years. During that period of time, I have sat on dozens of conference committees. I am, as most people know, somewhat towards the middle of the political spectrum. Thus, I am trying to make sure we don't do something which I think would be so counterproductive to the progress we want to make in the health care area if we pass this amendment. 
   We have made substantial progress in this conference committee. We are near agreement on all of the critical issues: Access, liability, and scope. It has not been an easy process. 
   Under the guidance of BILL FRIST and others, we have established for the first time a principle that every American is entitled to the best medicine. That is a new standard. It is a high standard. It is guaranteed when it is most needed through the process we have set up while the patient is ill. It is not as Norwood-Dingell would provide, and that is the best lawsuit after the patient is dead or suffering from ineffective care. Ironically, that standard which they would use for that is a lower standard than certainly best medicine but one which is generally practiced in the area. 
   Those who are looking at it from a legal perspective should recognize that a higher standard is going to be more protective than the standard that is being advocated by the other side. Yet we reasonably establish in the present draft reasonable availability of liability through the courts, including even, under certain circumstances, punitive damages when appropriate. That is a step we have somewhat reluctantly taken, but we have done it in a way that I don't think in any way interferes with what we want to do in the bill. 
   Finally, which is very important before I go into some other aspects, the cost of the bill that we had will be very small relative to that which is proposed by the opponent. It would be probably less than 1 percent. For every 1 percent that we increase the cost over $300,000--this came from the AFL-CIO--people lose their health insurance. We are looking at alternatives that go up as high as 6 percent on the other side, meaning almost 2 million people would lose their health care. 
   I will strongly support Senator NICKLES' motion to table the amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE. Under the able leadership of our chairman, Senator NICKLES, I am committed to working with the other conferees from the Senate and the House of Representatives to find agreement on responsible legislation to regulate managed care plans. But any new protections cannot significantly increase the cost of health coverage and cause more Americans to become uninsured. 
   The House-passed legislation, which Senator KENNEDY is attempting to add to the Department of Defense reauthorization bill, mandates that the Health  Care Financing Administration enforce the new insurance standards in those States that decide not to adopt the Federal laws. To date, 23 States have refused to enact one or more of the provisions contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and its amendments. For almost half the country, HCFA is the agency that consumers must turn to for help in enforcing these new Federal insurance mandates. The House-passed bill would continue this pattern and accelerate the creation of a dual system of overlapping State and Federal health insurance regulation that will only cause confusion for consumers and inefficiency for plans. 
   The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) agrees with me on this important point. In NCSL's action policy on managed care, they state:  
   [T]he Senate-passed version of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' generally preserves the traditional role of States as insurance regulators, and focuses most of its attention on the federally regulated, self-funded ERISA plans.  
   In sharp contrast to their support for the Senate bill's applicability, they believe the Norwood/Dingell bill: ``[W]ill largely preempt these important State laws and replace them with Federal laws that we submit the Federal Government is ill prepared to monitor and enforce.'' The National Conference of State Legislators goes on to say: ``[T]he Federal Government will not be able to deliver on the promise and may very well prevent States from delivering on theirs regarding patient rights.''

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Vermont has passed many of the consumer protections contained in the two bills. However, it has not enacted all. As Vermont's employers struggle with 20-percent to 30-percent premium increases, and the State adjusts to the departure of a major carrier, the Governor and the State legislature have agreed to a moratorium on the passage of additional consumer protections. Under the House approach, the Vermont legislature's decision would be overridden, and they would be forced to pass additional congressional insurance mandates. We in Congress cannot be working at cross-purposes with respect to our States, which are best positioned to understand the needs of the local health care markets. This is not an issue of States' rights--it is an issue of who is best situated to determine what's right for our States. 
   On Sunday, House and Senate Republican staffers offered new proposals on managed care legislation in the key areas of liability, scope, and access. The offer would provide for a new Federal cause of action in ERISA to allow for lawsuits for failure to comply with the decision of the independent medical reviewer. 
   On the issue of scope, the Republican conferees offer the new protections would be extended to ``all 193 million Americans covered by health insurance.'' We believe that this should be achieved through a combination of Federal and qualified State protections that takes into account a consideration of market composition and fee for services issues. We have yet to hear back from the Democrats on our offer. 
   I don't underestimate the difficulty of our task--especially in the three critical areas of the external appeals process, the appropriate remedies when the external appeals process fails, and the scope of the legislation. 
   Fortunately, we can, I believe, provide the key protections that consumers want at a minimal cost and without disruption of coverage--if we apply these protections responsibly and where they are needed--without adding significant new costs, increasing litigation, and micro-managing health plans.  
   Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a package that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope we will be successful in our efforts to develop a conference committee report that provides a true Patients' Bill of Rights, which can be passed and signed into law by the President.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my home town of Shrewsbury, Vermont, can be a good way farther from Plymouth than it looks, at first glance, on a map. Though the towns' borders touch, Plymouth is on the east side of the Green Mountains in Windsor Country, Shrewsbury's in Rutland County high on the mountains' west side. In the winter the drive is about 25 miles, though it shortens to seven in the summer, when the old CCC Road is open. But the two old Vermont mountain towns are, in reality, close in spirit, due in considerable part to the ``Coolidge connection''. 
   I thought about this last week on receiving the sad news of the death of John Coolidge, at 93, the son of President Calvin Coolidge. I had seldom been to The Notch without seeing John, and his greeting was always warm and I usually heard another fascinating story about his father, Calvin, or his mother, Grace. Though father and son shared reputations for being men of few words as Calvin's autobiography shows, he was capable of true eloquence, as was John. Read his introduction to the book ``Your Son Calvin Coolidge'', if you doubt it. 
   But as I was saying, the Coolidges helped make Plymouth and Shrewsbury close. Calvin's sister Abbie taught school in Northam, before her early death. Aurora Pierce, the long-time housekeeper at the Coolidge homestead was a product of Shrewsbury. Her cousin Marjorie Pierce, of Shrewsbury, recalls that John Coolidge often stopped by on his annual summer visit to Aurora's grave in the Northam Cemetery. Aurora lived at the homestead long after Calvin Coolidge's death and jealously guarded its historic contents. We owe much to her for preserving, virtually intact, the contents of the house. She was, in her own unique way, a preservationist. So, too, was John. 
   John once told me that his grandfather, Col. John Coolidge said that to keep the Notch looking as it was would be the best memorial to President Coolidge. The Notch today remains virtually as it was when Calvin Coolidge was president. John Coolidge, working closely with the State of Vermont and through the wonderful Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation, which he and his wife Florence, were instrumental in founding, saw to that. It is comforting to know that a Vermonter like myself can always drop in on The Notch and see the Vermont of olden times, of open fields, farm homes, barns in good repair, all living on, and to know what a remarkable event in our nation's history happened in that remote setting-the 1923 homestead inaugural. 
   I was happy three years ago to be able to deliver a federal appropriation to the Coolidge Foundation and I know it is being well used, continuing the legacy of Calvin Coolidge, a legacy so well carried on by his son. 
   John Coolidge left many legacies. He nobly and eloquently bore the mantle of first son, which came so suddenly upon him with his father's early death. He had a successful career in business, including the restarting of the Cheese Factory at the Notch. Time and again through countless interviews he showed the world what a true Vermonter was all about. And he made sure that the world ``let Plymouth be'' as it was in his father's time. 
   John Coolidge had always lived in Plymouth from spring until after the  autumn leaves were gone. Then, two years ago, he came home to Plymouth Notch to live full time. One paper said he'd come home to die, but he really came home to live. He was proud that he spent his first two winters at The Notch and was added to the Plymouth checklist. 
   Now he will rest at the Notch Cemetery, besides his father and mother, his wife, his brother Calvin Jr., who died during the Coolidge presidency, and long generations of Coolidges. He will rest in a green and peaceful setting, in a valley he did so much to preserve. Vermont needs to forge on preserving its wondrous landscape, for it is too precious and rare to lose. John Coolidge knew that well and his beloved Notch will long serve as an example for coming generations of Vermonters, indeed, for all Americans.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today that the Senate is considering the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources and Emergency Act Amendments of 2000, a measure that will reauthorize a national program providing primary health care services to people living with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to commend Senators HATCH and KENNEDY for the leadership they have provided since the inauguration of the legislation establishing the Ryan White programs over a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator FRIST whose medical expertise played a critical role in key provisions of the bill and continues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts on the range of health issues that come before the Senate. I want to recognize Senator DODD for his unwavering support for this legislation and people living with HIV and AIDS. Finally, I want to acknowledge Senator ENZI's recognition of the growing burden that AIDS and HIV have placed on rural communities throughout the country and the need to address those gaps in services. 
   Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. During the last reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act in 1996, the measure garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final passage. As evidence that strong bipartisan support continues, I am happy to report that last month this reauthorization bill was passed unanimously out of committee. The bipartisan support for this important legislation underlines the critical need for the assistance this Act provides across the nation. 
   With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the Ryan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support services to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II have provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by this disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in providing healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White program dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting this epidemic and have allowed States and communities around the country to successfully address the needs of people affected by HIV disease. 
   In a recently released report, the General Accounting Office found that CARE Act funds are reaching the infected groups that have typically been underserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, and ethnic minorities. In fact, these groups form a majority of CARE Act clients and are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions than their representation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found that CARE Act funds support a wide array of primary care and support services, including the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for people with HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and deaths. 
   Much has occurred to change the course of the AIDS epidemic since the last reauthorization. During the last reauthorization, Congressman Coburn and our colleague, Senator FRIST, focused our attention on the needs of women living with HIV/AIDS and the problems associated with perinatal transmission of HIV. Since then, the CARE Act has helped to dramatically reduce mother-to-child transmission through more effective outreach, counseling, and voluntary testing of mothers at risk for HIV infection. Between 1993 and 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases declined 74% in the U.S. In this bill, I have continued to support efforts to reach women in need of care for their HIV disease and have included provisions to ensure that women, infants and children receive resources in accordance with the prevalence of the infection among them. 
   Another key success has been the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. This program has provided people with HIV and AIDS access to newly developed, highly effective therapeutics. Because of these drugs, people are maintaining their health and living longer. The AIDS death rate and the number of new AIDS cases have been dramatically reduced. From 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54% while new AIDS cases have been reduced by 27%. However, these treatments are very expensive, do not provide a cure, and do not work for everyone. 
   AIDS, HIV, the people it infects and families that it has affected are not in the news today as often as they have been in the past. But for too many of us, this lack of bad news has created a false sense of complacency. While the rate of decline in new AIDS cases and deaths is leveling off, HIV infection rates continue to rise in many areas; becoming increasingly prevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; and also among women, youth, and minority communities. Local and state healthcare systems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our success in treating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. Unfortunately, rural and underserved urban areas are often unable to address the complex medical and support services needs of people with HIV infection. Thus, Ryan White programs remain as vital to the public health of this nation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. As the AIDS epidemic reaches into rural areas and into underserved urban communities across the country, this legislation will allow us to adapt our care systems to meet the most urgent needs in the communities hardest hit by the epidemic. 
   The bill being considered today was developed on a bipartisan basis, working with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and elected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought input to ensure that we addressed the most important problems facing communities of people with HIV infection. I held a hearing in March before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to learn whether the program has been successful and whether it needed to be changed. We received testimony from Ryan White's mother, Jeanne White, from Surgeon General David Satcher, from a person living with AIDS, as well as state and local officials familiar with the importance of this program. I especially want to commend Dr. Chris Grace of Vermont who testified as to the particular challenges of providing care to people living with HIV/AIDS in rural, and sometimes remote, parts of the country. It was clear from our witnesses' statements that, despite the successes, challenges remain. 
   To address these challenges, we have developed a bill that will improve access to care in underserved urban and rural areas. My bill will double the minimum base funding available to states through the CARE Act to assist them in developing systems of care for people struggling with HIV and AIDS. The bill also includes a new supplemental state grant to target assistance to small and mid-sized metropolitan areas to help them address the increasing number of people with HIV/AIDS living outside of urban areas that receive assistance under Title I of the Act. Rural and underserved areas receive a preference for planning, early intervention, and capacity development grants under title III. In order to assist states in expanding access to appropriate HIV/AIDS therapeutics to low-income people with HIV/AIDS, a supplemental grant has been added to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. 
   The bill remains primarily a system of grants to State and local jurisdictions, thereby ensuring that grantees can respond to local needs. States, EMAs, and the affected communities will still decide how to best prioritize and address the healthcare needs of their HIV-positive citizens. This bill reinforces the ability of States and EMAs to identify and meet local needs. 
   Finally, in recognition of the changing nature of the epidemic, I have asked the Institute of Medicine to complete a study of the financing and delivery of primary care and support services for low income, uninsured, and under-insured individuals with HIV disease, within 21 months after the enactment of this Act. Changes in HIV surveillance and case reporting, and the effects of these changes on program funding, will be included in this study. The recommendations from this study will help Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure the most effective and efficient use of Federal funds for HIV and AIDS care and support. 
   I intend to see this bill become law this year so that the people struggling to overcome the challenges of HIV and AIDS continue to benefit from high quality medical care and access to lifesaving drugs. We have made incredible progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and I want to be sure that every person in America in need of assistance benefits from our tremendous advances.  
   Many groups and individuals have contributed significantly to crafting this bill, but I want to acknowledge those at the Health Resources and Services Administration, especially Dr. Joseph O'Neill, Associate Administrator of the HIV/AIDS bureau; John Palenicek, Director of the Office of Policy and Program Development; Doug Morgan, Director of the Division of Service Systems; and Howard Lerner, Principal Adviser for Telehealth and International Collaboration, HIV/AIDS. All of the groups united under the umbrella of the National Organizations Responding to AIDS (NORA) deserve recognition. Representing a diverse community of people with AIDS, CARE Act service providers, and administrative agencies, NORA clearly and effectively communicated to Congress the needs and priorities of their constituents. 
   I also want to thank several staff members who have worked long and hard to craft this bill and to address the concerns and needs of the affected communities. Sean Donohue and William Oscar Fleming have guided this effort from the beginning, building consensus across the many policy issues, resulting in a bill that meets the pressing needs of people with HIV and AIDS and enjoys broad bipartisan support. Stephanie Robinson and Idalia Sanchez, for Senator KENNEDY, were key to reaching agreement on this bill and have provided invaluable assistance and support throughout the development of this legislation. I would also like to recognize Dave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson, of Senator FRIST's office, for their support for the needs of rural and underserved communities throughout the nation. Similarly, Jeannie Ireland with Senator DODD's office, Helen Rhee, working for Senator DEWINE, Libby Rolfe, for Mr. SESSIONS, and Raissa Geary and Mary Jordan in Senator ENZI's office, provided valuable input. Without the efforts of these staff members, we would not have such a strong, well-balanced, and targeted reauthorization bill before us today.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to represent the people of the state of Vermont. On this occasion, I rise to pay tribute to two health care institutions in Vermont that add so much to their communities and make ``the Green Mountain State'' such a wonderful place to live. 
   This year Porter Hospital is celebrating its 75th anniversary and Helen Porter Nursing Home is celebrating its 30th anniversary of providing quality health care to the people of Addison County, Vermont. Together these two institutions have played a vital role in delivering a continuum of care to thousands of people. They have demonstrated their commitment to serving as catalysts in the development of health services for the people of this region. 
   Porter Hospital has been caring for its community since 1925 and is a full service, community hospital, providing emergency services and comprehensive medical care. Helen Porter Nursing Home provides skilled and intermediate care to residents in a home-like environment where privacy is honored and individuality respected. 
   The devoted and professional staff of both institutions provide the full range of health care from outpatient services and rehabilitation, to long-term care and Wellness programs. Additionally, Porter Hospital and Helen Porter Nursing Home have contributed significantly to the economic vitality of the region as major employers and active members of the Addison County business community. 
   In a rural state such as Vermont, we count our successes one community at a time. We hold our institutions dear and we thank the men and women who devote their lives to improving the health status of our state. 
   Porter Hospital and Helen Porter Nursing Home have displayed a steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Addison County. The citizens of Vermont are tremendously grateful for that commitment, and I join them in sharing gratitude. Thank you.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator BENNETT, for his excellent work on the FY 2001 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill and the attention he and his staff have paid to my concerns. I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with Senator BENNETT on one of my priorities, the issue of extending health and retirement benefits to employees of the Library of Congress' child care center. 
   As the Senator knows, providing quality and affordable child care is a very important issue to me. I was, therefore, shocked to learn that child care workers in the Legislative Branch are not all afforded the same benefits. While employees of both the Senate and the House child care centers receive Federal health and retirement benefits, employees of the Library of Congress' child care center, the Little Scholars Child Development Center, do not. I ask Senator BENNETT if he agrees that employees of all Legislative Branch child care centers should be provided benefits in a consistent manner?

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will help small health and educational institutions more effectively finance the cost of essential services and new facility construction. By modifying the laws that restrict the deductibility of ``bank eligible'' bonds, the bill I am introducing today will increase access to tax-exempt financing for small non-profit organizations that need it most, like small local hospitals and small institutions of higher education. 
   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 unintentionally discriminated against small educational, health care and other non-profit institutions that want to sell small amounts of tax-exempt debt to community banks. Before 1986, banks and financial institutions could deduct the interest incurred to carry a tax-exempt bond. This benefit enabled banks to purchase tax-exempt bonds at attractive rates. The 1986 tax act repealed bank deductibility, although an exception was retained for small issuers that issue bonds of $10 million or less each year. 
   This exception was designed to preserve bank deductibility for small beneficiaries, but in practice is of assistance only to private placements issued by small local issuers. The small issuer exception has proven to be of little value in many States, like Vermont, where statewide health care and higher education bond issuing authorities typically issue many millions of dollars of debt each year. My bill will modify the small issuer exemption by granting the bond issuers the right to apply the small issuer exemption at the level of the ultimate beneficiary of the funding. Consequently, a small college or health care facility borrowing less than $10 million in tax-exempt debt in any one year could elect tax-exempt status for the debt, even if it is issued by a statewide issuing authority. This would make the debt more attractive to local banks, and could result in significant savings for the beneficiary institution over the life of the bond. 
   My bill focuses the benefit of the small issuer exemption on smaller non-profits, without regard to whether the bond issuer is government entity issuing more than $10 in bonds per year. Small non-profits are important community institutions; they stand to benefit from greater access to tax-exempt debt. Wall Street and large banks may have little interest in small amounts of debt from small institutions, which can prove costly to administer. The bank across the street from a local college or health care clinic, however, may have greater confidence and insight in the institution. My bill would allow those banks to carry tax-exempt debt at attractive rates and maintain commitments to the people and institutions in their local communities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, Senator HATCH and I, together with Senators ROCKEFELLER, CHAFEE, BRYAN, and KERRY are introducing a bill which we believe will serve two important national interests: air quality and energy security. We call it the ``Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act,'' and it consists of a series of temporary tax provisions to encourage purchases of cars and trucks operating on alternative fuels, and to promote the retail sale of these fuels. 
   The sharp gasoline price spikes earlier this year were a reminder of what can happen when the United States is not in control of the source of the energy it consumes. Some of us remember the long lines in the mid-1970s, when the Middle East pipeline was shut down, when service stations rationed the amount of gas you could buy, and when fistfights broke out over gasoline purchases. Science is now taking us to a point where we can develop other sources of energy and free ourselves from this over-reliance on foreign oil. 
   Imports of foreign oil now exceed 50 percent of our oil consumption. Most of the oil that we use--more than two-thirds--is used for transportation. But there's some good news: cars and trucks that operate with alternative fuels are rapidly becoming a fact of life. Each of the major automobile manufacturers offers alternative fuel vehicles, but low production volume and high initial costs have impeded their widespread use and adoption. Consumers and businesses are receptive to alternative fuel vehicles and electric vehicles, but are often reluctant to pay the additional costs manufacturers charge for them. 
   This bill's tax incentives will make those vehicles more cost competitive. With their environmentally-friendly fuels, these vehicles will mean significant benefits to the air we breathe. The levels of pollutants emitted by these alternative fuels vehicles are a tiny fraction of those released from a conventional gasoline or diesel engine. Some of these cars don't even have tail-pipes. To assure that owners of alternative fuel vehicles can find fuels  for their cars, the bill also provides for two incentives to encourage the retail sales of alternative fuels: a tax credit for retailers for each gasoline gallon-equivalent of alternative fuel sold, and a provision allowing retailers to immediately expense up to $100,000 of the costs of alternative fuel refueling infrastructure. 
   Passing this bill would mean cleaner air, energy independence, and more jobs in a developing sector of the auto industry. We have the technology and the resources to accomplish these goals. And we have manufacturers ready to deliver. It shouldn't take another oil crisis for us to get moving on this.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator LIEBERMAN for his hard work in focusing the attention of the nation on the problems Section 527 organizations are creating in our campaign finance system. Today, I join Senator LIEBERMAN and others in introducing two legislative vehicles to address the problems these organizations are bringing to our already troubled campaign finance system. 
   Many years ago, James Madison said, ``A popular government without popular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' 
   In clearer terms, Francis Bacon conveys the same principle in the saying, ``Knowledge is Power.'' 
   Mr. President, most people don't know what a section 527 organization is, and that is understandable as it is a highly complex issue. But what many people do understand is that our campaign finance system is broken and that we must do something to fix it. 
   I have long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' People deserve to know before they step into the voting booth which individuals or organizations are sponsoring the advertisements, mailings, and phone banks they may see or hear from during an election. We need to shine some sunlight on these secretive Section 527 organizations so that people will know who or what is trying to influence their vote. 
   Mr. President, the passage of either of these important pieces of legislation would help arm the people with the knowledge they need in order to exercise their civic duty and sustain our popular government. 
   We must close the loophole allowing so-called ``Stealth PAC's'' organized under Section 527 of the tax code, to hide their donors, activities, even their very existence from public view. Doing so would be an important first step in helping restore the public's confidence in our political system. 
   Mr. President, passage of this legislation would be one small step in eventually achieving our ultimate goal, which is enactment of meaningful campaign finance reform that includes increasing disclosure requirements and the banning of soft money. It is time to work together. It is time to act. It is time to pass campaign finance reform.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise today to recognize the young men and women of our great nation who have earned the honor of receiving the Boy Scout Eagle Scout Award and the Girl Scout Gold Award. 
   As a former Boy Scout, I have a great appreciation for the duties, obligations, and benefits that Scouting offers to boys and girls. Scouting helps to shape our nation's youth into proud and civic-minded adults. Recipients of the Eagle Scout and Gold Awards not only meet the challenges presented to them, but they surpass the expectations of their leaders and their peers. 
   In order to receive the highest honor, each Scout must design and execute a project that will benefit others in their community. Through initiatives such as teaching music to children, hosting an educational seminar, or building a neighborhood playground facility, the recipients display selfless commitment and integrity--qualities they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. 
   The contributions that these youth have made to their communities, and to our nation, are invaluable. Their hard work and devotion warrants great commendation. I am grateful for this opportunity to offer my appreciation and my congratulations to the recipients of the Boy Scout Eagle Scout Award and the Girl Scout Gold Award.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter and a determined leader, Edward Kehoe. Ed Kehoe was born in Rutland, my hometown, to the late James and Grace Kehoe and graduated from Rutland High School  before serving in the U.S. Army with the 26th Infantry Regiment during World War II. As a decorated war hero, Ed Kehoe returned to Vermont to own and operate Kehoe's Diner in Hydeville. 
   Ed Kehoe served as the town manager of Castleton from 1955 to 1965 before being elected the Vermont House for a single term. In August 1965, Ed Kehoe was appointed to head the Fish and Game Department where he served as the Vermont fish and wildlife commissioner under four governors until he retired in August 1982. He was an avid sportsman and member of an many Vermont sportsmen organizations until his death in late April. At the time of his appointment Ed Kehoe was initially troubled by his lack of a ``professional'' background in biology or wildlife management. However, his experience as a hunter and angler gave him the needed edge. 
   Led by his ability to draw on experience and heed the advise of biologists, Ed Kehoe led the Vermont crusade to resist development pressures. During his 17-year tenure as commissioner, Ed Kehoe established two Green Mountain Conservation camps to help teach younger Vermonters how to fish and camp, helped to improve the state warden force, expanded the statewide Hunter Safety Program, and worked to restore Connecticut River salmon and wild turkeys throughout Vermont. Perhaps Ed Kehoe's greatest contribution to the state was his ability to push, acquire, and protect lands with significant wildlife and recreation value. 
   Ed Kehoe's most recent award speaks to his accomplishments. Last year the Rutland Herald honored his visionary concerns about nongame species and protection of important property by naming him, ``Outdoorsman of the Century.'' John Hall, spokesman with Fish and Wildlife Department, recently alluded to Ed Kehoe's achievement, ``Ed wanted to make sure we were passing on the hunting and fishing traditions to future generations of Vermonter to enjoy. He always had the everyday Vermonter in mind, the average person of average means. He was the supreme steward of fish and wildlife resources.'' 
   I pay tribute today to a man who paid tribute every day, to the values the everyday Vermonter holds dear. We have lost an extraordinary man, but his contributions to Vermont wildlife policy will live on.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Senator Stafford, my Vermont colleague whose seat in this body I am honored to hold today, authored the legislation creating FEMA more than 25 years a go. Thanks to his foresight and leadership in this area, the federal government has helped thousands of ordinary citizens recover from disasters and other incidents beyond their control. 
   Today we have a chance to build on the legacy of Senator Stafford by adding airline and rail accidents to the list of ``major disasters'' defined in the act that governs the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
   While extremely rare occurrences, major airline and rail disasters place an incredible burden on the states and municipalities in which they occur. Due in part to the extraordinary level of national attention these accidents receive, states and municipalities face millions of dollars in unexpected and unbudgeted expenditures that often cripple local finances. Fees associated with initial response, security, and other health and safety measures often cost several million dollars. 
   This legislation standardizes procedure for federal reimbursement of affected communities. While the federal government has regularly reimbursed states and municipalities during the 1990s for their role in these most national of disasters, the process is an ad hoc one. This body has considered and approved at least three special line item appropriations for areas affected by the recent ValueJet, TWA, and COMAIR accidents. A bill to reimburse Rhode Island for its costs associated with last fall's Egypt Air disaster is currently working its way through the Congress as part of the appropriation for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
   This process causes needless headache and anxiety for local communities, as well as unnecessary chores for the NTSB and Congress. It forces states and municipalities to wait as reimbursement requests find their way through the complicated appropriations process while creating more work for our overburdened appropriators. 
   The numbers speak for themselves. States and local communities spend millions of dollars to respond to these accidents. While they are ultimately reimbursed by the federal government, the uncertainty and slow pace of the process often places affected communities in a financial bind. Money that could be spent on education, health care, or public safety is lost in an unnecessary limbo. 
   Under this bill, airline and rail accidents will be treated like any other disaster under the Stafford Act. Like an earthquake, blizzard or any other disaster, FEMA, upon the request of a governor, will examine the scene of such an accident and advise the President on whether federal reimbursement is appropriate. 
   Mr. President, this bill simply standardizes procedure for a commitment already made by the federal government. It requires to new costs or expenses  and actually saves money by streamlining a bureaucratic and complicated process. The International Association of Emergency Managers and the NTSB supports this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join these groups in supporting this bill that will bring standardization to an ad hoc process that has the potential to cause so much harm to our states and communities.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I strongly believe we owe it to Americans to provide them the best educational opportunities. And as a Navy veteran, I feel we owe our military greater access to education by providing maximum flexibility to use the educational benefits they've been promised. Today, on behalf of Senators ALLARD, BINGAMAN, KENNEDY, LEAHY, and myself, I am introducing legislation that will provide more time for our National Guard and Reserves to utilize their current education benefits. 
   Education benefits have proven to be one of the more important benefits offered by the U.S. military, both in terms of recruiting and retention, and as a means of upgrading the educational levels of our existing force. Currently, members of our uniformed services receive education assistance primarily through the successful Montgomery GI bill. 
   While the Montgomery GI bill goes a long way toward helping to further the education of our hardworking men and women serving in the uniformed services, there is an important gap in the number of years they have to utilize these benefits. While active duty personnel are provided education benefits for up to ten years after they separate from active duty, National Guard and Reserve personnel are only entitled to these benefits for the first ten years of their service and not after they leave the service. Since our active duty servicemembers currently have up to ten years after they separate from active duty, they are eligible to utilize their education assistance for up to thirty years (twenty years service plus ten). Our National Guard and Reserve servicemembers' benefits currently end ten years from the date they complete basic training. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would allow our National Guard and Reserves to use their Montgomery GI bill education benefits for the entire time they serve in the Selected Reserve. We are not asking for more benefits, just greater flexibility in the servicemembers' choice of when to use the education benefits that are already approved for them. 
   In addition, the Selected Reserve members who become disabled are currently allowed to use the GI bill education benefits only during the first ten years of service, regardless of what year they become disabled. For example, if a servicemember becomes disabled during the first two years of service, he has eight more years of education assistance eligibility. But if he becomes disabled after nine years of service, he would have one year of eligibility left. After ten years of service, the National Guard and Reserve have no education benefits if they become disabled. 
   This legislation would allow any unused portion of their 36 months of GI bill educational assistance to be utilized through the later of the original ten-year period of eligibility or a four-year period beginning on the date the person is involuntarily separated from the Selected Reserve. This adjustment also pertains to servicemembers whose unit is inactivated during a force drawdown if they have any unused months of educational assistance remaining. 
   As we have seen, our National Guard and Reserve continue to be tasked more and more as our nation calls on them to support missions around the world. The Selected Reserve makes up almost half of our Uniformed Services today. They, too, leave their families behind to meet the call of serving our nation. In addition, they leave their full-time employers for months on end to perform their `part-time' jobs. This makes it even more difficult for them to take advantage of employer-provided opportunities to further their education. How can we continue to expect them to utilize their current Montgomery GI bill benefits within the current time limitations while being tasked to work two jobs, maintain a family and deploy overseas on short notice? They've earned the right to have an equitable amoun6t of time to utilize their Montgomery GI bill educational assistance. This is the right thing to do. I hope my colleague will join me in cosponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Lieberman amendment. I want to be sure that all my colleagues understand that what the amendment would do is wipe out everything in S. 2--the bill we have been debating for the past week. The amendment would put in the provisions of S. 2254, a bill which was introduced about two weeks after the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions completed its work on S. 2. 
   I believe that my colleagues should also understand that, if the Lieberman amendment is adopted, all amendments which were approved over the past week will be discarded along with S. 2. Moreover, no further amendments would be in order. I know that many members have prepared amendments which they wish to see considered. Should a substitute amendment be adopted, this will simply not be possible. 
   There may very well be ideas in the Lieberman amendment which are worth considering, but using it as the basis to scrap 18 months worth of hearings and other committee deliberations and to rewrite the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on the floor of the United States Senate is hardly the way to pursue those ideas. 
   A major function of the committee system in Congress is to assure that a bipartisan group of members have the opportunity to devote extra time and study to particular issues. 
   There may be disagreements among committee members and Members who do not serve on the committee may disagree with some of the conclusions reached by those who present a bill for the consideration of the full Senate. Nevertheless, there is a clear understanding of the issues at hand--so that a rational debate of differences can be held. 
   The danger in dismissing the work of a committee entirely in order to adopt something which may appear more appealing is that serious problems may well go unnoticed. I believe there are numerous aspects of the substitute amendment which illustrate this point. 
   For example, the amendment makes significant changes to the title I formula. Proposals to alter the formula by which title I funds are distributed are among the most difficult to analyze. 
   Changes which at first glance appear to represent sound policy often have unintended consequences that do not become evident until actual runs are performed. 
   Senator LIEBERMAN has proposed a significant change to the way that title I funds are to be distributed within states. Currently, the vast majority of funds are distributed through the Basic Grant Program 85%, and the Concentration Grant Program, 15%. 
   No funds have been made available for either the Targeted Grant Program or the Education Finance Incentive Grant Program. Importantly, the amount received by each state is determined by totaling amount that each eligible school district within the state is eligible to receive. 
   If the Lieberman amendment were adopted, the most dramatic changes would be experienced at the school district level. Under current law, the states distribute 85% the money to local educational agencies, LEAs, in  accordance with the Basic grant formula and 15% of the money through the Concentration Grant formula. This structure is retained under the committee bill. Importantly, the amount of funding to each state is based upon the amount that eligible school districts within the state are entitled to receive. 
   Under the Lieberman proposal, money would be received by the state on the basis of one formula and then distributed to LEAs on the basis of a modified version of the Targeted Grant Program. This establishes a new precedent and raises basic questions of fairness. For the first time, the amount that a state receives will be based upon the eligibility of school districts which shall not be given the funds. Let me state this again. States will receive money on the basis of the eligibility of certain school districts. These school districts will not, however, receive the money. The money that the state received on the basis of their eligibility will be diverted to other school districts within the state. 
   It may be argued by some that this improves targeting by sending money to high-poverty school districts. An examination of the actual numbers reveals that the proposal would establish deep inequalities among school districts across the Nation. It turns out that not all poverty is treated equally. In fact, it depends upon which state you happen to be fortunate enough to reside in and even which school district governs your school. 
   Let me provide some examples. These examples were selected simply by going through the LEA lists in alphabetical order to select districts with comparable poverty rates. 
   In Alabama the Thomasville City School District has a poverty rate of 30.3% and would lose 21.6% of its title I funding. In California, Burnt Ranch with a poverty rate of 30.5% would only lose 16% of its funding. New London School District in Connecticut with a poverty rate of 30.6% would receive an increase of 11.9% while Bridgeport with a poverty rate of 35.5% would be cut by .5%. The disparity in the dollar amounts of the reductions is even greater. 
   My point is this. Many school districts which currently receive funding under the Basic and Concentration Grant Programs would receive steady annual cuts in their title I funds under this proposal. These would not be potential cuts--these would be real cuts. Cuts that would have to be made up by raising property taxes or cutting services. 
   The Congressional Research Service has done runs for each LEA in each state. These runs reflect annual projected increases or decreases for each of the next three years. There is nothing magic about three years. Districts which are gaining funds would presumably continue to gain them and districts which are losing funds would presumably continue to lose them until an equilibrium is established in the out years. 
   Our goal during this reauthorization should be to strengthen educational opportunities for all students. This proposal pits poor children in one school against poor children in another and should be soundly rejected. 
   Proponents of the Lieberman substitute have spoken to the need to increase accountability. I do not believe there is any disagreement at all in this body that recipients of federal education funds must be held accountable. As I noted in my opening remarks when we began floor consideration of this bill, through a bipartisanship effort in 1994, we in the Congress decided that title I should carry out its mission of improving learning by assisting state and local efforts in the development of standards and assessments. 
   Congress completely rewrote Title I in 1994 and made the program more rigorous--requiring States to develop both content and student performance standards and assessments. 
   Congress gave the states seven years to complete this difficult task. We are mid-stream in this process. 
   In the name of accountability, the Lieberman substitute rewrites many of the standards, assessment, and school improvement provisions that were included in the 1994 law. I fear that rewriting these sections will not lead States down the path toward greater accountability, but rather will create detours for the states and school districts that have already spent several years going in the right direction. Developing and implementing standards-based reform and assessments is not a simple task. It requires sustained and consistent effort. Loading up States and school districts with new regulations, new reporting requirements, and more mandates is a distraction at best and a step backward at worst. 
   Finally, I believe it is important to point out that most of the individual programs authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act outside of title I are repealed by the Lieberman substitute. A notable exception is that the amendment does authorize the President's class-size reduction program as a separate activity. Apparently, some merit is seen for that separate program which is not seen for programs such as the Reading Excellence Act, Gifted and Talented Education, Reading is Fundamental, or Character Education--to name just a few of the programs which are repeal by the substitute amendment. 
   It is my understanding that the funds from the various programs which are repealed are to be used within four general categories: school improvement, innovative reform, safe learning environments, and technology. 
   For example, the substitute amendment would repeal title IV of ESEA , the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities program. title IV funds would be pooled with the other funds allocated to repealed programs, and 15% of the funds in the pool are to be used for safe learning environments. The substitute amendment completely tosses overboard the Title IV reforms in S. 2 which were developed by a bipartisan group of members--spearheaded by Senators DEWINE, DODD, and MURRAY. These reforms were designed to assure that drug-free schools funds are used for proven, effective programs--rather than being used in some of the frivolous ways we have seen in the past. The Lieberman amendment sets back the clock on these important revisions to the bill. 
   As I indicated at the outset, it is important that we take great care in crafting changes to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The programs in this Act represent virtually all the support provided by the Federal Government in support of elementary and secondary schools. Although the federal share is small relative to the contributions made by States and localities, it is a substantial investment--approaching $15 billion a year. 
   I believe that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has taken its responsibilities seriously in developing S. 2 over the past 18 months. We held 25 hearings on all aspects of the Act and have spent considerable time discussing the issues it includes--with much of this work being done on a bipartisan basis. I am pleased to have heard so much today about bipartisan cooperation with respect elementary and secondary education. Although the final vote out of committee was on a party-line basis, the fact of the matter is that much of the bill was developed through bipartisan discussions. 
   I have spoken many times on this floor on behalf of bipartisan efforts to help our nation's school children, and I remain willing to engage in such efforts. I am not, however, willing to turn my back on the work the committee has put into S. 2 in order to embrace a proposal which reduces title I funding for many school districts throughout the country, imposes additional reporting burdens on States and localities, and repeals many programs which have been of value to our nation's schools and students. 
   I want to say again that I strongly oppose the Lieberman amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator very much. Mr. President, I am very happy to join a strong bi-partisan group of my colleagues in introducing the ``Early Learning Opportunities Act'' amendment. The twenty-eight co-sponsors of the amendment are: Senators STEVENS, KENNEDY, JEFFORDS, DODD, DOMENICI, BOND, KERRY, VOINOVICH, LAUTENBERG, MURRAY, COCHRAN, BINGAMAN, SMITH of Oregon, DURBIN, CHAFEE, BAUCUS, MURKOWSKI, ROBB, ROCKEFELLER, ROBERTS, WELLSTONE, FEINSTEIN, MIKULSKI, SNOWE, BOXER, KERREY, SPECTER, and WARNER. 
   In 1989, President Bush met with Governors from across the nation and identified a set of educational goals for our nation's children. The first national educational goal was that ``By the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn,'' We have unfortunately failed to meet that critical goal. 
   Early childhood learning plays a key role in a child's future achievement and is the cornerstone of education reform. I am absolutely convinced that we must invest in early childhood learning programs if we are to have every child enter school ready to learn and succeed. 
   We know that from birth, the human brain is making the connections that are vital to future learning. We know that what we do as parents, care providers, educators, and as a society can either help or hurt a child's ability to gain the skills necessary for success in school--- and in life. 
   Many of America's children enter school without the necessary abilities and maturity. Without successful remediation efforts, these children continue to lag behind for their entire academic career. We spend billions of dollars on efforts to help these children catch up. As we demand that students and schools meet higher academic standards, these efforts become much harder. An investment in early learning today will save money tomorrow. Research has demonstrated that for each dollar invested in quality early learning programs, the Federal Government can save over five dollars--spend one, save five. 
   These savings result from future reductions in the number of children and families who participate in Federal Government programs like Title I special education and welfare. 
   This amendment is designed to help parents and care givers integrate early childhood learning into the daily lives of their children. 
   Parents are the most important teachers of their children. If parents are actively engaged in their child's early learning, their children will see greater cognitive and non-cognitive benefits. 
   Parents want their children to grow up happy and healthy. But few are fully prepared for the demands of parenthood. Many parents have difficulty finding the information and support they need to help their children grow to their full potential. Making that information and support available and accessible to parents is a key component of this amendment. 
   For many families, it is not possible for a parent to remain home to care for their children. Their employment is not a choice, but an essential part of their family's economic survival. 
   And for most of these families, child care is not an option, but a requirement, as parents struggle to meet the competing demands of work and family. 
   Just as it is essential that we provide parents with the tools they need to help their children grow and develop, we also must help the people who care for our nation's children while parents are at work. 
   Today, more than 13 million young children--including half of all infants--spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. 
   In Vermont alone, there are about 22,000 children, under the age of six, in state-regulated child care. 
   This amendment will provide communities with the resources necessary to improve the quality of child care. Funds can be used for professional development, staff retention and recruitment incentives, and improved compensation. By improving local collaboration and coordination, child care providers--- as well as parents--- will be able to access more services, activities and programs for children in their care. 
   Our ``Early Learning Opportunities'' amendment will serve as a catalyst to engage all sectors of the community in increasing programs, services, and activities that promote the healthy development of our youngest citizens. The amendment ensures that funds will be locally controlled.  
   Funds are channeled through the states to local councils. The councils are charged with assessing the early learning needs of the community, and distributing the funds to a broad variety of local resources to meet those needs. 
   Local councils must work with schools in the community to identify the abilities which need to be mastered before children enter school. Funds must be used for programs, activities and services which represent developmentally appropriate steps towards acquiring those abilities. 
   This amendment will expand community resources, improve program collaboration, and engage our citizens in creating solutions. It will will help parents and care givers who are looking for better ways to include positive learning experiences into the daily lives of our youngest children. 
   When children enter school ready to learn, all of the advantages of their school experiences are opened to them---their opportunities are unlimited. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote for the ``Early Learning Opportunities Act'' amendment. 
   I urge you to give our nation's children every opportunity to succeed in school and in life. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we work to address the problems of health care in the new millennium, we are blessed and we are cursed: blessed with the promise of new research capabilities and the knowledge gleaned from the human genome, and cursed with the high costs of all medicines, new and old. Today, I come to the floor to introduce a bill that will help address the curse of out-of-control drug prices, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000, or MEDS Act. 
   There is no question that prescription drugs cost too much in this nation. 
   During a time when we are experiencing unprecedented economic growth, it is not uncommon to hear of patients who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to make prescriptions last longer, because they can't afford the refill. The question that we should ask is, can we put politics aside and work in a bipartisan manner to deal with this national crisis? I say we must. And I am hopeful we can. 
   Prescription medicines have revolutionized the treatment of certain diseases, but they are only effective if patients have access to the medicines that their doctors prescribe. 
   The best medicines in the world will not help a person who cannot afford them. And they can actually do more harm than good if taken with the improper dosage. 
   Mr. President, it is well documented that the average price of prescription medicines is much lower in Canada than in the United States, with the price of some drugs in Vermont being twice that of the same drug available only a few miles away in a Canadian pharmacy. This is true even though many of the drugs sold in Canada are actually manufactured, packed, and distributed by American companies that sell the same FDA-approved products in both markets, but at drastically different prices. 
   This pricing disparity unfairly places the heaviest burden on the most vulnerable Americans--hardworking, but uninsured Americans who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid, yet still cannot afford the high cost of lifesaving drugs. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will allow pharmacists and wholesalers to get the same FDA-approved drugs sold at lower prices in other countries, and pass the savings on to consumers in the U.S. 
   This bipartisan proposal builds on legislation I introduced last year, S. 1462, that would allow imports from Canada for personal use, and borrows from another bill cosponsored by Senator WELLSTONE, S. 1191, that would allow reimportation of prescription drugs that were made in U.S. facilities. 
   The most important aspect of this bill, Mr. President, is safety. We all want to find ways to bring drug costs down for all Americans, but the concept of reimportation has been criticized as compromising the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) world-renowned gold standard for safety by opening the American market to foreign counterfeiters who will attempt to flood the market with fake drugs. 
   This bill is simple in its approach. It would empower pharmacists and wholesalers to purchase FDA-approved medicines in Canada and pass the discounts along to American patients, and would let the experts at Health and Human Services (HHS) determine the best mechanism for allowing such imports while preserving the gold standard for safety. 
   The discretionary authority granted to the Secretary of HHS would be subject to a few important requirements,  such as identification of the importer and the product, but would require the Secretary to promulgate regulations setting up a safe system for allowing the reimportation of prescription drugs as long as the importer has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of HHS, that the product being reimported is safe, and is the same product that is being sold in the United States at a higher price. 
   Mr. President, I have said before and I will say again, this is not the only solution, and it may not be the best solution to this problem. 
   I strongly believe we need to enact a broad prescription drug benefit, and I believe we need to find ways to encourage more insurance coverage for more Americans that covers the cost of drugs. But this is a positive, bipartisan measure that we can implement now that will bring prescription drug prices down for all Americans, and I encourage your support.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for his usual eloquence, as well as for his understanding and perception of the education problems in this country. 
   I would like to speak about other areas I think are important. We must look closely at these two areas during consideration of this legislation. 
   We are talking today about the need for improving the quality of teacher education and further improvements in the legislation before us for that purpose. I think we will find that we have reached agreement on that. One of the most critical parts of the equation in improving education is ensuring classrooms are led by quality teachers. 
   I am a member of the Goals 2000 panel. Here we are already in 2000 and we haven't reached these important education goals. I want to share with you some of the concerns about some of the areas in education where we need improvement, and what we intend to do through amendments to try to move us forward in these most critical education areas. 
   We received notice in 1983. President Ronald Reagan called on the Secretary of Education to convene a panel to examine the quality of education in our Nation. It was very tersely stated in a phrase that says it all, if a foreign nation had imposed upon us the educational system that we had in the country especially our elementary and secondary education, it would be considered an act of war. 
   Since 1983, we have seen measurable improvement across this Nation in reaching the goals that we set at that time. This bill provides us with an opportunity to reevaluate where we are. It is the year 2000 and we have not achieved many of our most important and pressing educational goals. 
   Still, we have learned a great deal since that time about the area of huge need in this Nation involving preschool children--the 0 to 3, or 0 to 5 age group, depending on what you want to talk about. These are problems that are created when the parents do not take a leadership role in educating the children. Often times, sadly, it is because they don't have a strong educational backgroud themselves. Some are illiterate and do not have the tools to help their children as they grow up to enter school ready to learn. 
   The amendment that will be offered by Senator STEVENS and myself, and others will, on a voluntary basis--I want to emphasize over and over again that it is a voluntary basis--to provide information for parents, information for child care providers, and information to schools to ensure that as a child grows, they all have the basic educational opportunities to learn to read and achieve academically. The successful passage of this amendment will make sure that we take care of those children who currently do not have that kind of assistance and educational support in a variety of ways. It is a critical issue that must be addressed.  
   Some years ago, studies were done on the impact to the growth and development of a child's brain. A comparison was done between the brain of a child who received attention, support, nurturing and good care, and one who unfortunately, like too many, had little or no real nurturing as children. The brain of the well-developed child who had all the nurturing necessary was what we would like to see--a large healthy brain. For comparison, they showed you one of an old man in his eighties or nineties which was shriveled up and shrunk. The other picture was the brain of a child that was not nurtured and did not receive the care that a normal child should receive from a parent. That child's brain was just as shriveled up as the old man's. That is what can happen to a baby, a very young person that does not receive the care, attention and nurturing at home that it should. 
   We will have an amendment which will assist us in understanding that, and which will make sure that throughout that period of time, in a voluntary way, the information will be available.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have just been discussing the amendment which we just got unanimous consent to consider. 
   I would like to briefly discuss another amendment that I am hopeful that I will have an opportunity to offer this week. It addresses another significant educational problem we face in this nation. 
   As I said, on the goals panel we studied what is happening with our young people. It is telling when one considers those young people who end up incarcerated. 
   Eighty percent of the individuals incarcerated in jail in this country are school dropouts. 
   Consider those students that don't drop out. Far too many of our students who stay in high school are not receiving the kind of education they need to prepare them to enter the workforce. 
   Therefore, I will have an amendment that tackles these critically important  problems. We must do what we can to make sure that young people stay in school and we must do what we can to ensure that students receive a relevant education in high school. Students graduating from high school must be literate. At the same time, we have got to strive for improvement in our high schools so that our nation's young people will have the skills they need to graduate and get a job. 
   Since 80 percent of people incarcerated in our institutions are school dropouts, it is essential we pay more attention to those young people as well. Those institutions must have the capacity to provide those completing their sentences with literacy skills and are job skills so that they can enter the workforce and not return to crime. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an organization that has served the state of Vermont, and the nation, for 150 years. National Life has served the needs of millions of Americans during this time, starting with its first policy, issued in 1850, and continuing into the contemporary insurance business. As Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, I can personally attest to how valuable their services have been and continue to be. However, National Life is more than just a business, it is an archetype of community relations and a leader in the promotion of ethical market conduct. 
   National Life was founded in 1848 by Dr. Julius Dewey as a mutual life insurance company. The first claim was paid to a policy owner who had traveled to California for the Gold Rush. From this beginning, National Life has expanded to include 800 career and general agents, and over 3,000 independent brokers. National Life has also grown to include some of the most prestigious services in America, including the Sentinel Fund--established in 1968, the American Guaranty and Trust--chartered in Delaware in 1914, and the national Retirement plan Advisors--founded in 1940. 
   In 1998, National Life joined the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association. This group promotes ethics in market conduct of the life insurance industry. Among the criteria that National Life had to meet were high standards of honesty in fairness to customers, fair competition, quick resolution of customer disputes and complaints, and customer-focused sales and service. Needless to say, National Life met the criteria in 1998, as they have throughout their long and prestigious history. 
   This 150th Anniversary also marks a rare meeting of past, present, and future, in 1960, the National Life building was opened. At the dedication ceremony, a time capsule was interred in the floor of the lobby. This time capsule will be opened on May 12, 2000, and we will be able to compare where we are today with where we thought we would be. The hopes and wishes of yesterday have evolved into today's reality, and the year 2000, once an incomprehensible milestone, is no longer the distant future. 
   While the past and present will merge at this ceremony, the anniversary also provides an opportunity to look forward. True to form, National Life again initiates a bond with the community; among the entries in the Year 2000 time capsule will be the predictions of children of Central Vermont. The hopes and wishes of these children for the future are significant, as they will be the ones living it. Recognizing this, National Life is also contributing money to each participating public elementary school. The students' whose predictions will be included in the time capsule, along with their respective schools, will receive an additional contribution. 
   On this occasion of celebrating the venerable and storied past of National Life, let us pay tribute to their Vermont roots and their contributions to the Vermont economy during the past century and a half. Far from simply administering to their community, National Life is a part of it. National Life has realized from the start that the investment we make in the children of today will pay dividends in the leaders of tomorrow. For their continued commitment to the community and their customers, they should be commended.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself the remaining time. 
   I back up the statements of the Senator from Michigan. What we are dealing with on the first vote is whether or not to make more flexible the options with respect to the schools. The Abraham-Mack amendment does that. The second-degree is a strike of that and puts one option in and does not add but detracts from what we would have without that amendment. 
   The Murray amendment, again, restricts the availability of the class size money to one option--class size. In my State and many other States, that is not the problem. The problem is the quality of the teaching. We would rather spend that money to enhance the qualities of the teachers we have rather than to have it available for things we don't need. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the second degree, a ``yes'' vote on the Abraham amendment, and a ``no'' vote on the Murray amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. 
   Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with my good friend Senator ROCKEFELLER in introducing legislation that will improve upon the federal rules for reimbursement for telemedicine and help to ensure that all of our citizens have access to our great health care system. We are joined by a broad, bipartisan group of senators in this effort. 
   In many ways we have the best health care system in the world. But increasingly fewer and fewer Americans actually have access to it. I recently introduced a tax-credit bill that will help some of these Americans and I anticipate supporting future measures aimed at increasing access to health care services. 
   One important area that demands our attention is the problem of access for rural Americans. More than 25 percent of our Nation's senior citizens live in areas underserved for modern health care services. At the same time, telemedicine has come of age. We have moved beyond the feasibility stage and proven that this technology can provide real benefits to people in rural and underserved regions of our country. 
   In my own State of Vermont, nearly 70 per cent live in rural areas. This is the highest percentage rural population of any state in the nation. In Vermont, specialists in more than twenty-five disciplines from Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington are made readily available to patients even in the most rural areas. I want to see this level of service expand and be made available to all Americans. 
   We in Washington have made some good faith attempts to allow for the development of telehealth technologies but we have fallen short. In an effort to restrain the expansion of these programs, the Health Care Financing Administration's interpretation of the laws and its cumbersome rules for reimbursement have all but guaranteed the demise of current programs. 
   Federally-funded telemedicine projects exist in almost every State in the Nation. These projects have proven that cost-effective, high-quality care can be delivered using this technology. The provisions in this bill will help to ensure that this care will be continued when the federal grants end. 
   Why is this legislation needed now? Because current HCFA regulations concerning payment are unworkable in the real world. Less than 6 percent of all telemedicine doctor-patient visits last year provided to Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for reimbursement under HCFA's current guidelines. 
   Now that we have more experience and understand better how telemedicine can be used, it is time to enact several changes to the law so that these programs can thrive and deliver on their promise of providing cost-effective, high-quality healthcare where it is needed the most. 
   Rural healthcare providers and patients are eager for this legislation. Norman Wright, President of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, recognized the potential of 
   Fletcher Allen's telemedicine program by describing it as one that ``provides incredible opportunities for rural providers and their patients because it links them to a network with access to the region's best authorities for any given condition.'' 
   I have indeed heard an outpouring of support from healthcare providers across my own State on this issue. Gerry Davis, Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Fletcher Allen Health Care, described ``appropriate and fair third party payment for  telemedicine'' as ``essential in order to move this process beyond education, and to make the service truly useful for patients in remote locations.'' 
   Telemedicine can be used in so many ways. It can be vital to a pediatrician from a rural area with a sick baby who needs to consult with a neonatologist from a tertiary care hospital in the dead of winter and the middle of the night. It can be also be crucial for a depressed senior citizen who desperately needs mental health services available in their own rural county. And it can be much needed help for a frustrated isolated primary care provider who longs to be able to provide for access to specialty services for her patients in their own community. All of these people need our help. 
   While the changes included in this bill are relatively minor in the context of the Medicare program, the effect will be far-reaching. This legislation will allow us to avoid arbitrarily denying access to health care for our senior citizens and persons with disabilities just because of where they live. It will allow for fair and reasonable reimbursement for services that can be delivered appropriately in this way. It will also encourage the incorporation of telehealth technology in the care plans of home health agencies, an area that has already shown great promise for the future in terms of cost-effective disease management. In summary, it will allow us to begin to release the incredible potential of telemedicine. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in bringing HCFA's approach to the delivery of health care into the 21st Century. Any Medicare reform must include progress on telemedicine for our Nation's rural areas.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. We are commencing further debate on the ESEA, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I think it is important that we do spend this time on general debate because it is a big bill. There are a number of very important problems to be discussed. Hopefully, we will reach a consensus at some point so that the bill will pass. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take a little bit of time today, until others arrive, to talk about the role of teachers in our efforts to improve educational opportunities for young people. S.2 includes some important changes related to the critical job of providing teachers with opportunities to enhance their professional skills. Supporting our Nation's teachers must be at the foundation of our education reform efforts because the better our Nation's teachers are--the better chance our Nation's students will have to ``make the grade'' in the 21st century. 
   A 1999 survey by the U.S. Department of Education on the preparation and qualifications of public school teachers reported that continued learning in the teaching profession is ``key to building educators' capacity for effective teaching, particularly in a profession where the demands are changing and expanding.'' An investment in our Nation's teachers is a wise one. And we need to make wise investments with our Federal resources to ensure that the Federal dollars for professional development support activities that will foster improvements in teaching and learning that benefit students in the classroom. 
   Our Nation's classrooms are changing. All across this country, students are expected to learn to higher standards and perform at increasingly challenging levels. We will never get students to where they ``need to be'' unless our Nation's teachers have the knowledge base to teach to those demanding standards. While there is near total agreement that strong, capable teachers are the ones that will make the most significant, positive difference in the education of our nation's students, we have not done enough to help them be at the top of their game. 
   There are still too many educators teaching outside their field of expertise. Too often, teachers are offered one-shot, one-day workshops for professional development that do little to improve teaching and learning in the classroom. Professional development activities often lack the connection to the everyday challenges that teachers face in their classrooms. The most recent evaluation of the Eisenhower Professional Development program notes that ``The need for high-quality professional development that focuses on subject-matter content and how students learn that content is all the more pressing in light of the many teachers who teach outside their areas of specialization.'' 
   Title II of this bill addresses these serious deficiencies in professional development ``head on.'' S. 2 draws on the strongest elements of the Eisenhower program while including authority for other initiatives that have an impact on ``teacher quality.'' The bill provides flexibility to school districts to address the specific needs of individual schools through programs such as: recruitment and hiring initiatives; teacher mentoring and retention initiates and professional development activities. 
   It prohibits Federal dollars from being used for ``one-shot'' workshops that have been criticized for being relatively ineffective because they are usually short term; lacking in continuity; lacking in adequate followup; and typically isolated from the participants' classroom and school contexts. 
   The bill before the Senate provides significant resources--$2 billion--to school districts to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom. It combines funds and authorities from the Eisenhower program and the class size reduction program in an effort to give school districts the flexibility that they need to make decisions about what investments in ``teacher quality'' will have the greatest impact on learning in their schools. 
   In an effort to set the record straight, I would like to clarify a point that has been made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle with regard to hiring teachers. The language in Title II makes it very clear that only certified or licensed teachers can be hired under this program. I would like to read from the text of the bill on page 210, Section 2031(b)(1):  
   Each Local Education Agency that receives a subgrant to carryout this subpart may use the funds made available though the subgrant to carryout the following activities: (1) Recruiting and hiring certified or licensed teachers, including teachers certified though State and local alternative routes, in order to reduce class size or hiring special education teachers.  
   This language is very straight forward and to the point--if you use Title II funds for hiring teachers--they must be certified or licensed. 
   There has also been some criticism about what kind of professional development programs can be supported under this bill. The language in S. 2 is very strong on this point. The bill ensures that professional development funded with Federal dollars be related to the curriculum and tied to the academic subject the teacher is responsible for teaching. 
   Professional development must be tied to challenging State or local standards; tied to strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in improving student academic achievement and student performance or be a project that will substantially increase the knowledge and teaching skills of the teacher. They must be developed with extensive participation of teachers and other educators and must be of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on the performance of a teacher in the classroom. It prohibits ``one-shot, one-day'' workshops unless they are part of a long-term comprehensive program. 
   This bill--for perhaps the first time in Federal law--makes it crystal clear that Federal funds must be used for activities that will improve teaching and learning in the classroom--not for fad-type activities that have no relationship to what teachers want and need to know to be better at their jobs. 
   The structure of title II makes a great deal of common sense and will result in a real improvement in teacher quality. My home State of Vermont serves as a good example of success through local decisionmaking. Vermont strongly supports the class size money. Yet, since the first dollar was appropriated for class-size reduction, Vermont sought greater flexibility to use that money for professional development activities that would improve the quality of the teacher in the classroom. Because Vermont already had small classes--sizes that happen to meet the Federally mandated standard of 18--those dollars were able to go for professional development. 
   I want other States to do what Vermont has done if that is what is in the best interest of their students. Reducing class size is important. Having a dynamic, qualified teacher at the head of the classroom is of equal or greater importance. Title II of this bill supports both efforts--high quality  professional development and hiring teachers to reduce class size--yet 
   does it in a way that allows school districts to come up with their own recipe for improvement that will work for its students.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my leader for his very eloquent statement on the status of education and the importance of this legislation. I am hopeful we will all work together in a bipartisan manner to come out with legislation on which we can all agree. 
   Today, the Senate begins debate of S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act. This legislation deals with every aspect of federal assistance to our nation's elementary and secondary schools. 
   There is perhaps no subject more on the minds of the American public than education. As a nation, we have long recognized that the quality of our future depends upon the quality of the education provided to our children. From our very earliest days, schoolhouses were among the first buildings to spring up in budding communities. 
   Federal involvement in elementary and secondary education can be traced back to the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, one of the first laws passed by the Continental Congress. The Northwest Ordinance required each township within the territory to reserve one square mile for the establishment of public schools. Under the Northwest Ordinance law, 77 million acres of land were set aside for public education. 
   Since 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, has provided the foundation for Federal efforts to help children succeed in school. Currently, we provide about $14.3 billion annually for ESEA programs. This is a substantial investment which deserves the careful attention of all Members. 
   Over half, $7.9 billion, of these funds is used on behalf of disadvantaged children under the title I program. Congress created the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in order to serve these children, and they remain the primary focus of our efforts. Other activities supported through ESEA include professional development, literacy, safe and drug-free schools, bilingual education, impact aid, aid to special populations, and technology. 
   In preparation for this legislation, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held 25 hearings on ESEA programs to examine each aspect of the Act with a view toward keeping what works, revising what does not, and adding what is necessary to meet emerging needs. 
   In addition, I have devoted a great deal of time talking with students, parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, school board members, state-level school officials, and Governors. I have traveled all over the country doing this. In particular, I have listened to those in my home state of Vermont who work every day to make elementary and secondary school the best it can be. 
   What I have heard from Vermonters and others around the country is that schools need to be held accountable for the performance of all their students, that education programs must show positive results, and that quality teachers and school leaders are essential to the success of any school. I have also been reminded that the 7-cents on the dollar provided by the Federal government is not going to do the job singlehandedly. To achieve these objectives, states and localities must have sufficient flexibility to tailor solutions to meet their individual circumstances. 
   The advice I received is reflected in the programs and themes included in the Educational Opportunities Act. The primary objectives of this bill are: 
   One, to maintain and strengthen the title I reform process initiated in 1994 which emphasizes the establishment of high standards and assessments designed to measure progress towards those standards; 
   Two, to promote the sustained professional development of teachers and school leaders; 
   Three, to help assure that students are provided a safe and drug-free learning environment; 
   Four, to place an emphasis on getting results by insisting that activities and programs supported with federal funds are based on theory, research, and evaluation showing them to be effective in meeting their objectives; and 
   Five, to increase State and local flexibility in the use of Federal funds in exchange for greater accountability for improving student performance. 
   We would all agree that our schools must be held accountable for ensuring the academic success of all students. Like many others, I am disappointed that our students are not performing at the levels they should be and that Federal efforts to serve disadvantaged students have not shown better results. 
   Congress has long recognized the need to raise standards. The alarm was raised in the Nation at Risk report issued in 1983. The admonition was given in these terse words: If a foreign government had imposed on us our educational system we would have declared it an act of war. In 1989, then-President Bush called together the Nation's Governors to an education summit from which national education goals for the year 2000 were set. 
   In 1994, Congress substantially revised the title I program by focusing on standards, assessment, and professional development. The 1994 legislation set out a 7-year timetable for States to develop student content and performance standards and assessments aligned to those standards. The idea was to determine what students should know and be able to do and then to hold schools accountable for results by testing students against these standards. 
   In addition, States and local school districts are to identify failing schools, known as schools in need of improvement, to offer extra assistance to those schools, and to take corrective action if the schools fail to improve over a 2-year period. Corrective action may include implementing a new curriculum, restructuring the school, implementing a joint plan that addresses specific student performance problems, reconstituting school staff, or decreasing decisionmaking authority at the school level. If permitted under State or local law, corrective action at the school district level may also include reducing or withholding funds from a school or abolishing the school. At the State level, again subject to State and local law, corrective action may include reducing or withholding funds from a school district, abolishing the district, removing particular schools from its jurisdiction, or appointing a receiver or trustee. 
   We are now midstream in this reform process. To date, 48 States have approved content standards, 25 States have approved performance standards, and no States have approved assessments. Assessments are not required under the law until the 2001-2002 school year. 
   The proposal approved by the committee ``stays the course'' with respect to these fundamental reforms, while building upon them in ways which will not sidetrack the activities well underway at the State and local levels. The revisions made to title I are designed to demonstrate that we are serious about holding children to high standards and pressuring for reform of failing schools--without creating mandates that force States and localities to start all over under a new set of rules and reporting requirements. Recognizing the expense of these endeavors, the measure also offers additional assistance for school improvement and assessment activities so that schools will be able to keep in stride with the 7-year reform schedule. 
   Other revisions in title I emphasize the importance of parental involvement, including the creation of a separate part in the Title which is exclusively devoted to this issue. Title I also contains a new part which highlights the Comprehensive School Reform program. This program provides support for schools to put in place schoolwide reform programs which are backed up by research showing them to be effective. 
   Not just in title I, but throughout the bill, there is an emphasis on getting results. Activities and programs supported with Federal funds are to be based on theory, research, and evaluation showing them to be effective in meeting their objectives, particularly as they relate to improving student achievement and performance. 
   The bill also supports efforts to enhance teacher quality, which is one of the most critical tasks facing us. Nothing will change in the classroom until  the teachers change. And the teachers can't be expected to change until they have help in knowing what is expected of them. 
   We made a strong start in this regard during the last Congress by completely revamping federal support for teacher preparation activities as part of our work on the Higher Education Act. We now have the opportunity to focus on the professional development of teachers already in the classroom. 
   This legislation is designed to step away from one-time, short-term activities and, instead, promote the sustained professional development shown to be effective in improving teacher skills and content knowledge. 
   Recognizing that the need for professional development is not limited to teachers, the bill includes a new professional development initiative directed toward principals and superintendents. As we all know, a good school always has a first-rate principal, and a first-rate school district always has an outstanding and innovative superintendent. 
   Funding for professional development activities is increased by including funds currently allocated for the class-size reduction program. Schools will still have the ability to hire teachers with Federal funds. If that is where their need lies, I am sure they will do just that. What I have heard in Vermont, however, is that the biggest need is not for more teachers--but rather for better ones. That is a choice that I believe Vermont and the other States across the country are in a better position to make than we are here in Congress. This bill leaves that choice squarely in their hands. 
   The goal of assuring a safe and drug-free learning environment is promoted in this legislation through a strengthening of the provisions of title IV, Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities. These improvements are the result of the bipartisan efforts of several Members, spearheaded by Senators DEWINE, DODD, and MURRAY. Modifications are made to increase accountability, to ensure that researched-based programs are funded, to provide States with greater flexibility in targeting violence and drug use, and to increase community participation in prevention programs. 
   Finally, this legislation takes a number of significant steps to increase flexibility in exchange for greater accountability. It does so in the recognition that national programs which offer assistance for specific activities are limited in their ability to capture the diversity of individual needs in States and localities throughout the country. 
   The bill substantially increases funding for the Innovative Education Program Strategies provisions of title VI. This program is the most flexible of all current Federal education programs, permitting local schools to undertake the activities most likely to improve their schools and enhance the performance of their students. These funds are put to work where the need is greatest--be it technology or library books or teacher training. 
   The bill consolidates into title VI the waiver and related authorities now located in various titles of current law, making it easier for States and localities to find and review their options for making Federal dollars work more effectively for them. 
   Title VI also includes several new options for flexible use of Federal funds. For example, a new rural flexibility initiative offers small rural districts the chance to combine the small amounts they might receive under specific categorical grant programs to amass a chunk of funds large enough to really address a priority need. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes formula and competitive grants that allow many of our local school districts to improve the education of their students. These federal grants support efforts to promote goals such as the professional development of teachers, the incorporation of technology into the classroom, gifted and talented programs, and making sure our schools provide safe learning environments for our children. Schools receive several categorical grants supporting these programs, each with its own authorized activities. 
   As valuable as these programs are for thousands of predominantly urban and suburban school districts, they simply do not work well in rural areas. This is because the grants are based on school district enrollment. These individual grants confront smaller schools with a dilemma; namely, they simply may not receive enough funding from any single grant to carry out meaningful activities. The rural flexibility initiative allows a district to combine the funds from four categorical programs and use the funds to support projects that bring about improved academic achievement. 
   If we are to ensure that our children have the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we must all work together to lay a sound foundation at the elementary and secondary school level. The Federal Government is just one among the many partners with a responsibility to assure that we succeed. Although the total Federal investment pales by comparison to the support offered by State and local taxpayers, the $14 billion to $15 billion we do provide represents a substantial sum by anyone's accounting. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to play a constructive role in helping to bring about the improvements we all want to see in elementary and secondary education. I realize there are many ideas regarding how we might achieve this goal. My hope is that, in debating our differences, we will not lose sight of our mutual goal of supporting a system of education which is second to none. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my good friend from Massachusetts, but I want to assure the American people that the majority of his criticisms are directed not toward the main body of the bill but toward a demonstration project contained within the bill. I think we have agreement on a great deal of the underlying bill. 
   I would like to point out, for instance, that the bill contains a bipartisan proposal put forward by the Governors. Our heavily relying on the States is only appropriate, and it is the way to go. The Governors and the States are primarily responsible for education in this country. 
   I also point out that this bill does not abandon the needs of homeless children and immigrants and other disadvantaged students. They are maintained about the same as they are now. 
   There are some important differences, there is no question about it, with respect to parts of the bill. But the major of the criticisms offered by my colleague from Massachusetts were aimed at a demonstration project that might be used by 15 States. I think there is agreement on so much of this bill, I hate to see the debate entirely focused on those areas that were mentioned. 
   I note the majority has consumed about 15 minutes, and the minority has consumed more than an hour. I have three of my people waiting who have been here for pretty much that time. I will recognize those three and then we will return to alternating.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Vermonter and good friend, Larry Cooke, who recently died after a long illness. Born and raised in Vermont, Larry's love and devotion to his state and home town of Brattleboro framed all of his actions. We in Vermont are saddened by his loss but heartened by the legacy that he leaves behind. 
   Larry's dedication to public service began early in his life. As an eighth grader, he was elected president of his class and never looked back. Like many of an earlier generation, Larry was a self-made man, going to work for his father immediately after graduating from Brattleboro Union High School. 
   Demonstrating a devotion to his country that would extend throughout his life, Larry joined the Army and served in Germany before coming home to earn his real estate license. In this profession that he found his true calling, and it is here that he leaves his biggest footprint on the town of Brattleboro. 
   Larry devoted his career to affordable housing and environmentally friendly developments. His most important projects have included renovating historic buildings to their original condition while making them viable for modern day usage. 
   Larry was a consistent and important champion of affordable housing, taking the lead on the issue at the age of thirty as a candidate for Battleboro town selectman. He then went on to serve on the Brattleboro Housing Authority for two decades, building and renovating affordable housing and apartments throughout the area. 
   As if his professional and private life did not take up enough of his time, Larry was active in every aspect of town affairs. He has served as president of the Kiwanis Club and as a corporator of Brattleboro Memorial Hospital. Among other activities too numerous to mention, Larry was a Mason, a member of the American Legion, the Shriners, and the Elks. 
   Before he died, this close friend of mine gave one last gift to his community. Larry donated a historic home in the center of Brattleboro to the town's historical society for use as its headquarters and museum. Although only a small part of Larry's life-long contribution to Brattleboro, the home will stand as a lasting monument to a man who devoted his life to the betterment of his community. 
   It has been said that we live in deeds, not years. While Larry died young, his accomplishments rival those of the oldest of men. He will be missed not only by Brattleboro and Vermont, but also by this country, where his life stands as a shining example for us all. My deepest condolences go out to Larry's devoted Wide, Kathleen, and his four daughters.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to educators in five Vermont high schools whose collaborative work in school improvement will help high school teachers and administrators across the country understand how to support high school reform. The high schools and their educators include: Montpelier High School--Owen Bradley, David Gibson, and Charlie Phillips; Otter Valley High School in Brandon--Nancy Cornell, Ellie Davine, and Bill Petrics; South Burlington High School--Tim Comoli, Sheila Mable, and Janet Bossange; Essex High School--Kevin Martell, Sue Pasco, and Brian Nelligan; and Mount Abraham High School in Bristol--Tom Tailer, John Vibber, David Royce and Mary Sullivan. 
   These people are outstanding educators who understand how to build partnerships between the community and school that enrich the experience of their students. All five of these high schools have Professional Development School partnerships with the University of Vermont, collaborating to prepare new teachers and support veteran teachers on behalf of school renewal. Each of them has learned to use local resources to bring high school students into meaningful contact with adults in the surrounding community, making learning a part of life. All five schools are discovering how to link local innovations with the national effort to help all high school students meet high standards of performance. The Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Laboratory at Brown University (LAB), a program of The Education Alliance at Brown University, with the support of the U.S. Department of Education will publish and disseminate a description of their work and the results of the work in The Dynamics of Change in High School Teaching: Instructional Innovation in Five Vermont Professional Development Schools, which will be released this summer. (Clarke, et al, 2000) 
   The Montpelier Story, a publication excerpted from the book and available now through the LAB, is the story of the success of dedicated educators in collaboration with community partners and other resources in providing new, student-centered learning opportunities to the young people they serve. 
   At Montpelier High School, Owen Bradley, David Gibson, Charlie Phillips and the entire faculty have redesigned the curriculum to support Personal Learning Plans for each student in the school. Montpelier students use their Personal Learning Plans to select courses and to develop community-based learning projects that help them meet graduation requirements and carry them toward their individual goals in ways that fit their unique talents and aspirations. The work at Montpelier has already inspired schools across Vermont and spilled over the borders to Maine and beyond, where it serves as a model for redevelopment of curricula and advising to increase contact between students and adults. 
   Under the leadership of Nancy Cornell, Ellie Davine and Bill Petrics formed a team at Otter Valley High School with the purpose of designing a standards-based course for students in the school who needed to understand how geography and local decision making affect land use in Vermont. By giving each student a topographic map of 100 acres in the State and leading them through the process of land-use assessment and planning required by Vermont's environmental laws, they illustrated the application of knowledge and skills in local community development efforts. 
   Over a period of 15 years at South Burlington High School, Tim Comoli and Sheila Mable, both of the English Department, developed a state-of-the-art media lab that engages students in designing multi-media presentations of professional quality for public service organizations in their community. Development of the media lab provoked a complete revision of the district's technology education plan, creating a model technology program for the State. 
   At Essex High School, Kevin Martell, Sue Pasco and Brian Nelligan have worked for more than a decade to design and refine an integrated course in history and English that engages students in examining the evolution of human culture from 10,000 BC to the present. By fitting course assignment to the individual learning styles of the students who fill their classrooms, they have been able to create a challenging course in which high school students teach each other, and learn to express their views in a wide variety of media. 
   Tom Tailer, John Vibber and a host of partners at Mount Abraham Union High School developed a physics unit on Newton's Laws that they expanded over a decade into a simulation of armed, global aggression. Having made ``weapons'' that launch tennis balls over great distances, Mt. Abraham's physics students play out the implications of an unequal distribution of global power on the school's athletic fields, then compare their struggle to current wars and conflicts around the globe. The ``Physics War'' is part of a complete redesign of Mt. Abraham's science curriculum that bases student learning on performance measured against common standards. 
   Each of these projects demonstrates that high school change occurs when individuals reach across the boundaries that separate them into departments and bureaucratic layers, forming partnerships that empower all participants to learn and grow through shared effort on behalf of a common goal: improved learning for young people.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I must congratulate the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, for producing an on-time budget for only the third time in the 24-plus-year history of the Budget Act. 
   Thrifty, cautious, and conservative. These adjectives describe the Yankee qualities of many Vermonters when someone tries to get them to open their wallets, and are in the genes of anyone who represents our great state in Congress. I am pleased that this resolution protects social security. Not one penny of the social security surplus is touched. Second, it balances the budget every year without using the social security surplus. Thirdly, this resolution retires the national debt held by the public--nearly $170 billion in the first year and $1 trillion over the next five years. 
   I am greatly troubled, however, about certain elements in the budget, and will vote against the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution now before the Senate. 
   What would a cautious farmer do when times are good--invest in new equipment to become more efficient, pay off debts, and put some away for a rainy day. There is no question that tax relief is warranted, but not at the expense of education, veterans health, job training, child care and other important discretionary programs. 
   A farmer cautiously guards his seed corn for future harvests. Our nation's seed corn is its youth and investments in education are needed to protect our prosperity. The conference report now before us rejects funding added on the floor of the Senate for three important education programs. It not only rejects funding that a majority of this body supported but it takes a giant step backward by reducing funding for education $3 billion below what was contained within the original Senate-passed resolution. 
   When I first arrived in Congress, one of the very first bills that I had the privilege of working on was the Education of All Handicapped Act of 1975. As a freshman Member of Congress, I was proud to sponsor that legislation and to be named as a member of the House and Senate conference committee along with then Vermont Senator Bob Stafford. 
   At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate all children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students were denied access to a public education. Passage of the Education of All Handicapped Act offered financial incentives to states to fulfill this existing obligation. Recognizing that the costs associated with educating these children was more than many school districts could bear alone, the Federal government pledged to pay 40 percent of the costs of educating these students. 
   The budget resolution that is before us makes a mockery of this pledge. The original Senate budget resolution assumed that the Federal government would only fund between 15 and 18 
   percent of the cost of educating disabled students. My amendment to increase this percentage was narrowly defeated last week and was then watered down by an amendment by my colleague Senator VOINOVICH. I had hoped, nonetheless, that passage of the Voinovich amendment meant that a serious effort would be made in conference to increase funding for IDEA. This hope was clearly misplaced. 
   Let me also speak for a minute about early childhood education. 
   Research into the development and growth of the human brain clearly demonstrates that learning begins at birth. The sheer magnitude of this scientific research is difficult to fathom. When talk turns to 100 billion neurons or connections with axons and dendrites, confusion is the most likely outcome. What this research basically says is something that parents and grandparents have know for decades, very young children need a nurturing, stimulating environment in order for their brains to make the myriad of connections they need to grow into competent, caring adults. 
   Research on the brain has shown that the years between birth and six are critical for future success in school, at work, and in society. I believe that education provides the cornerstone from which all other things become possible. Our Nation's first educational goal is that all children should begin  school ready to learn. In order to achieve that goal, parents and caretakers need support and assistance to better ensure that they have the tools necessary to incorporate early childhood learning into the daily lives of our Nation's children. Senator STEVENS offered an amendment that was adopted by unanimous consent that provided mandatory funding for this program. This funding was rejected in conference and is not contained within this budget resolution. 
   Senator KENNEDY and I offered an amendment that provided for a $400 increase in the maximum Pell Grant. These funds make it possible for millions of students to attend college each year. Again, this funding was rejected in conference and is not contained within this resolution. 
   Prosperity also dictates that we redouble our efforts to protect society's most vulnerable. Unfortunately, this budget does not go far enough to provide drugs to seniors who need them now. I agree with Vermonters who tell me that prescription drug costs are too high, and that it doesn't make sense for Medicare to cover hospital charges, but not cover the drugs that could keep beneficiaries out of the hospital. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. President, I believe that we need Medicare reform that includes a broad prescription drug benefit. But even if we are not able to enact Medicare reform this year, I believe we need to provide sufficient funds now, in this budget, that will provide relief to Medicare beneficiaries that need help the most--those low-income seniors whose income is high enough that they don't qualify for Medicaid, but still do not have enough income to afford the prescription drugs that they need. 
   Mr. President, I am very disappointed with the prescription drug provision in this Budget Resolution. I supported the approach of Senator SNOWE's amendment in the Budget Committee that would have provided $40 billion for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries even if Congress is unable to enact Medicare reform. We should not let Congress' inability to enact broad Medicare reform stand in the way of providing seniors with the medicines that they need to live longer, healthier lives. 
   I am further dismayed that this budget resolution does not fulfill our Nation's commitment to its veterans. Years of underfunding coupled with spiraling health care costs have left the veterans health care system struggling to provide the quality care that veterans expect and deserve. This trend must be stopped and reversed. We owe it to future generations to keep federal spending under control. But we must first recognize the prior claim of veterans who have already given of themselves and who expect to receive the medical care and benefits they were promised. 
   This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of political intent, priorities, and a starting point for bargaining. Much work remains to be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that actually fund the government. In areas where I disagree with the budget resolution, I plan to work hard with appropriators to adjust spending levels and turn this budget into reality. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. Two years ago, I stood before you as the proud sponsor of a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA). Today I am here to honor the 20th anniversary of VVA's first chapter--born and raised in my home town of Rutland, Vermont. 
   Twenty years ago, Vietnam Veterans were suffering under the wave of anti-  Vietnam sentiment that had swept the nation. Little recognition was given to their sacrifices during the war. And in fact, there was even a great deal of official denial about the extent of the price that had been paid by these veterans, both physical and emotional. It would be years before Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder would be a recognized condition for many veterans and years before the Federal Government would admit that use of Agent Orange had left a terrible legacy of continued suffering for our veterans. The founders of the VVA felt that they must have an organization to speak directly to those needs. The outpouring of enthusiasm from the veterans themselves demonstrated the depth of these feelings. 
   In 1979, during a trip to Vermont, VVA founder Bobby Muller met Don Bodette. Don supported the notion of an organization of and for Vietnam era veterans, but felt that it would only be truly successful if they mobilized locally and established chapters. The power of Don's logic and commitment persuaded Bobby Muller to adopt his model. On April 13, 1980, VVA Chapter One was established in Rutland, Vermont. Taking up the challenge, Don was joined by Jake Jacobsen, Albert and Mary Trombley, Mike Dodge, Dennis Ross and Mark Truhan, to name a few. Today, April 13, 2000, VVA Chapter One has 120 members hailing from 19 states and 3 other countries. 
   I would like to add my voice to the multitudes both in and outside of Vermont who are celebrating this auspicious anniversary. I join in recognizing the tremendous work done by the VVA, both in Vermont and nationally. As a Vietnam era veteran myself, we all owe a debt of gratitude to VVA Chapter One's farsighted founders and the committed members who have followed their lead. Happy 20th Birthday, Chapter One! May you have many more!

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Weatherization Improvement Act of 2000. 
   As this past winter has demonstrated, cold temperatures and high fuel costs can result in severe hardship for many of our low-income households, particularly those with children, elderly, and disabled members. Preventative energy efficiency measures are vital to ensure that low-income consumers spend less money keeping their families warm on cold winter nights. It is estimated that investments in Weatherization can save a typical household $193 in annual gas energy costs. While improving energy efficiency through work such as air-  sealing and insulation work is an admirable goal, the Weatherization Assistance Program also has become an important tool in addressing the health and safely of our low-income families. 
   The Weatherization Improvement Act of 2000 seeks to further this commitment. The legislation will amend the average per dwelling unit cost to incorporate intensive costs, such as costs of furnace or cooling replacements, reducing the administrative burden of tracking these costs separately; increase the average cost per home, beginning this year, to $2,500 (up from $2,032 for 1999); and eliminate the statutory requirement that at least 40 percent of funds be spent on materials. These changes are necessary to improve the effectiveness of the Weatherization, and are long overdue. 
   Lastly, the legislation repeals the 25 percent state matching requirement for the Weatherization Assistance Program set to begin in FY2001, which was included in the FY2000 Interior Appropriations legislation. While many states, utilities, and private organizations have leveraged large amounts of money in support of the Weatherization Assistance Program, not every state is in the same financial situation. There needs to be national commitment to energy efficiency for low income Americans and affordable housing. This is part of that commitment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for his statement. We had an incredibly good breakthrough in negotiations, which is why I can reassure the Senator of my belief that we don't have to worry about it being changed, with the administration about 3 o'clock the morning before last, after long negotiations, and we came to a resolution which at least I know my critics in Vermont and everyone I know has agreed is a wonderful resolution of the problem. 
   I am hopeful we will also be able to get the holds from the other side of the aisle removed expeditiously so this can be passed. 
   I thank the Senator because he was a leader in this field, and the bill he brought out of the appropriations process was certainly one which was taken into consideration and utilized in the final resolution. 
   With Senator KENNEDY and Senator FRIST agreeing to it, with the administration, I think we have, for the first time, a real hope this very difficult area of organ transplants and how they will be utilized may have a permanent solution--at least a solution for a foreseeable length of time. A lot of it is due to the efforts of the Senator, and I appreciate it.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky for their work on the bill being presented today. We are here today because we believe that all workers should have the opportunity to share in the success of their companies and it is incredibly important we do all we can to make sure that this legislation gets passed with the vote it deserves. 
   More and more employers are providing equity ownership opportunities to all of their employees and we are here today because we want to foster this trend which is good for our workers and for our nation's economic growth. The Worker Economic Opportunity Act will encourage this trend by changing the Fair Labor Standards Act  to address the needs of the 21st century. 
   Over the last ten years, we have witnessed tremendous change in the structure of our Nation's economy in large part due to the birth of the internet and e-commerce. The vitality of our economy is a tribute to the creative and entrepreneurial genius of thousands of individual business people and the indispensable contribution of the American workforce. 
   As legislators during this exciting time, we are challenged to maintain an environment that will foster the continued growth of our economy. We must work to ensure that our laws are in sync with the changing environment. However, many of the laws and policies governing our workplace have fallen out of sync with the information age and there has been particular resistance to changing our labor laws. As chairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over workplace issues, I believe it is time to examine and modify these laws to meet the rapidly evolving needs of the American workforce. 
   The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, was enacted in the late 1930s, to establish basic standards for wages and overtime pay. While the principles behind the FLSA have not changed, its rigid provisions make it difficult for employers to accommodate the needs of today's workforce. In early January, we discovered the problem that we are addressing here today. It is extremely important. We learned that the sixty-year old law actually operates to deter employers from offering equity participation programs, such as stock options, to hourly employees. 
   These programs are most prevalent in the high tech industry, yet increasingly employers across the whole spectrum of American industry have begun to offer them. And, while these programs used to be reserved for executives, recent data shows that they are making their way down the corporate ladder. A recent Federal Reserve Board of Governors study found that 17% of firms have introduced stock options programs within the last two years and 37% have broadened eligibility for their stock option programs in the last two years. 
   Broad-based equity programs prove valuable to both employers and employees. For employers, these programs have become a key tool for employee recruitment, motivation and retention. Employees seek out companies offering these programs because they enable workers to become owners and reap the benefits of their company's growth. 
   When I first heard about the FLSA's application to stock options, I became very concerned about its impact on our workforce. I was pleased to discover that Senators McConnell, Dodd, and ENZI shared similar concerns and that the Department of Labor also recognized that we had a problem on our hands that would require a legislative solution. Together we crafted the legislation we are debating here today. 
   We have also worked together on a Joint Statement of Legislative Intent on S. 2323 which is intended to reflect the discussions the sponsors had with the Department of Labor during the drafting of the legislation, and the sponsors' intent and understanding of this legislation. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. It is a symbolic first step in the process of aligning our labor laws with the new economy. 
   I commend the Senator from Wyoming who is one of the initial people who understood the importance of this issue and who came forward to help other Members understand the dangers of the present situation and to bring about the bill we have before the Senate. I am happy to yield the floor to my wonderful Senator from Wyoming.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those who have already spoken eloquently about the need to increase funding for America's veterans. While I appreciate Senator DOMENICI's efforts to provide the increase requested by the administration, many of my colleagues agree with me that this is not sufficient to meet the needs of America's veterans. Years of underfunding coupled with spiraling health care costs have left the system struggling to provide the quality care that veterans expect and deserve. This trend must be stopped and reversed. We owe it to future generations to keep federal spending under control. But we must first recognize the prior claim of veterans who have already given of themselves and who expect to receive the medical care and benefits they are promised. 
   Mr. President, veterans in my State of Vermont are very lucky. They have been served for many years by a very dedicated and high quality VA system, headquartered in White River Junction with clinics in Burlington and  Bennington. But this system is being stretched to the limit. Numbers of veterans wanting to use the services of the VA are increasing. While the cost of providing quality medical care has risen less at our VA hospital than it has in the private sector, more funding is still required just to provide the same services this year as last. Budget shortfalls of about 10 percent per year for several years have forced administrators to demand sacrifices of their personnel that would not be tolerated in many other systems and make cuts in services that are regrettable. Thanks to our dedicated staff, Vermont veterans are still receiving quality health care, but these trends can't continue. It is high time the system was given the funding it needs to do the job right. 
   In an improvement over last year, the President's budget for fiscal year 2001 requested an increase of $1.3 billion for veterans health care. But that is still about $600 million below the amount that is needed to maintain existing programs and fulfill the funding requirements of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, passed by Congress last year. This amount, $21.2 billion, has been identified by the Independent Budget coalition as the minimum acceptable funding level for veterans health care programs. 
   While veterans, just like all Americans, would love to see their benefits increase, this request does not do that. Funding the Veterans Health Administration at $21.2 billion would merely take a bite out of the increasing cost of medical care, particularly pharmaceutical costs, for an aging veterans population. Demand for VA health care continues to rise and enrollment is going up at many facilities, with no corresponding increase in funding to cover those veterans. The Millennium bill authorized better nursing home care, home health and long-term care services, greatly needed by veterans. It also provided veterans with long-desired emergency room coverage, and recognizes the imperative of covering the increasing number of hepatitis C cases among veterans. But if additional funds are not provided to cover these costs, these promises will be hollow. 
   I am very pleased to join Senators JOHNSON and WELLSTONE in offering this amendment to add $500 million to the budget for the Veterans Health Administration. I urge all my colleagues to support this worthy effort. This is the very least we can do!

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment by Senators JEFFORDS, DODD, STEVENS, KENNEDY, COLLINS, SNOWE, L. CHAFEE, and FEINGOLD. We have voted many times, often 99-0, to fully fund IDEA. Failure to agree to this amendment will tell the Nation we do not ever intend to make good on this pledge. We have unprecedented economic prosperity. We have surpluses well into the future. We can do it now. 
   For 25 years, we have promised to pay 40 percent of the cost of educating students with disabilities. Today, we pay 13 percent. The chart behind me shows the truth about the budget resolution. It proposes to move us from 13 percent to 18 percent. It says clearly to the Nation, despite all our rhetoric, we never intend to keep our word. 
   Our amendment will fully fund our promise. I ask my colleagues: If not now, when? 
   The time is now.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the permanent protection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   I certainly understand the concerns raised by those calling for more domestic energy production. I don't disagree that this nation should do more to kick our addiction to foreign oil. I agree it's time to develop more of our nation's clean, renewable energy resources. I urge my colleagues to look carefully at creating incentives for clean, domestically produced energy such as ethanol, methanol, natural gas, wind, solar and biomass power. However, we must withhold efforts to drill in one of our nation's most pristine nature preserves and instead look at alternatives. 
   It may be easy for some to look at maps of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and envision it as an empty expanse of land that should be valued only for its small and scattered oil pockets. However, this is a beautiful stretch of land that contains an incredible variety of plant and animal life. This is the only national conservation area that provides a complete range of arctic ecosystems, and it is home to two large caribou herds and 72 species of land mammals and fish. The founders of the Refuge recognized the special characteristics of this land and its value to the American public as a wild and free land. 
   In the summer of 1997, I traveled to the Refuge and was able to see first hand how beautiful and important this land is to both Alaska and the Nation. As part of a Senate delegation, I visited the Port of Valdez, where oil is loaded onto tankers, and I traveled along the pipeline that brings oil from the north. I also flew over the Refuge itself, getting a perfect birds-eye view of this quiet, peaceful landscape. In particular, I was silenced by the beauty of the Mollie Beattie Wilderness. As my colleagues will remember, we dedicated a large portion of the refuge to Mollie Beattie, a friend and fellow Vermonter. 
   Mollie oversaw all of Vermont's public lands as Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, instituting policies which today are a model of environmental protection. She then brought her passion and extensive knowledge of the natural world to Washington to head the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   I was astounded by the natural beauty of this area and proud as I reflected back on Mollie's contribution and dedication to preserving wildlife and wildlife habitat. I could not think of a better tribute than to have named the eight million acres of wilderness in the Arctic Refuge after Mollie. It's been three years since she passed away and we miss her dearly. Although I can no longer work by her side in common cause, her spirit and enthusiasm for preserving our nation's wildlife is always with me. 
   While in Alaska I also visited a number of native communities along the North Slope and spoke to the inhabitants about their life in this unique environment, one that they depend on for both their cultural identity and their survival. I understand the needs these people have and they must be addressed. 
   As a nation we must continue to protect this vital ecosystem while working to bring good jobs, education, and health care to these native communities. Our nation's dependence on oil and its byproducts cannot overshadow the importance of keeping ANWR free from the traditional impacts of oil drilling and exploration. Drilling and exploration in this gentle Arctic wilderness could have a lasting impact that would forever damage the environment of this region. 
   I applaud Senator ROTH's commitment to permanent protection for this unique linkage of ecosystems upon which local communities depend, and the American community as a whole should value as a national and natural treasure.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, especially for his leadership on the Budget Committee and for his efforts in 1997 which greatly contributed to the fiscal policy that has led this country from an era of deficits to an era in which we anticipate budget surpluses for the foreseeable future. 
   He has had a challenging job crafting budget resolutions that balance the many real and competing needs of the Nation. He has been a strong advocate for education and an even stronger advocate for funding IDEA. In fact, last year, I joined him in calling for an increase in education funding of $40 billion over five years. Regrettably our colleagues on the House Budget Committee did not share this commitment. 
   This year he has, once again, taken up the challenge of balancing the competing needs. The budget resolution that he has brought before us is a product of difficult negotiations between competing viewpoints. 
   Because of my deep respect for him, I do not come to the floor with an amendment lightly. I come to the floor with an amendment only because of my conviction that there is a Federal obligation that must now be met in full. 
   This amendment, which I will offer tomorrow, has been cosponsored by Senators DODD, STEVENS, KENNEDY, COLLINS, FEINGOLD, SNOWE, CHAFEE, HARKIN, LEAHY, KOHL, and MIKULSKI, among others. 
   I will begin my remarks with a question to which I will time and time again return. In 1974 we made a commitment to fully fund IDEA. If 25 years later we cannot meet this commitment in an era of unprecedented economic prosperity and budgetary surpluses, when do we plan to keep this pledge. 
   The American people have a right to ask us--If not now, then when? 
   In the early years, when we were running large budget deficits, it was understandable that we couldn't meet those commitments. 
   During those same years this body, by almost unanimous votes, voted--99 Members sometimes--that ``when feasible'' we would fully fund our commitment to our States and our school districts. That time has come. We now have large surpluses with more than enough resources to meet our commitment now and well into the future. 
   I have behind me a chart which compares the funding levels in my amendment with the funding levels in this budget resolution and with the levels that will be required to fully fund IDEA. This shows where full funding is.  This shows the bipartisan amendment I will be offering and how it will take us to full funding. And this is where we will be if we do nothing but live within this budget that is before us. Make no mistake. The budget resolution before us does not fully fund IDEA. Despite the repeated pledges we have made to fully fund IDEA, this budget resolution sends a clear message that this body has no intention of fulfilling this commitment anytime in the next five years. 
   I was one of the few, now in this body, that were present at the time that P.L. 94-142, The Education of all Handicapped Act was passed. As a freshman Member of Congress, I was proud to sponsor that legislation and to be named as a member of the House and Senate conference committee along with then Vermont Senator Bob Stafford. 
   At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate all children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students were denied access to a public education. Passage of the Education of All Handicapped Act offered financial incentives to states to fulfill this existing obligation. Recognizing that the costs associated with educating these children was more than many school districts could bear alone, we pledged to pay 40% of the costs of educating these students. 
   We pledged to pay 40% of these costs but we never have. We 
   have continuously claimed that we couldn't afford to. We started in 1976 with 12.5%. Then we slipped to 6%. Those were tough budget deficit times. Lately we have come up to 13 percent--still less than 1/3 of our pledge. 
   Today, however, instead of making good on our promise now, those who object to my amendment cry, that would be mandatory spending--that's bad. How can it be bad policy to fund this vital program that we have guaranteed to fully fund--over and over again? It is now feasible. It is now painlessly possible and it must be done. 
   We must pay our share of educating children with disabilities. No more excuses. The time is now. 
   I know that there is some disagreement about whether or not a commitment was made. I want to tell you as someone that was there at the time that we made a pledge to fully fund this program. 
   The time is now. 
   I didn't have to ask my constituents in Vermont whether the Federal government made a commitment. I will show you what I got when I was home. This is a petition from every school district in the State of Vermont that says: Do what you promised to do; fund IDEA; fund special education. The chart behind me shows you what those petitions look like. 
   Vermonters know that we made that commitment. Passing this amendment will do more to help our school districts meet their obligation to improve education in this country than nearly anything else we can do. Our amendment will triple what they presently receive. We promised. We should deliver it. The time to make good on this promise is now. 
   Now some of you may think that because you were not here in 1975 that you were not party to a pledge to fully fund IDEA. 
   In 1997 Congress once again took up this landmark legislation. This is a complex bill that has profound impact on classrooms across the Nation. With the strong leadership of Senator LOTT, Senator FRIST, Senator GREGG, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DODD, Senator HARKIN, Senator COLLINS and others on my Committee, we passed the first reauthorization of IDEA in 22 years. It is an accomplishment that we are all very proud of. 
   At that time, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay 40% of the costs of educating these children. We made this pledge to families, to school boards, and to the Governors of our States. Over the past three years, with the leadership of my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator GREGG, we have made some progress. 
   But as he has pointed out several times over the past year, we are only supporting 13 percent of these costs. In 1975, we made a pledge which we did not keep. In 1997 we made that same pledge once again when we reauthorized IDEA. 
   I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle; If not now, then When? 
   In the 105th Congress we felt it important to reaffirm our commitment to full funding for IDEA. We added language to the FY 1999 Budget that stated that IDEA should be fully funded as soon as feasible. This language was adopted unanimously by the Senate. At that time, we still faced budget deficits and it was argued that full funding was not feasible. Today, however, in an era of unprecedented economic prosperity and with budget surpluses projected far into the future, full funding is within our grasp. 
   If not now, then when? 
   In the 106th Congress we continued to press for full funding for IDEA. The FY 2000 budget resolution made room for about a $500,000,000 increase in funding for IDEA. Once again, the Senate adopted language that I advocated with Senator GREGG calling for full funding of IDEA as soon as feasible. The House of Representatives adopted a bipartisan free standing resolution that called for full funding. 
   The budget resolution that is before us assumes that funding for IDEA will increase by $1 billion in FY 2001 and $2.5 billion in 
   FY 2002. If there is time remaining, I will take time later on to discuss my concerns about whether these assumptions require cuts in other programs that we will not have the will to make at the end of the day. What is very clear, however, is that this budget resolution does not claim to fulfill our obligation to fully fund IDEA. The budget resolution assumes that the Federal government will never fund more than about 20% of the costs of educating disabled students. One half of what we have promised over and over again. 
   If our amendment fails, adoption of this budget resolution will state clearly to the Nation that this Congress does not intend to fulfill its commitment any time in the next five years. 
   Our amendment is simple. It provides a path by which we will achieve full funding for IDEA in fiscal year 2005. It sends a clear message to the Nation that we, as a body, make good on the commitments we make. 
   I want to tell you that I am tired of being party to promises that this body hasn't kept. The time is now. 
   I urge you to ask your people back in your state. Ask parents, teachers, and education administrators. Ask your governors. ``What would you prefer--the possibility of a future tax cut, or fully funding IDEA so you can have more money for education, and pay less property taxes?'' 
   Fulfill the pledge that you made to your people. I tell you that if you want a hero's welcome, you will vote in favor of this. If it wins, let me tell you that they will be out on the streets marching to meet you when you come home. If you do not, I wouldn't want to go home. 
   Tomorrow morning I will have a chance to drive this point home once again. Tonight I want to close by thanking my cosponsors for their stalwart commitment to fully funding IDEA. Senator STEVENS, Chairman of the Appropriations, has been a strong advocate for IDEA. Senator FEINGOLD has worked closely with me on this amendment and has been instrumental to getting us to the place we are today. Senator COLLINS has worked long and hard to persuade members of this body that we should fully fund IDEA. I also want to thank Senators DODD and KENNEDY and HARKIN with whom I have worked for many many years to improve educational opportunities for disabled students. Similarly, I am grateful for the efforts of Senator SNOWE and Senator CHAFEE. I feel confident that with their efforts, our amendment will prevail. 
   Thank you.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there is strong bipartisan support for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). To date, 45 Senators have signed a letter in support of $1.4 billion in regular funding, and $300 million in emergency funding, for LIHEAP during Fiscal Year 2001. 
   I, along with my colleagues from the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, will offer this Sense of the Senate to demonstrate the broad support for increased LIHEAP funding. The amendment expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to increasing LIHEAP regular funding from the current level of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. 
   In my home State of Vermont, this past winter brought temperatures of fifteen below zero; and home heating oil prices soared to $2 a gallon. Approximately 11,400 Vermont families received benefits, which averaged $310 in regular funding for the entire season. Emergency funding contributed an additional $50-$135 depending on the fuel source. These numbers reveal the frugalness with which this program now has to operate. 
   I am concerned that emergency LIHEAP funding is being used to make up for regular appropriations funding shortfalls. During the first four and half months of FY2000, all available emergency LIHEAP funding ($300 million) was released. There are requests for additional emergency funding. This situation demonstrates the need to increase regular funding to at least the sum of last year's regular and emergency funding amounts. 
   There is no doubt that emergency funding was critical during this past winter's severe weather conditions and volatile fuel prices. However, LIHEAP funding is most effective when states have it in the form of regular funding, allowing proper advance budgeting and providing funding assistance to low income households before a crisis situation. 
   In addition, it is critical that we maintain the integrity of the LIHEAP program through the regular funding cycle. The decision was made last year to consider the program an additional non-routine expense. I am concerned that this designation threatens the foundation of the program. This amendment seeks to return LIHEAP to its regular funding structure. 
   LIHEAP is an effective tool for maintaining the basic needs of low-income households. Nevertheless, stagnant funding has resulted in a growing eligible population not receiving benefits  due to lack of funding. The safety net for our low-income households is getting ever smaller and ever thinner. 
   The statistics demonstrate the need for LIHEAP best. More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have annual incomes of less than $8,000, approximately one-half have annual incomes below $6,000. It has been estimated that low-income households typically spend four times what middle-income households spend on utility services. Middle-income households spend about four percent of their income for energy purposes, whereas low-income households spend between 14% and 16%, and in many instances up to 25% for utility costs. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to address the funding needs of this important program. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to join in introducing the Home Health Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This important bill has been crafted to protect the Medicare home health services that our seniors depend upon. I want to recognize the leadership of Senators COLLINS, BOND, BAUCUS, REED, and the many others who are original cosponsors of this effort to protect access to home health services. 
   My own state of Vermont is a model for providing high-quality, comprehensive care with a low price tag. For most of the 1990's, the average Medicare expenditure for home health care in Vermont has been the lowest in the nation. Vermont's home care system was designed to efficiently meet the needs of frail and elderly citizens in our largely rural state, but it, like home care across the country, has been put under tremendous pressure. 
   Since the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and imposition of the interim payment system (IPS), the Medicare home health benefit has been seriously eroded. The BBA failed to recognize how the new home health reimbursement would affect small, rural home health care providers. The IPS has caused such significant cash flow problems, that many agencies are struggling to make meet their payroll needs. Now, because of the BBA, agencies are facing the prospect of 15 % cut in Medicare funding in October of 2001. With providers already struggling to survive, any further cuts could spell disaster for low-cost, efficient providers, non-profit agencies, and patients. 
   That is why we are introducing the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to eliminate the 15% reduction. The original budget target for home health expenditures from the BBA has already been far exceeded. The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the total home health cuts from BBA will total $69 billion in five years. That's more than four times what was originally estimated when BBA was passed. 
   The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 contained a provision requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress in 2001 on whether the 15% reduction is still considered necessary. I think the answer is becoming more and more clear. We don't need it, and the Home Health Payment Fairness Act is designed to stop it. 
   Adequate home health care services cannot survive any further reductions. Seniors depend on the home health benefit offered by the Medicare program, and we must make sure it will be there for them. Once again, I want to thank all the cosponsors for giving this legislation such broad, bipartisan support. Our seniors are depending on that kind of support more than ever before.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. 
   Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues today in introducing the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources and Emergency Act Amendments of 2000; a measure that will reauthorize a national program of providing primary health care services for people living with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to commend Senators HATCH and KENNEDY for the leadership they have provided since the inauguration of the legislation establishing the Ryan White programs over a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator FRIST whose medical expertise played a critical role in key provisions of the bill and continues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts on the range of health issues that come before the Senate. Finally, I want to acknowledge Senator ENZI's recognition of the growing burden that AIDS and HIV is having on rural communities throughout the country and the need to address those gaps in services. 
   Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. When I looked back to the last time the Ryan White CARE Act was reauthorized in 1996, I was heartened to see that the measure had garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final passage. I urge my colleagues to examine this bill we are introducing today and to join me in working toward its passage. 
   With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the Ryan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support services to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II have provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by this disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in providing healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White program dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting this epidemic. 
   Fortunately, we have experienced significant success over the last decade, and especially over the last five years. The General Accounting Office recently released a report that found that CARE Act funds are reaching the infected groups that have generally been found to be underserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, and ethnic minorities. In fact, these groups form a majority of CARE Act clients and are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions than their representation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found that CARE Act funds support a wide array of primary care and support services, including the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for people with HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and deaths. 
   Mr. President, there have also been successes in the reduction of HIV/AIDS among women, infants and children. During the last reauthorization, Congressman COBURN and our colleague, Senator FRIST, focused our attention on the needs of women living with HIV/AIDS and the problems associated with perinatal transmission of HIV. Since then, the CARE Act has helped to dramatically reduce mother-to-child transmission through more effective outreach, counseling, and voluntary 
   testing of mothers at risk for HIV infection. Between 1993 and 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases declined 74% in the U.S. In this bill, I have continued to support efforts to reach women in need of care for their HIV disease and have included provisions to ensure that women, infants and children receive resources in accordance with the prevalence of the infection among them. 
   Another key success has been the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. New therapies and improved systems of care have led to impressive reductions in the AIDS death rate and the number of new AIDS cases. From 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54% while new AIDS cases have been reduced by 27%. However, these treatments are very expensive, do not provide a cure, and do not work for everyone. 
   Much has occurred to change the course of the AIDS epidemic since the last reauthorization. A whole new class of therapeutic drugs called anti-retrovirals have been developed and people are living longer and the rate of increase of the number of new AIDS cases has begun to level off. AIDS, HIV, the people it infects and families that it has affected are not in the news today as often as they have been in the past. But for too many of us, this lack of bad news has created a false sense of complacency. The epidemic of HIV continues to grow, to infect whole new groups of people, and to expand both within our urban areas and beyond to our rural communities. 
   While the rate of decline in new AIDS cases and AIDS deaths is leveling off, HIV infection rates continue to rise in many areas; becoming increasingly prevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; and also among women, youth, and minority communities. Local and state healthcare systems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our success in treating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. Unfortunately, rural and underserved urban areas are often unable to address the complex medical and support services needs of people with HIV infection. 
   The bill being introduced today was developed on a bipartisan basis, working with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and elected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought input to ensure that we addressed the most important  problems facing communities of people with HIV infection. Earlier this month, I held a hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to learn whether the program has been successful and whether it needed to be changed. We received testimony from Ryan White's mother, Jeanne White, from Surgeon General David Satcher, from a person living with AIDS, as well as state and local officials familiar with the importance of this program. I especially want to commend Dr. Chris Grace of Vermont who testified as to the particular challenges of providing care to people living with HIV/AIDS in rural, and sometimes remote, parts of the country. It was clear from our witnesses' statements that, despite the successes, challenges remain. 
   To address these challenges, we have developed a bill that will improve access to care in underserved urban and rural areas. My bill will double the minimum base funding available to states through the CARE Act to assist them in developing systems of care for people struggling with HIV and AIDS. The bill also includes a new supplemental state grant that will target assistance to rural and underserved areas to help them address the increasing number of people with HIV/AIDS living outside of urban areas that receive assistance under Title I of the Act. Furthermore, these areas will be given preference for direct care grants and we have strengthened the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to supplement those states struggling to provide lifesaving drugs to their HIV/AIDS patients. 
   We have not changed the unique flexibility of CARE Act programs; it remains primarily a system of grants to State and local jurisdictions. States and EMAs will still decide how to best prioritize and address the healthcare needs of their HIV-positive citizens. 
   Today, there are few people who can say they have not been touched by this epidemic. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit with Jeanne White. We talked about the impact of this disease; about the loved ones it has taken, and the damage to the lives of those it has left behind--about the infected, and about the affected. We talked about her son Ryan, and about my good friend David Curtis of Burlington, Vermont, who testified before my committee in 1995, but who passed away just last year. As an advocate of the program and as a person living with AIDS, David helped me to understand the terrible impact of this disease. Ryan White and David and countless others, worked long and hard to ensure that all people affected by AIDS could receive both the care and compassion they deserve. 
   The AIDS epidemic, despite our success in developing treatments and providing systems of care, is still ravaging communities in this country. This program remains as vital to the public health of this nation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. As the AIDS epidemic reaches into rural areas and into underserved urban communities across the country, this legislation being introduced today will allow us to adapt our care systems to meet the most urgent needs in the communities hardest hit by the epidemic. 
   I intend to see this bill become law this year so that the people struggling to overcome the challenges of HIV and AIDS continue to benefit from high quality medical care and access to lifesaving drugs. We have made incredible progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and I want to be sure that every person in America that needs our assistance, benefits from our tremendous advances.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in introducing the Health Coverage, Access, Relief and Equity Act or Health CARE Act. This legislation will provide low-income Americans with a refundable tax credit for the purchase of health insurance coverage. This effort marks the first major bipartisan, bicameral, market-based initiative on behalf of the uninsured since 1994. 
   I believe the issue of access to health coverage for the uninsured must be a top national priority. The uninsured often go without needed health care or face unaffordable medical bills. Insurance coverage guarantees providers reimbursement for their services, and it helps contain costs by encouraging more appropriate use of the health care system. 
   Unfortunately, the main source of coverage--employer-based insurance--is simply not available to a significant number of working Americans and their families. High health care cost increases have caused more people to become uninsured. 
   New Census Bureau data indicate that there are now 44 million Americans with no health coverage, an increase of one million from last year. This number is unacceptable for a prosperous nation with a strong economy. 
   A new poll indicates that our bill is consistent with the main health care concern of average voters. When asked what they think is the most important problem about our health care system that the government should address, the top choice--selected by 29 percent of those sampled--was universal coverage.  
   I believe the legislation we're introducing today can provide the necessary foundation for achieving the goal of expanded health coverage. The Health CARE tax credit is targeted to those who are most in need of help, due to their lack of income, access to subsidized employment-based coverage, and ineligibility for public programs. 
   About one-half of the full-time working poor were uninsured last year. Many of these individuals work for small firms. In my own state of Vermont, only 27 percent of workers in firms employing fewer than 10 people are offered health insurance. 
   These uninsured working Americans have one thing in common: they are low wage workers--with nearly 70 percent making less than two times the minimum wage. Without additional resources, health insurance coverage is either beyond their reach or only purchased by giving up other basic necessities of life. 
   The Health CARE Act will provide a refundable tax credit to help low and moderate-income individuals and families purchase health insurance. 
   The legislation will provide a refundable tax credit of $1,000 for the purchase of individual coverage to those with adjusted gross incomes of up to $35,000 and it will provide a $2,000 credit for the purchase of family coverage for those with AGI of up to $55,000. 
   The initial estimates show that this proposal will help almost 9 million Americans. It will provide health coverage for 3.2 million Americans who are presently uninsured and give needed financial relief to another 5.5 million low-income Americans who are using their scarce dollars to buy individual health insurance policies. 
   Realizing that insurance coverage is not the single answer for our nation's health access problems, we are also developing additional components to the Health CARE Act which will focus on improving access to health care services and safety net providers, such as community health centers and rural health clinics. 
   We must do whatever we can to ensure that the Safety Net already in place becomes stronger and more reliable. Just last week, the Subcommittee on Public Health held a hearing on three of our nation's safety provider programs--the Consolidated Health Centers program, the National Health Service Corps, and the Community Access program. 
   I look forward to working with Senator FRIST on shoring up the Safety Net, and together we plan to introduce an additional component to the CARE Act on Safety Net providers that will become part of the larger health CARE Package. 
   Our goal for this legislation is to maximize health coverage, tax equity, and cost efficiency, and we believe it should be included as an important element in any tax package that Congress enacts this year. 
   The Health CARE Act will increase the number of Americans who have health insurance coverage by filling key gaps in the current system and supporting a system of health care financial and delivery that complements the employment-based system.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to introduce the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. Having worked with colleagues from both sides of the aisle and the Department of Labor, I am extremely proud of this collaborative effort which has resulted in this legislation which will encourage employers to provide equity ownership opportunities to their hourly employees. 
   In the last 10 years, we have witnessed tremendous change in the structure of our Nation's economy in large part due to the birth of the internet and e-commerce. The vitality of our economy is a tribute to the creative and entrepreneurial genius of thousands of individual business people and the indispensable contribution of the American workforce. 
   As legislators during this exciting time, we are challenged to maintain an environment that will foster the continued growth of our economy. We must work to ensure that our laws are in sync with the changing environment. However, many of the laws and policies governing our workplace have fallen out of sync with the information age and there has been particular resistance to changing our labor laws. As Chairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over workplace issues, I believe it is time to examine and modify these laws to meet the rapidly involving needs of the American workforce. 
   The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, was enacted in the late 1930s, to establish basic standards for wages and overtime pay. While the principles behind the FLSA have not changed, its rigid provisions make it difficult for employers to accommodate the needs of today's workforce. Most recently, we discovered that the FLSA actually operates to deter employers from offering stock option programs to hourly employees. 
   While stock option programs are most prevalent in the high tech industry, increasingly employers across the whole spectrum of American industry have begun to offer stock option programs to all of their employees. Broad-based stock option programs prove valuable to both employers and employees. For employers, stock options programs have become a key tool for employee recruitment, motivation and retention. Employees seek out companies offering these programs because they enable workers to become owners and reap the benefits of their company's growth. 
   When I heard about the FLSA's application to stock options, I became very concerned about its impact on our workforce. I was pleased to discover that Senators' MCCONNELL, DODD, and ENZI shared similar concerns and that the Department of Labor also recognized that we had a problem on our hands that would require a legislative solution. Together we have crafted the Worker Economic Opportunity Act which will create a new exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act for stock options, stock appreciation rights and employee stock purchase plans.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning and other acts of desecration. 
   As a veteran of 30 years in the United States Navy and United States Naval Reserve, I know the pride members of the Armed Forces have in seeing the United States flag wherever they may be in the world. I share the great respect most Vermonters and Americans have for this symbol. 
   I personally abhor the notion that anyone would choose to desecrate or burn the flag as a form of self-expression. Members of the Armed Services place their lives at risk to defend the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, including the First Amendment freedom of speech. It is disrespectful of these past and present sacrifices to desecrate this symbol. 
   It seems highly ironic to me that an individual would desecrate the symbol of the country that provides freedoms such as the first amendment freedom of speech. However, in my opinion the first amendment means nothing if it is not strong enough to protect the rights of those who express unpopular ideas or choose a distasteful means of this expression. 
   I have given this issue a great deal of thought. I must continue to oppose this amendment since I do not think that a valid constitutional amendment, one that does not infringe on the first amendment, can be crafted. The first amendment right of freedom of speech is not an absolute right though as we have in the past recognized the legitimacy of some limits on free speech. 
   I do not think, however, that we should open the Bill of Rights to amendment for the first time in our history unless our basic values as a nation are seriously threatened. In this case, in recent years there have not been a significant number of incidents of this misbehavior. 
   In my view, a few flag desecrations or burnings around the Nation by media-seeking malcontents does not meet this high standard and I therefore cannot support the adoption of this amendment.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the Homebound Clarification Act of 2000. This important bill has been crafted to protect Medicare beneficiaries from a growing problem that is impeding access to vital home care services. I want to recognize my cosponsors, Senator REED of Rhode Island and Senator LEAHY, for their continued effort and dedication to protecting access to home health care. 
   Federally funded home health care is an often quiet but invaluable part of life for America's seniors. Medical treatment can often mean being subjected to a strange and unfamiliar environment. For our nation's elderly, who may have special needs, this inconvenience can be more severe and detrimental to successful recovery. Home health care means that people recovering from surgery can go home sooner--it means that someone recovering from an accident can get physical therapy in their home, it means our seniors can stay at home, and out of nursing homes. 
   The sooner you can return patients to their homes, the sooner they can recover. The familiar environment of the home, family, and friends is more nurturing to recovering patients than the often stressful and unfamiliar surroundings of a hospital. Home health is also a great avenue for education. It empowers families to assist in the care of their loved ones. It is smart policy from human and financial standpoints. 
   But there are some seniors who are being denied access to this smart policy. An individual must be considered ``homebound'' to qualify for Medicare reimbursement for home health. Though an individual is not required to be bed-ridden, the condition of the individual should include ``a normal inability to leave the home.'' Under the current definition, an individual is ``homebound'' if ``leaving the home requires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual, and that absences of the individual from home are infrequent and of short duration, or are attributable to the need to receive medical treatment.'' The definition allows for ``infrequent'' or ``short duration,'' recognizing that short excursions may be a part of a successful recovery process, but leaves it up to fiscal intermediaries to interpret exactly what number is frequent and how short an absence must be. Interpretation of this definition has varied widely. 
   Sadly, there is a ready supply of disturbing examples of the overzealous and arbitrary interpretation of the definition. Many seniors have found themselves virtual prisoners in their homes, threatened with loss of coverage if they attend adult day care, weekly religious services, or even visit family members in the hospital. This makes no sense because all of these activities are steps on the road to successful and healthy recovery. Often, health professionals want patients to get outside for fresh air or exercise, as part of their care plan. This helps fight off depression. 
   Seniors deserve a more consistent standard to depend upon, rather than a completely arbitrary number of absences from the home. In April 1999, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala sent a report to Congress on the homebound definition. The report identifies the wide variety in interpretation of the definition and the absurdity of some coverage determinations that follow. While the Administration unfortunately stopped short of taking action themselves, Shalala did propose that a clarification of the definition is needed to improve uniformity of determination. 
   The Homebound Clarification Act states that eligibility of an individual depends on the condition of the patient, how ``taxing'' it is for the patient to leave home. It strikes the clause that states: ``that absences of the individual from home are infrequent or of relatively short duration, or are attributable to the need to receive medical treatment.'' This is consistent with the intent of Congress and the Administration. This will not open the door to wider coverage of home health, but rather protect coverage for those who need it. 
   We ask that seniors put their trust in the Medicare program. We are responsible for making sure that the Medicare program lives up to its promise and that home health will be available to those who need it. Once again, I would like to thank my cosponsors, Senators REED and LEAHY for their work. We look forward to working with the rest of Congress to turn this legislation into law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Hunger in this time of prosperity should not be tolerated by people of any party affiliation. The American people overwhelmingly support hunger relief efforts, and many of them volunteer their time and resources to help in their communities. I'm encouraged that the groundwork for modest hunger relief has been laid entirely in a bipartisan spirit, and should continue this way through passage of legislation that the experts on the Agriculture Committee have perfected. I join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in inviting the Budget Committee to preserve this spirit as it reserves $2.5 billion over five years for hunger relief legislation. This will produce a significant bipartisan, moderate accomplishment this session for people in obvious need.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues, Senators GRASSLEY, KENNEDY and HARKIN in introducing the Family Opportunity Act of 2000. We are taking the right step, the logical step, and a much needed step. 
   The last bill signed into law in the 20th Century was the Work Incentives Improvement Act. Through it, we extended health care coverage to adults with disabilities who work, by allowing them to buy-in to Medicaid coverage regardless of their income. Tomorrow, we set out to help children with disabilities by introducing the Family Opportunity Act. This legislation will create a similar Medicaid buy-in option for families of children with disabilities. 
   When a child is born, it is a time for joy, hope, and dreams. If the child has a serious medical condition that may lead to a significant disability, or if the child is born with a disability, these feelings are often put on hold. Instead, the families of these children must concentrate on some basic facts, facts that may be a matter of life and death. These facts will shape the quality of life that the family can offer the child. The family will have to answer some important questions. First, do they have health insurance? If so, does the insurance cover the cost of the specialized services that their child needs? Families who answer `NO' to these questions are overwhelmed and fearful, and their vision of the future is filled with uncertainty. 
   Every day, children in America are born with severe disabilities that require specialized health care services. Too often, the parents of these children do not have health care coverage or their coverage does not cover the needed services. These families do not have many options. Their child can receive health care coverage only if the family is poor, or if the family gives the child up to the state. We have all heard heart wrenching stories, but none are more traumatic than these. 
   The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 is a solution to this tragic problem. Children without health insurance will now be covered. Those children with  disabilities whose health insurance does not cover the services they need, will also be covered. Children with significant disabilities will no longer be denied the health care coverage they need, regardless of their family's income. Their families will, however, be expected to contribute to the cost of coverage. In addition, these families will have access to assistance from a Family Health Information Center. This service will provide families with information about their options and will help them exercise these options. Their children will receive the care they need and deserve. 
   Data from the Social Security Administration indicates that in December 1999 there were 1,080 Vermont children with disabilities eligible for Medicaid. That means that the families of these children are poor. Some of these families have chosen to keep their income under the prescribed limits in law, so that they can access health care through Medicaid for their child with a disability. These families cannot access health care coverage for their children through the private sector. 
   With the Family Opportunity Act everyone wins. Through Medicaid, children with disabilities will receive the health care services they desperately need. Through the Family Health Information Centers, their families will be provided with the right information at the right time. Families will be able to make key medical decisions that will maximize the quality of life for their children with disabilities. And, the federal and state governments will have a cost-effective program to help children and families in need. 
   The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 will make time for joy, hope, and dreams, for families of children with special needs. This is a good start to the 21st Century.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support elimination of the Social Security earnings test for individuals who have attained Social Security retirement age--currently age 65. Currently, if these retirees work, their Social Security benefits are reduced $1 for every $3 of earnings above $17,000 per year. This is an unfair result for many older Americans who are receiving Social Security benefits after a lifetime of work but who must continue to work to supplement their retirement income. In my own state of Vermont, many people work beyond age 65. They should not have to give up a portion of their hard-earned Social Security benefit because they need to take a job. 
   The earnings test can also be a problem for employers. Older workers are often in demand by employers because of their expertise and an overall tight labor market. The reduction in Social Security benefits can be a barrier to older workers reentering the workforce. 
   The earnings test presents a special problem for small business owners receiving Social Security benefits. Small business owners are subject to both the dollar earnings test and a self-employment test that can involve an extensive audit to establish their level of earnings. Eliminating the earnings test will also eliminate the need for these audits. And removing the incentive for older small business owners to retire could mean continued employment opportunities in their businesses for other older workers. 
   There has been an earnings test for Social Security benefits since the Social Security Act was passed in 1935, during the Great Depression. The earnings test originally was a way to encourage older workers to retire, to free up jobs for younger workers. 
   The earnings test has always been unpopular, especially with those age 65 and older. In response, Congress has changed the earnings test provisions several times over the years--increasing the amount a benefit recipient can earn without a benefit reduction. The earnings limit for those age 65 and older currently is $17,000 and rises to $25,000 in 2001 and to $30,000 beginning in 2002. It provides a higher earnings limit and smaller reduction for older benefit recipients--$1 for each $3 of annual earnings over $17,000 for those age 65-69, compared to $1 for each $2 of earnings over $10,080 for those age 62-64--and lowering the age at which an individual can work without suffering a benefit reduction to age 70 from age 72. It is time now to further lower that age to the Social Security retirement age, so that once a worker reaches that age--currently 65--the worker's Social Security benefit will not be reduced, no matter how much the worker earns. 
   We have before us legislation to eliminate the earnings test for individuals at Social Security retirement age. I have cosponsored Senator ASHCROFT's bill, S. 2074, and we have the House-passed bill, H.R. 5. These bills would free the approximately 800,000 Social Security benefit recipients currently ages 65 through 69 from the current law that reduces, and in some cases eliminates, their Social Security benefits if they work and earn above the earnings test. I urge my colleagues to act quickly to make this legislative change for older working Americans.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators ROCKEFELLER and HUTCHISON in the introduction of the Recognition of Physician Assistants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Act of 2000. This legislation will establish a position of advisor on physician assistants within the office of the Undersecretary of Health for Veterans Affairs. 
   Physician assistant are very valuable members of the VA health care delivery team. But unlike most components of the team, physician assistants have no representative within the VA's Office of the Undersecretary for Health. As the largest employer of physician assistants in the country, the VA will be establishing important precedents as the role of physician assistants evolves over the coming decade. Physician assistants must be part of the discussion and represented at the level where key health care delivery decisions are made. 
   An advisory position would be established by this legislation to inform the Undersecretary for Health on such matters as optimal utilization of physician assistants by the VA, the advisability of establishing clinical privileges and practice areas, the development of appropriate educational requirements and certification criteria, and other matters. 
   This representation is critically important at this time. As the VA moves toward Medicare Subvention and the requisite billing expertise, questions will continually arise surrounding the role of physician assistants. There must be consistent input on these matters directly from physician assistants. 
   I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this legislation and I hope it is quickly enacted into law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation that is being introduced by my friend and colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND. As Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have been a long-standing supporter of legislation to make adoption easier. This bill does exactly that by requiring federal agencies to reimburse their employees up to $2,000 for all qualified expenses associated with the adoption of a child. Both this bill and its House companion, introduced by Representatives TOM BLILEY and JAMES OBERSTAR last August, have gathered the support of a bipartisan group of legislators and numerous groups in the adoption community. 
   Currently, many private sector businesses provide financial assistance to employees who wish to adopt a child. These businesses understand that adoption can be a very time-consuming, exhausting, and expensive process for parents. Relieving the financial burden on their employees will not only help encourage adoption, but also produce a happier and more productive work force. 
   The legislation being introduced today provides a benefit for our own hard-working federal employees. In the process, it brings the federal government up to par with those private-sector businesses that already provide financial assistance to employees adopting a child. Even further, it establishes a leadership role for the federal government in this area. This hopefully will encourage even more businesses to assist their employees financially should they wish to adopt a child. 
   I am proud to stand today with several of my colleagues as co-sponsors of the Federal Employees Adoption Assistance Act of 2000. I hope the Senate will proceed quickly to pass this legislation. It makes sense, both for the approximately 110,000 children currently awaiting adoption in the United States, and for those federal employees who are willing and able to provide a home for them.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator GRAHAM today in introducing the Medicare Wellness Act of 2000. Our nation's rapidly growing senior population and the ongoing search for cost-effective health care have led to the development of this important bipartisan legislation. The goal of the Medicare Wellness Act is to increase access to preventive health services, improve the quality of life for America's seniors, and increase the cost-effectiveness of the Medicare program. 
   Congress created the Medicare program in 1965 to provide health insurance for Americans age 65 and over. From the outset, the program has focused on coverage for hospital services needed for an unexpected or intensive illness. In recent years, however, a great escalation in program expenditures and an increase in knowledge about the value of preventive care have forced policy makers to re-evaluate the current Medicare benefit package. 
   The Medicare Wellness Act adds to the Medicare program those benefits recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. These include: screening for hypertension, counseling for tobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone replacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, cholesterol screening, expanded screening and counseling for osteoporosis, and nutrition therapy counseling. These services address the most prominent risk facing Medicare beneficiaries. 
   In 1997, Congress added several new preventive benefits to the Medicare program through the Balanced Budget Act. These benefits included annual mammography, diabetes self-management, prostate cancer screening, pelvic examinations, and colorectal cancer screening. Congress's next logical step is to incorporate the nine new screening and counseling benefits in the Medicare Wellness Act. If these symptoms are addressed regularly, beneficiaries will have a head start on fighting the conditions they lead to, such as diabetes, lung cancer, heart disease, blindness, osteoporosis, and many others. 
   Research suggests that insurance coverage encourages the use of preventive and other health care services. The Medicare Wellness Act also eliminates the cost-sharing requirement for new and current preventive benefits in the program. Because screening services are directed at people without symptoms, this will further encourage the use of services by reducing the cost barrier to care. Increased use of screening services will mean that problems will be caught earlier, which will permit more successful treatment. This will save the Medicare program money because it is cheaper to screen for an illness and treat its early diagnosis than to pay for drastic hospital procedures at a later date. 
   However, financial access is not the only barrier to the use of preventive care services. Other barriers include low levels of education of information for beneficiaries. That is why the Medicare Wellness Act instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Care Financing Administration to establish a Risk Appraisal and Education Program within Medicare. This program will target both current beneficiaries and individuals with high risk factors below the age of 65. Outreach to 
   these groups will offer questions regarding major behaviorial risk factors, including the lack of proper nutrition, the use of alcohol, the lack of regular exercise, the use of tobacco, and depression. State of the art software, case managers, and nurse hotlines will then identify what conditions beneficiaries are at risk for, based on their individual responses to the questions, then refer them to preventive screening services in their area and inform them of actions they can take to lead a healthier life. 
   The Medicare Wellness Act also establishes the Healthy Seniors Promotion Program. This program will bring together all the agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that address the medical, social and behavorial issues affecting the elderly to increase knowledge about and utilization of prevention services among the elderly, and develop better ways to prevent or delay the onset of age-related disease or disability. 
   Mr. President, now is the time for Medicare to catch up with current health science. We need a Medicare program that will serve the health care needs of America's seniors by utilizing up-to-date knowledge of healthy aging. Effective health care must address the whole health of an individual. A lifestyle that includes proper exercise and  nutrition, and access to regular disease screening ensures attention to the whole individual, not just a solitary body part. It is time we reaffirm our commitment to provide our nation's seniors with quality health care. 
   It is my hope that my colleagues in Congress will examine this legislation and realize the inadequately of the current package of preventive benefits in the Medicare program. We have the opportunity to transform Medicare from an out-dated sickness program to a modern wellness program. I want to thank Senator BOB GRAHAM and all the other cosponsors of the Medicare Wellness Act who are supporting this bold step towards successful Medicare reform.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Summer Fill and Fuel Budgeting Act of 2000. 
   This winter's fuel crisis will be etched on the memories of New Englanders for many years to come. Price spikes and low inventories have hit Vermonters hard. Schools closed down, oil dealers were driven out of business, and many low income families were forced to choose between heating their homes and purchasing necessary food and prescription medications. The region's Senators have focused with a single-mindedness on the seriousness of the situation and the dire need to ensure that it is never repeated. 
   There have been many letters written, emergency funds released, meetings held, and legislative initiatives discussed. Today after weeks of diligent research and careful analysis, I am introducing the Summer Fill and Fuel Budgeting Act of 2000. Senators JOE LIEBERMAN, JOHN KERRY, TED KENNEDY, and PATRICK LEAHY are joining me as original co-sponsors. 
   The legislation is a critical long term education initiative. Its purpose is to educate our constituents about the benefits of filling their propane, kerosene and heating oil tanks in the summer and entering into annual fuel budget contracts. The legislation authorizes $25 million for Fiscal Year 2001, and such sums in each fiscal year thereafter, for the states to use to develop education and outreach programs to encourage consumers to fill their fuel storage facilities during the summer months. It also promotes the use of budget plans, price cap arrangements, fixed-price contracts and other advantageous financial arrangements to help avoid severe seasonal price increases for and supply shortages of propane, kerosene, and heating oil. 
   I believe that we must work with retailers and consumers to implement these types of proactive measures to ensure that our fuel supply, as well as the health and safety of millions of Americans, is not subject to the whims of foreign oil producing countries. I invite other Senators, concerned about the influence that major oil producing countries have on our economy and national security, to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the changes made in the take title provisions. I have discussed it with my Governor, and now I can say that we no longer have an objection to the bill. The Governor hopes it passes with the changes that were made. So I wanted to let everybody know that I am in favor of the bill, and I appreciate the changes that were made. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to reduce the marriage penalty built into the Earned Income Tax Credit--the EITC. It appears that Congress may well act to address the marriage penalty this year. Eliminating the marriage penalty is a worthwhile goal. A marriage license shouldn't come with a higher tax bill from Uncle Sam. As we consider this issue, however, I want to make sure that low-income taxpayers are not left out of the debate. In terms of dollars, the EITC marriage penalty may be relatively small, but for workers trying to raise children on low wages it represents a significant loss of income, and it may well deter couples from marrying. 
   Though our nation's economy continues to thrive, many Americans still struggle to make ends meet. Working families across the nation hover above the poverty level, striving to stay off welfare and yearning to provide a decent life for their children. We can and must do more to help these families. And we can do it through the tax code in a manner that is proven and fair, using the earned income tax credit. The EITC is a refundable tax credit specifically targeted to help low-income workers and their families. In my state of Vermont, with soaring housing costs and spiking fuel costs, the EITC has proven effective in supplementing the income of working families. 
   By some estimates, the EITC has moved more than two million children out of poverty. One recent report calls it the most effective safety net program for children in working poor families. In 1999, the EITC provided low-income working families with two children a subsidy of roughly 40 cents for every dollar of income. But after income reaches a certain point, the EITC is gradually phased out. 
   Unfortunately, a marriage penalty is built into the EITC. This marriage penalty exists because a married couple's combined earnings put them at a higher point in the EITC phase-out range than where one or both of them would have been if they had remained single. If, for example, one minimum wage earner marries another minimum wage earner with two children, the couple's EITC would be over $1,300 less than the combined EITC they would have received if they hadn't gotten married. For working families that subsist on the minimum wage, this is a significant loss--more than half of their combined wages for a month. 
   To reduce the EITC marriage penalty, the bill I'm introducing will extend the point at which the EITC begins to phase out. This is the approach I advocated, and which was subsequently adopted in last year's tax bill. It is also the approach adopted in the bill passed by the Ways and Means Committee. The difference between my bill and these other bills is the amount by which the beginning point of the phase-out range would be extended. The other bills proposed to extend it by $2,000. I propose to extend it by $3,500; this would provide significantly more marriage penalty relief. My back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that my bill would eliminate about half of the marriage penalties built into the EITC. 
   I do not have a cost estimate for this bill. For the Ways and Means marriage penalty bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that a $2,000 extension of the beginning point of the EITC phase-out would cost $11 billion over 10 years. This is a relatively small part of a bill whose overall 10-year cost is $182 billion. 
   Last year, the conferees on the tax bill initially chose not to include help for EITC taxpayers in the marriage penalty provisions. I threatened to vote against the bill, probably depriving it of a majority in the Senate. The conference was reopened, and relief of the EITC marriage penalty was included in the final bill. I think that shows how strongly I feel about this issue. I'm glad that the House has looked out for low-income taxpayers in its marriage penalty bill. Still, I think we can do better.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the federal investment in the area of education technology has been and continues to be critical in ensuring that schools in all of our states not only have technological capacity but are able to effectively integrate technology into the curriculum for the benefit of all children. The federal government has shown extraordinary leadership in this area through the funding it provides through the E-rate, the Technology Innovations Challenge Grant and Literacy Challenge Fund programs, to name a few. Still, making technology integral to and effective in the learning process is not something that can be done by the federal government alone. To be successful, it will require creating strong and committed partnerships of schools, teachers, institutions of higher education, local and state governments and of course the business community. 
   There are many businesses that are leading by doing--creating partnerships for the educational benefit of kids. They are investing time and resources in our nation's schools to help make technology a positive and powerful educational tool. Intel is one such company. 
   The Intel Teach to the Future program brings together expertise and resources from leading high-tech companies to improve technology use in the classroom. This comprehensive teacher development initiative has been designed to address the barriers teachers face in effectively applying computer technology to enhance student learning. In spite of the potential for technology to improve education, only 20% of today's 3.17 million teachers feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. Barriers to success include: lack of access to adequate equipment; lack of training on specific software tools; lack of training on tools to evaluate how, when and where technology should be applied to teach specific subject matter; and finally, lack of an evaluative process that measures success and provides for continuous improvement. Intel has learned from its own and others' experiences and partnered with leaders in the computer industry to deliver a program that can tackle these barriers head-on. 
   The Teach to the Future program provides a flexible, modular curriculum delivered by teachers for teachers. The training incorporates the use of the Internet, web page design and multimedia software. Every participant is guaranteed access in their classrooms to the hardware and software necessary to put their training into practice. The training of a cadre of local master teachers ensures the knowledge and expertise remains within the school district and provides for ongoing support. 
   Key elements of the Teach to the Future program include hands-on, face-to-face learning. The curriculum is based on the award-winning Intel ACE Project, authored by the Institute for Computer Technology. It has been delivered to some 3,200 teachers in nine communities over the last two years in cooperation with Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company. Responses from Intel ACE participants show that 98% of the participants found the training to be valuable; 97% developed new skills and knowledge and 94% felt the training would benefit their students. A follow-up study with teachers who participated in the training in 1998 found that more than 84% felt the use of computers had improved their instruction and more than 80% felt their students' learning was enhanced. I heard a great deal about the program that Intel sponsored in Washington, DC and was excited to learn of what a positive impact it had on students and teachers there. 
   Intel will develop online communities via its web site to support the Regional Training Agencies, Master Teacher and teacher participants. Some of the areas will facilitate administration of the program itself such as registration and evaluation; other services include case studies, a lesson plan database, and chat capability. 
   In its first three years the program will reach 100,000 teachers in the United States. Giving teachers the tools, know-how and confidence to apply technology effectively in the classroom will have a big payoff in improving educational opportunities for our nation's young people. I applaud Intel and its partners as well as all the other businesses for their commitment to education in the 21st century.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I must set the record straight with regard to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Rarely in all my years in Congress have I witnessed such ill-considered comment and media hysteria as has occurred over the Dairy Compact in these last few days. 
   I recognize that my Senate colleagues from the Midwest are, very understandably, raising the dairy issue to a new level of concern and I welcome the opportunity to respond to their call for productive changes in our dairy policy. As for my media friends, I appreciate the heightened scrutiny of our dairy policy, because we in the northeast share a common concern with our Midwestern Senate colleagues over the current state of our nation's dairy policy. 
   To my Senate colleagues from the Midwest: I have worked on the dairy issue for all of my twenty-four years in the Congress. More than most, I appreciate the complexity and difficulty of this issue. There is nothing I would like more than to join with you in common cause to improve our nation's dairy policy. 
   But let us be frank with each other. The key issue that has divided us in all my time here, and which continues to divide us, is your insistence that the Midwest should somehow be seen as the source of our nation's supply of fluid, or beverage, milk. 
   This insistence has been and still remains simply contrary to the overwhelming will of this Congress. And this is not just an issue that divides the northeast and the Midwest; this is an issue that divides the Midwest from the rest of the country. 
   The universal constituencies of every member of Congress, from every region including your own, demand a local supply of fluid milk. This is not a free market issue, not merely an issue of the best interests of dairy farmers. 
   The real issue is the very nature of our basic food supply and so extends way beyond the mere interest of a single constituent group. Regionally and on behalf of the nation as a whole, the Congress simply will not yield to the destruction of our local supplies of fresh, wholesome drinking milk, and the inevitable result of the consumption of reconstituted milk. 
   For now and for the foreseeable future, our nation's dairy policy will be based on the maintenance of local, regional supplies of fluid milk. You must recognize that we cannot compromise on this issue. 
   This fact must and will define our national policy. The Midwest will never be called upon to provide the supply of fluid milk for the rest of the country. 
   And so I call upon my Senate colleagues from the Midwest to look elsewhere than to reformation of the fluid marketplace for a solution to the problems your dairy industry faces. I make this call in the spirit of cooperation and with a positive spirit. 
   To my media friends: I welcome this opportunity to respond to the specifics of the various misstatements and misinformation contained in the most recent descriptions of the Dairy Compact. Before doing so, I would like first to highlight for you a simple and incontrovertible fact about the Dairy Compact: 
   Twenty-five of our fifty states have now passed dairy compact legislation patterned after the original compact language first adopted by the Vermont legislature in 1987. This means that twenty-five legislatures and twenty-five governors (more, if you count the number of governors who have supported the bill over the years) have committed their active support to this unique legislation. 
   With this important fact in the background, I would like to respond to the charges and assertions that have recently been raised against the Dairy Compact. 
   For purposes of this discussion, I will address directly the substance of the editorial that appeared yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. To summarize the editorial, the Dairy Compact is a ``price fixing cartel'' which benefits ``inefficient'' Vermont dairy farmers unfairly at the expense of their more efficient Upper Midwest counterparts. 
   To compound this misery, the Compact unduly burdens milk consumers in the northeast, particularly the most vulnerable ``poor children'', ``to the tune of 20 cents a gallon.'' 
   Now I would like first generally to ask this body: Who in their right mind would support such a clearly wrongheaded policy as so characterized by the Wall Street Journal? Who could support any measure which pits a relatively small number of farmers  against a vastly greater constituency of consumers, and which disadvantages our most vulnerable citizens? 
   Certainly not the twenty-five state legislatures and governors which have adopted Compact legislation. And certainly not the 40 Senators and over 160 House Members who co-sponsored legislation to approve Compact legislation here in the Congress. 
   Certainly not the Compact's bi-partisan supporters in the Congress and around the country, who represent the country's most rural and most urban constituencies. And such an initiative could never have been embraced simultaneously by our nation's most divergent regions--the northeast and the deep south. 
   Just look at the list of co-sponsors here in the Senate. Senator JESSE HELMS joins Senator TED KENNEDY. Senator SCHUMER from New York is a co-sponsor along with Senator THURMOND from South Carolina. Need I say more about the diversity of support for the Compact? 
   And so I call upon the media to look at the Compact with a fresh gaze. If you will do so, I think you will find that the reason for this unusual if not truly unique support for the Compact is really quite simple: The Compact manages to respond simultaneously to all of the divergent interests at play in today's dairy marketplace. 
   The Compact does not just respond to the needs of dairy farmers. Consumers, processors, retailers, as well as farmers, all find their place in the regulatory process created by the Compact. 
   Because the consumer ultimately pays, the consumer controls the decision as to whether the price should be raised. Perhaps most importantly, because the Compact is made up of individual sovereign states, the sovereign right of each state to control its own regulatory fate is ultimately protected by the Compact. 
   In short, the Compact truly promotes the public interest. Let me see if I can further advance the discussion by clearing up at least some of the cloud of confusion which the Journal and others have cast around the Compact. 
   Let's begin with the claim that the Compact is a ``price-fixing cartel''. Along with the Journal, the Washington Post also yesterday referred to the Compact as a ``cartel'' in an editorial. And our supposed ``newspaper of record'', The New York Times, has repeatedly described the Compact as a cartel in its coverage of the Compact. 
   For the benefit of all these erudite commentators whose stock in trade is the precise use of the English language, let's consider the dictionary definition of a cartel. Webster's dictionary defines ``cartel'' as follows

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa, with whom I have worked all these years, was here just a moment ago. I would like to wish him a happy 60th birthday. I am sure all of us would like to join in that, and I will move on now and get to the purpose of being here today. 
   Mr. President, I am thrilled that the Senate will soon send to the President the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This landmark legislation will open doors to jobs across the country for disabled Americans. 
   As we all know, the Federal Government often sets policies with the best of intentions, and the least of common sense. There are lots of examples, but today's policy for disability benefits takes the prize. 
   If you are disabled and don't work, you have access to federally funded health care. If you are disabled and you do work, you lose access to federally funded health care. Does it make any sense to you? No, it does not to me, either. 
   Access to health care is important to everyone, of course, but to severely disabled people it is absolutely vital for the everyday needs of life. And the price tag for this care can be astronomical. 
   Three years ago, this paradox was brought to my attention, and I began the process of trying to figure out how we could solve it. 
   I realized that, unless and until we gave individuals with disabilities access to health care, they would not, could not work to their full potential. That is why I am so proud that we are on the verge of changing the law that will, at last, change the lives of 9.5 million individuals with disabilities who have been waiting, pleading that we take this step. 
   These millions of Americans want and will use the job training and job placement assistance that this legislation authorizes. They will benefit from the advice and guidance that will be available on the complicated work incentives options in Federal law. They will go to work, work longer hours, work more hours, and seek advancement knowing that their health care will be there when they need it. 
   For those who look beyond what this legislation means in human terms, to its monetary applications, I say, you will see results. The taxpayer rolls will expand. Use of Federal and State public assistance programs will decrease. Data on the health care needs and costs of working individuals with severe disabilities will be collected. Private employers and their insurers will have data from which they may calculate risks and craft health care insurance options for employees with disabilities. 
   This conference report represents sound federal policy. Last night our colleagues in the House, on a vote of 418 to 2, endorsed this policy. We must do the same. Let us celebrate and confirm the consensus we have achieved. Individuals with disabilities are waiting to show us how they are ready, willing, and able to join the workforce, support their families, and contribute to their communities and our national economy. 
   The action we are taking is the next logical step in our efforts to ensure that disabled Americans can fully participate in our society. In 1975 we guaranteed each child with a disability a free appropriate education through the precursor to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. In 1978, we prohibited discrimination based on disability in all services, programs, and employment offered by or through the federal government. In 1988, for the first time, we recognized and addressed the need to provide assistive technology to individuals with disabilities. 
   And in 1990, we enacted the most comprehensive civil rights law for individuals with disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   Each of these actions was a building block toward true independence for individuals with disabilities. 
   But the promise of employment rights under the ADA was an empty one for millions of Americans who couldn't afford to take advantage of their rights. Today, we are making good on that promise. 
   I want to again commend the principal cosponsors of this legislation, Senators KENNEDY, ROTH, and MOYNIHAN for their incredible contributions. Five months ago, the four of us joined President Clinton in a room just off the Senate floor to call for enactment of this legislation. 
   I was confident then that the day would soon come, and I am elated that it finally has. It is the end of the session, we are all tired, and some tempers are frayed. But Mr. President, as we conclude our work for the year and return to our states, this is one accomplishment of which we can all be proud.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President I am delighted to stand before you today, to speak about an extremely important piece of legislation. The bill we are sending to the President today, a bill I know he is eager to sign into law, will have a tremendous impact on people with disabilities. In fact, this legislation is the most important piece of legislation for the disability community since the Americans with disabilities Act. 
   My reason for sponsoring this particular piece of legislation is quite simple. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 addresses a fundamental flaw in current law. Today, individuals with disabilities are forced to make a choice . . . an absurd choice. They must choose between working and receiving health care. Under current federal law, if people with disabilities work and earn over $700 per month, they will lose cash payments and health care coverage under Medicaid or Medicare. This is health care coverage that they need. This is health care coverage that they cannot get in the private sector. This is not right. 
   Once enacted, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will allow individuals with disabilities, in states that elect to participate, continuing access to health care when they return to work or remain working. In addition, those individuals who seek it, will have access to job training and job placement assistance from a wider range of providers than is available at this time. Currently, there are 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the country who receive cash payments and health care coverage from the federal government. Approximately 24,000 of these individuals live in my home state, Vermont. Once enacted, the Work Incentives Improvement Act will actually save the federal government money. For example, let's assume that 200 Social Security disability beneficiaries in each state return to work and forgo cash payments. That would be 10,000 individuals out of the 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the country. The annual savings to the Federal Treasury in cash payments for just these 10,000 people would be $133,550,000! Imagine the savings to the Federal Treasury if this number were higher. Clearly, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is fiscally responsible legislation. 
   I began work on this bill 1996. Though it was a long and sometimes difficult task, many hands made light work. Senator KENNEDY, Ranking member on the HELP Committee, joined me in March 1997. Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, Chairman and Ranking Member on the Finance Committee signed on as committed partners in December of 1998. Last January, 35 of our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, joined us in introducing S. 331, the Senate version of this legislation. One week later, in a Finance Committee hearing, we heard compelling testimony 
   from our friend, former Senator Dole, a strong supporter of this legislation. A month later, we marked this legislation out of the Finance Committee with an overwhelming majority in favor of the bill. Finally, on June 15th, with a total of 80 cosponsors, we passed this legislation on the floor of the United States Senate, with a unanimous vote of 99-0. 
   Four months later, over 35 of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, took to the floor of their chamber, and spoke eloquently for their version of this legislation. Later that day, the bill passed the floor of the House with a vote of 412-9. Since then, the Senate and House Conferees have been working diligently in effort to reach common ground. I am very pleased today, that the differences in policy in the two different bills have been resolved and consensus has been reached on a conference agreement. This agreement does not compromise the original intent of the legislation, retaining key provisions from S. 331. 
   From my perspective, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 represents a natural and important progression in federal policy for individuals with disabilities. That is, federal policy increasingly reflects the premise that individuals with disabilities are cherished by their families, valued and respected in their communities, and are an asset and resource to our national economy. Today, most federal policy promotes opportunities for these individuals, regardless of the severity of their disabilities, to contribute to their maximum potential--at home, in school, at work, and in the community. 
   I have been committed to improving the lives of individuals with disabilities throughout my Congressional career. Providing a solid elementary and secondary education for children with disabilities, so that they will be equipped, along with their peers, to benefit from post-secondary and employment opportunities is crucial. When I came to Congress in 1975, Public Law 94-142, the Education for all Handicapped Children Act, now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), was enacted into law. IDEA assures each child with a disability, a free and appropriate public education. I am proud to be one of the original drafters of this legislation which has reshaped what we offer to and expect of children with disabilities in our nation's schools. 
   In addition, I have been committed to providing job training opportunities for individuals with disabilities. In  1978, I played a central role in ensuring access to programs and services offered by the federal government for individuals with disabilities through an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act. I believe that this amendment alone laid the foundation for significant legislation that followed, including the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, now the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, both of which I drafted. Most importantly, this legislation opened the doors for the most comprehensive piece of legislation of all, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This legislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in employment, public services, public accommodations, transportation, and telephone service. 
   These laws have forever changed the social landscape of America. They serve as models for 
   other countries who recognize that their citizens with disabilities are an untapped resource. In our country, individuals with disabilities are seen everywhere, doing everything. Just this past weekend, thousands of physically disabled individuals participated in the New York City Marathon, as they have been doing for years. The expectations that these people set for themselves and the standards we apply to them have increasingly been raised, and now in many circumstances equal those set and applied to other individuals. 
   Unfortunately, one major inequity remains. That is, the loss of health care coverage if an individual on the Social Security disability rolls chooses to work. Individuals with disabilities want to work. They have told me this. In fact, a Harris survey found that 72 percent of Americans with disabilities want to work, but only one-third of them do work. With today's enactment of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, individuals with disabilities will no longer need to worry about losing their health care if they choose to work a forty-hour week, to put in overtime, or to pursue career advancement. Individuals with disabilities are sitting at home right now, waiting for this legislation to become law. Having a job will provide them with a sense of self-worth. Having a job will allow them to contribute to our economy. Having a job will provide them with a living wage, which is not what one has through Social Security. 
   In addition to continuing health care coverage and providing job training opportunities for individuals with disabilities, this legislation offers many other substantial long-term benefits. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will give us access to data regarding the numbers, the health care needs, and the characteristics of individuals with disabilities who work. Furthermore, this legislation will provide the federal government as well as private employers and insurers, the facts upon which to craft appropriate future health care options for working individuals with disabilities. It will allow employers and insurers to factor in the effects of changing health care needs over time for this population. Hopefully, it will even improve the way in which employers operate return-to-work programs. Through increased tracking of data, we will learn the benefits of intervening with appropriate health care, when an individual initially acquires a disability. We will also learn the value of continuing health care to a working individual with a disability. If an individual, even with a severe disability, knows that he or she has access to uninterrupted, appropriate health care, the individual will be a healthier, happier and thus more productive worker. 
    I would like to take the time now to briefly outline the major provisions which have remained as part of this legislation. The conference agreement retains the two state options of establishing Medicaid buy-ins for individuals on Social Security disability rolls, who choose to work and exceed income limits in current law, as well as for those who show medical improvement, but still have an underlying disability. For working individuals with disabilities, the conference agreement extends access, beyond what is allowed in current law, to Medicare. In addition, the legislation before us today retains several key provisions from S. 331, including, the authority to fund Medicaid demonstration projects to provide access to health care to working individuals with a potentially severe disability; the State Infrastructure Grant Program, to assist states in reaching and helping individuals with disabilities who work; work incentive planners and 
   protection and advocacy provisions; and finally, most of the provisions in the Ticket to Work Program. 
   In order to control the cost of this legislation, compromises were made. Although the purpose of the State Infrastructure Grant Program and the Medicaid Demonstration Grant Program remain the same, the terms and conditions of these grants were altered in conference. As a result, states are not required to offer a Medicaid buy-in option to individuals with disabilities on Social Security, who work and exceed income limits in current law, prior to receiving an Infrastructure or a Medicaid Demonstration Grant. 
   Also in Conference, the extended period of eligibility for Medicare for working individuals with disabilities has been changed from 24 to 78 months. During this extended period, the federal government is to cover the cost of the Part A premium of Medicare for a working individual with a disability, who is eligible for Medicare. S. 331 would have extended such coverage for an individual's working life, if he or she became eligible during a 6-year time period. 
   I would like to note two changes to the Ticket to Work program made during Conference. The new legislation shifts the appointment authority for the members of the Work Incentives Advisory Panel from the Commissioner of Social Security to the President and Congress. In addition, language regarding the reimbursements between employment networks and state vocational rehabilitation agencies was deleted in Conference. The new legislation gives the Commissioner of Social Security the authority to address these matters through regulation. 
   Although several changes have been made from the original Work Incentives bill, I am still very pleased with what we are adopting today. This is legislation that makes sense, and it will contribute to the well-being of millions of Americans, including those with disabilities and their friends, their families, and their co-workers. Today's vote provides us the opportunity to bring responsible change to federal policy and to eliminate a misguided result of the current system--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, you don't get health care. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 makes living the American dream a reality for millions of individuals with disabilities, who will no longer be forced to choose between the health care coverage they so strongly need and the economic independence they so dearly desire. 
   In closing, I would like to thank the many people who contributed to reaching this day. I especially thank the conferees, Majority Leader LOTT, Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, and in the House, Majority Leader ARMEY, and Congressmen ARCHER, BLILEY, RANGEL, and DINGELL. I also thank their staff who worked so closely in effort to reach this day. From my staff, I thank Pat Morrissey, Lu Zeph, Leah Menzies, Chris Crowley, and Kim Monk. I want to recognize and extend my appreciation to the staff members of my three fellow sponsors of this bill; Connie Garner in Senator KENNEDY'S office, Jennifer Baxendell and Alexander Vachon with Senator ROTH, and Kristen Testa, John Resnick, and Edwin Park from Senator MOYNIHAN'S staff. Finally, I wish to thank Ruth Ernst with the Senate Legislative Counsel for her drafting skill and substantive expertise, her willingness to meet time tables, and most of all, her patience. In addition to staff, we received countless hours of assistance and advice from the Work Incentives Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities. These individuals worked tirelessly to educate Members of Congress about the need for and the effects of this legislation. 
   Finally, I would like to urge my colleagues in both chambers to set aside any concerns about peripheral matters and to focus on the central provisions of this legislation. Let's focus on what today's vote will mean to the 9.5 million individuals with disabilities across the nation. At last, these individuals will be able to work, to preserve their health, to support their families, to become independent, and most importantly, to contribute to their communities, the economy, and the nation.  We are making a statement, a noble statement and we must do the right thing. Let's send this bill to the President.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support an extremely important provision in the budget agreement. A provision which will mean the difference for many dairy farmers around the country on whether they will stay in business or not. 
   The dairy compromise that is included in the budget agreement will help bring stability to the price dairy farmers around the country receive for their product--as well as protect consumers and processors by helping to maintain a fresh local supply of milk. 
   The agreement extends the very successful Northeast Dairy Compact and overturns Secretary Glickman's flawed pricing rule, saving dairy farmers around the country millions of dollars in lost income. 
   Take one look at this chart and you will know why the dairy compromise in the budget agreement is so important to the survival of this country's dairy farmers. 
   Why, because every farmer in every state in the red would lose money out of their pockets if Secretary Glickman's flawed pricing rule known as option 1-B were to be put in place. The dairy compromise corrects this and creates a pricing formula that is fair for both farmers and consumers. 
   For three years the farmers in New England have had a program that works. It's called the Northeast Dairy Compact. Because the Dairy Compact pilot program has worked so well--no less than twenty-five states have approved Compacts and are now asking Congress for approval. 
   Today, I am so pleased two of the people responsible for creating the idea of the dairy compact are here in Washington today. Bobby Starr and Dan Smith are two Vermonters that over 10 years ago put their heads together in an effort to help protect the Vermont way of life. 
   It was my hope and the hope of the majority of the Senate that we could have expanded the compacts into other regions so other states could benefit from having a means of stabilizing prices for both their farmers and consumers. 
   Unfortunately, this time we were not able to expand the dairy compact into other regions. However, a great deal of progress has been made as more and more states are seeing the benefits of protecting their dairy farmers and rural economies through the use of Interstate Compacts. 
   Given the broad support for compacts among the states, we all know that the issue of regional pricing is one that will continue to be debated. I am pleased with the tremendous progress the Southern states and other Northeastern states have made to move their compacts forward.  
   While the debate continues, this reasonable compromise allows the Northeast Compact to continue as the pilot project for the concept of regional pricing 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact has given farmers and consumers hope. The Compact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm bill as a three-year pilot program, has been extremely successful. 
   The Compact has been studied, audited, and sued but has always come through with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the Compact it has served as a model for the entire country. 
   Mr. President, I am of course aware that some of my colleagues oppose our efforts to bring fairness to our states and farmers by continuation of the Dairy Compact pilot project. 
   Also, unfortunately, Congress has been bombarded with misinformation from an army of lobbyists representing the national milk processors, led by the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Milk Industry Foundation. These two groups, backed by the likes of Philip Morris, have funded several front groups to lobby against this compromise. 
   Their handy work has been seen recently in misinformed newspaper editorials, deceiving advertisements and uninformed television ads. Yesterday Senator LEAHY and I came to the floor to correct the misinformation contained in the Wall Street Journal Editorial. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight about the operation of the Northeast Compact. It is crucial that Congress understand the issues presented by dairy compacts on the merits, rather than based on misinformation. 
   When properly armed with the facts, I believe you will conclude that the Northeast Dairy Compact has already proven to be a successful experiment and that the other states which have now adopted dairy compacts should in the future be given the opportunity to determine whether dairy compacts will in fact work for them as well. 
   Contrary to the claims of the opposition, regional compact regulation remain open to the interstate commerce of all producer milk and processor milk products, from whatever source. Compacts establish neither ``cartels'', ``tariffs'' nor ``barriers to trade'' and are not ``economic protectionism.'' 
   According to the opponents characterizations, dairy compacts somehow establish a ``wall'' around the regions subject to compact regulation, and thereby prohibit competition from milk produced and processed from outside the regions. 
   These are entirely misleading characterizations. 
   It is really quite simple and straightforward: All fluid, or beverage milk sold in a compact region is subject to uniform regulation, regardless of its source within or outside the compact region. 
   This means that all farmers, including farmers from the Upper Midwest, providing milk for beverage sale in the region, receive the same pay prices without discrimination. It can thus be seen that there is no economic protectionism or the erection of barriers to trade. 
   Except for uniform regulation, the market remains open to all, and the benefits of the regulations are provided without discrimination to all participating in the market, including those who participate in the market from beyond the territorial boundaries of the region. 
   Next, I would like to address the actual and potential impact of dairy compacts on consumer prices. In short, opposition claims about the actual and possible impact of dairy compacts on consumers, including low income consumers, are unfounded and grossly distorted. 
   Over the years, while farm milk prices have fluctuated wildly, remaining constant overall during the last ten years, consumers prices have risen sharply. 
   The explanation for this is apparently that variations in store prices do not mirror the wild fluctuations in farm prices. 
   In other words, when farm prices go up, the store prices go up, but when the farm prices recede, the store prices do not come back down as quickly or at the same rate. Hence, and quite logically, if you take away the fluctuations in farm prices, you take away the catalyst for unwarranted increases in store prices. 
   When the 1996 Farm Bill granted consent to the Northeast Dairy Compact as a pilot program, Congress gave the six New England states the right under the compact clause of the Constitution to join together to help regulate the price paid to farmers for fluid milk in the New England region. 
   The six New England states realized that in order to maintain a viable agriculture infrastructure and an adequate supply of milk for the consumers they needed to work together. 
   When the compact passed as part of the 1996 Farm Bill, the opponents were so sure the compact would not operate as its supporters had promised, they asked the Office of Management of Budget to conduct a study on the economic effects of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   The opponents of the dairy compact intended for the OMB study to discredit the dairy compact. The study did just the opposite. Instead, the OMB study proved just what we had thought--that the dairy compact works and it works well. 
   The OMB studied the economic effects of the Northeast Dairy Compact and especially its effects on the federal food and nutrition programs. The study also examined the impacts of milk prices at various levels on utilization and shipment of milk, and on farm income both within and outside the Compact region. 
   Here's what the study concluded: 
   The New England retail milk prices were $.05 cents per gallon lower on average then retail milk prices nationally following the first six months of operation of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   The compact over-order payments made in New England through the Compact Commission have had little impact on the price consumers pay as a result of the compact. Consumers, who are well represented on the Compact Commission, are very pleased with how the Dairy Compact has operated. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact has not added any costs to federal nutrition programs, such as the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and the school lunch and breakfast program, due to compensation procedures implemented by the New England Compact Commission. A program that helps protect farmers and consumers with no cost to the federal government. 
   The OMB study found that the Dairy Compact was economically beneficial to dairy producers. It increased their income from the milk sales about six percent. 
   The study concluded that the retail prices in New England were lower than the national average and it increased the income of dairy producers. No wonder twenty-five states are interested in having compacts in their states. And it's no wonder why governors, state legislatures, consumers and farmers alike support the continuation of the Northeast dairy compact. 
   Also, the OMB study concluded that there were no adverse affects for dairy farmers outside the Compact region and the study noted that some dairy producers outside the region actually received increased financial benefits through the sale of their milk into New England. 
   The OMB study helped Congress understand just how well the compact works. The opponents of the compact did not get what they had hoped for--instead we all have benefitted, both opponents and proponents of the compact, with the facts. 
   Despite what some of my colleagues have said, the Northeast Dairy Compact is working as it was intended to. 
   Instead of trying to destroy an initiative that works to help dairy farmers with no cost to the federal government, I urge my colleagues from the Upper Midwest to respect the states' interest and initiative to help protect their farmers and encourage other regions of the country to explore the possibility of forming their own interstate dairy compact in the future. 
   Mr. President, the Northeast Dairy Compact has worked well. Just think if other commodities and other important resources around the country developed a program that had no cost to the federal government and benefitted both those who produce, sell, and purchase the product.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Vermonter, Lisa Lindahl. Ms. Lindahl is know to many as an artist, inventor and entrepreneur. She made her mark in the business world by designing the first sports bra and becoming the CEO of the company that successfully marketed the ``Jogbra'' until its sale in 1990 to a major corporation. 
   Ms. Lindahl is also know as a long-time advocate of people with epilepsy. Lisa is deeply committed to bringing to the forefront medical issues which are unique to women living with epilepsy. Her unwavering commitment toward improving the health status of such individuals serves as a testament to us all. She is a stunning example of how one person can positively affect so many. 
   There are now over one million American women who have epilepsy. Lisa has brought national attention to the inequities that exist in the field of research regarding men and women with epilepsy. She launched the National Epilepsy Foundation's Women's Health Campaign and chaired the Women and Epilepsy Task Force. Today, the Women's Health Campaign is a major program for the Epilepsy Foundation in cities and states across the nation. 
   Lisa's efforts have played a significant role on the local level as well. She is a long-standing board member of the Epilepsy Foundation of Vermont and the Epilepsy Foundation of America, where she has served as Chair of the Public Relations Committee, the Resource Development Committee, and as Executive Vice President. 
   Vermont has much to be grateful for when it comes to Lisa's steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life for people living with epilepsy, not only in Vermont, but throughout the country. For that, we owe her our deepest gratitude. Thank you, Lisa.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today in honor of an extraordinary Vermont woman, Sister Elizabeth Candon. On January 1, 2000, Sister Elizabeth will retire from her post as Professor of English at Trinity College, and from a long career in public service. Whether in the role of teacher, college President, or public official, Sister Elizabeth has been a steadfast leader for women and a true advocate for those in need. She is and will remain a stunning example of how one person can positively affect so many. 
   In 1939, Sister Elizabeth Candon began her life of public service when she became a Religious Sister of Mercy. Educated at Trinity College and Fordham University, Sister Elizabeth started her career in 1954, when she returned to her alma mater as an Associate Professor of English and Director of Admissions. In 1966, she became a full Professor of English and Trinity College's President, a post she would hold until 1976. 
   In 1977, Sister Elizabeth left the world of academia to try her hand at state government. At the request of Vermont's Governor, Richard Snelling, Sister Elizabeth took the helm of Vermont's largest agency as Secretary of Human Services. As the first woman in Vermont history to serve as Secretary and the only woman in the Governor's cabinet, Sister Elizabeth quickly became a role model for Vermont women. Her tenure as Secretary also provided her with an opportunity to effect change and help those in need. Under her leadership, community based programs were developed and as a result, the Windsor State Prison and Vergennes' Week's School were both closed. This restructuring allowed the beneficial programs administered at these sites to be relocated throughout the state. 
   Sister Elizabeth was and continues to be tireless in her efforts to institute programs on behalf of those in need of mental health and developmental disabilities services. To this day she is remembered for her motto, ``anything is possible if it matters not who gets the credit.'' Consequently, this legacy has woven its way into the mission of the Agency of Human Services. 
   Since returning to teaching at Trinity as Professor of English in 1983, Sister Elizabeth has continued to bring the beauty and inspiration of Shakespeare and Chaucer to her students. During this time, her steadfast leadership in community and public service has continued. 
   I should also acknowledge that throughout her career, Sister Elizabeth has served on many boards and Councils, further extending her influence on the issues important to her and to Vermonters. She sat on the Vermont Council on the Humanities and Public Issues, the Board of Directors for the United Community Service of Chittenden County, and the Board of Directors of Howard Mental Health Services. She also served as Trustee of Middlebury College and as Chairperson of the State Task Force on Funding for Special Education. She remains a trustee at the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government and a Director of the Vermont Ethics Network. 
   As we celebrate Sister Elizabeth's 46 year career of service to the people of Vermont, I know she will continue to contribute in the years to come. As a Sister of Mercy, she brings honor to her religious community and touches the lives of those around her. While she is retiring at the end of this millennium, her legacy will live on well into the next.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in 1986, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act was signed into law. The act created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program which serves two important functions: it provides timely and fair compensation to those few children who are injured from routine immunization and it reduces the adverse effect of the tort system on vaccine supply and cost. Prior to enactment of this bill, the number of U.S.  manufacturers of children's vaccines dropped from seven to two due to a flood of lawsuits filed in response to a network television broadcast claiming that vaccine causes brain injuries. This program has been very successful. However, it has come to our attention that the act requires an amendment which I, and the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Tennessee offer today. 
   A vaccine becomes part of the compensation program if it is recommended for routine use in children by the Centers for Disease Control. At such time, the Congress must also enact a Federal excise tax on the vaccine (currently at $.75 per antigen in the vaccine). The excise tax revenues are housed in a Federal trust fund, the sole purpose of which is to pay claims and administer this program. The program and the fund is jointly administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice. 
   HHS publishes a table listing all covered vaccines and events that may be associated with those vaccines as determined by valid scientific studies. Events that are listed on the table, if they occur within the listed time frame, are automatically compensated by the program unless there is demonstration that some other circumstances created the injury. For an event/injury not listed on the table, the claimant must prove causation. 
   If a vaccine is covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation program, all claims against it must first be filed and processed through the program. Once a claim is adjudicated (and either an award is made or the claim denied), a claimant can reject the program's determination and opt to file a lawsuit. 
   Since the benefit of taking a vaccine accrues not only to the recipient but to society as a whole, the Congress decided that it was also society's responsibility to compensate those who are injured by creating a no-fault program that removes the costliness and uncertainty of the tort system. At the time this law was enacted, parameters were established to permit claims for those serious adverse events that were known to be associated with those vaccines that were then available. The statutory proxy for a serious injury is that the residual effect from the injury must be of six months' duration or longer. 
   Recently, however, a new situation has developed that was not foreseeable at the time of enactment of this law. In October 1999, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), after a review of scientific data from several sources, concluded that intussusception occurs with significantly increased frequency in the first 1-2 weeks after 
   vaccination for rotavirus, particularly after the first dose. Thus, the ACIP withdrew its recommendation for vaccination of infants for rotavirus in the United States. 
   While most cases of intussusception require only minimal treatment, a few cases require hospitalization and surgery. Under the current law, these cases would not be compensable by the United States Claims Court under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, since the statute grants jurisdiction to resolve vaccine cases only in instances in which claimants have suffered the residual effects or complications of a vaccine-related injury for at least six months, or died from the administration of a vaccine. 
   For this reason, we are offering this bill to amend the law and grant jurisdiction to the Claims Court to resolve compensation cases under the Program in cases in which both hospitalization and surgical intervention were required to correct the ``illness, disability, injury or condition'' caused by the vaccine. Mr. President, this language has been shared with, and is supported by officials at HHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
   To our knowledge, the amendment would only apply to circumstances under which a vaccine recipient suffered from intussusception as a result of administration of the rotavirus vaccine. The amendment is not intended to expand jurisdiction to other vaccines listed in the Program's Vaccine Injury Table. 
   We note that this amendment does not address the issue of whether the condition is in fact caused by the vaccine; this is a matter for resolution under other provisions of the no-fault compensation law. Among these are the requirement that the condition either be listed in the Vaccine Injury Table or be established to have been caused in fact by the vaccine. Determinations of this type should only be made after thorough consideration of the scientific evidence by experts in the field; the law commits this issue to the Secretary for consideration in the context of changes to the Vaccine Injury Table through rulemaking, and to the Claims Court for determinations of causation in fact.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, exactly one year ago today, Mike Tighe of Barnard, Vermont boarded a commercial aircraft for a flight to Los Angeles, California. As the plane cruised at about 35,000 feet, Mr. Tighe suffered a deadly heart attack. To make a long story short, Mike is alive and well today, because the aircraft in which he was a passenger had, only two days before that fateful flight, installed an Automated External Defibrillator for use in such an emergency. Today, Mr. President, I am proud to say that the Senate has passed a bill, the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 1999, that will make it much easier for federal, state and local government to place these lifesaving devices in public buildings and emergency response units. 
   Automated External Defibrillators, known as AEDs, are small, easy-to-use, laptop size devices that can analyze heart rhythms to determine if a shock is necessary and, if warranted, prompt the user to deliver a life-saving shock to the heart. Research shows us that for every minute that passes before a cardiac arrest victim is defibrillated, the chance of survival falls by as much as ten percent. Research also shows that 250 lives can be saved each day from cardiac arrests by using the AED. This legislation will help reduce unnecessary and life-threatening minutes of delay, ensuring that public access to defibrillation programs are implemented in the hundreds of thousands of federal buildings. 
   The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 1999, which was introduced by Senator GORTON and referred to the committee that I chair, the Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, has broad bipartisan support, as well as the strong support of the American Heart Association, American Red Cross, and representatives of thousands of first response units across America. I would like to congratulate and thank all my colleagues for passing this legislation today, and especially Senator GORTON, who introduced this bill in August, and has worked tirelessly to get it completed before adjournment. 
   But most of all, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mike Tighe as he celebrates the one year anniversary of the deadly heart attack that he survived because the airplane that he was traveling in was equipped with an Automated External Defibrillator. I hope the bill we passed today moves through the legislative process and is signed into law just as soon as possible next year, so that the estimated 1000 Americans who suffer from sudden cardiac arrests each day will have the same chance that Mr. Tighe did.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will take a moment to react to an editorial which I read this morning in the Wall Street Journal which had so many errors and erroneous comments that it shocked me to find out that such a fine newspaper as the Wall Street Journal would carry this. 
   I have been in Congress now 24 years, and as a result of unusual circumstances, for many years I had been sort of the leader of dairy for the Republicans in the House. That occurred because I was elected during the Watergate year. During the Watergate year, there were 92 freshmen Representatives who were elected and only 16 were Republicans. So all of us who came in that year immediately got seniority because there were not any other Members around. 
   I got to be the ranking member on the dairy subcommittee my first year. During that time, some 24 years, one thing I could be assured of was that any time something was going to come to the benefit of the dairy farmers, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the Washington Post would all write adverse editorials. Why is that? Well, do the dairy farmers buy any advertising in these newspapers? Of course, they don't. Who does buy the advertising? It is those who purchase milk. What is their motivation? To keep the dairy farmers getting the least money possible so they can maximize their profits. And they have done a masterful job. 
   But they also have a propensity, either because they, without any checking, believe everything told to them by the processors who pay for their ads or they just ignore the truth. The Wall Street Journal article of this morning was a very typical example. I will run through some of the facts that were utilized in this great paper to point out the errors. 
   First of all, they make statements which are just not true. They say we have to have a compact because our  farmers are less efficient than the Midwestern farmers. Well, that is absolutely not true. Both are very efficient. The differences in the two areas are dramatic, but they are not relative to efficiency. Obviously, the Midwest farmers have an advantage because they are closer to the grain markets. They have more people producing cheese, and they have soils that are preferable to many of the other areas of the country, especially New England. So they have an advantage, not a disadvantage, by being not only efficient--and I don't think our farmers are any more efficient than theirs --but having lower costs to start with. So to make the statement that it is all based upon inefficiency is absolutely ridiculous. 
   Then this statement: Never mind that this milk costs consumers to the tune of about 20 extra cents a gallon. This is absolutely false. In fact, one of the ironic aspects of this whole argument occurred back when the compact first went into effect and the Midwestern farm representatives said: We will show them. We will show that this is all due to efficiency and all those kinds of things. So they asked OMB, not GAO or whoever else. Why? Because OMB was sympathetic to the administration at that time and they wanted help from the White House to try to back up their arguments. 
   Well, what happened? OMB did an analysis of the impact of the compact and found out just the opposite. Do we hear them quote that anymore? No. I have to bring it up every time. They still--either their friends in the newspapers that make the money off advertising or sometimes they do it themselves--ignore the fact that the study they asked for came back saying that, contrary to what they were telling people, actually the consumers in New England, where the compact was in effect, paid 5 cents less a gallon--not 20 cents more a gallon, 5 cents less a gallon--than the average in the rest of the country. But they still print something which they know is absolutely incorrect. 
   Also, for a conservative newspaper such as the Wall Street Journal--I wouldn't give that same label to the New York Times and the Washington Post--the Wall Street Journal should recognize that all of these States, all six States, are taking advantage of the Constitution which says that States can, if they want to, ask Congress for permission to create a commission to allow them to join together to sort of control or impact interstate commerce. 
   Well, the States have the right to do that and the States did do it. The New England States got together and said: Well, let us take a look and see what we can do to have a more organized pricing system. One has to understand a little bit about how the farming goes. If you are a dairy farmer, you have milk and you have to get rid of it. It is going to last about 3 days before you will have to throw it out. So you are at the mercy of the market. You can form cooperatives and things such as that, but no matter what you do, the milk has to go somewhere or it is going to spoil. 
   The thought was, instead of leaving ourselves at the mercy --and this is the basic part of the situation--of the processors, the people who buy the milk, who can sit there 2 1/2 days and say: Well, it is going to be worthless tomorrow; I will give you 5 cents a gallon--well, it never gets quite that bad, but that is the kind of power they have. They don't want to lose that power. They want to be able to dictate to the dairy farmers the price they are going to get. The New England farmers got together and worked with their various legislators and decided, why don't we set up a commission that would have consumers represented, processors represented, farmers represented, and the general interest of the public represented. We will set what the price will be, keeping in mind that we don't want to end up with a huge surplus. We want to make it fair but make sure the consumers don't lose on this--in fact, maybe even gain--and the dairy farmers will gain because they will have a stable market situation. 
   It worked so well that, as I said, the price to consumers actually went down. I could speak at length on that, but it went down. The farmers got a significantly better price overall. They were happy. The processors got a fair price, and they haven't screamed, those that are participating in it. It is a good system. That is the problem with it. It is a good system. 
   Why does that scare the processors? They would rather get the lowest price possible to pay to the farmers and so they have lost that control. But to the Midwest, it shakes them up because what was their dream? Their dream was that all of the dairy farmers in the United States would go out of business except in the Midwest. And they are so sure they could provide all the milk the country needs, so why do we not put them out? 
   Well, the commission worked. The price to consumers has gone down, the farmers are getting a fair price, and the processors are not being injured in any way. That is why 25 States, now a total of 25, including New England, have said that is a great idea. Everybody is happy. What a wonderful situation. 
   The processor is happy, consumers are paying less in price, and everybody is happy. So why don't we join? Well, that, of course, has now made it a big threat to the Midwest. Because if the whole country goes to compacts, the farmers will stay in business, and the market expansion that the Midwest was hoping for won't occur. 
   That is why we are here today. The States have recognized that it is essential to make sure their farmers survive. Why is that? The basic concept of the law right now, from the 1930s and rewritten in the Farm Act of 1947, said it is critical that we ensure that every area of this Nation has an adequate supply of fresh milk. That is basic law; that is, to make sure that when you go to your store, there is always some fresh milk for you there. That is the basic law. All these States that are going into compacts are saying: We want to make sure that our area of the country has an adequate supply of fresh milk, and we ought to be able to do that. So that is what the real fight is about. 
   We have already had the editorial I anticipated in the Post. The Wall Street Journal came through right on time with one I anticipated. Theirs is so incredibly inaccurate in what they cite, it was a little embarrassing, on behalf of the paper, to read that. I expect the New York Times will follow suit probably in the next couple of days. 
   I want to make sure these facts are out there. What this Nation needs is stable farming. We all love our farmers. I can't think of Vermont or New England without the cows on the hillside. I can't think of what the Southeast would be without the ability of their farmers to produce milk. 
   And they have, because of the weather situation and all, special problems in the Southeast, being able to produce milk at reasonable prices. But they are doing very well. They want to form a compact. The same is true in other parts of the country. What is wrong with people in the region getting together and deciding how to do it? 
   Another argument raised, which will be one for other editorials, is that it causes higher prices for WIC--Women, Infants and Children--and food. That is all taken care of by the commission. Farmers in the Midwest, right now, on an average, receive significantly more in the checks they get on a weekly or monthly basis--what they call the ``mailbox price.'' They do better than the rest of the country. So they are not the ones suffering. They have advantages, as I pointed out, in cost of production and those things. They are doing well. They just want to be sure they can perhaps have a better future by shipping more milk. 
   Incidentally--and I will leave you with this because the statements are that this is somehow infringing on commerce and the ability of people to sell--they can bring their milk down now and sell it in the New England area. Why don't they? It costs too much to ship it down there. But the market is open; it is not closed out. There are no barriers built up to where the farmers can ship milk. In fact, the New England compact is in place right now, but a great deal of the milk comes from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and wherever else anyone wants to ship it. 
   The New England area itself is a negative producer. So we depend upon milk coming from other areas. When you come in, you know you are going  to be bound by the price that is established by the commission. That, again, represents consumers, producers, the dairy farmers, the processors, the people who buy it, and it protects programs such as WIC. It is working so well. That is the problem. 
   Just remember, the reason for all the controversy right now is that this program is working so well for consumers, processors, and the producers, and it is a danger to those who want to do away with our local farming businesses. 
   Mr. President, I see no other Member present, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to stand before the Senate today and pay tribute to a man who has greatly influenced the cultural maturity of my home state of Vermont. Graham Stiles Newell will be honored as Citizen of the Year by the Vermont Chamber of Commerce on December 4, 1999. Graham has made extraordinary contributions to Vermont in many areas throughout his life. And he has made his biggest contributions in one area in which I have spent a great deal of legislative energy--education. 
   Graham Newell probably learned to read before he learned to walk. I understand that he first secured a library card at the Saint Johnsbury Atheneum when he was in the first grade. Since then, he has been passing on his knowledge to anyone willing to learn, and that number is larger than you can imagine. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1938, he launched an incredible career in education, one that touched three generations of many Vermont families. 
   Graham has been a leader in Vermont education in both the professional and legislative arenas. In the last seven decades he has been a teacher at the Junior High, High School, and College level, and will undoubtably keep teaching well into the next millennium. Graham began his teaching career at his alma mater, Saint  Johnsbury Academy, in 1938, and remained on the faculty for nine years. From 1945 to 1982 he taught history at Lyndon State College full-time. After ``retiring'' in 1982, he returned to the Academy to teach Latin, where you will still find him today. He also continued to teach one or two history classes a semester at Lyndon State College until 1996. 
   Most people consider Latin a dead language, but if you were to enter Graham's classroom today you would find it to be as alive and enjoyable as ever. A testament to Graham's teaching skills was demonstrated at the Academy in 1997, when 47 of his 52 Latin students, over 90 percent, made honors on the National Latin Exam, an extremely challenging test taken by over 90,000 students across the United States. 
   Graham's contributions to education do not end in the classroom. While teaching, he also served in the Vermont Legislature for over 25 years. He was a member and chair of the Vermont Senate Education Committee during the 1960s, helping to create Vermont's education laws. Indeed, the self proclaimed Ambassador of the Northeast Kingdom has positively affected every single student in the state of Vermont over the last 30 years. In fact, his influence has even reached students outside of Vermont, due to his tenure on the New England Board of Higher Education. But Graham always remained supremely faithful to the students in his classroom, once even teaching class over the phone from the Vermont Statehouse. 
   One can look at Graham's education accomplishments alone and see a lifetime of work and success. However, his influence has touched many in other fields as well. As President of the Vermont Historical Society from 1965 to 1969, his many successes included securing a permanent home for the organization in the historic Pavilion Office Building in Montpelier. He has also served on a number of commissions, including the Commission on Interstate Cooperation, the Historic Sites Commission, the Commission to Study State Government (or ``Little Hoover'' as we called it), the Vermont Civil War Centennial Commission, the board of managers of the Council of State Governments, and the Education Commission of the States. In addition, the thousands of people who check into the Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital each year should be thankful to Graham as he is largely responsible for its existence. I could go on, but I'm afraid it would take the remainder of this session of congress to do so. 
   I am thankful for the opportunity to provide my colleagues with a shining example of a real Vermont renaissance man. I join countless Vermonters in offering my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Graham Stiles Newell for his many years of hard work and dedication to the citizens of Vermont.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to stand before my colleagues today and pay tribute to a couple who have so positively influenced the people of Washington County, Vermont over the course of their lives. William and Olene Doyle will be honored as the Washington County Citizens of the Year by the Green Mountain Council of Boy Scouts on November 22nd, 1999. 
   My old friend Bill Doyle has navigated a well rounded career as a teacher, politician, and author. Since 1958, he has been teaching history and government at Johnson State College. In 1968, he was elected to serve as one of Washington County's three State Senators, a role in which he has thrived for over three decades. As a skilled teacher and a master of parliamentary rules, Bill has been an invaluable mentor and mediator in the Vermont State House. Bill has written two books, including The Vermont Political Tradition, which is regarded by many to be a ``must read'' on Vermont political history. He has also taken his passion for government and politics and created the annual ``Doyle Poll,'' our yearly gauge of public opinion on the hottest and sometimes most controversial issues facing Vermonters. While admittedly unscientific, the poll's results are soundly reflective of Vermont sentiment. 
   As the son of an art teacher, I have always held a deep respect for the arts and for those who are able to inspire creativity in our nation's young people. Olene Doyle has taught art in elementary, secondary, and higher education institutions in the central Vermont region. Her dedication to arts and education led her to volunteer positions on the local school board in Montpelier, as well as on the board of the Wood Art Gallery, where, incidently, I now hold the annual Congressional Arts Competition. 
   Bill and Olene raised three wonderful children. However, they have never stopped teaching as evidenced by their ongoing community service and involvement in their local church and non-profit organizations. Given the countless hours they dedicate to community service, it is noteworthy that the couple finds the time to pursue personal hobbies such as golf and gardening. And while I have never had the privilege of seeing the Doyle gardens, I have been told they are a vibrant reflection of the dedication which Bill and Olene give to everything they do. 
   I am thankful for the opportunity to express my heartfelt praise. I can think of few couples more worthy of this award. Years of partnership and devotion to each other have inevitably spilled over into the Vermont community, where Bill and Olene have truly made their mark as two of Vermont's most influential and giving people.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there has been considerable attention rightfully paid by our colleagues this year to the issue of providing prescription drug coverage for our older American citizens. Estimates of the number of older Americans without some form of added coverage for prescription drugs vary between a low of 16.7 percent to 50 percent. About 7.7 million Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes below 200 percent of poverty have no prescription drug coverage, despite some evidence indicating they are in poorer health than those beneficiaries with coverage. Those without added coverage for prescription benefits spend approximately 50 percent of their total income on out-of-pocket health care costs, and there are anecdotal reports that some elders forgo taking their prescribed medicines in order to have food to eat. Finally, there are econometric studies that conclude that a $1 increase in pharmaceutical expenditure is associated with a $3.65 reduction in hospital care expenditure. 
   The problems posed by the lack of prescription drug coverage for the neediest elders is compounded by the well-documented effects of inappropriate drug use among the elderly. In 1995, the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that inappropriate drug use among elders is acute and that elders were particularly susceptible to unintended, adverse drug events (ADEs), due in part to the natural aging process and also to the likelihood that they are taking multiple medications. One study of drug use by the elderly, done by the Vermont Program for Quality in Health Care, found that it was not uncommon for elders to be taking more than a dozen drugs at one time. In fact, the Vermont study actually documented one case in which ``a single individual received prescriptions for 71 different drugs in a single year, several of which probably should not have been taken in combination.'' 
   The GAO report also cited studies showing that hospitalizations for elderly patients due to ADEs were six times greater than for the general population, with an estimated annual cost of $20 billion. However, a recent Journal of the American Medical Association article indicated that the level of ADEs could be reduced 66 percent, if a pharmacist participated in grand rounds. Clearly, more must be done to recognize the importance of medication management programs that ensure the quality of drug therapy, including patient evaluations, compliance assessments, and drug therapy reviews. 
   We are all aware that prescription drug costs continue to grow at an alarming rate. Seniors are being forced to spend greater and greater portions of their fixed incomes on prescription drugs which they need to live. Research and development of prescription drugs have come a long way since Medicare was originally enacted in 1965. Today, drugs are just as important as hospital visits, and in many cases more important, and it just doesn't make sense for Medicare to reimburse hospitals for surgery but not to provide coverage for the drugs that might prevent surgery. We need to modernize the Medicare program so that it does not go bankrupt in the next 10 to 15 years, and at the same time we must ensure that any Medicare reform proposal we consider includes a prescription drug benefit that helps all seniors. 
   Mr. President, I have already introduced two measures that will help our older citizens obtain the medicines they need and at prices they can afford. My first bill, S. 1462, the ``Personal Use Prescription Drug Importation Act of 1999,'' allows Americans of all ages to avail themselves of the lower prices for prescription medicines that are available in Canada. A second measure, S. 1725, the ``DrugGap Insurance for Seniors Act of 1999,'' would provide for a more comprehensive access to prescription drugs by Medicare beneficiaries through reform and modernization of the Medicare Supplemental, Medigap, program. Under this approach, all existing Medigap plans, and three new drug-only Medigap plans, would provide various levels of prescription drug benefits from which seniors could choose. And our neediest elders' needs would be supported through Federal contributions for the cost of their premiums. 
   During the 1st Session of the 106th Congress, no fewer than eight bills have been introduced in the Senate to provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries--with most proposals estimated to cost between $5 billion and $40 billion per year. While I'm hopeful that we will all work hard to include a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, I am also concerned that at the end of the Congress we may not be successful. That is why I am introducing a measure today, the ``Pharmaceutical Aid to Older Americans Act,'' which will serve as a backstop for our neediest elders. This program builds on State pharmacy assistance programs that are already in place, and it encourages States to begin them where they don't already exist. 
   Fifteen States are cutting new and innovative paths for providing prescription drug coverage for their neediest citizens. Most of these programs are for elder citizens (more than half also cover people with disabilities), and cover a wide variety of drugs--though some are limited to certain drugs or conditions, some require cost sharing for prescription medicines, and some have annual enrollment fees or monthly premiums. As of 1997, these programs aided over 700,000 people. The  Pharmaceutical Aid to Older Americans Act is designed to assist States in their efforts to provide medicines and appropriate pharmacy counseling benefits for their neediest elders. 
   This Act will strengthen the Older Americans Act by authorizing two discretionary grant programs, subject to appropriations, to fund State-based pharmaceutical assistance and medication management programs. Under this measure, States would develop models that work best for them and would have the latitude to design and implement innovative approaches for providing benefits to their neediest elders. States awarded grant money would agree to: match Federal funds with 30 percent new or existing State funds or in-kind contributions and not supplant current State expenditures with Federal funds. In-kind contributions counting toward the match requirement could include assistance from pharmaceutical companies and organization- and community-based pharmacies, thereby making this approach a truly public-private partnership. 
   Each application for pharmaceutical assistance funds must include a medication management program that ensures the quality of drug therapies through patient evaluations, compliance assessments, and drug therapy reviews. Federal funds could be used to provide drug coverage benefits only to eligible beneficiaries, defined as Medicare beneficiaries with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty but without any other coverage for prescription drug benefits (States could 
   expand eligibility with State resources). All senior citizens could utilize the medication management portion of the program. 
   This is not government control of drug prices or price-fixing. The States can purchase pharmaceuticals from any willing seller, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical distributors, wholesalers, pharmacy benefit management firms (PBMs), and chain or local pharmacies, without any Federal requirement for wholesale prices or Medicaid-based rebates. In some instances, it's likely that States may be able to negotiate better purchasing prices than any of those set by some artificial, imposed ceiling. Finally, for those States that choose not to provide pharmaceutical benefits, the Act authorizes grants to States to create or support stand-alone Medication Management Programs that will involve the States in collaborative efforts with community, chain-based, and institutional pharmacists to implement medication management programs. 
   As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, I am fully committed to providing a prescription benefit for all our elders as we move forward on comprehensive reform of the Medicare program. I am equally committed to seeing that the Older Americans Act is reauthorized this Congress, and I will work diligently to get these jobs accomplished. However, if the latter effort succeeds and the former doesn't, then the Pharmaceutical Assistance for Older Americans Act will be in place to provide much-needed medicines for our neediest elders. I'm very pleased Mr. President, that this measure has received endorsement of two of the key advocacy organizations associated with the Older Americans Act, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging and the National Association of State Units on Aging. Note that these guardians of the aged support this measure, like me, if and only if we are unsuccessful in passing a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to commend Paula Duggan who is retiring after 13 years as a senior policy analyst at the Northeast-Midwest Institute. She has been instrumental on a variety of labor market, education, and fiscal federalism issues. 
   Paula, for instance, was the key force behind labor market information provisions within the Workforce Preparedness Act, and she has worked diligently to ensure that the law is well implemented. She was one of the first analysts to make the connection between worker education and business productivity. And she has written numerous reports explaining how federal allocation formulas are structured and how federal funds are distributed among the states. 
   I have benefitted from Paula's expertise and experience in my capacities as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and as co-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition. Paula consistently has provided unbiased and insightful research that has advanced bipartisan efforts on behalf of this region and the nation. As she begins her well-earned retirement, Mr. President, I again want to thank Paula Duggan for her fine work.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the importance of the Refugee Protection Act of 1999 and to honor those most affected by this legislation. 
   The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 will continue a tradition that is as old as the United States itself. Our great country was founded by men and women who left their homeland for a better life in the new world. Many of these individuals escaped persecution in their home countries, made the difficult decision to leave what they knew behind and to take their chances in a new country where many did not know the language and customs or have friends or family. The Refugee Protection Act helps to continue this tradition by ensuring that those who seek entrance to the United States as refugees are given fair consideration and due process. 
   The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 would reinstate important protections against the deportation and refusal of refugees and asylum seekers who enter the United States from countries in which they face danger and persecution, whether it is due to ethnic, religious or political beliefs. Over the past few years Vermont has seen an increase in the number of refugees who have come to live in our great state. These refugees are well served by a number of agencies in Vermont which provide them help and promote their interests, including the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, the Tibetan Resettlement Project, the Tibetan Association of Vermont and Vermont Refugee Assistance. The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 will continue the example set in the state of Vermont, by welcoming refugees to our country and ensuring that all are given the full extent of protection they deserve.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, last year Congress passed and the President signed a significant measure that will, as funds are provided, provide compassionate compensation payments to hundreds of individuals. Public Law 105-369, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act of 1998, authorizes payments for hemophiliacs treated with blood products infected with HIV during the 1980s as well as their infected spouses and children. Last year, Mr. President, you and I, and all of our colleagues gave our unanimous consent to this measure because we all knew it was the right thing to do. But we accomplished only part of the job. We provided compassionate compensation to only a portion of the Americans who, through indecisiveness and inaction on the part of federal government, became infected with HIV. So today I am introducing legislation that will set the record straight and finish what needs to be done, and I hope that our colleagues will once again in the name of fairness and compassion give this measure their unanimous support. 
   I am on the floor today to introduce legislation that will bring much needed fairness to hundreds of our citizens. This bill, the Ricky Ray Fairness Act of 1999 will finally include those people, other than hemophiliacs, who were infected with HIV and contracted AIDS through HIV contaminated blood products or tissues. 
   The blood crisis of the 1980s resulted in the HIV infection of thousands of Americans who trusted that the blood or blood product with which they were treated was safe. The tragedy of the blood supply's contamination has brought unbearable pain to families all over the country. I have heard from dozens over the past months. These are people like any of us--like our children and our grandchildren--who went to hospitals for standard procedures, emergency care, or were transfused due to complications in childbirth. Many children and adults were secondarily infected: children through childbirth or HIV-infected breast milk and adults through their spouses. Lives were lost and futures were ruined. Not only were there physical and emotional costs, but there exists a tremendous drain on personal finances as a result of lost income and extreme medical expenses. In the minds of these and in the minds of members who advocated for the Ricky Ray bill, the federal government played the determining role in the tragedy. 
   Mr President, these people were infected with HIV because the federal government failed to protect the blood supply during the mid-1980s when it did not use its regulatory authority to implement a wide range of blood and blood-donor screening options recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Had the federal government taken the recommendations of the CDC, thousands of American men, women and children would not have contracted AIDS through HIV-contaminated blood and blood products. 
   Sadly, and unfairly, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act as passed last year does not include all victims of the blood supply crisis. I feel strongly that the Act must be amended to include compensation for not only hemophiliacs, but also people who received a blood transfusion or blood product in the course of medical treatment. Though it was right for us to pass the Ricky Ray Act last year, it remains an inequity and a tragedy that the federal government did so without including victims of transfusion-associated AIDS. 
   Unlike a few individuals, most people infected with HIV through blood and blood products have been unable to track the source of their infection; nor have they been able to obtain some judicial relief through the courts. The community hit by this tragedy has found it nearly impossible to make recovery through the courts because of blood shield laws in most states that raise the burden of proof for product liability claims for blood and blood products. In addition, all States have statutes of limitations that prohibit litigation if the suit was not filed within a certain period of time. 
   I am introducing today what can be the final chapter in our Country's responsibility for not adequately protecting the blood supply during the 1980s. The Ricky Ray Fairness Act of 1999 provides compassionate payments to those infected with HIV contaminated blood, blood components, or human tissues. While the change to include transfusion cases increases the cost of this bill, many have already noted that this bill is not about money, it's about fairness. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the terrible tragedy the blood supply crisis of the 1980s cast upon all of its victims.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter, a gifted parliamentarian, and a true friend, Robert Gibson. Bob Gibson served the Vermont Legislature for over 35 years, first as Assistant Secretary of the Senate, and then as Secretary of the Senate. In these positions, he provided invaluable advice and counsel to every Senator who has served Vermont, from 1963, until his death in October. 
   Bob Gibson was born in Brattleboro in 1931, into one of Vermont's most distinguished families, a family dedicated to serving the public good. Bob's grandfather, Ernest Gibson, was president of the state Senate in 1908, a U.S. Congressman and a U.S. Senator. His father, Ernest Gibson, Jr., was an appointed U.S. Senator, Governor of  Vermont, a U.S. District Court judge, a decorated war hero and a close friend of my father. And both of Bob's brothers are exceptional citizens and public servants. His brother, Ernest III, is a former Vermont Supreme Court Justice and his other brother, David, is a former state's attorney for Windham County. 
   Both Bob Gibson and his father helped me immeasurably in my early years as a lawyer and a legislator. I clerked for Bob's father after law school, and was impressed by his vast knowledge of and respect for our laws, and his dedication to making Vermont a better place. And when I was elected to my first public office in 1967, as a Senator from Rutland County, it was Bob who steered me through the legislative process and set a standard of bipartisanship that has guided me throughout my career. 
   With a rare sense of fairness and a vast knowledge of the Vermont Legislature, Bob extended the same helping hand to every Senator that served in the Chamber during his tenure. Current Vermont State Senator from Caledonia County, Robert Ide, recently stated, ``Bob Gibson's reputation for fairness and honesty was above reproach from any member of the Senate. His guidance and respect from the leadership of both parties was unparalleled in the Vermont statehouse. He was a true friend and mentor for everyone who served in his classroom, and he will be sorely missed.'' 
   Bob Gibson was a positive force in the Senate, who kept lawmakers moving forward in an orderly fashion. He was a positive force in his native Brattleboro, serving the community in a variety of ways before moving to Montpelier and becoming Assistant Secretary. He was a positive force in his family, dedicated to his wife, daughters, parents and brothers. And he was a positive force to all those who had the privilege of calling him a friend. 
   I pay tribute today to a man who paid tribute every day, to the values that Vermont holds dear--hard work, honesty and fairness. We have lost a Vermont institution, but Bob Gibson's legacy lives on in the laws he helped to enact and the lives that he touched.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Connecticut for his acute remarks. He is quite right: at root, this is a question of equity, and it is a question of fundamental importance in a deregulated power market. 
   The Nation's dirtiest power plants have abused loopholes in federal law to dirty our air, pollute our lungs, and kill our most vulnerable citizens. With one set of loopholes about to close, these power plants now seek to create new ones. 
   These power plants have exploited the law for nearly 30 years. Now, EPA is exposing their effort for what it is: a blatant violation of the public trust. In response, these dirty polluters are pushing appropriations riders that would justify and permanently extend their unlimited ability to pollute. 
   Haven't these power plants done enough damage already? Isn't it enough that they have been allowed to pollute 10 times more than our plants in the Northeast for years and years? Couldn't they now apply the same pollution control equipment that our plants in the Northeast 
   employ? 
   The problem is growing even worse with the deregulation of electricity markets. In the five years since deregulation of the wholesale electricity market, increased generation at coal fired power plants has added the equivalent of 37 million cars worth of smog to our air. These power plants are now seeking to permanently extend their unfair advantage. 
   We need a level playing field. The nation's dirtiest power plants should not be able to exploit loopholes in federal law at the expense of the rest of the nation. We need to pass laws to clean up our air, not make it dirtier. I strongly oppose any attempt to make it easier for the nation's dirtiest power plants to continue their excessive pollution.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for years small communities across the United States have labored to meet environmental regulations written for major cities. They have struggled unduly with complicated regulations designed for Chicago or Los Angeles. Today I am introducing legislation designed to end this problem: the Small Community Assistance Act of 1999. 
   We who live in small towns such as my home town of Shrewsbury, Vermont are proud of our community and our environment. We want to comply with reasonable health and environmental standards in order to leave a healthy legacy for our children. But we do not have the staff or financial capacity of larger communities to respond to far-reaching regulations. We are concerned about standards written without consideration for the special circumstances small towns in America face. While we recognize the importance of environmental regulations in safeguarding our air and water, we need the ability to respond intelligently to local priorities and needs. We want to comply with environmental regulations, but we need some flexibility in order to comply in a reasonable manner. We do not want preferential treatment, we want treatment that recognizes our unique size and fiscal situation. 
   In 1991, I authored the Small Town Environmental Planning Act. This act passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Bush in 1992. This act mandated that the Environmental Protection Agency give more assistance to small towns. It created a task force comprised of representatives from small communities across the nation. These small town representatives developed a list of ways in which the EPA can better help small towns enjoy and maintain a healthy environment. 
   It is now time to take their advice. The Small Community Assistance Act of 1999 will give much needed assistance to small towns and communities in Vermont and across the nation. This bill will give small communities more input into the regulatory review process, clearer and simpler environmental guidelines, and more assistance in meeting environmental obligations. 
   This legislation acts on the recommendations of people from small communities throughout the United Stats. Small community members provided the impetus for this bill, helped write the bill itself, and provided numerous helpful comments. To these small community members I offer my sincere appreciation. I would especially like to thank the members of EPA's Small Community Advisory Subcommittee for all of their help, and I thank the committee for its unanimous endorsement of this bill. 
   I would like to thank the original cosponsors of this bill, Senators Crapo, Murkowski, Schumer, Harkin, Bryan, Burns, and REID. Their leadership on this bill underscores their dedication to helping people in our small towns. I urge every one of my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. Together, we can improve the quality of life and further environmental protections in our small communities nationwide.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an increase in the Federal minimum wage. I strongly believe that the time has come to raise the minimum wage again and that we should raise the minimum wage by a $1.00 an hour increase over the next 2 years. 
   The minimum wage is not the only way--or even the best way--to give folks in need a helping hand to get out of poverty. But I do believe that it should at least keep pace with inflation. Unfortunately, that is not happening. Today's minimum wage is 19 percent below the 1979 level. To give you a better idea of what this means for working families, consider that a minimum wage employee working full time earns about $10,700 a year--more than $3,000 below the $13,880 poverty line for a family of three. Workers deserve better. At a time when our economy is booming, we should not allow this trend to continue. Instead, we must continue to raise the minimum wage to keep pace with the rising cost of life's basic needs 
   My home State of Vermont recently raised the minimum wage to $5.75 an hour in response to its awareness of the cost of living. Let's follow its lead, a dollar-an-hour increase in the Federal minimum wage will put $2,000 a year in the pockets of working families at or near the poverty line. And given that 2 years has passed since the last increase, small businesses have had the time to adjust. Although this money will not solve all the problems of the working poor, it will go a long way toward helping minimum wage workers obtain basic needs for themselves and their families. 
   In addition to raising the minimum wage, there are many other things that Congress can and should do to assist low wage workers and their families. We must continue to search out and support targeted solutions such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC provides some 20 million low-income households with a refundable tax credit. Last year, the EITC enabled a worker earning minimum wage, who was either a single parent or the sole wage earning parent of dependent children, to receive up to $ 3,816 in additional income. 
   Along with measures that will raise take home pay, I know that we can do more to assist low-income families with their basic needs. Over the past few years, an organization in Vermont called the Peace and Justice Center has examined how low wage workers and their families were faring in my home State. The Vermont Wage Gap Study showed that while we are enjoying one of the most extraordinary economic booms in the history of our country, thousands of workers in my home State are having great difficulty making ends meet. The study found that the cost of meeting basic needs is more than many of Vermont's low income workers are earning. 
   For example, the Vermont Job Gap Study indicated that child care and health care are among working families largest expenses. Over the past few years, I have been pushing for national child care legislation to assist these working families with their child care needs. On the health care side, we were able to enact the Children's' Health Insurance Program which is helping to improve children's health for working families who cannot afford health coverage for their children. In addition, we should help low income workers in obtaining health insurance. I am currently working on a proposal that would provide uninsured and under-insured workers with the money they need to buy health insurance. 
   But the predominant factor influencing an individual's ability to support his or her family is not to be found in the minimum wage or the tax code. Study after study has found it is education. Simply put, you earn what you learn. I urge my colleagues to work with me on continuing to pass legislation aimed at improving our educational systems, and job training programs. It is my hope that these efforts will improve the skills and employability of our workforce and will enable low-wage workers to obtain better paying jobs. 
   I would like to add that I think it is entirely appropriate that an increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks for those who will have to shoulder higher wage costs, especially small employers. And I strongly favor several of the tax breaks in this amendment. In particular, I support acceleration of deductibility of health insurance costs for the self-employed; increasing the amount of equipment purchases that small businesses can deduct each year; and providing tax credits to employers who provide on-site child care. At the same time, some of the tax provisions bear little relationship to the impact of a minimum wage hike on small businesses. In addition, I am concerned that we have not had adequate time to explore the implications and effects of all of the tax provisions. My vote in support of this amendment should not be read as an endorsement of each and every tax provision, but rather reflects my fundamental belief that the time has come for a minimum wage increase. 
   Lastly, I would comment on the language in Senator KENNEDY's amendment increasing disclosure to participants of cash balance pension plans and prohibiting so-called benefit ``wear-aways''. This language is being offered in response to the conversion of hundreds of traditional defined benefit pension plans into cash balance or other hybrid arrangements. I believe that legitimate concerns have been raised that notices about the plan changes that were sent to participants have been insufficient. In fact, until recently many workers have been unaware that their plan was amended to significantly reduce the rate at which they are earning benefits. While pension law only requires employers to pay what an employee has actually earned under the plan, when these changes are made toward the middle of a worker's career, the effect can be devastating. 
   This legislation will help workers better understand what the changes in their plan mean for their retirement plans. It requires plan sponsors to give participants notice of the conversions in a more timely fashion, in plain English and on an individualized basis. In the words of my colleague Senator MOYNIHAN, this disclosure requirement helps to make cash balance conversions transparent for the plan participants. I feel this change is warranted and urgently needed. 
   But this amendment does more. It also prohibits an unfortunate pension practice called the benefit ``wear-away''. When some plans are converted, workers with long-years of service may not earn any benefits for a number of years. I believe this practice is unfair. There is no reason why an individual with 20 years of service should not earn any benefits while a younger worker earns benefits immediately. The language in this amendment will effectively prohibit wear-aways. 
   As we conclude the first session of the 106th Congress, I hold steadfast in my belief that Congress must do everything in its power to help working families. The time has come to raise the minimum wage and give the workers who are depending on it a better shot at self-sufficiency. I believe that a $1.00 increase over the next 2 years will certainly help. However, I also believe that a slower increase is better than none at all. Therefore if we do not have the votes in the Senate to pass a 2-year increase, I will also support a 3-year increase.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we were all deeply saddened just a few days ago at the death of Senator John Chafee. Certainly, that sadness can never diminish completely. But having his son with us today and starting right off by introducing an excellent piece of legislation certainly brings us strong hope for the future. 
   Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for introducing the Literacy Involves Families Together Act, the LIFT Act. This legislation reauthorizes one of the most effective education programs, Even Start. 
   The Even Start Act was first introduced in 1985 by Representative BILL GOODLING, chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, and our former colleague, Senator John Chafee. 
   When first created, the goal of the Even Start program was to develop a comprehensive literacy program that improves educational opportunities for disadvantaged families by focusing on parenting education, early childhood education, and adult education. Since its establishment a little over a decade ago, Even Start has grown from 76 local programs serving 2,500 families to an estimated 600 programs assisting over 36,000 parents and 48,000 children. 
   The most recent evaluation of the Even Start program illustrated that both the adults and children who participated in the program significantly improved their reading and basic education skills. The evaluation specifically pointed out that the educational gap that existed at the beginning of the school year for first term Even Start students was reduced by approximately two-thirds when the Even Start students were tested at the conclusion of the school year. 
   The most recent national survey of reading achievement by fourth graders indicates that forty-four percent of school age children in this nation are reading below a basic level of achievement. 
   Sadly, the statistics are also dismal when analyzing adult literacy skills. The most recent National Adult Literacy Survey found a total of 44 million adults, almost 25 percent of the adult population in the United States, were at the lowest literacy level. The lowest literacy level means that 44 million adults in this country have demonstrated difficulty in the reading and writing skills essential for carrying out daily routines. The uniqueness of the Even Start program is that it provides services to the entire family--it enables families to learn together. 
   I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for making literacy a very high priority. I am especially pleased that he chose to sponsor the reauthorization of the Even Start program which was first introduced to this body by his father. 
   I look forward to working with the Senator from Rhode Island on the Literacy Involves Families Together Act, the LIFT Act, as a part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which the Senate will consider early next year and on other education and literacy initiatives that will enable all of our Nation's citizens to have the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in the global economy. 
   I again commend the Senator from Rhode Island for being out here so fast and quick with a very important piece of legislation. I share his enthusiasm and look forward to working with him.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, and my colleagues Senators KENNEDY, HARKIN, FRIST, COLLINS, WELLSTONE, REED, DODD, MURRAY, and ENZI, I am pleased that we are considering S. 1809, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This legislation, commonly referred to as the DD Act, represents the reauthorization of a piece of legislation with a rich legacy, and a long history of bipartisan Congressional support. It was initially enacted as Title I of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 as part of the legacy of President Kennedy, and was last reauthorized in 1996 under the sponsorship of Senator FRIST. It has always focused on the needs of our most vulnerable citizens, currently an estimated four million Americans with developmental disabilities, including individuals with mental retardation and other lifelong, severe disabilities. I am pleased to say that S. 1809 was reported out, unanimously, by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on November 3, 1999. 
   I would like to take a moment to review the history of this legislation, and the programs in each State that it authorizes. The earliest version of this legislation focused on the interdisciplinary training of professionals to work with individuals with developmental disabilities by authorizing funding for University Affiliated Facilities charged with expanding the carde of professionals able to address the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. Later, the name of the programs was changed to University Affiliated Programs (UAPs), and their mission was expanded to include community services and information dissemination pertaining to individuals with developmental disabilities. In 1996, after 33 years of planned expansion by Congress, the DD Act provided funding for at least one UAP in each State. The present reauthorization recognizes the development of these programs, adds research as a core function, and renames UAPs as Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service. 
   In the 1970 reauthorization of the DD Act, Congress recognized the need for and value of strengthening State efforts to coordinate and integrate services for individuals with developmental disabilities. As a result, Congress established and authorized funding for State Developmental Disabilities Councils (DD Councils) in each State. The purpose of the Councils was, and continues to be, to advise governors and State agencies regarding the use of available and potential resources to meet the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. Every State has a DD Council. The Councils undertake advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities directed at improving access to and quality of community services, supports, and other forms of assistance for individuals with disabilities and their families. 
   In 1975, Congress created and authorized funding for Protection and Advocacy Systems (P & As) in each State to ensure the safety and well being of individuals with developmental disabilities. The mission of these systems has evolved over the years, initially addressing the protection of individuals with developmental disabilities who lived in institutions, to the present responsibilities related to the protection of individuals with developmental disabilities from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and from the violation of their legal and human rights, both in institutions and other community settings. 
   The 1975 reauthorization of the DD Act also established funding for Projects of National Significance. Through this new authority Congress authorizes funding for initiatives to address areas of national importance. Over the years, projects related to individuals with developmental disabilities and their treatment in the criminal justice system, their experiences with home ownership, in employment, their use of assistive technology, and their involvement in self-advocacy have been supported through Projects of National Significance. 
   The legislation before us today, S. 1809, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999 builds on the past successes of these programs. Additionally, this bill reflects today's changing society and seeks to provide a foundation for the services and supports that individuals with developmental disabilities, their families, and communities need as we enter the next century. Let me take a moment to highlight the major provisions of this legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to permit my home state of Vermont to enter the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) program. Before the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) all 50 states were qualified for SIB revolving funds. These funds are capitalized with federal and state contributions and used to provide loans and other sorts of non-grant aid to transportation projects. TEA-21 expanded the SIB program to California, Florida, Missouri, and Rhode Island. With this bill, I am proposing to add Vermont as a participant in the SIB program. 
   The SIB program functions to authorize loans to public or private organizations to cover the whole or partial costs of an approved project, and to make allowances for the planning and development of funding streams for repayment, which would not begin until five years after the completion of the project. Also, there is a provision in the TEA-21 for the creation of a multistate infrastructure bank system among the pilot states. In this system, states are encouraged to share both funds and ideas for curbing pollution and traffic problems and encouraging other forms of transportation. 
   It is my feeling that Vermont can be a national model on the efficiency of meeting clean air standards and managing sprawl while promoting economic growth. Under the SIB program the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VAOT) will collaborate with other state agencies and local organizations such as the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization (CCMPO) in order to reduce traffic, pollution, and growth problems that arise. 
   In order to fulfill these goals through creative, cutting-edge projects, VAOT will require sufficient funds. To secure these funds, the legislation that I am introducing today would extend the SIB program to include Vermont. This program will be an invaluable resource in the funding of projects that will prevent our beautiful state from moving in the direction of gridlock and congestion. 
   Vermont can be a model for the nation--an example for other states facing similar issues of finding a balance between growth and livability. Vermont's participation in the SIB program would provide more options to find the solutions that will permit this proper balance to be attained.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma's bringing this matter to my attention. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions is currently preparing legislation to reauthorize programs included in the elementary and Secondary Education Act. The reauthorization process offers an opportunity for congress to review the operations of these programs and to make appropriate modifications. During the last reauthorization of ESEA in 1994, we revised the Impact Aid Program in a way intended to target resources to districts based on their relative need in terms of serving federally connected children. I believe that is the right direction to take and am open to considering any proposal which assists us in better meeting this objective. I welcome the recommendations of all Members and look forward to further discussions regarding the problem which my colleague from Oklahoma wishes to address.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with much pride, and a little sadness, that I rise today to pay tribute to one of Vermont's outstanding leaders in education. Marc Hull, who recently resigned his post as Commissioner of Education in my home state, deserves both praise and gratitude for all he has accomplished for the children and youth of Vermont. 
   At a time when education rightly tops the state and national agenda, we have been fortunate to have his services. Marc has effectively advanced the education agenda of Vermont through his dedication and perseverence in making sure that every child achieves his or her highest potential, by setting high standards and giving children and teachers the means to reach them. To do so, he developed the Vermont Framework of Standards which is serving as the guide for improving the performance of all Vermont schools, and most importantly the performance of Vermont's students. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to salute Marc for his prior service to Vermont as Director of Special Education. He has consistently spoken for those who at one time had no voice and helped individuals advocate for themselves and their children. For years he has labored tirelessly to provide appropriate education programs for children with disabilities. 
   But despite these important positions and titles, I think of Marc as first and foremost a teacher. He has certainly taught me, and I think he has probably touched and inspired everyone around him. 
   I am especially fond of the example that stemmed from his visit to Washington, D.C. this spring. Marc had led Vermont's efforts to implement the federal Ed Flex law, and was invited by the President to attend the signing ceremony in the Rose Garden. At the ceremony, the President graciously gave Marc one of the pens he used to sign the legislation. For most of us, the story would have stopped there, as the pen gathered dust on our bookshelf or in a drawer. Not so for Marc. He took the pen with him to classrooms throughout Vermont so that hundreds of students had the thrill of writing a word or two with the pen the President used to sign the Ed Flex legislation. As usual, their comments were priceless, ranging from ``This must be worth millions!'' to ``Can I use it to write my name in my baseball cap?" 
   Marc Hull has written his name into the fabric of our state. With compassion for all whom he served, unique leadership skills and unsurpassed creativity, Marc has worked to make Vermont schools the best they can be. I am pleased that while he has left his post as Commissioner, he will not leave the field of education. And wherever he works, I know he will continue to have an impact on helping children to reach higher. 
   His integrity, humility and humanity make Marc Hull a wonderful advisor, a good friend and an asset to the nation. He's not a bad politician either, in the best sense of the word. Throughout my term as chairman of the Senate's education committee I have relied on his good counsel. Though he will never get proper credit, his influence has been felt far beyond the Green Mountains. I thank him, I wish him well, and I plan to continue learning from him.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to commend the service of Patricia Moulton Powden and Sue Davenport, two New Englanders who are ending their terms on the Board of Directors for the Northeast-Midwest Institute. Both have provided exceptional service to the Institute, and in the process helped to improve our region's economic development and environmental quality. The Northeast-Midwest Institute provides policy analysis for the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I co-chair with Senator Daniel Patrick MOYNIHAN from New York. 
   Patricia Moulton Powden is a fellow Vermonter who has served for the past 4 years as Treasurer of the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors. In that capacity, she provided careful oversight and helped the group's finances improve significantly. Within Vermont, Patricia is executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corporation. She also has served as Commissioner of Economic Development for the State of Vermont and Director of the St. Johnsbury Area Economic Development Office. 
   Sue Davenport has performed a variety of public service activities throughout New England. Currently, she is Executive Director of the Spurwink Schools-New Hampshire, which provide residential/day treatment programs for youngsters with emotional and behavioral handicaps, and their families. She has served as Commissioner of mental health and mental retardation for the State of Maine; adjunct faculty member at Suffolk University; Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and Acting Director of HHS's Regional Administrative Support Center. 
   Mr. President, I again want to thank these distinguished New Englanders for their leadership on the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors. They have provided valued service and helped increase that organization's reputation and effectiveness.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to an important article from the President of the Corporate Council on Africa, Dr. Mima S. Nedelcovych, concerning Africa's problem of severe dryland degradation (known as ``desertification'') as it affects our trade relations. 
   The Corporate Council on Africa, CCA, includes 180 members with substantial business interests in Africa, including such industry giants as General Electric, Ford Motor Company, IBM, Citibank, ConAgra, Cargill, AGCO, 3M, Pfizer, Land O'Lakes, Chevron, Texaco, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Raytheon and Rhone-Poulenc USA. Recently Dr. Nedelcovych, who also serves as Vice President for International Business Development for F.C. Schaffer & Associates, published a short article entitled ``Africa's Creeping Desert, A Problem for the U.S. Too,'' in the CCA's Perspectives on Africa (Fall 1999). 
   In it, Dr. Nedelcovych outlines clearly the extent to which the degradation of Africa's agricultural land is undermining one of the continent's most crucial natural resources, impeding economic growth, and slowing the hoped-for shift from aid to trade. Cocoa, coffee, cotton, cola nuts and spices grown in Africa end up in a myriad of everyday processed products on American store shelves, but land on which they are produced is increasingly threatened by a combination of bad management practices, drought and poverty. 
   As a boost to U.S. trade relations with Africa, Dr. Nedelcovych makes a strong case for full U.S. participation in the 1994 United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, not just because it seeks to help Africa's agricultural sector grow and achieve food self-sufficiency, but because it will also open greater opportunities for U.S. sales to Africa, including seeds, agricultural machinery, irrigation equipment as well as a wide range of automobiles, pharmaceuticals, electronic equipment and other goods to more prosperous African consumers. 
   Dr. Nedelcovych ends with an urgent plea for the Senate to ratify this important agreement without delay. With a world population now over 6 billion and fertile farmland shrinking at an alarming rate worldwide, I heartily support Senate action on the Convention to Combat Desertification.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to introduce today, for myself, and my colleagues from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senators KENNEDY, HARKIN, FRIST, COLLINS, WELLSTONE, REED, DODD, and MURRAY, The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This bill is the reauthorization of a piece of legislation with a rich legacy, and a long history of bipartisan Congressional support. Originally authorized in 1963 and last reauthorized in 1996, it has always focused on the needs of our most vulnerable citizens, an estimated four million individuals with severe disabilities, including individuals with mental retardation and other lifelong, pervasive disabilities. 
   Initial versions of this legislation focused primarily on the interdisciplinary training of professionals to work with individuals with developmental disabilities. The University Affiliated Facilities (UAFs) were the first federally funded programs charged with expanding the cadre of professionals to address the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. The name of these programs was changed to University Affiliated Programs (UAPs) in a subsequent reauthorization and their mission was expanded to include community services and information dissemination pertaining to individuals with developmental disabilities. Finally, in 1996, after 33 years of planned expansion by Congress, each State established and received core funding for at least one UAP. 
   In the 1970 reauthorization of the DD Act, Congress recognized the need for, and value of strengthening State efforts to coordinate and integrate services for individuals with developmental  disabilities. As a result, Congress established and authorized funding for State Developmental Disabilities Councils (DD Councils) in each state. The purpose of the Councils was, and continues to be, to advise governors and State agencies on how to use available and potential resources to meet the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. Every State has a DD Council. The Councils undertake advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities directed at improving access to community services and supports for individuals with disabilities and their families. 
   In 1975, Congress created and authorized funding for Protection and Advocacy Systems (P&As) in each state to ensure the safety and well being of individuals with developmental disabilities. The mission of these systems has evolved over the years, initially addressing the protection of individuals with developmental disabilities who lived in institutions, to the present responsibilities related to the protection of individuals with developmental disabilities from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and from the violation of their legal and human rights, both in institutions and in the community. 
   The 1975 reauthorization of the DD Act also established funding for Projects of National Significance. Through this new authority Congress authorized funding for projects that would support national initiatives related to specific areas of need. Over the years, projects related to areas such as people with developmental disabilities and the criminal justice system, home ownership, employment, assistive technology, and self-advocacy for individuals with developmental disabilities have been initiated through these projects. 
   The 1999 reauthorization of the DD Act builds on the past successes of these programs, reflects today's changing society, and seeks to provide a foundation to provide the services and supports that individuals with developmental disabilities, their families, and communities will need as we enter the next century. Let me take a few moments to highlight the major provisions of this bill. 
   The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999 continues a tradition of support for a DD Network in each State that is able to provide advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities in quality assurance, education and early intervention, child care, employment, health, housing, transportation, recreation and other services for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. This approach reflects current trends in society and in the field of developmental disabilities in that it emphasizes the empowerment of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families and joins it with state flexibility and increased accountability. 
   The bill continues and further develops the important work of the DD Act programs in each State. It seeks to ensure that more individuals with developmental disabilities are able to fully participate in and contribute to their communities through full integration and inclusion in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of our nation. It also assists DD Act programs to improve the quality of supports and services for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families regardless of where they choose to live. 
   Unfortunately, in keeping with other realities of our time, the bill also recognizes that individuals with developmental disabilities are at greater risk of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and the violation of their legal and human rights, than the general population. Based upon this recognition, the bill supports the extra effort and attention that is needed, in both individual and systemic situations, to ensure that individuals with developmental disabilities are put at no greater risk of harm than others in the general population. 
   The bill recognizes that individuals with developmental disabilities often have multiple, evolving, life long needs that require interaction with agencies and organizations that offer specialized assistance as well as interaction with generic services in their communities. The nature of the needs of these individuals and the capacity of States and communities to respond to them have changed. In the past 5 years, new strategies for reaching, engaging, and assisting individuals with developmental disabilities have gained visibility and credibility. These new strategies are reinforced by and reflected in this bill. 
   In the past, the Councils, Centers, and P&A Systems have been authorized to provide advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities to make access to and navigation through various service systems easier for individuals with developmental disabilities. Over time there has been pressure for these three programs to provide assistance beyond the limit of their resources and beyond their authorized missions. The bill clearly and concisely specifies the roles and responsibilities of Councils, Centers, and P&A Systems so that there is a common understanding of what the programs are intended to contribute toward a State's efforts to respond to the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. 
   The bill gives States' Councils, Centers, and P&A Systems more flexibility. Each program in a State, working with stakeholders, is to develop goals for how to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of and have access to needed community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self-determination, independence, productivity, integration, and inclusion in all facets of community life. Goals may be set in any of the following areas of emphasis: quality assurance, education and early intervention, child care, health, employment, housing, transportation, recreation, or other community services. 
   Consistent with Congressional emphasis on strengthening accountability for all federal programs, this legislation requires each program to determine, before undertaking a goal, how it will be measured. Measurement of a goal must reflect the impact of the goal on individuals with developmental disabilities. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to develop indicators of progress to evaluate how the three programs in each State have engaged in activities to promote and achieve the purpose and policy of the Act in terms of choices available to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families, their satisfaction with services, their ability to participate in community life, and their safety. In addition, the Secretary is to monitor how the three programs funded in each State coordinate their efforts, and how that coordination affects the quality of supports and services for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families in that State. 
   During the past several years, a clearer picture has emerged of what individuals with developmental disabilities are able to accomplish when they have access to the same choices and opportunities available to others and with the appropriate support. There has also been increasing recognition of and support for self-advocacy organizations established by and for individuals with developmental disabilities. This bill reflects and promotes such efforts by authorizing State Councils in each State to support self-advocacy organizations for individuals with developmental disabilities. 
   The legislation renames the University Affiliated Programs as University Centers for Excellence for Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service, expands their responsibilities to include the conduct of research, and links them together to create a National Network. 
   By administering the three programs specifically authorized under the DD Act and by funding projects of national significance to accomplish similar or complementary efforts, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) in HHS plays a critical role in supporting and fostering new ways to assist individuals with developmental disabilities and in promoting system integration to expand and improve community services for individuals with disabilities. This bill provides ADD with the ability to foster similar efforts across the Executive Branch. The bill authorizes ADD to pursue and join with other Executive Branch entities in activities that will improve choices, opportunities, and services for individuals with developmental disabilities. 
   The bill recognizes that forty-nine States have begun to develop family  support programs for families with children with disabilities. This supports States by providing grants (one, 3-year grant per State, on a competitive basis) to assist States to provide services to families who choose to keep their children with disabilities at home and not be forced to place their children in institutions due to the lack of support. The bill gives States maximum flexibility to use targeted funds to strengthen or expand existing State family support programs. 
   Finally, in response to a national need to increase the number and improve the training of direct support workers who assist individuals with developmental disabilities where they live, work, go to school, and play, the bill includes provisions proposed by Senators FRIST and WELLSTONE. One provides funding for the development and dissemination of a technology-based training curriculum to provide state of the art staff development for individuals in direct service roles with people with developmental disabilities and their families. The other is a scholarship program to encourage continuing education for individuals entering the field of direct service 
   Throughout the country, the DD Act programs have a long history of achievement. In Vermont, the DD Act programs make ongoing contributions to major initiatives affecting individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. They play significant roles in many of Vermont's accomplishments, including: the inclusion of children with severe disabilities into local schools and classrooms; early intervention and family leadership initiatives that are national models; and innovative programs in the areas of employment, and community living options for individuals with developmental disabilities. Based upon the letters our office has received from across the country, it is clear that these small programs make substantial, positive differences in their states. 
   The bill we present today reflects the foundation of what Congress has supported over the past 36 years, combined with our best efforts to support individuals with the most severe disabilities, their families, and their communities into the next century. It represents the best of what we in Congress have the opportunity to do ..... to ensure that those who are among our most vulnerable citizens, are protected, supported, and encouraged to achieve their potential. My colleagues and I are proud to present it to you today and hope to see it enacted as soon as possible.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate women in my home state of Vermont. It gives me great pleasure to speak in recognition of the Governor's Commission on Women of Vermont and to acknowledge their 35th anniversary. 
   Over the last 35 years, the Governor's Commission on Women has accrued a long list of achievements in the state of Vermont. It is a vibrant and healthy organization, dedicated to ensuring that women's rights, health, life choices, careers and community service are in sharp focus for policymakers and citizens alike. Commission members know how to use their strength of advocacy to empower women and raise the profile and scope of key issues. To highlight a recent endeavor, the Commission made it a priority to give all Vermonters a better understanding of their health benefits by offering a series of educational materials on managed care plans. 
   I have often said that community service is the cornerstone of democracy and I believe that each citizen has a responsibility to contribute to their community. The Governor's Commission on Women does just this, by addressing the pressing matters of concern throughout the state, such as poverty, child care and pay equity. For over three decades the Commission has taken on the ``tough to tackle'' issues. I was very pleased to partner with women's groups across Vermont, including the Commission, in the fight to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Although we suffered defeat on this particular issue, we knew we were successful in championing the message of equal rights. 
   Through a combination of their hard work, commitment and vision, the Vermont Commission has surpassed all expectations and created new, and I believe lasting, community partnerships. I am proud of what they have been able to achieve and I hope that others throughout the state and nation will look to the Commission's accomplishments and be inspired to act as resourcefully. 
   I have made it a personal priority to support the Commission's efforts to reach their goals and, because I am  committed to raising awareness at the federal level about the needs of women, I rely upon them for guidance. From a woman's right to make her own reproductive health choices, to supporting efforts to thwart domestic violence, to addressing the life quality issue of retirement security, I have had the opportunity to listen, to learn and to act on each of these issues in Congress. I encourage my colleagues to forge the same relationship of mutual reliance with any organization representing women in their respective states. I firmly believe that we can never shy away from efforts to understand, and eventually ameliorate the impacts of discrimination, low wages and lack of opportunities. 
   I extend my best wishes to the Governor's Commission on Women and to honor their very notable accomplishments over the past 35 years.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Vermonter, Dr. John Frymoyer. John's unwavering commitment toward improving the health of all Vermonters serves as a testament to us all. His long and distinguished career began at the University of Vermont in 1964. Now, as he prepares for his retirement, he is a stunning example of how much one person can accomplish in a lifetime--how one person can positively affect so many. 
   John began his career specializing in orthopaedics and quickly became one of the world's leading authorities on lower back pain--something many of us can relate to. He served as Chairman of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery from 1979-1987, and Chief Executive Officer of the University Health Center from 1987-1991. His leadership posts include the Director of the McClure Musculoskeletal Research Center and one of the founders of the Vermont Back Research Center. He also helped launch the acclaimed International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine. 
   John was one of the key architects of Fletcher Allen Health Care, which in 1995 combined the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Fanny Allen Hospital and the University Health Center. In doing so, Fletcher Allen emerged as one of northern New England's preeminent health care providers. It was a very bold move, but a necessary one considering the dynamics of our health care system. John rose to the challenge, and it was no surprise that he served as Fletcher Allen's first chief executive officer, simultaneously while he was at the helm of the College of Medicine. 
   Since 1991, John has served as Dean of the University of Vermont College of Medicine. Simply put, his accomplishments as Dean are far too many to list, but certainly, strengthening UVM's research programs, building a curriculum for the 21st century, and addressing the unique health care needs of our rural communities are among them. On a more personal note, whether as Dean, doctor or professor, John was always approachable, something I know his students, faculty and staff admired and appreciated. 
   I should also acknowledge John's willingness to personally advise me over the years on critical health care and education matters. As a longtime member, and now Chairman, of the committee which oversees health care and education policy, it was comforting to know that I could always rely on John's competence and expertise in such areas as medical research, telemedicine, home health care, graduate medical education and Medicare reform. In this, as in every other capacity, his mark has been left far beyond that of the UVM campus. It is this deep commitment to his patients, students and the greater community that has endeared him to us. 
   One might imagine that amidst all his responsibilities, John would find little time for extracurricular activities--not so. John is also an accomplished organist, a published author and a skilled woodworker. In fact, he designed much of the furniture adorning the Dean's office. He also helped design an extensive playground for Burlington's King Street Area Youth Program, and he served as a captain in the Vermont National Guard for eight years. 
   Vermont has much to be grateful for when it comes to John's steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life in our small state. Although he is retiring on the last day of this century, it is reassuring to know that his legacy will lead the College of Medicine, Fletcher Allen and the greater community we call Vermont, into the next millennium. For that, Vermont owes a great deal of gratitude to John Frymoyer. We wish him well.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization (CCMPO) for having won the 1999 Overall Achievement Award from the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations. 
   In receiving this award, the CCMPO is being recognized by its peers for excellence in coalition building, innovative planning and programming, integration of transportation planning with land use and community development, and for implementation of the Surface Transportation Equity Act. 
   Citizen participation, consensus building and pragmatic implementation have long been hallmarks of Vermont civic life. I am proud that the CCMPO has received such a prestigious award for bringing these qualities to their work. 
   The Chittenden County Metropolitan Organization is an effective administrator of federal and state transportation funds, but has gone well beyond this basic role to also develop alternative transportation plans and support public transportation systems. The CCMPO has also taken an active role in exploring the relationship between transportation planning and smart growth strategies, helping to make Vermont a nationally recognized leader in this subject area. 
   Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations in honoring the members and staff of the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization for their significant achievements.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today with a saddened heart at the passage of probably my best friend in the Senate, and the House. 
   It is not often we get to be close to someone in this body. Oftentimes, we have friendships, but they are not personal friendships. This was a personal one to me--starting from the time I first knew him in the House. When I came to this body in 1989, I was appointed to his committee, as I took the place of Senator Stafford from Vermont. And thus, I got to know JOHN immediately and found there was little, if anything, on which we ever disagreed. 
   His leadership on difficult decisions was without parallel to those I have known in this body. He was one of our greatest heroes in this Nation. I know others have exalted his wartime service at Guadalcanal as a marine. 
   Also, I remember having met him when he was Secretary of the Navy. I was in the Navy at the time. So my memories go back a long time. 
   But my friendship was mainly based upon JOHN's tremendous personality and his dedication to work and his ability to get things done. He was a man of courage on the battlefield and in the political arena. I do not know anyone who did not like and respect JOHN CHAFEE. 
   When I first came to the Senate in 1989, I served on the Environment and Public Works Committee with JOHN as my ranking member. He took me under his wing and helped guide me in the big shoes I had to fill in the wake of Bob Stafford, as I mentioned. 
   We had many trying problems at that time. We had the reauthorization of the Transportation Act. But the most memorable experiences I had dealt with the Clean Air Act, and not only in the committee but also having been appointed, along with him, by the then-majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, to be on the Clean Air Task Force. 
   As one can remember, that was one of the most contentious pieces of legislation with which we have ever dealt. It took the holding of hands and nursing each other along to make sure we could get the votes necessary to pass that very controversial act. That placed me in even greater awe of JOHN's capacity to lead and to be listened to. 
   I also recall in 1995 and 1996 meeting day in and day out in JOHN's office to develop a centrist health care package. We spent a year as JOHN toiled trying to pull together a middle ground on a health care package. JOHN's work to do that was well recognized. Although it never came to fruition at that time, it did give an alternative to the plan which had come from the White House and did give us all something to work on to try to develop a health care package that would serve this Nation. Although it did not work then, and did not work more recently, it was tried from the center, and it did give to us many thoughts and approaches which have been adopted in the health care package which did pass this body. 
   JOHN's work to preserve the environment, especially for New England, to me, again, showed he was a leader. 
   JOHN and I ate lunch together every Wednesday for the last 
   10 years, along with some others, especially from New England, and also ARLEN SPECTER. But we always discussed the matters of policy on which we would have agreement.  Also, I spent several evenings with JOHN at dinner, when he would say, hey, let's go down to the Metropolitan Club, or elsewhere, and have dinner together. Those were also memorable moments in my life, as we had many things to discuss; but it was as much about ourselves and our families as it was about the great problems of the Nation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we once again are debating legislation to ban the dilation and extraction, or D&X, procedure used by doctors. I am again opposed to this legislation and will once again be voting against this ban for the fifth time in as many years. 
   My reasons for opposing this legislation are many. Most have been discussed on the floor during the many debates on this difficult issue. First, and most importantly I believe that this bill undermines the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade to leave these critical matters in the hands of a woman, her family and her doctor. The pending legislation is an effort to chip away at these reproductive rights established in that 1973 decision and upheld by court cases since 1973. I understand many people disagree with my position. This issue has been contentious since I came to Congress in 1975. 
   Second, with the Roe decision, the Supreme Court wisely gave states the responsibility to restrict third-trimester abortions, so long as the life or health of the mother were not jeopardized. As of 1999, all but ten states have done so. To me, the rights of states to regulate abortions, when the life or health of the mother are not in danger, is an adequate safeguard. In the event the states pass unconstitutional regulations on this point, the appropriate remedy is with the courts. I realize that this policy leads to differences in law from state to state, but just as families differ, so too do states. As has been said before during the debate on this issue:  
   When the Roe v. Wade decision acknowledged a state interest in fetuses after viability, the Court wisely left restrictions on post-viability abortions up to states. There are expert professional licensing boards, accreditation councils and medical associations that guide doctors' decision-making in the complicated and difficult matters of life and death.  
   Third, the legislation before us would prevent doctors from using the D&X procedure where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. This clearly goes against the holding of the Supreme Court in Roe, as it required the health of the mother be safeguarded when states regulate late-term abortions. I will not vote for a bill that is neither Constitutional, nor takes into account those situations where carrying a fetus to term would cause serious health risk for the mother. This is simply unacceptable. My vote in 1997, in favor of the Feinstein substitute amendment underscored my commitment to safeguarding a doctor's options to protect the health of the mother in cases where a late-term procedure is necessary. 
   Finally, I believe that women who choose to undergo a D&X procedure do so for grave reasons. We have established a delicate legal framework in which to address late-term abortions and we should not shift the decision making to the federal government.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank Senator GREGG for recognizing the need of three Vermont towns to upgrade, modernize and acquire technology for their police departments in this Conference Report. Allowing these police departments to improve their technology will permit them to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide. 
   Reflecting the needs of the police departments, the $1 million in technology funds for these three towns should be divided on the following basis: one-half ($500,000) to the Burlington Police Department, one-third ($333,000) to the Rutland Police Department, and one-sixth ($167,000) to the St. Johnsbury Police Department. Again, I appreciate his help in addressing the technology problems these towns' police departments are facing. I look forward to working with him to get this important appropriations bill signed into law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first thank Senator BOND for all of his hard work on the FY 2000 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, and the attention he paid to priorities in my home State of Vermont. I would like to briefly discuss with the Senator from Missouri the $600,000 provided in the Conference Report for the Vermont Rural Fire Protection Task Force. 
   It is my understanding that the funds provided are for the purchase of personal safety equipment that includes, but is not limited to the following: self-contained breathing apparatus, fire resistant turn out gear (helmets, coats  pants, boots, hoods, gloves, and the like), personal pagers, personal accountability system to fulfill requirements of OSHA's two in two out rule, portable radios and personal hand lights. The need for new firefighting equipment is great in Vermont, because of the new OSHA regulations. I hope that the funds provided in this bill will be matched 50 percent with non-federal funds. 
   Further, it is my understanding that the funds will be administered by the Vermont Rural Fire Protection Task Force supported by the George D. Aiken and the Northern Vermont Resource Conservation and Development Council.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure and a privilege for me to be here to honor my colleague. We came into the Congress together. That moment is most memorable to me. I was at a reception and missed the first vote in the House. I thank the Senator for never burdening me with that. I am privileged to be his colleague. 
   For four decades, PAT has served Vermont. At the time he was a Chittenden County prosecutor, I was attorney general. We worked very closely together to make sure that Vermont was protected. 
   In his position, he has gained national and international recognition on many issues. He has led the fight to rid the world of landmines and continues to aid victims of these weapons through the Leahy War Victims Fund. He has helped bring the computer age to the Senate, helped educate all Members on the value of the Internet, and continues to champion environmental issues. 
   He always remembers his roots. I am sure I speak for him when I say that his proudest accomplishments are those that make Vermont a better place. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that Vermont receives full consideration before the Senate. He has protected Vermont dairy farmers, maintained funds for programs to preserve the waters of Lake Champlain, and helped fulfill George Aiken's legacy by adding lands to the Green Mountain National Forest.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to stand before the Senate today and speak of an organization that has, for the past 25 years, been committed to ending violence toward women and children. The organization is called Women Helping Battered Women (WHBW) and their goal is simple: create a living environment for women and children that is free from fear of battering--sexual, physical, emotional or financial. On the occasion of their 25th anniversary, WHBW, through their direct service, their advocacy and their educational and outreach programs stands as an example for us all and, unfortunately, are as crucial today as they were 25 years ago. 
   We must not shy away from the impacts of domestic violence. In the United States, a woman is battered by a partner every seven seconds and thirty percent of Americans know a woman who has been physically abused by their husband or boyfriend in the last year. In my home state of Vermont, I shudder when I hear that domestic violence touches over 16,000 Vermonters each year. In Chittenden County alone, an overwhelming 59% of all reported crimes since January 1998 have been domestic-related disturbances. We often perceive Vermont as one of the safest states in the nation, however, the incidence of domestic violence in Vermont continues to rise. 
   As a result of WHBW's work, over 3,500 Vermonters' lives were positively touched during difficult and dangerous times in their lives. I'd like to highlight their PARADIGM project, a joint educational partnership with the Woman's Rape Crisis Center. The PARADIGM project serves to educate students, churches and professional and community groups, in the hope of breaking the cycle of violence in the home and in our communities. 
   Mr. President, you may see me and others wearing a purple ribbon, to symbolize our commitment to ending violence against women and children in our state, and across the nation. Yet it is the day to day work of Women Helping Battered Women--it is their strength and advocacy--that continues to make a difference and helps Congress focus on this issue. Congress made a commitment to the women behind the statistics when we passed the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). I will continue to work to fulfill this pledge to millions of women and families who have suffered, by fully funding this important Act which supports shelters, counseling, training, and law enforcement. In fact, my work helped to double the fiscal year 1997 allocations for community level demonstration projects and to increase the domestic violence hotline funds. Congress also included funding targeted exclusively to combat domestic violence in rural areas--especially important in my home state of Vermont. We must continue the work we began with the passage of VAWA and pass a reauthorization of these vital programs. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 51, the Violence Against Women Act II. I pledge to work with my colleagues to get this needed legislation passed in the near future. 
   I applaud WHBW's leadership and the creative initiatives they have undertaken to build and maintain a multi-cultural organization which empowers staff, volunteers, and the women and families they serve. I commend Woman Helping Battered Women for their crucial work in breaking the silence for victims, supporting women and children in meeting their most basic needs in times of great difficulty, educating our communities, and working to heighten public awareness of this growing epidemic. 
   Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to provide my colleagues with a shining example of a group of dedicated individuals actively engaged in the war against domestic violence. I join other Vermonters in offering my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Women Helping Battered Women for their many years of good work.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the completion of the Lake Champlain/Saint Albans Historical Diorama. 
   This interactive educational exhibit at the Saint Albans Historical Museum is ambitious in its geographic and historic scope. It spans the entire Champlain Valley, from Fort Ticonderoga to the Richelieu River and also spans time, from pre-history to the present. 
   The people of Saint Albans have a tremendous understanding and respect for their history, as seen by the fact that this exhibit was funded entirely through local contributions and completed in just over a year, with most of the work done by residents of Saint Albans and neighboring towns. It is a beautiful addition to one of Vermont's finest historical museums. 
   The Champlain Valley is the birthplace of the United States and Canada. For two hundred years the Champlain Valley was the stage for conflicts between the French and the English, and then for the most critical campaign of the Revolutionary War. In times of peace, the Champlain Valley has been an important corridor of commerce. Important sites from this history are displayed and interpreted in the Diorama, including wonderful scale models of the region's lighthouses. 
   The Diorama also depicts the local history of Saint Albans, displaying her historic structures, rail yards and neighborhoods in great detail. These events and places are brought to life in three dimensions, engaging and educating the viewer as is possible with no other medium. 
   Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize the Saint Albans Historical Society and all of the others who have helped to create the diorama. This is a significant contribution to the heritage of Vermont.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as we begin the debate on campaign finance reform to discuss my thoughts and hopes on the actions the Senate will be taking in the coming days. 
   First, let me thank the sponsors of the legislation, Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD, for their tireless perseverance to enact campaign finance reform. Without their hard work and vast knowledge, we would not be at this important point. I would also like to thank the majority leader, Senator LOTT, for working with Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD to schedule this time for what I hope will be a full and open debate on this important issue. I look forward to hearing and debating the many ideas of my colleagues and believe the Senate should strive over the next couple of days to show why we are considered the greatest deliberative body in the world. 
   Mr. President, I was first elected to Congress following the Watergate scandal, right around the time Congress last enacted comprehensive reform of our campaign finance system. I have watched with growing dismay over my almost 25 years in Congress as the number of troubling examples of problems in our current campaign finance system have increased. These problems have led to a perception by the public that a disconnect exists between themselves and the people that they have  elected. I believe that this perception is a pivotal factor behind the disturbingly low voter turnouts that have plagued national elections in recent years. 
   While some may point to surveys that list campaign finance reform as a low priority for the electorate, I believe that the public actually strongly supports Congress debating and enacting comprehensive 
   reform this year. It is important to reverse the trend of shrinking voter turnout by reestablishing the connection between the public and us, their elected representatives, by passing comprehensive campaign finance reform. 
   As I said earlier, I look forward to a full and open debate on the issue of campaign finance reform including the amendments that will be offered. At the end of this debate, the Senate should be able to pass comprehensive campaign finance reform. That to me is the most important aspect of any bill the Senate may pass, it must be comprehensive. If we fail to address the problems facing our campaign finance system with a comprehensive balanced package we will ultimately fail in our mission of reforming the system. Closing one loophole, without addressing the others in a systematic way, will not do enough to correct current deficiencies, and may in fact create new and unintended consequences. 
   Mr. President, we have all seen first-hand the problems with the current state of the law as it relates to sham issue advertisements. I have focused much time and effort on developing a legislative solution on this topic with my colleague Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE, and was pleased that this solution was adopted by the Senate during the last debate on campaign finance reform. I was also proud to cosponsor the comprehensive campaign finance bill Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD introduced earlier this year that included this legislative solution. 
   While I understand the rationale my colleagues used in crafting the base legislation that we are debating, I feel strongly that the legislation the Senate must ultimately vote on include some kind of changes to the current law concerning sham issue advertisements. I feel that we have crafted a reasonable, constitutional approach to this problem and will be offering it as an amendment during this debate. 
   That does not mean, though, that we will stop working with our colleagues to craft additional, and perhaps different, ideas to address the problems with the current law on sham issue advertisements. My ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive campaign finance bill that will garner the support of at least 59 of my other colleagues, and hopefully more. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the upcoming full and open debate on this important issue, and pledge to continue working with my colleagues to enact comprehensive campaign finance reform into law this year. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the DrugGap Insurance for Seniors Act of 1999, which will provide much-needed insurance coverage for medicines for low-income seniors, and will allow all other seniors, for the first time, to purchase an affordable, drug-only insurance policy to protect them against the runaway cost of drugs. 
   Mr. President, we are all aware that prescription drug costs continue to grow at an alarming rate. Seniors are being forced to spend greater and greater portions of their fixed incomes on prescription drugs that they need to live. Research and development of prescription drugs have come a long way since Medicare was originally enacted in 1965. Today, drugs are just as important, and in many cases more important, than hospital visits. It does not make sense for Medicare to reimburse hospitals for surgery, but not provide coverage for the drugs that might prevent surgery. That is why I am committed to modernizing the Medicare program so that it does not go bankrupt in the next 10 to 15 years. In addition, we must ensure that any Medicare reform proposal we consider includes a prescription drug benefit that helps all seniors. 
   This is a basic coverage problem that we must address as we modernize the Medicare program, and it is one of my top priorities. Ideally, it should be part of broad Medicare reform. Even if we are not able to achieve broad reform in the Medicare program this year, we must at least do something to address this basic need for seniors. 
   Today, I am introducing a bill that will target the most needy seniors. Currently, Medicare beneficiaries can purchase private insurance plans, called Medigap plans, to pay certain health care expenses that are not covered by Medicare. The law allows Medigap insurers to offer ten standardized plans to beneficiaries. However, only the three most expensive Medigap plans cover prescription drugs. 
   My plan calls for three new Medigap insurance plans to be developed that will cover only prescription drugs. The federal government will use a small portion of the budget surplus to purchase these new ``DrugGap'' policies for low-income Medicare beneficiaries who do not already have prescription drug coverage under Medicaid or through an employer sponsored plan. This bill provides all seniors the option of purchasing affordable, comprehensive coverage for prescription drugs even if they do not qualify for the federal government purchase plan. The bill also includes reforms to the Medigap system to give seniors more choice, and to keep Medigap premiums affordable. 
   Mr. President, this bill offers several significant advantages to Medicare beneficiaries who need coverage for prescription drugs. First, nothing will change for those Medicare beneficiaries who like their current Medigap plans. This bill will offer more choices for Medicare beneficiaries, but will not make seniors change coverage that they like. 
   Second, this plan does not mandate prescription drug benefits on the current standardized plans, which some critics have argued will raise premiums. Indeed, one of the goals of this legislation is to make Medigap more affordable, and to seek solutions to the problem of the spiraling cost of Medigap premiums. This bill offers a way to accomplish this goal. 
   This bill also gives DrugGap policy holders access to the deep discounts on drugs that HMOs get, even if the beneficiary has not met the policy's deductible, and makes it clear that insurance companies can issue drug discount cares to Medigap policy holders even if the policy doesn't cover prescription drugs. 
   Finally, this bill will provide federal grants to the states for counseling for seniors regarding this new benefit. 
   Mr. President, this bill is not a substitute for the much-needed Medicare reform and Medicare drug benefit, but it is a positive step that we can take right now to protect Medicare beneficiaries until Medicare reform can be achieved, and a broad drug benefit is implemented. I hope my colleagues will support this moderate approach to helping Medicare beneficiaries deal with the runaway costs of prescription drugs.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill. I oppose the Agriculture funding bill not because of what's in the bill, but because of what has been left out. 
   I have listened to several of my colleagues speak in support of the disaster aid in this bill. They have spoken passionately on how we need to help our family farms. I, too, support providing relief to farmers and ranchers across the nation who have suffered from weather and market related disasters. 
   However, this bill has ignored one of this nation's most important agriculture sectors--our dairy farmers. The bill, which provides $8.7 billion in aid to farmers, in large part as direct payments, has neglected dairy farmers, not only in my home state of Vermont, but the dairy farm families in the entire country. 
   Unlike the commodity farmers throughout the country, dairy farmers have not asked for assistance in the form of federal dollars. Instead, they have asked for relief from a promised government disaster in the form of a fair pricing structure from the Secretary of Agriculture and the extension of the very successful Northeast Dairy Compact, at no cost to the federal government. 
   Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues from the states and regions of the country that will be receiving billions of tax payer dollars in aid for their farmers, that the Northeast Dairy Compact has no cost to the federal government and has no adverse impact on any farmer outside the compact region. 
   If my colleagues who have opposed our efforts to bring fairness to all dairy farmers truly supported family farms across this country they would support my efforts to help protect the dairy farmers in my state as well as the dairy farmers in the rest of the nation. 
   While Congress is providing needed government assistance to commodity farmers across the nation, I would like to remind my colleagues on just how well the Dairy Compact helps dairy farmers protect against sudden drops in the price of their products. 
   This no cost initiative has given farmers and consumers hope. In large part based on the success of the Northeast Compact, which includes the six New England states, no less than nineteen additional states have adopted dairy compacts. 
   In total, twenty-five of the states in the country have passed compact legislation. During the past year Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, Kansas, and Missouri have all passed legislation to form a southern dairy compact. Texas is also considering joining the Southern Compact. 
   The Oregon legislature is in the process of developing a Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact. In addition, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania have passed state legislation enabling them to join the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm bill as a three-year pilot program, has been extremely successful. The Compact has been studied, audited, and sued--but has always come through with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the Compact it has served 
   as a model for the entire country. 
   One look at the votes cast by each state legislature, and you can see that there is little controversy over what is in the best interest for the consumers and farmers in each respected state. For example, in Alabama and Arkansas, both legislative chambers passed compact legislation unanimously. It passed unanimously in the North Carolina House. In the Oklahoma State Senate, it passed by a vote of 44-1 and unanimously in the Oklahoma House. It passed unanimously in the Virginia State Senate and by a vote of 90-6 in the Virginia House. In Kansas, the bill  passed in the Senate by a vote of 39-1 and an impressive 122-1 in the Kansas House. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact was also approved on overwhelming votes in each of the New England state's legislative bodies. 
   Mr. President, given its broad support among the states, we all know that the issue of regional pricing is one that will continue to be debated. I am pleased with the tremendous progress the Southern states and other Northeastern states have made to move their compacts forward. 
   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman COCHRAN, Senator SPECTER and others progress has been made. 
   While the debate continues, we must allow the Northeast Compact to continue as the pilot project for the concept of regional pricing. 
   I am, of course, aware that some of my colleagues oppose our efforts to bring fairness to our states and farmers by continuation of the Northeast Dairy Compact pilot project. However, why do Members who share my admiration and respect for family farms oppose an initiative that has no cost to the federal government and has no adverse impact on farmers outside the region? 
   Unfortunately, Congress has been bombarded with misinformation from an army of lobbyists representing the national milk processors, led by the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Milk Industry Foundation. These two groups, backed by the likes of Philip Morris, have funded several front groups such as Public Voice and the Campaign for Fair Milk Prices to lobby against the Dairy Compact and other important dairy provisions. 
   The real fight over dairy compacts should not come from Members of the Senate that support protecting small farms and consumers, but from the National Milk Processors who work against all farmers to the benefit of their bottom line, because they control the price now, and that gives them higher profits. All we want is a fair price. 
   It is crucial that Congress debate the issues presented on dairy compacts on the merits, rather than based on misinformation. When properly armed with the facts, I believe you will conclude that the Northeast Dairy Compact has already proven to be a successful experiment and that the other states which have now adopted dairy compacts should be given the opportunity to determine whether dairy compacts will in fact work for them as well. 
   Mr. President, federal dairy policy is difficult to explain at best. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I served as the ranking member of the Dairy and Livestock Subcommittee. During my years in the House, I worked very closely with the programs that impacted dairy farmers and consumers. I know the industry, I know the policies, and the compact is a raving success. 
   Of all the programs and efforts by the federal government to help our nation's dairy farmers and protect the interests of consumers, the most effective and promising solution I have seen thus far is the 
   creation and operation of the Dairy Compact. 
   Unfortunately, many of my colleagues have not yet seen the benefit of compacts and may be basing their reasons on misinformation. 
   In addition to being sound public policy, the Dairy Compact represents a state's right to do all it can under the law to protect its farmers and consumers. 
   The courts agree that the Compact is legally sound. Last January, a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to the Dairy Compact by the Milk Industry Foundation. The Court found that the Compact was constitutional and the U.S. Agriculture Secretary's approval of the Compact was justified. 
   In November of 1998, a Federal district court judge also ruled in favor of the Compact Commission in a challenge brought by five New York-based milk processors. The court found that the Commission had the authority to regulate milk that is produced or processed outside of the region but distributed within the Compact region. In each case, the courts found that the work of the Commission is of firm and legal grounds. 
   Mr. President, in recent weeks Governors from throughout the Northeast and Southeast sent a letter to the Majority Leader of the Senate and House, urging Congress to consider and support the Dairy Compact legislation. 
   The Governors of the Compact regions speak not only for their farmers and consumers but for the rights of the States. The message to Congress from Governors nationwide has been clear. ``Increase the flexibility of states and support legislation that promotes state and regional policy initiatives.'' 
   Governors from the twenty-five Compact states represent diverse constituents. They have all considered the benefits and potential impacts by compacts on all those in their states. In the state of Rhode Island for example, there are nearly six million consumers and only 32 dairy farmers. Yet, the dairy compact passed overwhelmingly in the Rhode Island State legislature and is supported by the entire Rhode Island delegation. A similar story is true for Massachusetts. 
   As I mentioned previously in my statement, nearly all the states supported the Dairy Compacts overwhelmingly. 
   The success of the three year pilot program of the Northeast Dairy Compact, has created an opportunity for a partnership between Congress and the States, to help strengthen the fundamental federalism movement. 
   The New England states by joining together as one are doing what any large state can do under the law such as California. A large State can do it. We can't because of the commerce clause. We have to join together and get a compact. We did that. 
   The reauthorization of the successful experimentation of the Northeast Compact and the creation of a Southern Compact as a pilot program will help maintain that the States' constitutional authority, resources, and competence of the people to govern is recognized and protected. 
   Mr. President, the Compact also stands on firm constitutional grounds. Does Congress possess the authority to approve the Northeast Interstate and Southern Dairy Compacts? 
   The answer to this question is clear, simple, and affirmative. Under the Compact Clause of the United States Constitution, states are expressly authorized to seek congressional approval of interstate compacts, even states in the Upper Midwest. And congressional approval, once given, endows interstate compacts with the force of federal law. The Compact Clause, and the Compacts that Congress may license under it, are important devices of constitutional federalism. 
   Despite what some of my colleagues have said, the Northeast Dairy Compact is working as it was intended to. Instead of trying to destroy an initiative that works to help dairy farmers with cost to the federal government, I urge my colleagues to respect the states' interest and initiative to help protect their farmers and encourage that other regions of the country to explore the possibility of forming their own interstate dairy compact. 
   For many farmers in Vermont and New England, the Compact payments have meant the difference between keeping the farm and calling the auctioneer. 
   Dairy farming in Vermont represents over seventy percent of the agricultural receipts in the state. No other state relies on one sector of agriculture more than Vermont depends on dairy. 
   What we were trying to accomplish in the Agriculture Appropriations bill was about helping farmers and protecting consumers. Farmers deserve our support and recognition. It is sometimes easy to forget just how fortunate we are in this country to have the world's least expensive and safest food supply. 
   Dairy farmers work harder than many of us realize. The cows have to be milked at least two times a day, 365 days a year; farmers work on the average 90 hours per week, an average of 13 hours a day; farm owners receive an average hourly wage of $3.65, take few if any vacations or holidays and have no sick leave. That is why they are so sensitive to something which may destroy or reduce the prices. 
   Prices received by farmers in the month of October will be lower than the prices received over 20 years ago. Can you imagine maintaining your livelihood or business with salaries of 20 years ago? Think about what that means to consumers also. The price of milk, if you look on an inflationary scale, is well below what it would be for softdrinks or anything else.  
   I am certain that my colleagues will agree with me that dairy farmers deserve a fair price for their product. What does it say about our values when some of the hardest working people, our farmers, are underpaid and unappreciated? Mandating option 1-A and continuing the dairy compact ensures that dairy farmers will have the needed tools to help face the challenges of the future. 
   In Vermont, dairy farmers help define the character of the state. I am proud to work to protect them to protect the traditions and special qualities of the state. Dairy is not just a farming operation for Vermont and other states in New England, it is symbol of our culture, history and way of life. Its survival is a highly emotional subject. 
   Vermonters take pride in their heritage as a state committed to the ideals of freedom and unity. That heritage goes hand and hand with a unique quality of life and the desire to grow and develop while maintaining Vermont's beauty and character. Ethan Allan and his Green Mountain Boys and countless other independent driven Vermonters helped shape the nation's fourteenth state while making outstanding contributions to the independence of this country. 
   Today, that independence still persists in the hills and valleys of Vermont. Vermonters have worked hard over the years to maintain local control over issues that impact the charm and quality of the state. Vermont's decision to enhance and protect its wonderful scenic vistas by prohibiting bill boards along its highways and roads was a local, statewide decision. Because of the vision Vermonters many years ago had, driving throughout Vermont enjoying the beautiful landscapes and nature beauty is a pleasurable experience. And it would not be without cows on the hillside. Vermonters choose to control their state's destiny. They should, as any other state have the right to protect their consumers, farmers and way of life. 
   Most Americans know Vermont as a tiny state in the Northeast that has good skiing, great maple syrup, and beautiful fall foliage--a charming place where the trees are close together and the people are far apart--far from the problems that plague many communities across the country. It is nearly impossible to drive down any country road in Vermont and not pass a farm with a herd of cows. Dairy farms still define the nooks and crannies of the rolling hills. Maybe there's a small pond nearby and a few horses or sheep. Or maybe there's a pasture with bales of hay and cows lining up at the barn waiting for milking time. 
   The look of Vermont distinguishes it as a throwback to a bygone, simpler time. Vermont is the home of stone fences, covered bridges, and red farmhouses. Vermonters have a special place in their hearts and lives for farmers. 
   Vermonters of today are struggling to keep step with the modern world while holding onto the state's classic rural charm and agriculture base. It's a difficult task requiring much thought and work. But then again, overcoming difficulties through hard work is what the native Vermonter is all about. Farm families know all about hard work. 
   Mr. President, dairy farmers did not ask Congress for billions of dollars in disaster aid? Instead, and most appropriately, they asked Congress to provide them with a fair pricing structure and the right of the states to work together at no cost to provide a structure that would help them receive a fair price for their product--not a bail out from the federal government. 
   Therefore, I must oppose the Agriculture Appropriations bill and suggest that Members whose farmers will be getting federal dollars in disaster assistance take a close look at how the Northeast Dairy Compact helps protect farmers and consumers with no cost to the federal government or any adverse impact on farmers outside the compact region. 
   I urge my friends to watch closely what is happening to dairy and to give us the opportunity to continue to live in a beautiful State with cows on the hillside. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate finds itself in a very uncomfortable position today. We have before us one of the most important treaties negotiated this decade, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is not perfect. It does not do everything we wish it would. Its verification provisions are not air-tight, and its sanctions for violators are not particularly stiff. 
   I understand many of my colleagues' uneasiness about the treaty. Prior to last week, there had been no deliberate consideration of the CTBT before any Senate committee. Members have had little opportunity to learn about the treaty and have their questions addressed. A significant portion of the Senate has just in the last two weeks begun to carefully examine the details of the treaty. This is no way to conduct the ratification process on a matter of such importance to national security, and puts Senators in a very uncomfortable position. For some time, I have urged the Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings on this treaty and allow this debate to begin. But for better or worse, this is the situation we find ourselves in, and having exhausted appeals for a delay in the vote, I trust my colleagues will do their best to thoroughly evaluate what is now before them. 
   Implementation of the CTBT would bring, however, a significant improvement in our ability to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Test Ban Treaty would constrain the development of new and more deadly nuclear weapons by nations around the globe by banning all nuclear weapon test explosions. It would also establish a far-reaching global monitoring system and allow for short-notice on-site inspections of suspicious events, thereby improving our ability to detect and deter nuclear explosions by other nations. The fact that the CTBT was signed by 154 nations is a major tribute to American diplomacy. Many of these nations are now looking to America for leadership before they proceed to ratification of the treaty, and under the provisions of the treaty, it will not enter into force until the United States has ratified. 
   Rejection of the test ban treaty could give new life to dormant nuclear testing programs in countries like Russia and China. It could also renew dangerous, cold war-era nuclear arms competitions. And we would have a very  difficult time asserting our leadership in urging any nation to refrain from testing. Not only would we lose an historic opportunity to lock in this agreement among nations, we would undermine the power of our own diplomacy by not following through on an initiative that we have spearheaded. 
   Critics charge that we cannot be 100 percent certain that we can detect any test of any size by any nation. I would concede that is true. But when it comes to national defense, nothing is 100 percent certain. We can never be sure any weapon will work 100 percent of the time. We can be certain, however, that this treaty will improve our ability to constrain the nuclear threat today and in the future. We owe it to our children and our grandchildren to add this important weapon to our defense arsenal. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for all his tremendous work on this bill. Most of what I wanted, however, did not succeed. It was not because of his lack of effort. He has put a tremendous amount of time in trying to make the bill more acceptable to those of us who live in the Northeast. 
   It is with great disappointment that I stand before the Senate to express my reasoning for opposing the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill, the bill that provides funding for agriculture programs, research and services for American agriculture.  
   In addition, the bill provides billions of dollars of aid for farmers and ranchers throughout America who have endured natural and market disasters. However, and most unfortunately, it neglects our Nation's dairy farmers. 
   I understand the importance of funding these programs and the need to provide relief for farmers. However, dairy farmers throughout the country and the drought stricken Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions have been ignored in this bill. For these reasons, I must vote against this bill. 
   The Agriculture appropriations bill provides $8.7 billion in assistance to needy farmers across the country. I believe they should receive the help of the Federal Government. What is troubling is that dairy farmers are not asking for Federal dollars, but instead are asking for a fair pricing structure for their products, at no cost to the Government. 
   The drought-stricken Northeastern States are not asking for special treatment, just reasonable assistance to help deal with one of our region's worst drought. 
   Weather-related and market-related disasters do occur and we must as a nation be ready help those in need. In Vermont, in times of need, a neighbor does not have to ask another for help. Vermonters are willing to help, whether it is plowing out a neighbors snow covered driveway or delivering hay to Midwestern States during one of their worst droughts, which we did some years ago to save Wisconsin and Minnesota from terrible problems. 
   This summer weather conditions in the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic put a tremendous strain on the region's agricultural sector. Crops throughout the region were damaged or destroyed. Many farmers will not have enough feed to make it through this winter. Water for livestock and dairy operations dried up, decreasing production and health of the cows. 
   The Northeastern and mid-Atlantic States were not asking for much. Just enough assistance to help cope with the unpredictable Mother Nature. 
   America's dairy farmers need relief of a different kind. There is no need for the expenditure of Federal funds. Commodity farmers are asking the government for relief from natural and market disasters. Dairy farmers are asking for relief from the promised Government disaster in the form of a fair pricing structure from the Secretary of Agriculture. That is all we are asking. 
   Unless relief is granted by correcting the Secretary's Final rule and extending the Northeast Dairy Compact, dairy farmers in every single State will sustain substantial losses, but not because of Mother Nature or poor market conditions, but because of the Clinton administration and a few here in Congress have prevented this Nation's dairy farmers from receiving a fair deal. 
   Unfortunately, Secretary Glickman's pricing formulas are fatally flawed and contrary to the will of Congress. The Nation's dairy farmers are counting on this Congress to prevent the dairy industry from being placed at risk, and to instead secure its sound future. 
   Secretary Glickman's final pricing rule, known as Option 1-B, was scheduled to be implemented on October 1 of this year. However, the U.S. District Court in Vermont has prevented the flawed pricing rule from being implemented by issuing a 30 day temporary restraining order on Secretary Glickman's final rule. The court finds that the Secretary's final order and decision violates Congress' mandate under the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the plaintiffs who represent the dairy farmers would suffer immediate and irreparable injury from implementation of the Secretary's final decision. 
   The temporary restraining order issued by the U.S. district court has given Congress valuable additional time to correct Secretary Glickman's rule. 
   We must act now. With the help of the court, Congress can now bring fairness to America's dairy farmer and consumers. 
   Instead of costing dairy farmers millions of dollars in lost income, Congress should take immediate action by extending the dairy compact and choosing Option 1-A. 
   The Agriculture appropriations bill which includes billions of dollars in disaster aid seemed like the logical place to include provisions that would help one of this country's most important agricultural resources without any cost to the Federal Government. 
   Giving farmers and consumers a reliable pricing structure and giving the States the right to work together at no cost to the Federal Government to maintain a fresh supply of local milk is a noble idea, and it is a basic law of this Nation. 
   It is an idea that Congress should be working towards. Instead, a few Members in both the House and Senate continue to block the progress and interest of both consumers and dairy farmers. 
   This Congress has made its intention abundantly clear with regard to what is needed for the new dairy pricing rules. Sixty-one Senators and more than 240 House Members signed letters to Secretary Glickman last year supporting what is known as Option 1-A, for the pricing of fluid milk. 
   On August 4 of this year, you will recall the Senate could not end a filibuster from the Members of the upper Midwest, but did get 53 votes, showing a majority of the Senate supports Option 1-A and keeping the Northeast Dairy Compact operating. Most recently, the House passed their version of Option 1-A by a vote of 285 to 140. 
   Both the House and Senate have given a majority vote on this issue. Thus, I felt very hopeful that its inclusion would have been secured in the Agriculture appropriations bill or some other place. 
   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman COCHRAN, the Senate stood firm on these important dairy provisions in conference. For days he worked hard to hold the line to include these. His farmers should be very appreciative of his efforts to bring about another compact of a demonstration program for the Southeast. The Southeast is another special area of the country that needs help just to organize their pricing system better to help farmers survive. 
   Although the House would not allow the provisions to move forward, both Chairman COCHRAN and Senator SPECTER led the fight for the dairy provisions. Farmers from Mississippi and Pennsylvania should be proud of the work and commitment of their Senators. 
   In fact, dairy farmers throughout the country should be thankful for the tremendous support their livelihoods have received from Chairman COCHRAN, Senator SPECTER, Senator BOND, and others on the Agriculture appropriations conference. Since then, there have been opportunities supported by the Senate to extend the compact and both times it failed because of lack of support in the other body. 
   With the Senate's leadership, the dairy provisions had a fighting chance in the conference committee. Unfortunately, time and time again House Members rebutted our efforts to include Option 1-A and include our dairy compacts in this bill. 
   If not for the actions of the House conferees dairy farmers could embrace this bill. 
   The October 1, 1999, deadline for implementation of the Secretary's rule has come and gone, but with the help of the district court, Congress still has time to act. 
   We must seize this opportunity to correct the Secretary of Agriculture's flawed pricing rules and at the same time maintain the ability of the States to help protect their farmers, without additional cost to the Federal Government, through compacts. 
   I understand the significance of the disaster aid in this bill and do not want to prevent the farmers and ranchers throughout the country from receiving this aid. However, in order to protect dairy farmers in my State, as well as farmers throughout the country, I most oppose this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, right now, my home state of Vermont is celebrating Disability Employment Awareness Month. For that reason, I am delighted to speak about the ``Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999,'' legislation that I developed with my colleagues, Senators KENNEDY, ROTH and MOYNIHAN. This Act, also known as the Work Incentives Improvement Act (WIIA), is the most important piece of legislation for individuals with disabilities since the Americans with Disabilities Act. This legislation is bipartisan. This legislation was brought to the floor of the United States Senate with 80 cosponsors. And, most importantly, this legislation passed through the Senate on June 15th with a unanimous vote of 99-0. 
   The ``Work Incentives Improvement Act'' addresses a fundamental flaw in current law. Today, individuals with disabilities are forced to make a choice, an absurd choice. They must choose between working and receiving health care. Under current law, if people with disabilities work and earn over $500 per month, they will lose their cash payments and health care coverage under Medicaid or Medicare. This is health care coverage that they need. This is health care coverage that they can not get in the private sector. This is not right. 
   Individuals with disabilities want to work. They have told me this. In fact, national surveys over the past 10 years have consistently confirmed that people with disabilities want to be part of the American workforce. But only one-third of them do work. With the enactment of WIIA, these individuals would not need to worry about losing their health care if they choose to work a forty-hour week, to put in overtime, or to pursue a career advancement. Individuals with disabilities are sitting at home right now, waiting for this legislation to become law. Having a job would provide them with a sense of self-worth. Having a job would allow them to contribute to our economy. Having a job would provide them with a living wage, which is not what one has through Social Security. 
   Currently, there are 7.5 million individuals with disabilities across the nation who receive health care coverage and cash payments from the federal government. 24,000 of these people live in Vermont. Only, one-half of one percent of the 7.5 million work to their full potential, because, when they earn over $500 per month, they lose their access to health care coverage. The first part of my legislation tackles this problem. In states that elect to take up this option, WIIA provides continuing access to health care for Social Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries who work and exceed the income threshold. 
   Recognizing that some SSI and SSDI recipients will need job training and job placement assistance, the second part of my bill provides these incentives. People with disabilities would have more choices in where to obtain vocational rehabilitation and employment services. In addition, we would increase the incentives to public and participating private providers serving these individuals. 
   This legislation makes sense. When I came to Congress in 1975, one of my legislative priorities was to provide individuals with disabilities access to the American dream. Through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Assistive Technology Act, we have consistently improved the lives of people with disabilities. Unfortunately, one major flaw remains, providing health care to individuals who want to work. The enactment of the Work Incentives Improvement Act would diminish this flaw in federal policy. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act reflects what individuals with disabilities say they need. Over 100 national organizations have given us their input and endorsed our bill. The President has made it clear that he would like to sign this legislation into law by the end of the current year. The Incentives Improvement Act provides the opportunity to bring responsible change to federal policy and to eliminate a misguided result of the current system--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, you don't get health care. The Work Incentives Improvement Act makes living the American dream a reality for millions of individuals with disabilities, who will no longer be forced to choose between the health care coverage they so strongly need and the economic independence they so dearly desire. 
   I am looking forward to having my colleagues in the House of Representatives finish their work on the Work Incentives Improvement Act. Let's send this bill to President Clinton by the end of this session of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senators SPECTER and HARKIN for including in the manager's package an amendment cosponsored by my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator REED, myself and others increasing funding for the LEAP program. 
   LEAP is an extraordinarily program that provides grant aid to needy undergraduate and graduate students. This federal program can be credited in large part with encouraging States to create, maintain and grow their own need-based financial aid programs. It is a program that relies on a partnership for its strength by matching the federal investment in grant aid with State dollars. The end result is a good one: increasing the pool of funds available to assist low income students who are struggling to pay for college. 
   As part of the 1998 Higher Education Amendments, we made significant changes to the LEAP program with the goal of making additional grant aid and a greater array of services available to post-secondary students. We challenged States to increase the match that they contribute by offering $2 for every one federal dollar that we make available for this program. With the additional funds, States will have greater flexibility to provide more services to meet the diverse needs of low income students who are working to make the dream of a higher education degree a reality. 
   I am proud to stand with the National Association of State Student Grant Aid, NASSGAP; the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, NAICU, the American Council on Education, ACE, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, AASCU; the United States Public Interest Research Group, USPIRG; and the United States Student Association, USSA in support of this amendment that I believe will provide significant assistance to the students of this nation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment and reluctance that I stand before the Senate to express my reasoning for opposing the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. This bill provides funding for agricultural programs, research, and services for American agriculture. In addition, it provides billions of dollars of aid for farmers and ranchers throughout America who have endured natural and market disasters. 
   However, and most unfortunately, it neglects our Nation's dairy farmers. I understand the importance of funding these programs and the need to provide for farmers. However, dairy farmers throughout the country, drought-stricken farmers in the Northeast, have been ignored in this bill. Congress is willing to provide billions of dollars in assistance to needy farmers across the country. Dairy farmers in States are not asking for Federal dollars but for a fair price structure for how their products are priced. 
   Vermonters are generally men and women of few words. Given that the State's heritage is so intertwined with agriculture and the farmer's work ethic, whether fighting the rocky soil or the harsh elements, Vermonters have developed a thick skin. If Vermonters want advice, they will ask it. Until then, it is best to keep one's mouth shut. 
   Indeed, a Vermonter will rarely meet a problem with a lot of discussion but, rather, with a wry grin and perhaps a shrug. If there is a blizzard and the temperature is below zero, the Vermonter will most likely put on his boots and grab a shovel. Talking isn't going to make the snow melt, but hard work will clear a path so the mailman can get to the door.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I commend the Senator from New Jersey for his very realistic look at this bill. I would like to emphasize that there is so much more than the ordinary disaster in here. It has nothing to do with hurricanes and the drought. And the billions of dollars for the Northeast, which had the drought and problems and all, have nothing to do with farmers. Not only that, the program they have--which costs no money and which has given security to the farmers and helped the consumers--will not go forward. They rejected our attempts to put it in there. 
   The Senator from Oregon, I believe, desires to speak on another matter. I would like to finish up with a few more remarks, and then I would be happy to yield. We may have one other Member coming over to speak on dairy. But I know he also supports this effort, and I appreciate that very much. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that unlike years ago, the Federal pricing program has essentially no Federal cost and no Federal subsidy. So here we are arguing for something to protect our farmers, to protect consumers, to protect the processors with a reasonable price, and we cannot get it approved, when billions of dollars are being spent in the disaster bill for nondisasters--except a lower price. That is a disaster, but it is not the kind of disaster we look to for protection by the Federal Government. 
   The overall loss to dairy farmers caused by the overall final rule is even more startling. We are back on 1-B, the one the Secretary of Agriculture jammed down the farmers' throats. Fortunately, the courts have put a stop to that. 
   The Secretary's final rule will drop the price paid for cheese by as much as 40 cents per hundredweight of milk. That is the way we look at how we reward the farmers for each hundredweight of milk. Dairy economists estimate that U.S. dairy farm annual income will fall in total by at least $400 million or more under the Secretary's final decision. 
   Who benefits from that? Do the consumers? No. There is no evidence whatsoever that they will benefit. Who will benefit? The processors, the ones that buy the milk. Their profits will go up. The farmers' profits will go down. And the consumer prices will go up. What we are trying to set up is a system where that does not occur. The Northeast is projected to lose $80 million to $120 million per year under 1-B. 
   The Southeast loses $40 to $60 million. The upper Midwest will lose upwards of $70 million, even though, as the chart in red shows, they lose a lot less. In fact, they gain. On the other hand, most areas of the country will be better off under option 1-A, including the upper Midwest. Marginally increasing producer income in most regions of the country, option 1-A is based on solid economic analysis, benefiting both farmers and consumers. It takes into account transportation costs for moving fluid milk, regional supply and demand needs, the cost of producing and marketing milk, and the need to attract milk to regions that occasionally face production deficits. 
   In early August, dairy farmers were given the opportunity to vote for option 1-B or reject the Federal Milk Marketing Order Program. That is right. There were two choices given to dairy farmers: Either approve option 1-B or have no Federal order program. Which is it? It is not a surprise that the farmers overwhelmingly chose the lesser of two evils. 
   There was no sense to this. There was no reason to allow it to occur. Correcting the Secretary's final rule, as part of the Agriculture appropriations bill, would have prevented dairy farmers across the Nation from losing millions of dollars in income. 
   Let me also explain briefly, before I turn to my friend from Oregon, the votes were in the conference committee to put in what we are trying to do. They were there. However, what happened? Just as we were about to have that vote, people from processors and others came in, and the leaders who were behind this move were able to convince those Members not to vote for what we want here, which is basically real help to farmers and consumers. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, at least until my good friend from Oregon has finished.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine has a brief statement to make on the bill that we are talking about. I know the Senator from Florida has a brief statement, and I have no objection to the Senator from Florida leading. I also thank my friend from Oregon for his remarks about a very serious topic. 
   I yield to the Senator from Florida.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be finishing quickly. I would like to point out--exactly where the Senator from Maine left off--why we are here. It may be a little confusing why we are involved in a conference report, but it was pointed out in the farm bill of 1996, we got agreement that we should run a pilot program in New England of a very exciting idea, of a compact where the States would get together and handle the problems of their dairy farmers by having an organized marketing system. 
   We would show this kind of a system where people from the States would sit down on a commission and make sure the price of milk was held at a level which would guarantee a supply of  fresh fluid milk, which is a basic part of agricultural law, and that the demonstration program would be reviewed when the milk orders were to be implemented. 
   What happened? Did the program work? That was the problem, it did. That is why we are here tonight because the program did work. 
   As the Senator from Maine pointed out, the opponents of this, in the Midwest in particular, were so confident it was going to fail, they went out and got the OMB, who they figured would be most friendly to them being of the administration, many Democrats--whatever, that is beside the point--but so certain were they that it would be a failure, they got OMB to do a study. 
   Lo and behold, what happened? The study came back, and the GAO later came back and said it worked great, it is a wonderful program. That is why 25 States now have said that ought to be a program in which they can get involved. Half the States in the country have already said it is a success. OMB said it is a success. 
   What is the problem now? Why? Because of the desire of those in the Midwest to take over and supply these areas with milk themselves and not the local dairy farmers, which helps make sure we have that fresh quality milk available, they decided they will put them out of business. 
   They cannot put them out of business because it is working. The processors, who have been used to setting the price themselves--in many cases there are one or two; there are not many processors, so when there is a good supply of milk, they can go to zero. That has stopped. It is working well. 
   The Department of Agriculture was not going to do the pilot program. We had to get it extended. 
   That is where we are. We wanted to extend it, and when we had one, at least we thought we had one in the conference committee that we would have approved because the majority in the House and Senate agreed it was a good program and ought to be extended, what happened? Forces came in and put pressure on Members and we ended up without a majority in the committee. Therefore, we got thrown out into the cold. 
   We are here to make sure this bill, which belonged on that conference report, that everyone seemed to agree to, goes forward. That is why we are now trying to hold up this bill to get action. We are not going to try to hold up the bill for the disaster payments. We will get into a further discussion of this whole bill and the stuff in it. 
   The one part that worked so well that does not cost any money and prevents disasters, we cannot get it put into law. That is why we are here. We are going to continue. We are going to fight as long as we possibly can to make sure the dairy farmers in our States, the family farms, the small, beautiful hillsides that have their nice wonderful cows will be there for people to look at, and we will have a fresh supply of milk from our local farms. 
   Hopefully, since it was such a successful program, the 25 States that have already passed laws through their legislatures to participate in the compact will have the wonderful opportunities that have been so successful in New England. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators MOYNIHAN, LEAHY, ROBB, KERREY, ROCKEFELLER and GRAMS of Minnesota in the introduction of the Pension Reduction Disclosure Act. This bill greatly expands current law and will provide improved disclosure of the impact of the conversion of a traditional defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance or other hybrid pension plan. We believe that current law protections are insufficient to protect the interests of plan participants. The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act is an important first step in improving worker pension protections. I am also pleased that the President supports this bill. 
   Appropriate disclosure for cash balance pension plans is a serious public policy issue affecting the retirement benefits of millions of Americans. At a minimum, employees should have meaningful notice when their employer plans to reduce pension benefits in the switch from a traditional to a cash balance plan. 
   This bill does that. 
   First, employers have not always been candid with employees about what the changes in pension plans will mean for the employee's retirement. Our bill will require that they spell it out in black and white, and do so in language that anyone who is not an actuary or tax attorney can understand. 
   Second, plan sponsors will have to provide this information in a timely manner, so that employees can engage their employer and seek changes if they choose to do so. As we have seen at IBM and elsewhere, companies can misjudge the impact of these changes on their workforce. 
   Third, plan sponsors will be required to provide their employees with specifics about the effect that the change will have on their retirement benefits so that individuals can understand the financial impact that the conversion will have on their pension. Once we pass this bill, my guess is that employers will think long and hard about what changes they want to make to their pension plans. 
   Long-serving, loyal employees should not wake up to find their pension benefits slashed without even the chance to confront their employer. We can't expect people to save for retirement if the sand is forever shifting under their feet. 
   This bill addresses but one part of the conversion issue. But I think it deserves widespread bipartisan support. I believe that there are more issues at stake for workers, such as my own concerns regarding the pension benefit  ``wear away''. However, the Pension Reduction Disclosure Act is a good first step we ought to take to address the legitimate concerns that have been raised about these plans. 
   We don't have a lot of time, but I hope we can send this bill to the President for his signature before we adjourn this fall.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to stand before my esteemed colleagues and speak of my good friend, Cornelius Hogan, who is retiring as Secretary of the Vermont Agency of Human Services. His work in leading state government to improve the well-being of Vermonters stands as a example for us all. 
   The Vermont Agency of Human Services includes the departments of Social Welfare, Corrections, Social and Rehabilitation Services, Mental Health, Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Aging and Disabilities. Secretary Hogan has not only administered these vital services through extraordinary changes, but has provided outstanding leadership, recognized throughout the Nation. This agency, with the State's largest budget, must have a human face in its efforts to improve the lives of Vermonters. Con Hogan is that face. 
   Secretary Hogan has served as Vermont's Secretary of Human Services since 1991 when then-Governor Richard Snelling enticed him back into public service from his successes in the private sector. Previously, Hogan served as Commissioner of Corrections. 
   Throughout his eight year tenure, Con has been remarkably effective and always gracious in his approach to each challenge. When Vermonters in need have a problem, Con has been the person that folks turned to when all else had failed. As Chris Graff, a Vermont journalist, noted:  
   Hogan is a legend. And for the past eight years, when people knew that Con Hogan was coming, they had hope. And confidence. Confidence that whatever the trouble, whatever the problem, whatever the need, someone who cared deeply would do what ever it took to help.  
   As a result of Con's work, Vermont families and communities have improved educational opportunities, a better health care system, increased employment for the disabled and an expanded network of family support services. By demanding that government define, seek, and evaluate its efforts, Con has set a new example for public service in Vermont and the country. 
   More Vermont children have health care coverage, and have had it for longer, than almost any state in the country. The state is offering more home and community based care options for the elderly and disabled. Disabled Vermonters are working and, thereby, supporting themselves and their families. Con Hogan's ultimate legacy will be the thousands of lives that have been directly touched by the work of the Agency of Humans Services under his stewardship. 
   He, of course, will describe his work as collaborative and the consequence of others' good will and efforts. He is right, as he has led efforts to open government to the ideas, hopes, and information from citizens, industry and business. He has fostered a real public debate about the well-being of Vermonters and the responsibilities of government and its citizens to participate, evaluate, and dream for better things. 
   Secretary Hogan's vision is alive and full of vibrant change. Con has changed our ways of thinking. He is the mastermind of dozens of partnerships in which human services providers now collaborate with others in state and local governments, and communities to deliver locally-based services. Con recognizes and encourages citizen participation as essential to this process. He has convinced service providers that they should listen to real people - that the child, the elder or the youth needs to be the center of their concerns. 
   Over the last several weeks, many Vermonters have written to their local papers, touting Con Hogan's work as Secretary. Con has significantly changed thousands of Vermonters lives, both through policy and through his own untiring advocacy. The results have impressed his colleagues and friends alike. 
   I was moved when I read a commentary in the Burlington Free Press by my good friend, David S. Wolk, Superintendent of Schools in Rutland City. David pointed out that it was Con Hogan's success in the private and public sectors, as well as his impeccable reputation as both a manager and a leader, that led then-Governor Snelling to appoint him as the state's premier advocate for Vermonters in need. 
   David aptly notes that Con's relentless advocacy has been coupled with his unique capacity to reach out to the wider community. His strong and effective leadership has presented important dualities:  
   Con Hogan could have remained in the private sector to seek his fortune and fame. Instead, he offered a selfless contribution to public service, an emphasis on accountability with measurable outcomes and an impressive brand of leadership, combining pressure and support, characterized by candor  and courage...... If the ultimate goal of the consummate public citizen is to improve our collective lot, and to enjoy the privilege of making one's personal mark on Vermont's well-being, then no other public citizen called to service in our wonderful state has achieved that pinnacle more than Cornelius D. Hogan of Plainfield.  
   On a personal note, I have enjoyed witnessing Con's talents, not only in public service but on the stage, as an accomplished bluegrass musician. Con's passion and zeal for life is evident in all that he does. 
   Mr. President, I'm sure I could stand here all day, and regale my colleagues with stories and tributes to this remarkable man and still, Con's contribution would not be described adequately. For us to thoroughly understand the impacts of his sage and exemplary leadership, the outcomes of Con Hogan's service to Vermonters will need to be measured far into the new millennium. 
   I join my fellow Vermonters in offering my most heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Con Hogan for his years of public service, and I wish him all the best in his new endeavors.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my good friend from Connecticut. We have been working for years to draw the attention of the public to the essential need that we pay more attention and provide help in the child care area. Each year we get the support of our Members. Each year we have successfully gotten agreements for billions of dollars of the budget, but the time is now to do something real. That is why we are here, to make sure we make a commitment, not only make a commitment but provide the funds to enable our society to be able to take advantage of all that can be done to make sure our children have an opportunity to participate in the best possible way in our society. 
   This amendment will almost double the funds that provide low-income working families with the help they need. The amendment increases funding for the child care and development block grant from about $1.83 billion to $2 billion. This block grant has always been forward funded so no offset will be required. States are struggling to meet the escalating child care needs of low-income families, and they are transitioning off of welfare. States have already transferred $1.2 billion in TANF funds into the child development block grant; other States use TANF dollars directly to pay for child care costs; while still others have spent all of their TANF funds and have nothing left to transfer. 
   Still this is not enough. States have waiting lists for child care subsidies provided under the CCDBG. In addition, many States provide subsidies so low-income families are forced into the cheapest and in many cases the poorest quality child care. 
   There are more than 12 million children under the age of 5, including half of all infants under 1 year of age, who spend at least part of the day being cared for by someone other than their parents. There are millions more school-age children under the age of 12 who are in some form of child care at the beginning or end of the school day as well as during school holidays and vacation. More 6-to-12-year-olds who are latchkey kids return home from school to no supervision because parents are working and there are few, if any, alternatives. 
   While the supply of child care has increased over the past 10 years, there are still significant shortages for parents in rural areas with school-age children or infants and for lower income families. The cost of child care for lower middle-income families can rival the cost of housing and the cost of food. The most critical growth spurt is between birth and 10 years of age, precisely the time when nonparental child care is most frequently utilized.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, everyone should realize this is  the year we start reevaluating the educational programs of this country. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is up for reauthorization. This is most comprehensive. It is the one bill we look at to try and get guidance from the Federal Government in the area of elementary and secondary education. 
   There are many things we must be concerned about. One of those has been raised by the Senator from Washington--class size. There are many other issues to be involved. In addition, this is an attempt to authorize on an appropriations bill. It is not the time. The time is when we take up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have begun doing that. The committee has been very active. We held over 20 hearings on what should be done to make the Elementary and Secondary Education Act more successful. 
   This Nation, as everyone has articulated, is in an educational crisis situation. We have many wonderful schools and many wonderful teachers, but relative to our competition in other areas of the world, we could be doing much better. The question is, What do we do and how do we do it? On the 23rd of June this year, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a hearing on the class size proposal. We have had this under review. Statements were heard from an expert panel of witnesses who offered an array of views on the merits of creating a Federal program that mandated local communities use funds to lower class sizes. 
   We examined important issues, including the impact of reducing class size on student achievement and other factors impacting student achievement; the tension between quantity and quality with respect to hiring teachers; whether large class sizes are the biggest obstacle to improving student achievement; and the value and role of schoolteachers in making decisions for providing the best education to young people in their schools. 
   What did the witnesses who came before the Committee have to say? Dr. Eric Hanushek, a respected professor at the University of Rochester stated, for the record:  
   a move to mandate smaller classes ...... is misguided and could even hurt students and student achievement; ...... the accumulated evidence on the impact of reduced class size on student performance gives no reason to expect that the current wave of class size reduction will have an overall effect on student achievement; and that class size is very expensive and takes resource and attention away from potentially more productive reform efforts.  
   He based his views on extensive research and historical evidence. In U.S. history, between 1965 and 1995, pupil-teacher ratios have fallen from 25:1 to 17:1 yet performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has remained roughly constant. That produces no evidence that class size makes a difference. He noted that while pupil-teacher ratios are defined somewhat differently than class-size, the two measures do move together. International comparisons suggest no relationship between pupil-teacher ratios and student performance. So in Europe their studies show the same as reported in ours: It doesn't make a difference. In looking at some 300 advanced statistical studies, the studies show an equal number of studies that suggest positive improvements as suggest negative effects. 
   We also heard from Dr. Randy Ross, who spoke not from a research-based perspective but from the heart and common sense. He has witnessed the results of class size reduction efforts in California first hand and is concerned about what he saw. He stated:  
   A wholesale reduction in the sizes of classes in schools throughout a state predictably nibbles away at the chances that students in poor, inner city neighborhoods will get a better education.  
   He watched the better teachers in low-income neighborhoods be lured away to higher paying suburban schools, leaving the inner-city schools to fill vacancies which those individuals that did not make the cut in other school districts. It is a policy that has hurt students, not helped them. 
   At this same hearing, we talked at length about the Innovative Education Program Strategies, or title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Witnesses on that panel told us how states and local education agencies are improving student achievement by investing in reform efforts, education technology, professional development, school library activities, and support for at-risk students. I would argue that investing in any one of these activities may have a more profound and significant impact on helping students achieve at higher levels than mandating that a local school hire one more ``teacher''--qualified or not. 
   Let's not forget our common sense in this debate. My common sense says the quality of the teacher does matter. Common sense tells me that local leaders in schools across the country have the student's best interest at heart and must have a say in implementing programs that will provide the greatest benefit to their students. If class size reduction is the greatest need in a community, we can all rest assured that local leaders throughout the country will direct their portion of the $1.2 billion made available in this bill to that effort. There is no need for my colleagues to worry. 
   If on the other hand, local leaders have other ideas for ways to vastly improve the educational opportunities of young people in their communities, in their classrooms, I think we should provide them with some flexibility to do what is best for the student, and what is best in accordance with that community. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am forced to vote against the Energy and Water conference report. Not to do so would be to break a commitment to small businesses across America, to hurt farmers and ranchers and rural communities, and to threaten the energy security of the United States. 
   The people across the United States demand increased funding for renewable energy. Poll after poll shows that our citizens believe we should spend more on renewable energy. 
   A majority of the United States Senate--54 Senators--believe we should increase funding for renewable energy. 
   This bill defies the will of the American people and a majority of U.S. Senators. It does not provide more money for renewable energy. It provides less money. It provides 130 million dollars less than the administration's request. It cuts funding for renewable energy by 30%. 
   Mr. President, by decreasing funding for renewable energy, we jeopardize the security of our Nation, we hurt small businesses, ranchers, farmers, and rural communities, we hurt our ability to compete internationally, and we hurt the environment. 
   Mr. President, our Nation needs to increase domestic energy production--not cut funding for developing an unlimited source of energy made in America. Our Nation needs a lower balance of payments--not an increased trade deficit. We need to help farmers, ranchers, and rural communities develop affordable, reliable, locally produced energy--not cut it off. We need to stand up for U.S. companies selling U.S. manufactured energy technologies in overseas markets--not leave them dangling in the wind while the Japanese and Europeans grossly outspend us. We need to spur job markets in every state in the Nation--not send our good jobs overseas. 
   Apparently there are still some who fail to realize that clean, domestic energy production is important. Perhaps they have not noticed that the U.S. has a trade deficit larger than any other nation, ever. Or maybe they have forgotten that imported foreign oil is the number one contributor to our trade deficit. Or maybe they just do not realize what the rest of the nation has long ago realized--that clean, made in America renewable energy can give us the energy security, jobs, and healthy environment that our people demand. 
   I am deeply disappointed in the severe cuts to renewable energy in this bill. I vow to fight even harder next year to give renewable energy the funding it deserves.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, September 23rd was the 2-year anniversary of submission of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the US Senate for ratification. 
   Both Republican and Democratic presidents over the span of 4 decades have worked to enhance our national security by negotiating limits on nuclear testing. Progress has been slow and halting, but the inescapable logic of improving security by banning nuclear tests has prevailed. The successful negotiation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signed by 152 countries, was the culmination of these decades of effort on the part of the United States. Ratification and entry into force of this treaty is in our best interest and in the best interest of nuclear non-proliferation and international stability. 
   Mr. President, I have urged the Committee on Foreign Relations to hold hearings on this treaty. I know the Chairman has concerns about the treaty. I hope he will air them in a forum that will allow discussion of his concerns and those of other Members of the Committee. And I urge the Majority Leader to bring this treaty to the Senate floor. Time is of the essence on this matter. America has been the world leader on this issue and was the primary architect of this treaty. We have an obligation to take up this treaty in the Senate, to educate ourselves on its provisions and to debate the merits of its ratification. The eyes of the world are on our actions as the 44 countries who have ratified the treaty prepare to meet on October 6th in Vienna, Austria, to discuss implementation of the treaty. I would vastly prefer that the United States were sitting as a party at that meeting. But at a minimum, we should use this opportunity to make progress on the treaty here in the Senate. 
   We have an obligation to future generations to improve the national security of our nation. It would be irresponsible of us to let slip out of our grasp a very important tool in the fight against nuclear proliferation.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to publicly acknowledge the five Vet Centers from around this country that are being recognized for their superior services as ``Vet Centers of Excellence.'' While I am proud of the fine facilities located in California, Arizona, Georgia and West Virginia, the one I want to praise today is in my state of Vermont. 
   Vermont is very fortunate to have two Vet Centers--in fact we boast the first in the nation back in the days when the Readjustment Counseling Service (RCS) was just getting started with pilot sites strategically located around the country. The nation's first Vet Center, an excellent facility, was designed to help veterans in the Burlington, Vermont area. 
   The Vet Center we honor today opened in mid-1981 and is located in White River Junction, Vermont. It serves veterans on both sides of the Connecticut River in Vermont and New Hampshire. The team leader, Tim Beebe, assesses their work modestly, saying ``we are just doing our job.'' Maybe they don't understand the impact they have. This incredible staff go so far above their ``job''. They are caring, involved and understanding friends, devoted to offering a safe haven to those veterans suffering the emotional wear and tear of battle, often thirty years after leaving the service. 
   I am sure I don't need to remind my colleagues in Congress that the work being done at Vet Centers throughout the Country is enormously important. Over the years, the Vet Center program has been so successful in meeting the readjustment needs of Vietnam veterans that the VA Readjustment Counseling Service expanded the scope of their good work to veterans of all eras. This move was heartily endorsed by Congress and is now law. Long before this mandate, however, the White River Junction Vet Center subscribed to an open door policy to all veterans. Their message was simply put: ``Welcome home--you are not alone.'' 
   Mr. President, I believe in the great work being done by Vet Centers everyday throughout this country. I also know, however, that a ``Vet Center of Excellence'' award is only given to the those centers that stand a little taller than the rest. The White River Junction Vet Center staff exemplifies excellence. I want to offer my warmest congratulations to this incredibly talented group of professionals and remind them that they are shining examples to their colleagues in the 206 Vet Centers around the United States.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce the Medicare Wellness Act of 1999. This legislation will modernize Medicare benefits and improve the preventive care received by our nation's seniors. 
   The Medicare program was designed in 1965 to provide seniors with access to the same health care services enjoyed under private health insurance plans. Medical science has grown by leaps and bounds in the decades since that time. Most of the private sector acted swiftly to cover preventive benefits when they realized that it is cheaper to screen for an illness and treat its early diagnosis than to pay for drastic procedures in a hospital later on. Congress has been too slow in extending to Medicare beneficiaries the same advances in quality care enjoyed throughout the rest of the health care system. 
   The Medicare Wellness Act adds to the Medicare program those benefits recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. These include: screening for hypertension, counseling for tobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone replacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, expanded screening and counseling for osteoporosis, and cholesterol screening. These are some of the most prominent risk factors facing Medicare beneficiaries. If these symptoms are addressed regularly, beneficiaries will have a head start on fighting the conditions they lead to, such as diabetes, lung cancer, heart disease, blindness, osteoporosis, and many others. 
   Beyond the eight new preventive benefits under this bill, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) will conduct a study every five years to assess the scientific validity and cost-effectiveness of the preventive benefits package. When presented to Congress, the study will recommend what, if any, preventive benefits should be added, or removed from the Medicare program. By facing such regularly scheduled considerations of preventive benefits, Congress will do a much better job of keeping the Medicare program up to date with the rapid advances in medical science. 
   The Medicare Wellness Act also instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Care Financing Administration to establish a Risk Appraisal and Education Program. This program will target both current beneficiaries and individuals with high risk factors below the age of 65. Outreach to these groups will offer questions regarding major behavioral risk factors, including the lack of proper nutrition, the use of alcohol, the lack of regular exercise, the use of tobacco, and depression. State of the art software, case managers, and nurse hotlines will then identify what conditions beneficiaries are at risk for, based on their individual responses to the questions, and inform them of actions they can take to lead a healthier life. 
   Any modern health care professional can tell you that effective health care addresses the whole health of an individual. A lifestyle that includes proper exercise and nutrition, and access to regular disease screening ensures attention to the whole individual, not just a solitary body part. It is time we reaffirm our commitment to provide our nation's seniors with quality health care. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, Senators GRAHAM, CHAFEE, BRYAN, ROCKEFELLER, and KERRY for their dedication to the idea of changing Medicare from a sickness program to a wellness program. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator SLADE GORTON, Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for his, as well as his staff's, efforts to work with me and my staff to address concerns regarding  a potential funding freeze for the Weatherization Assistance Program. I am very pleased that the Chairman was able to obtain an additional $2 million, at my urging, for the Weatherization Assistance Program, increasing the FY 2000 funding level to $135 million. 
   Weatherization is an especially critical program to the Northeast-Midwest region. It increases energy efficiency in low-income homes, reducing energy use by up to one-third. More than four and a half million households have been weatherized through this program over the past twenty years. Weatherization returns $1.80 in energy savings for every dollar spent; and provides an additional $0.60 in employment and environmental benefits. 
   This year, 31 Senators voiced support for an increase in weatherization funding. In light of recent forecasts of rising fuel costs, weatherization funding has never been more critical. By providing targeted support in anticipation of extreme weather conditions, we can ensure the health, safety, and well-being of millions of low-income families, including the especially vulnerable populations of low-income children and elderly.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators BENNETT, CHAFEE, KENNEDY, MOYNIHAN, and REED, I am pleased that the Managers of the bill have agreed to support our proposal for a funding increase for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
   First let me commend Senators GORTON and BYRD for starting this discussion out on the right foot. They provided modest increases for the NEA, NEH and IMLS under very difficult circumstances. I applaud the leadership they have shown in recognizing the important role that each of these agencies play in strengthening our nation's cultural institutions and expanding opportunities for participation in cultural activities. 
   My support for these agencies runs deep because I know that the grants that they make have a positive impact on the state of Vermont and nearly all who live there. The NEA and NEH make it possible for more Vermonters to have access to the arts and humanities in their many different forms and shapes--literature, art history, dance, music, folkarts, history and theater. 
   In number terms, the positive impact of the arts and the humanities is statistically significant. It can be measured in terms of increased academic  achievement and better outlook on life for those school-aged children that have the opportunity to participate in the arts or humanities experience. 
   In terms of education, students of the arts outperform their ``non-arts'' peers on the SAT. Even when one takes into consideration the economic status of a family, kids from low-income families that participate in the arts had higher grades in English, were less likely to drop out by grade 10, were less ``bored'' in school, had a higher ``self concept,'' and placed a higher value on volunteerism than their low-income peers with low arts involvement. 
   The arts have demonstrated effectiveness in making a difference for youth at-risk by decreasing truancy and increasing enthusiasm for learning. Students engaged in the learning process are less likely to get into trouble and the arts have proven themselves are one of our best tools in this effort. The hard data backs up these claims. 
   In other instances, the positive impact of the arts and humanities can be ``measured'' by a smile that grows on the face of a person listening to the music of the Vermont Symphony at a free summer concert; it can be ``quantified'' by the deeper understanding one gains about storytelling and the New England folk culture thanks to programs sponsored by the Vermont Folklife Center; it can be ``gauged'' by a young person's spirit that soars to new heights from imagining worlds beyond their own while daydreaming at the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium in St. Johnsbury. 
   We must recognize and acknowledge the ways in which the arts expand the imagination of young people; broaden their interest in creating; introduce them to other worlds, other people, and other cultures; make learning other subjects generally more ``fun;'' and build their skills of cooperation that they must practice when performing a play, playing in a band, or singing in a choir. The NEA and NEH make these opportunities possible for the people of Vermont. With a little investigation, many of you will find that these agencies are doing the same in your home states. 
   Because of the consideration shown by the Chairman of this subcommittee, each of the three agencies will be able to extend their grant programs more broadly. With the additional money that we are requesting today, NEA and NEH could further expand their outreach efforts with an eye towards introducing more Americans, many for the first time to the beauty of dance, the spectacle of theater, the enchantment of reading and the magic of the museum. 
   We have new, visionary leaders at the NEA and NEH. Bill Ivey and Bill Ferris are Chairmen who have their ears to the ground and they are prepared to respond to the cultural needs of the people of this nation, regardless of where they live. They have made it their business to involve the grassroots. They fundamentally understand where congress is coming from both in terms of its support for the agencies and with regard to the criticisms of ``elitism'' and favoritism. 
   To address concerns, they have focused on grassroots initiatives like: ``Challenge America,''--an effort to target grant dollars to communities that lack a significant arts presence and invest in arts education, preservation of cultural heritage and after school programming for young people-at-risk; 
   ``Our History is America's History''--a program that will encourage all Americans to explore our family's history and stories, enter these stories to the Internet and connect these personal histories to the broad sweep of American and world history; and 
   ``ED-sitement''--a partnership involving the NEH, MCI corporations and others designed to help humanities teachers use the Internet effectively in their teaching. 
   Each of these programs better connect the local community with its rich and vibrant local history and cultural offerings. They draw upon the rich cultural heritage and traditions of a region and share those treasures and stories widely with our nation's community. I am anxious to support their efforts. It is due to their leadership and the leadership of my own Vermont Arts Council, Vermont Humanities Council and all of Vermont's museums and cultural institutions that I stand with confidence behind these agencies and call for a modest increase in their budgets. 
   The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities are agencies with small budgets that provide extraordinary service to the people of this nation. I encourage my colleagues to support each of these agencies. 
   In closing, I would like to applaud the leadership of my colleague from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN for his unwavering support for the NEH. In addition, I would like to publicly state my support for the Institute for Museum Services and hope that during conference negotiations with the House, we will adopt the highest appropriation possible for that important agency. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD for their leadership on this issue and thank my colleagues for supporting this modest increase for NEA and NEH.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, plaintiffs from my home State of Vermont made opening arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, representing the New England Council for Energy Efficiency and the Environment, have raised serious questions about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision in 1997 to grant power marketer status to a subsidiary of the Canadian company Hydro-Quebec. 
   The Council is protesting that Hydro-Quebec was unlawfully granted the ability to buy and sell power in the U.S. without regulatory oversight. According to expert testimony in that case, Hydro-Quebec already exercises too much control over Northeastern energy markets, and Vermont ratepayers will have to pay higher energy bills if this license is upheld. 
   Hydro-Quebec's ability and willingness to exert undue influence on electricity markets in the United States is of serious concern. The company's request last month that the Canadian government sue the United States over fair trade practices is a clear infringement of the legitimate rights of Vermonters to set Vermont electric rates. The Vermont Public Service Board sets rates equally for all companies, be they foreign or domestic, yet Hydro-Quebec is using its status as a semi-governmental foreign company in an attempt to control these rates. 
   It is deeply ironic that Hydro-Quebec, a monopoly protected by Quebec law against all retail and virtually all wholesale competition in Quebec, should utilize principles of ``fair trade'' to lodge a complaint against the United States under NAFTA. Entrepreneurs in New England and New York who want to compete in Quebec are prohibited from doing so, thus precluding meaningful international competition in energy. Yet Hydro-Quebec is able to freely sell its energy in the U.S. 
   I call upon Hydro-Quebec to come out from behind its monopolistic shield and act like a true competitive utility. Drop your NAFTA lawsuit. End your efforts to undermine Vermont law. Stop using international law to threaten Vermont ratepayers. We want to do business with Hydro-Quebec, but we cannot do so while it tries to exert undue influence in Vermont and New England markets. In Vermont, the Public Service Board sets electric rates, not foreign companies. We will never, ever let a foreign entity write our rules on power sales. 
   I further call upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to thoroughly examine all means by which a foreign utility may exert influence in the United States. Foreign companies should not be given carte blanche to sell energy in the U.S. until all impacts of that decision are considered--not only market share, but also environmental impacts and means outside of the market by which a foreign company may exert influence. Hydro-Quebec is taking advantage of its enormous size and semi-governmental status to gouge ratepayers in Vermont. This issue is of enormous importance to the people of Vermont, and I hope the Commission will thoroughly examine all of these issues. 
   Mr. President, I will do all in my power to protect Vermont electric ratepayers from unnecessary manipulation and threats. I am carefully reviewing the law related to wholesale and retail power sales and will be sure to work for a revision of this law if we see that a region of this nation, or a particular state, is being treated unfairly.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today on an issue of the utmost importance to Vermonters. I recently returned from a wonderful month in my home State of Vermont. I visited farms and downtowns, talked to teachers, parents, and business men and women from all over our State, and enjoyed the beautiful Vermont summer. However, as I and countless of Americans know, nothing compares to Vermont in all of its autumn glory. I would like to read the following proclamation, that I received when I was visiting the picturesque town of Stowe, VT: 
   Vermont Foliage Challenge Proclamation 
   Inasmuch as Vermont is acknowledged throughout the known universe to be the home of the most spectacular fall foliage. 
   And inasmuch as certain ill informed media reports have implied that Vermont's legendary foliage display this year may be less spectacular than usual. 
   And inasmuch as Vermont's fall foliage display is always the best and brightest on this planet or any other. 
   We, of the Green Mountain State, hereby issue a challenge, open to all Senators, to wit: 
   That as of twelve noon on October 1, 1999, the fall foliage in Vermont will be the most colorful, most spectacular, and most photogenic of any venue on Earth. 
   And inasmuch as any challenge worth issuing deserves to be honored with a prize, we of the Green Mountain State hereby offer as proof of our challenge the quality of ten gallons of last spring's Vermont's finest Grade A Fancy Maple Syrup from Nebraska Knoll Sugar Farm of Stowe, Vermont, to be collected in Stowe. 
   Respectfully tendered, the Stowe Area Association.  
   I don't know about where you come from, but 10 gallons of Vermont Fancy Maple Syrup are worth their weight in gold! I would like to see anyone try and meet that challenge. 
   From Bennington to Derby Line, from Fair Haven to St. Johnsbury, in the months of September and October Vermont's Green Mountains become a painter's palette of rich colors. Nothing refreshes the soul as we head into the cold winter months like the invigorating rush one gets from a visit to Vermont when she is decked out in prime foliage. 
   The brisk autumn weather and the breathtaking beauty of nature's fall canvass are unparalled anywhere in the 50 States, or even anywhere in the world. Come see for yourself. 
   Mr. President, before I came to the Chamber, I received word that my esteemed colleague from the State of New York, Senator SCHUMER, has risen to the Vermont Foliage Challenge. Senator SCHUMER has offered 10 gallons of New York apple cider to our 10 gallons of Vermont Maple Syrup, stating that the foliage in the Empire State ``will outshine the challenging leaves found in Vermont during this and every October.'' Anybody who has looked at apple leaves in the fall and maple leaves in the fall realizes there is no way to compare them. I am sure he was not referring to that. I am delighted to hear that the challenge has been accepted, and I am looking forward to enjoying a nice, tall, cold glass of New York apple cider later in the fall. I would like to mention that 10 gallons of maple syrup is not quite comparable to 10 gallons of apple cider, especially considering that it takes 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of maple syrup. But this evens the odds, as it is about a million-to-one chance that Vermont will come out on the short end of the stick in this wager.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to legislation Senator AKAKA and I are introducing today. Entitled ``Permanent Eligibility of Members of the Selected Reserve for Veterans Home Loans,'' this important legislation does not change existing law, but rather makes permanent a critical benefit for the National Guard and Reserve personnel. 
   Under current law, selected Reservists and National Guard personnel who complete six years of service are eligible for guaranteed home loans. This is a significant benefit that has been enjoyed by active duty personnel for many years and has proven to be very effective. In 1992, there was broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate for extending this benefit to the hard working men and women of the Reserves on a trial basis until 1999. Last year the program was extended to the year 2003. However, as we near that date, no potential recruit may participate in the program because it expires before they are able to complete six years of service. Therefore, we introduce this bill in an effort to make this benefit permanent. 
   Our Reserves and National Guard are being called upon more and more today. They are a crucial asset to our Nation's military, but the Reserves are not exempt from problems such as low recruiting that currently face our military. This legislation will give the Reserve Component an added recruitment incentive to offer potential service members. 
   Mr. President, more and more of our service members are taking the giant step of buying a home. Since the start of the VA Home Loan Program in 1992 through 1996, 33,224 loans have been guaranteed by the VA. Only 93 of those  have been foreclosed upon; an incredibly low rate of .37 percent; The foreclosure rate for loans made to other veterans was .97 percent (two and a half times more). In 1996 alone, over $1.1 billion was given out in home loans under this program. This legislation is good not only for our veterans and Reserves, but it is good for our economy as well. I hope there will be support from both sides on this issue.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act of 1999 (NRRA) and thank Senator LIEBERMAN for his leadership on this issue. The purpose of this bill is to reinvest revenues from oil and gas production on outer continental shelf lands to establish a reliable source of funding for State, local and Federal efforts to conserve land and water, provide recreational opportunities, preserve historic resources, protect fish and wildlife, and preserve open and green spaces. 
   This Congress, the subject of permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received significant attention. The Land and Water Conservation Fund, a special account created in 1964, is the primary vehicle for funding land conservation efforts in the United States and is used for acquisitions and maintenance for our national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Four federal agencies--the Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service--receive these funds. In addition, the Park Service has administered a matching grants program to assist states (and localities) in acquiring and developing recreation sites and facilities. The fund accumulates money from diverted revenues from off-shore oil leases. 
   Unfortunately, the main fund has not recently been fully funded and the state grant program has not received any funding since 1995. The promise of this worthy program has never been fully realized and many opportunities to conserve precious lands and to work with our state and local partners have been lost. People across the country are realizing that they cannot afford to lose more opportunities to protect the lands they consider important to their quality of life. 
   Many of us think of large tracks of land, like the Green Mountain National Forest in my home state of Vermont, when we think about federal conservation programs. When we think about the Land and Water Conservation Fund, however, we should also envision soccer fields, swing-sets, picnic areas, town beaches and wildlife preserves across the country. The LWCF has made it possible to protect some of the most valuable wildlife habitat in the United States, and also for small communities to afford public recreation facilities that would otherwise not be possible, bringing the benefits of outdoor recreation close to where we live and work. 
   In addition to the LWCF, the NRRA establishes permanent funding for Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery, the Historic Preservation Fund, and creates several new open space initiatives. The bill also establishes an Environmental Stewardship Fund for states to conserve, protect, and restore their natural resources beyond what is required by current law. The Fund is designed so that states have the flexibility to create their own plans that address their particular needs, while including citizens through a comment process. 
   The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act demonstrates a commitment to conserving and protecting our national natural and historical resources. I urge my colleagues to support this bill that would secure the funding of our conservation and open space programs for the future.

I would especially like to thank the Chairman for encouraging the Department of Energy to consider the Vermont Agency of Transportation electric vehicle lease proposal. I would just like to clarify that the committee's recommendation refers to a request for $400,000 from the Vermont Agency of Transportation to develop an electric vehicle program, including the purchase and demonstration of electric vehicles, the creation of charging stations, reports documenting vehicle use, and the collection of experiential data, for the State of Vermont and its municipalities.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, the Weatherization Assistance Program is an investment. Its success is unparalleled--as a way to upgrade housing, increase energy efficiency, and assist low-income Americans. 
   Weatherization enables very low-income people--including families with children, older Americans, and individuals with disabilities--to experience savings of 30 percent on their energy bills. For every federal dollar invested in this program, $2.40 in energy, health, safety, housing, and other measured benefits are achieved. 
   The mandate that States provide a 25 percent state cost share contained in the bill passed by the other body may endanger states' use of this program. This provision causes great concern to me and other Senators of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I co-chair with Senator MOYNIHAN. Such a fundamental change in the distribution of state Weatherization Assistance grants falls squarely under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, the reason we are here today is to talk about cloture, whether we should have time to fully discuss and be able to make sure that this body knows the importance of what we want to do, and that is to protect the dairy farmers of the United States. We are not here to discuss the fine points of the issues which the Senator from Wisconsin has brought out, with which we sincerely most heartily disagree, but whether or not we ought to have the opportunity and whether it is important enough to this country and to the dairy farmers to have a full discussion by getting cloture. If we don't get cloture, then chaos will happen in many areas, in especially New England which has a compact which would go out of being and would require dramatic action in order to repair the damage that would be done. 
   Dairy farmers around the country are watching the actions of the Senate this week with great anticipation and anxiety. They know that under the 1996 farm bill, Congress instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to develop much needed new pricing formulas for how milk is priced. Unfortunately, they also know that Secretary Glickman's resulting informal rulemaking process is developing pricing formulas that are fatally flawed and contrary to the will of Congress. 
   The Nation's dairy farmers are counting on this Congress to prevent the dairy industry from being placed at risk and instead to secure its sound future. 
   This chart says it all. This is the devastation that will come from the proposed order of the Secretary. What this shows is, with the new order 1-B, there is only one area of this country that will substantially benefit. Guess what area that is? Wisconsin and Minnesota. The rest, clearly delineated by the red, will lose money--all of them. There is a little green in the tip of Florida, there is a little green on the coast of California, and there is a little green in a couple of States, but the rest all lose money. 
   The question is whether 1-A, which was studied, should be replaced to make sure that does not occur. Mr. President, 1-A, which is supported by a letter to the Secretary by 61 Members of the Senate, will not create this devastation. In fact, it will provide an orderly system for farmers all over this country to make a decent income. 
   Secretary Glickman's final pricing rules, scheduled to be implemented on October 1, will cost dairy farmers, not the Government, millions of dollars in lost income from their pockets. There are no Federal funds involved with this. That is something that may be confusing because in the past, the dairy program cost millions of dollars. It does not cost anyone anything now. 
   This amendment will prevent the Secretary's rule from being implemented, thereby maintaining the current law for dairy pricing for another year. 
   Do not be taken in by any of the misleading claims made by the opposition, including their references to the letter from USDA supposedly indicating the amendment does not accomplish its purpose. First of all, it can be easily modified in conference and, secondly, it does accomplish its purpose. This will allow a new rulemaking procedure for the Secretary to carry out the will of Congress for a new and improved pricing structure. It will also allow the Northeast Dairy Compact pilot project--remember, this is a pilot project which was put into law in 1996 to see if by States gathering together they can organize an order system which would protect them from high prices to the consumers and low prices to farmers because of the fact, when you get into milk situations, you can get devastation with a little bit of surplus.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is my 20th year dealing with dairy programs, and I understand the confusion that results in Members' minds who have not been in this body or had the exposure of sitting on the Agriculture Committee. Let me try to correct, as best I can, some of the statements that have been made. 
   First of all, this amendment conforms with the dictates of rule XVI. We cleared that with the Parliamentarian. Also, the amendment is legally sound and the intent is clear. The letter from USDA was expected, as will be further lawsuits. What they state in the last part of the letter is: Rescinding the order presents novel questions which will require further analysis. 
   Let me correct the situation about who makes the money in this country with respect to the dairy farmers. For each period of time the USDA reports what the mailbox price is to the dairy farmer. They go region by region. The charts that we have seen show that, for instance, New England, in 1998, received $14.89 per hundredweight, 10 cents below the national average. More importantly, the Midwestern farmer received $15.27 per hundredweight average, 28 cents above the national average. So who is making money right now? They are making money, not us. 
   Incidentally, the American Farm Bureau supports the 1-A option, which is all this is about. This is a cloture vote. It is designed for us to have an opportunity to demonstrate the importance and the necessity to Vermont and New England and the whole country that we must change what now is in the offing. The dairy farmers, as this chart shows, will be devastated, as will be the rest of the country. The only exception is where? Minnesota and Wisconsin and surrounding areas. They are the ones that are going to make the money if we can't change this situation. 
   Also, the compact has worked extremely well. California, for instance, is so big as a State they don't need a compact, but they are doing exactly what the six States in New England are doing. Theirs is working fine. And the New England compact is working fine. 
   Incidentally, the opponents asked for a study. The study they wanted was from OMB, from whom they thought they would get a friendly study. They did a study of the compact. What did they find out? The compact worked fine. It worked well. It has helped save the farmers. The consumers had a 5-percent lower price than the rest of the country. Why? Because the States got together. They formed a compact. They take care of matters by having consumers on board and everybody sets the price. It is working beautifully. That is why almost half the States in the Nation decided to take a look and said, hey, this is a good idea. We ought to have compacts. We can protect our consumers. We can protect our farmers. Vermont has demonstrated to the country a way to help dairy farmers. We ought to have that opportunity. All we are talking about is a chance to do that, a chance to get everybody together for a lengthy, solid debate which is allowable when you get cloture. 
   This issue is only cloture, so that we can discuss these things and remove all of the statements that have been made which are contrary to the facts. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think it is important to understand why we are here. First of all, this is a cloture vote. There are obvious disputes and they ought to be resolved. But complicated issues such as this can't be resolved in 40 minutes. We need to have a full debate on these issues. It is important to dairy farmers and all farmers. We must not end today by refusing to allow us to go forward, to take the Vermont/New England compact, a model that is being looked at by States all over the country because it works so well to protect its farmers and consumers. We should be able to debate that fully and not to run out of time by virtue of the rules. 
   In addition to that, this chart shows it all. It shows who is going to win and lose.

The compact we have in Vermont allows anybody to be able to come and sell in our market. We are talking about the ability of States to do what California and Idaho already do because they are so large, and that is to have their own milk orders. All we want to do is be able to form together--and I point out that when the opposition asked OMB to make a determination as to whether or not our farmers were in any way, through this pact, violating anything, they came back and said it would even save money for some. Look at this chart. This is the end. This shows what happens. If you go with 1-B instead of 2-A, the whole country, including Idaho, loses money. Why my good friend wants to have his farmers lose money, I don't know.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues to support this important amendment. On April 27, I introduced S.J. Res. 22, along with 39 of my colleagues. Support for S.J. Res. 22, which reauthorizes the Northeast Dairy Compact and ratifies the creation of the Southern Dairy Compact, is impressive. 
   As we know, Secretary Glickman's final pricing rule, which is scheduled to be implemented on October 1, 1999, will cost dairy farmers millions of dollars in lost income. In addition, successful pilot program of the Northeast Dairy Compact will expire on October 1, 1999, unless congressional action is taken. 
   This amendment would: Extend the Northeast Dairy Compact until 2002 and ratify a Southern Dairy Compact as a pilot program until 2002; Mandate Option 1-A for the pricing formula for Class 1 milk; and Require the Secretary of Agriculture to use formal rule making to determine the pricing formula for Class III milk. 
   This amendment must be addressed before the October 1, 1999, deadline. We have an opportunity to give the states the right to help protect their farmers with no cost to the federal government and correct the Secretary of Agriculture's flawed pricing rules. 
   This amendment is about fairness to both farmers and consumers. It has the broad support of governors, state departments of agriculture, the American Farm Bureau, and dairy cooperatives and coalitions from throughout the country. Even the Land-O-Lakes Cooperative in the Upper Midwest supports this important amendment. 
   However, I am aware that some of my colleagues oppose our efforts to bring fairness to our states and farmers. Also, unfortunately, Congress has been bombarded with misinformation from an army of lobbyists representing the national milk processors, led by the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the Milk Industry Foundation. These two groups, backed by the likes of Philip Morse, have funded several front groups to lobby against this amendment. 
   I would like to set the record straight. It is crucial that Congress debate the issues presented on the merits, rather than based on misinformation. When properly armed with the facts, I believe you will conclude that the Northeast Dairy Compact was a successful experiment that works and that other states should be given the opportunity to prove whether a dairy compact would work for them. 
   This amendment reauthorizes the very successful Northeast Dairy Compact pilot program and allows the Southern Dairy Compact to operate as a pilot program until 2002, when Congress would have an opportunity to revisit and carefully consider the Northeast and Southern Compacts in the 2002 farm bill. 
   Currently the bill to reauthorize the Northeast and ratify the Southern compact has 40 cosponsors. Twenty-five states have passed dairy compacts and now even more than half the states in the county are interested in having the right to form dairy compacts. During the past year Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, Missouri and Kansas, have all passed legislation to form a southern dairy compact. Texas is also considering joining the Southern Compact. 
   The Oregon legislature is in the process of developing a Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact as well. New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York have passed state legislation enabling them to join the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm bill as a three-year pilot program, has been extremely successful. The Compact has been studied, audited, and sued--but has always come through with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the Compact it has served as a model for the entire country. 
   One look at the votes cast by each state legislature, and you can see that there is little controversy over what is in best interest for the consumers and farmers in each respected state. For example, in Alabama and Arkansas, both legislative chambers passed compact legislation unanimously. It passed unanimously in the North Carolina Senate and by a vote of 106-1 in the North Carolina House. In the Oklahoma State Senate, it passed by a vote of 44-1 and unanimously in the Oklahoma House. It passed unanimously in the Virginia State Senate and by a vote of 90-6 in the Virginia House. In Kansas, the bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 39-1 and an impressive 122-1 in the Kansas House. 
   A 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requested by Members from the Upper Midwest, on the economic effects of the Dairy Compact illustrates the Compact's success. The OMB reported that during the first six months of the Compact, consumer prices for milk within the Compact region were five cents lower than retail store prices in the rest of the nation. 
   OMB concluded that the Compact added no federal costs to nutrition programs during this time, and that the Compact did not adversely affect farmers outside the Compact region. This is an important fact to remember as some of my colleagues may debate that the Compact harms the farmers in the compact region. 
   Congressional opponents of the Compact also requested an audit of the Dairy Compact Commission by the USDA's Office of Inspector General and federal auditors gave the Compact Commission a clean bill of health. The auditors stated unequivocally that the Commission has properly administered funds and provided $46 million to dairy farmers. 
   The courts also agree that the Compact is legally sound. Last January, a Federal appeals court rejected a challenge to the Dairy Compact by the Milk Industry Foundation. The Court found that the Compact was constitutional and the U.S. Agriculture Secretary's approval of the Compact was justified. 
   Recently seventeen Governors from throughout the Northeast and Southeast sent a letter to the Majority Leader of the Senate and House, urging Congress to consider and support the Dairy Compact legislation. The Governors of the Compact regions speak not only for their farmers and consumers but for the rights of the States. The message to Congress from Governors nationwide has been clear. ``Increase the flexibility of states and support legislation that promotes state and regional policy initiatives.'' 
   I would now like to address the actual and potential impact of dairy compacts on milk production and the cost to taxpayers. In short, dairy compacts have and should have little impact on production and operates without cost to taxpayers and the federal government, not one penny. Opposition claims to the contrary, even accounting for the admitted uncertainty of dairy economics, are overblown and distorted. 
   First, these compacts contain specific provisions designed to ensure the prevention of surplus production attributable to operation of the compacts. The compacts are entirely self-funded, without any recourse to the federal (or state) treasury and preclude any cost to taxpayers. Additionally, the states have agreed to the condition of consent contained in S.J. Res. 22 which requires the compact commissions to reimburse USDA for any surplus purchases made, should the internal protection devices fail. While the latter provision does not directly prevent the potential adverse impact of surplus production on the national marketplace, it does act as a further restraint on the commission's function. It is only logical to see that the last thing the commissions would want is to end up as funding USDA purchases of surplus powdered milk production for the national milk market! 
   With this analysis in mind, I would like to briefly respond to the claims about milk production and taxpayers costs made by opponents of dairy compact legislation. The International Dairy Foods Association, the trade organization for the processors' lobby which is leading the opposition to S.J. Res. 22, claims that the Northeast Compact has resulted in an estimated 60 percent increase in milk powder production while national powder production increased only by 2 percent, and that the USDA has expended $11 million in surplus production purchases  attributable to the regional production increase. In various statements against dairy compacts, opponents have cited the percentage increase in milk powder production and purchase costs with approval. 
   Anyone who has worked in the area of dairy pricing and statistics knows of the hazards of attempting to quantify analysis of this most complex sector of our economy. The above analysis proves the point. It is certainly true that milk powder production in the northeast increased during the first six months of operation of the Northeast Compact at a rate above the national average. Yet the reasons are not as simple--only because of operation of the Northeast Compact--as opponents of dairy compacts would have us believe. First, one of the largest cheese processing plants in the region shut down during this time, and the raw milk supply had to be converted from cheese to powder production. On the other side of the equation, national production during this period was quite depressed, despite the apparent two percent increase, because of a dramatic downturn in California and southwest production. Hence the otherwise seeming disparities in rates of production. 
   Furthermore, the claim that USDA spend $11 million in surplus purchases attributable to the Northeast Compact's operation is blatantly misleading. In fact, $1.7 million in such reimbursement was provided--nowhere near the $11 million amount claimed by the opposition. In addition, whether the $1.7 million represents purchases which more reflect the increase in powder production attributable to the shut down of the cheese plant, and other factors, remains an open question of economic analysis, despite the reimbursement provided also by the Compact Commission. 
   Opponents further cite with approval the claim of IDFA that operation of the Northeast Compact will cost taxpayers an estimated $400 million annually. This claim is made without basis or analysis and must not be relied upon at all. Simply put, CBO gave the Northeast Compact a zero source, which is a long, long, way from $400 million. 
   I feel I should take some time to explain just how the Compact operates. The Northeast Dairy Compact Commission has the authority to regulate Class 1 (or fluid) milk prices. The commission, which consists of consumer, processor and farmer representatives appointed by each state's governor, determines both the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to producers and distributors as well as the purchasing power of the public through a formal rule making procedure. Any regulation is subject to a two-thirds vote by a state delegation as well as a producer referendum. 
   All milk consumed in compact-affected areas is uniformly regulated. This provision ensures an equal benefit to New York or California farmers who supply milk to the compact states. The Compact Commission's price regulation works in conjunction with the federal government's pricing program, which establishes minimum prices paid by processors and received by dairy farmers for raw milk produced on farms. 
   The Compact regulation raises these minimum prices as they relate to the market for fluid, or bottled milk. Part of the difference between the Compact's minimum price and the federal minimum price is set aside to compensate any cost that may be associated to the WIC programs and school lunch programs. 
   Processors purchasing milk to produce other dairy products such as cheese or ice cream are not subject to the Compact's pricing regulations, although all farmers producing milk in the region, for any purpose, share equally in the regulation's benefits. 
   Here is how it works. The Commission established $16.94 per hundredweight as the Compact over-order price for Class 1 milk. All milk processors having sales of fluid milk in New England are required to pay a monthly over-order obligation. This obligation is the difference 
   between $16.94 and the price established monthly by federal regulation for the same milk. 
   For instance, if the federal price for Class 1 milk was $13.94 for a particular month, the processors' over-order obligation for that month would be $16.94 minus $13.94--or $3.00. Processors multiply their total fluid milk sales by this amount and that is what they pay into the Compact Commission. 
   Three percent of the pooled price regulation proceeds are then set aside to hold harmless the impact on New England WIC programs. At least 4 cents but no more than 5 cents is deducted from the pooled proceeds each month and placed in a reserve fund established in the event of late payments by handlers. 
   Approximately half of the unobligated balance of this fund is added back into the pool for redistribution in the following month in order to prevent the reserve fund from growing too large. 
   Farmers receive the balance of the proceeds in accordance with the Class 1 utilization rate--the percentage of milk produced that actually goes towards drinking milk, not cheese or other manufactured products. Therefore, the producer price is derived by dividing the balance of the pool proceeds by the total number of pounds of all producer milk in the region. 
   The Compact Commission makes disbursements to farmer cooperatives and milk handlers, who then make the individual payments to farmers based on their production. 
   When the Compact regulation first took effect in July of 1997, the Compact over-order obligation was $3.00. During that month, 245,001,960 pounds of milk, or 46.14% of the total milk in the region was sold as Class 1 milk. This resulted in a pool paid into the Commission of $7,350,058.80. After the WIC and reserve fund adjustments were made, the balance of the pool proceeds was $6,903,009.44. When this number was divided by the total number of pounds of all producer milk, in this case 531,000,726 pounds, the resulting producer price was $1.30. 
   For many farmers in Vermont and New England, the Compact payments have meant the difference between keeping the farm and calling the auctioneer. 
   Federal dairy policy is difficult to explain at best. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I served as the ranking member of the Dairy and Livestock Subcommittee. During my years in the House, I worked very closely with the programs that impacted dairy farmers and consumers. Of all the programs and efforts by the federal government to help our nation's dairy farmers, the most effective and promising solution have seen thus far is the creation and operation of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   I would like to address the actual and potential impact of dairy compacts on consumer prices. In short, opposition claims about the actual and possible impact of dairy compacts on consumers, including low income consumers, are unfounded and grossly distorted. 
   While farm milk prices have fluctuated wildly, remaining constant overall during the last ten years, consumers prices have risen sharply. The explanation for this is apparently that variations in store prices do not mirror the wild fluctuations in farm prices. 
   In other words, when farm prices go up, the store prices go up, but when the farm prices recede, the store prices do not come back down as quickly or at the same rate. Hence, and quite logically, if you take away the fluctuations in farm prices, you take away the catalyst for unwarranted increases in store prices. 
   Let's take a look at what the retail price has done in the Compact region compared to other areas that do not have Compacts in place. This demonstrates several extremely important points that dispute the claims that the compact hits consumers with higher retail prices compared to other regions. The average price per gallon of milk in Boston remained steady at $2.89 for February, March and April of 1999 in the Compact areas. Meanwhile retail prices across the country widely fluctuated and were most often higher than in the Compact area of New England. 
   Again, I would like to make it very clear that the Compact only regulates fluid milk used for drinking, called Class I milk. Although not shown on this chart, milk prices in suburban areas of New England can often be found for $2.00 or less per gallon. Generally, the shelf price of milk has increased proportionally to increases in producer prices, yet, has not decreased  at the same rate when farm prices have dropped. The result has been an upward price ratcheting in the retail milk price--a rise of about 30 percent between 1985 and 1993 while the farm price actually fell. 
   Even with the Northeast Dairy Compact, New England retail milk prices are among the lowest in the country! 
   Contrary to the claims of the opposition, regional compact regulation remain open to the interstate commerce of all producer milk and processor milk products, from whatever source. Compacts establish neither ``cartels'', ``tariffs'' nor ``barriers to trade'' and are not economic ``protectionism.'' 
   According to the opponents characterizations, dairy compacts somehow establish a ``wall'' around the regions subject to compact regulation, and thereby prohibit competition from milk produced and processed from outside the regions. 
   These are entirely misleading characterizations. It is really quite simple and straightforward: All fluid, or beverage milk sold in a compact region is subject to uniform regulation, regardless of its source within or outside the compact region. This means that all farmers, including farmers from the Upper Midwest, providing milk for beverage sale in the region, receive the same pay prices without discrimination. 
   Despite what some of my colleagues have said, the Northeast Dairy Compact is working as it was intended to. Instead of trying to destroy an initiative that works to help dairy farmers with cost to the federal government, I urge my colleagues from the Upper Midwest to respect the states' interest and initiative to help protect their farmers and encourage that region of the country to 
   explore the possibility of forming your own interstate dairy compact. 
   When the June 1999 Compact payments were paid, the Compact will have returned an average of 51 cents per hundredweight of milk to farmers over the past two years of operation. The average Vermont family farm realized an additional $13,000 net income during the life of the Compact. For seven of those months no payments were made because market prices were above the Compact floor. 
   In April of this year, farmers felt the effect of a record $6.00 per hundredweight drop in the Basic Formula Price. In New England, blend prices dropped an unprecedented $3.93 per hundredweight from the previous month, but the Compact payment of $1.43 made up nearly half of the loss for Northeast farmers. 
   We would like every region of the country to have the same opportunity to provide stability for their farmers and consumers that the Northeast Dairy Compact provides for our region. 
   Earlier today, when we were debating the cloture vote on the dairy amendment, I responded to my colleague from Minnesota statement that the dairy compact somehow lowered his farmer's price of milk. I would again, refer to the USDA mailbox price. The mailbox price is the net price that dairy farmers receive for the milk that is marketed under the Federal milk marketing program. 
   The average prices shows on this chart include all payments received for milk sold and deducts all costs associated with marketing milk. As you can see, in 1998 New England received $14.89 per hundredweight, ten cents below the national average. 
   Most importantly, despite claims that the Northeast Dairy Compact means smaller checks for Midwest farmers, they received $15.27 per hundredweight, twenty-eight cents above the national average, and thirty-eight more cents per hundredweight than New England producers. 
   The amendment also mandates that the Secretary use Option 1-A as the pricing formula for fluid milk. As I discussed earlier today, the Secretary's rule, known as 1B, is sue to be implemented on October 1, unless congressional action is taken. 
   Sixty-one Senators and more than 240 House members signed letters to Secretary Glickman last year supporting the pricing option known as Option A-1, for the pricing of fluid milk. The majority of the country and dairy industry support Option 1-A. 
   Most all areas of the country are better off under Option 1-A, including the Upper Midwest. Option 1-A is based on solid economic analysis, benefiting both farmers and consumers. It takes into account; transportation costs for moving fluid milk; regional supply and demand needs; costs of producing and marketing milk; and the need to attract milk to regions that occasionally face production deficits. 
   Finally, the amendment requires the Secretary of Agriculture to hold formal hearings to determine how the Class II, and Class IV price will be calculated. There is concern that the Secretary's final rule will drop the price paid for cheese by as much as $.40 per hundredweight. The amendment would give both producers and processors the opportunity to have input on the formula through the formal rule making process. 
   This amendment is about helping farmers and protecting consumers. Farmers deserve our support and recognition. It is sometimes easy to forget just how fortunate we are in this country to have the world's cheapest and safest food supply. 
   I listened with great interest to the sugar debate earlier today. I support this Federal no-cost that provides stability to farmers and consumers in sugar growing states. I don't have sugar growers in Vermont. I have dairy farmers. But that does not mean I should not support a commodity program that helps protect farmers in other states with no cost to the federal government. 
   I noticed that during the debate several of my colleagues that argued so pationately about protecting the sugar program, did not support my efforts to protect the dairy program. Agriculture, nationwide needs our collective help. Let's not divide agriculture, but join together to protect our nation's most important resources. 
   I am certain that my colleagues will agree with me that dairy farmers deserve a fair price for their products. What does it say about our values when some of the hardest working people, our farmers, are underpaid and unappreciated? In the last couple of days we have debated providing billions of dollars in assistance to farmers who face the current disasters. This amendment would help prevent a disaster for America's dairy farmers by giving the states and the dairy farmers the tools to face the challenges of improving and stabilizing farm prices. 
   In Vermont, dairy farmers help define the character of the state. I am proud to work to protect them and to protect the traditions and special qualities of the state. 
   I realize that this amendment is not in order at this time, however, I urge my colleagues to give great consideration to the importance of this amendment and the need to address these important issues as soon as possible. Supporting this amendment respect the interstate cooperation among states, protects the interests of consumers, and supports America's dairy farmers.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am honored to congratulate the Vermont Housing Finance Agency on its 25th Anniversary of providing Vermonters with access to safe, decent and affordable housing. 
   In 1974, the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, VHFA, was established to ensure that Vermonters of a variety of different backgrounds have access to affordable housing. Over many years of finding innovative ways to finance and stimulate the preservation and development of affordable housing, VHFA has multiplied the number of home ownership opportunities in Vermont many times over. This dedication to aggressively and compassionately provide affordable housing opportunities ensures that today's neediest Vermont families need not go without shelter. 
   As a Senator one of my highest priorities is to help secure for Vermont's low and moderate income families a home they can afford. We all know that having a home is a critical foundation to achieving success. Every year VHFA helps Vermonters build this foundation by making financing possible for thousands of Vermonters to purchase hundreds of dwellings. Over the years, VHFA has worked with private lenders, real estate professionals, builders, developers and nonprofit organizations throughout the state to get the job done. This dynamic approach to home financing has brought about dozens of healthy and safe Vermont communities where residents thrive and communities grow. The professionalism, reliability, and accomplishments of the staff at VHFA are unsurpassed. 
   I commend the Vermont Housing Finance Agency for its outstanding contribution and dedication to improving the quality of life for so many Vermonters. VHFA has my sincerest thanks and unending respect for its 25 years of commitment to Vermont and her people. I am both proud and honored to represent such an accomplished group of individuals in Washington as they are a national model for how to provide affordable, quality housing opportunities for those in need. As they celebrate their 25th anniversary at the end of this month in Vermont, the VHFA staff, past and present, should be proud that their leadership and continued perseverance will help ensure that every Vermonter has a place to call home.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Vermonter, Patricia Thomas, formerly the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of Chittenden and Grand Isle Counties. Pat's commitment to improving the health status of Vermonters serves as a model to us all. She is, and will remain, a stunning example of how one person can positively affect so many. 
   Pat has served Vermont in a variety of capacities. As a teacher and college administrator, as a government official and director of Vermont's largest United Way, and on various boards and commissions, Pat always strived to improve the quality of life here in Vermont. Most recently, she served the people of Vermont at the helm of our State's largest VNA. It is this role that I wish to elaborate upon today before the U.S. Senate. 
   Throughout Pat's 7-year tenure at the VNA, her leadership was instrumental in sustaining Vermont's unique, nonprofit home health care system, while maintaining its high-quality, cost-effective service. Ironically, when this nationally renowned system was severely challenged by an unintended consequence of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pat's advocacy easily convinced me and other lawmakers that corrective action was essential. With such an impressive track record and with so many Vermonters relying on her agency's care, it was an easy argument to both make and adopt. Certainly, being a key member of my Health Care Advisory Board, there have been numerous occasions when I have relied on Pat's wise counsel, but none was more critical than during the last year's debate. Vermonters were fortunate to have such an advocate and leader in Pat Thomas. 
   In addition to being an effective advocate on the Federal level, Pat led her VNA through a dynamic and critical  time in its history. During Pat's tenure, her agency more than doubled in size, successfully completed a massive capital campaign, purchased and renovated its current headquarters, and significantly diversified its services. Vermont Respite House, home psychiatric care, specialized home therapies, home infusion, palliative care and wellness programs were all added to the plethora of VNA services on Pat's watch. Other major services include their Adult Day and Hospice Programs and Maternal Child Health Services. Pat knew that these changes were necessary if her agency was to adequately reflect and meet the evolving needs of Vermonters. Her vision and leadership helped her agency do exactly that, with resounding success. 
   Vermont has much to be grateful for when it comes to Pat's steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life in our small state. Although her tenure at the VNA has ended, we will forever remain the beneficiaries of her expertise, vision and leadership on those issues she has been so ably, and passionately committed to. In her own words, ``our house is in order and the agency is incredibly sound, despite an ever changing and challenging health care environment''. Vermont has Pat Thomas to thank for this. We wish her well.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. 
   As a cosponsor of this legislation, let me first thank Senator COLLINS for her hard work in crafting this legislation, and for the informative and insightful oversight hearings she has held on the sweepstakes industry this year. Those hearings have exposed some troubling practices, and clearly demonstrate the need for this important legislation. 
   Earlier this year a constituent of mine from Huntington, Vermont, e-mailed my office and relayed his own personal story as an example of the need for this legislation. He had been asked by his mother to help review her mail as she was certain she had won something from a variety of sweepstakes mailings. He was shocked to learn in reviewing the material that while technically correct the material she was sent was very misleading. Any information that would lead the person to believe they had won was highlighted or in bold print, while the statements containing words like ``if you have the winning number'' are subdued, and in small print. The intent of these mailings was clearly to create a false sense of ``winning'' in the recipient. 
   As his e-mail further points out, it used to be only the big names which sent out these sweepstakes mailings, but it ow seems to be every fund-raising group, catalog, or magazine has some version of these sweepstakes mailings. However, even if you are just receiving material from one company if can be an overwhelming amount of sweepstakes mailings. 
   For example, another constituent of mine from Barre, Vermont, brought into my office over fifteen pounds of sweepstakes mailings from one company that related to only one contest. You heard me right, fifteen pounds of material for only one contest from one company. Multiply that by the number  of contests and companies people receive mailings from and you are looking at an overwhelming amount of mail. 
   One of the most outrageous practices in these mailings is the request for a donation or a purchase of a product without making it clear that the donation or purchase has no effect on your chances of winning any of the prizes. This has caused some people to expend their precious resources thinking they are giving themselves a better chance at winning the grand prize, when in reality it has done nothing to change the odds. 
   Senator COLLIN's legislation, S. 335, will go a long way to solve the problems of these deceptive sweepstakes mailings. It requires a clear disclosure of the game's rules and an indication that the odds of winning are not improved by purchasing any products that are being advertised. It also will restrict the mailing from depicting an individual as a winner unless that person actually has won a prize. In addition, the bill will implement stricter penalties for sending mail that does not comply with the federal standards. 
   Every day people are being inundated with these mailings and many of them promote a belief that you have already won, or that a donation or purchase will increase your chances of winning. For many, especially for the most vulnerable in our society, it has been very difficult to separate the truth from the fantasy in these mailings, and as past history has shown sweepstakes mailings are a particular problem for the elderly in our society. 
   Mr. President, we have a chance to protect all Americans, particularly the elderly, and I urge all my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the child development block grant has helped thousands of families keep jobs by helping offset the enormous costs of child care, which enable them to go to work. In most cases, subsidies are so low that families are forced to use the cheapest and, in many cases, the poorest quality child care. 
   There are 66 Senators who voted for the money in the budget for this purpose. The kids at the Burlington YMCA are right: We must act now for quality child care.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding the 5 minutes. We have worked closely together on this bill. I am here to recommend passage of it. 
   First of all, I commend my chairman, Senator ROTH. I support many of the provisions in his bill. Many of the provisions in his bill are in this bill. I express my sincere hopes that the bill's good provisions will stand. I agree with much of what Senator SPECTER said about some of the ramifications if we continue on our present course. This is basically ``Roth lite'' as far as the bill goes. 
   It is very much modeled after it. It just cuts it back somewhat so we can get sort of in the middle. 
   This $500 billion centrist alternative represents an attempt by some of us to find a middle ground. The Senate finance Committee has approved tax cuts of roughly $800 billion. The President has said he will veto a bill of that size. The Senate Democrats have proposed tax cuts of $300 billion, and the President has signaled his willingness to sign a bill with that level of tax cuts. 
   The bad news in all this is that the parties are at an impasse. One side is dug in at $800 billion; the other will not budge from $300 billion. The good news is that both sides agree that we can afford and achieve some level of tax cut. I certainly do. And since both sides agree that a tax cut is appropriate, sooner or later we will have one. 
   What those of us sponsoring his centrist amendment are saying is: ``Let's compromise. Let us take a step toward the middle. Let us settle on a figure we can agree on. And let us get this tax cut done--sooner, rather than later. If neither side can give ground, if we lock ourselves into hard and fast positions, this whole process will come grinding to a halt. How the process will ultimately play out is anybody's guess. It could mean we have another government shut-down. Or it could mean we end up with an omnibus bill like we had last year. 
   It does not have to be that way. This should not turn into a game of ``chicken'' between political parties. But both sides will have to give a little. 
   In the end, I think we will ultimately end up with a tax bill that is somewhere between $300 billion and $800 billion--in other words, around $500 billion. I do not see why we can not settle on an acceptable mid-point now. 
   You can get a lot of tax relief with $500 billion. The centrist package will provide for broad-based tax relief for most taxpayers. Taxpayers who do not itemize deductions will see a big increase in the standard deduction. This increase is not just tax relief. It is also tax simplification. With a larger standard deduction millions of taxpayers will no longer have to itemize their deductions. Taxpayers who itemize will also get a break, as the 15-percent bracket will be expanded. 
   Up to $5,000 that was formerly taxed at 28 percent will now be taxed at 15 percent. This 13 percent reduction in tax will mean savings up to $650 for married couples. 
   Our centrist package also addresses the marriage penalty. It eliminates the marriage penalty in the standard deduction, and eliminates part of the marriage penalty in the earned income credit. Our Tax Code should not punish marriage--especially among the working poor. Right now two low-income people who marry often find themselves with a smaller earned income credit than they would have had as single taxpayers. That shouldn't be. 
   This alternative also encourages savings and investment. The first $1,500 of capital gains would be tax tree. Again, this is not just tax savings; it's also tax simplification. During the tax filing season, the complex schedule D was one of the things Vermont taxpayers  complained about most often. Under our proposal, millions of people with capital gains from mutual funds could avoid filing out schedule D. 
   Our alternative includes targeted provisions that serve important national interests like retirement savings, education, and protection of the environment. When people move between jobs it will be easier for them to take their pension benefits with them. More people will be able to claim the deduction for student loan interest. Long-term care insurance would be deductible. The research and experimentation credit would be permanent and the low-income housing tax credit would be extended. These are but a few of many tax issues addressed in our alternative package. 
   In the Finance Committee, I voted to move the bill out of committee and keep the process going. I applaud Chairman ROTH for the reasoned approach he has taken in this bill. 
   With a projected surplus approaching a trillion dollars, I think we can afford some tax relief. I must confess, however, I'm a little uneasy with the level of tax cuts in the Finance Committee bill. An $800 billion tax cut leaves little margin for error if the surplus projections are not correct. An if these projections understate the surplus, we can always come back and enact further tax cuts. 
   I'm also concerned that an $800 billion tax cut doesn't leave us a cushion sufficient to fund a Medicare prescription drug benefit, to pay down our national debt or to address other areas of concern, like education. I think we should go slower, be a little more cautious. Some would call this the conservative approach. 
   Still, I want tax cuts. Our $500 billion alternative allows for meaningful tax relief, while also leaving a significant chunk of the surplus intact for other national priorities. 
   Mr. President, the American people are tired of gridlock. They're frustrated that compromise is becoming a lost art. We don't need to wait for a veto before getting down to serious negotiations. We can get this bill done today.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that takes another positive step toward the goal of providing access to affordable prescription drugs for patients in my state of Vermont, and many other patients across the United States. 
   The high cost of prescription drugs is an issue that faces many Americans every single day, as they try to decide how to make ends meet, and whether they can afford to fill the prescription given to them by their doctor. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to hear of patients who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to make prescriptions  last longer. This is a serious health problem, and I am committed to legislative solutions that we can enact that provides immediate assistance to those who need it. I will soon introduce legislation that will provide prescription drug insurance for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. And today I am introducing legislation that will allow Americans of all ages who do not have sufficient coverage for prescription drugs, to purchase the medicines they need at prices they can afford. 
   Mr. President, it is well documented that the average price of prescription medicines is much lower in Canada than in the United States, with the price of some drugs in Vermont being twice that of the same drug available only a few miles away in a Canadian pharmacy. This is true even though many of the drugs sold in Canada are actually manufactured, packed, and distributed by American companies that sell the same products in both markets, but at drastically different prices. That is why many residents of my home state travel the short distance across the border into Canada to buy their prescription medicines at the lower price. Unfortunately, in most cases this is a violation of Federal law. This does not seem fair to many Vermonters, and it does not seem fair to me. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will change that, so that Americans who want to buy prescription medicines in Canada can legally do so. This legislation will require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to promulgate new regulations permitting patients to import prescription medications purchased in Canada. Currently, it is illegal for Americans to go to Canada and purchase drugs to be brought back to the United States. But FDA and U.S. Customs employ a ``discretionary enforcement policy'', allowing some Americans to enter the U.S. with drugs that they bought in Canada. 
   My legislation does a number of things. First, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations that will allow individuals to import prescription FDA-approved medicines from Canada in personal baggage, so long as the appropriate use is identified and the product does not represent a significant health risk. Under this bill, patients could also be asked to identify the licensed U.S. health professional responsible for treatment, and to affirm that the product is for personal use, and provide other necessary information so that the FDA can continue to ensure the safety of the U.S. drug supply. All information collected under this provision will be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. 
   Under this proposal, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will also be required to promulgate regulations regarding importation of prescription drugs from Canada by mail order. The Secretary will establish criteria which will ensure the safety of patients in the United States that wish to purchase drugs by mail order from Canada. 
   Finally, this legislation will require the Secretary of HHS to study the safety and purity of the prescription drug products that are imported under this Act. 
   Mr. President, it has often been said that we have the international gold standard when it comes to drug safety. Well, we have the platinum standard when it comes to prices. I want to emphasize, again, my commitment to helping Vermonters and all Americans have access to the prescription drugs that they need at prices that they can afford. As Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, the safety of American patients is always one of my top priorities, and I am committed to achieving the goal of affordable prescription drugs without putting patients' lives at risk. This is a responsible proposal to help Vermonters and all Americans with the high prices of drugs, and I hope my colleagues will support it.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act as an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Fiscal Year 2000 bill. 
   This legislation will provide the Federal Government a needed tool to combat the destructive impact of hate crimes on our society. The amendment also recognizes that hate crimes are not just limited to crimes committed because of race, color, religion, or national origin, but are also directed at individuals because of their gender, sexual orientation or disability. 
   Mr. President, any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by hate are especially harmful. This amendment would take two important steps to strengthen existing Federal hate crimes law. 
   First, the amendment would expand the situations when the Department of Justice can prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin. Second, the amendment would authorize the Department of Justice to prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because of a victim's disability, gender, or sexual orientation provided there is a sufficient connection with interstate commerce. 
   Many states, including my state of Vermont, have already passed strong hate crimes laws, and I applaud them in this endeavor. An important principle of this amendment is that it allows for Federal prosecution of hate crimes without impeding the rights of states to prosecute these crimes. 
   Federal prosecutions under this amendment would still be subject to the current provision of law that requires the Attorney General or another senior official of the Justice Department to certify that a federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. Mr. President, such a requirement under current law has ensured that states are the primary adjudicators of the perpetrators of hate crimes, not the Federal government. 
   This has meant that in recent years the existing Federal hate crimes law has been used only in carefully selected cases. For example, there have been an average of only 5.2 prosecutions per year under current law from Fiscal Year 1990 through Fiscal Year 1996. 
   Additionally, Federal authorities will consult with State and Local law enforcement officials before initiating an investigation or prosecution. Both of these are important provisions to ensure that we are not infringing on the rights of States to prosecute crimes. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity today to take a strong stand against hate crimes, and I urge them to do so by supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator GREGG for all his work on crafting the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bill. In this time of tight budgetary caps, and with the many requests by members, Senator GREGG has worked hard to get the bill through the Appropriations Committee and to the floor of the Senate. 
   I would especially like to thank Senator GREGG for recognizing the need of three Vermont towns to upgrade, modernize and acquire technology for their police departments. Allowing these police departments to improve their technology will permit them to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide. Reflecting the needs of the police departments, the $1.5 million should be divided on the following basis: one-half ($750,000) to the Burlington Police Department, one-third ($500,000) to the Rutland Police Department, and one-sixth ($250,000) to the St. Johnsbury Police Department. Again, I appreciate Senator GREGG's help to address the technology problems these town's police departments are facing, and I look forward to working with him to get this important appropriations bill signed into law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I again thank Senator GREGG and his staff for working with me to provide funding for two important initiatives in my home State of Vermont. It is my understanding that within funds provided to Department of Justice of Juvenile Justice Programs, the FY 2000 Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill provides $100,000 for the establishment of a teen center in Colchester, Vermont and $100,000 to Prevent Child Abuse-VT to evaluate the SAFE-T program, a comprehensive child abuse prevention program for middle school communities.  
   There is a great need for a community center with a focus on youth in the Town of Colchester. Currently after school gathering places for Colchester youth are limited to local restaurants and supermarkets. This project has strong local support. Last October, a group of local citizens formed a non-profit organization called the ``Colchester Community Youth Project'' and purchased an available property in the town for use as a teen center. The Town of Colchester hopes to buy the building from the non-profit, and then plans to renovate the 4,500 square foot main building to house a youth center/multi use space, offices, and a branch of the local public library. 
   For over four years, Prevent Child Abuse-VT has funded, developed and piloted SAFE-T, a comprehensive health education and abuse prevention program for middle school communities. Students learn victim an victimizer prevention, build healthy relationship skills and experience personal and social change. Parents, guardians, school staff and service providers participate in training, dialog assignments, classroom presentations and school community change projects. SAFE-T research-based and classroom tested with over 500 students. 
   More work, however, needs to be done to evaluate the success of the SAFE-T program. Dr. David Finkelhor, Co-Director of the Family Violence Research Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire, plans to embark shortly on a three-year scientific evaluation of the SAFE-T program. I am very pleased that this appropriation will enable this evaluation to move forward. 
   The sexual abuse of and by children is now at epidemic proportions in America. The SAFE-T Program is an excellent resource in helping early adolescents develop the skills they need to grow safe, free of abuse. This program offers great promise as a national model for comprehensive abuse prevention programs. A thorough scientific evaluation will ensure that this research-based initiative can be proven effective and disseminated properly.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of international exchange programs. Americans benefit from an opportunity to work and study abroad. Foreigners benefit from time in the United States both in their professional development and by exposure to the American system and values. Exchanges are a proven way to disperse American principals of freedom and democracy around the world. Therefore, I am disappointed that the committee report recommends reducing funding for several exchange programs, including the funding for students, scholars and teachers portion of the Fulbright Program. The Fulbright Program has served America and Americans very well for many years. It is not in our best interest to reduce funding for it at this time. I would hope that all of the programs on the committees reprioritization list will be carefully evaluated before any decision is made to reduce or eliminate them. 
   The Tibetan Fulbright Program touches Vermonters very close to home. Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan exile living in India, was the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship and studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. He was unjustly arrested by the Chinese in 1995 in his native Tibet when he returned to document traditional Tibetan music. Although this young man's time in Vermont was brief, the passion he threw into his work to preserve endangered Tibetan culture gained him a large following in my state. His case is of the highest priority for me and the other members of Vermont's congressional delegation. Senator LEAHY has joined me in offering an amendment to this legislation to ensure that the Tibetan Exchange Program continues in fiscal year 2000. 
   I hope that in conference the necessary changes will be made to ensure adequate funding for our most important exchange programs.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999. 
   As we debate the best avenue to promote smart growth in our communities, a prominent issue is brownfields revitalization. Historically an issue of corporate America, small businesses can play a crucial role in revitalizing brownfields sites. Providing small businesses with the necessary capital to redevelop these sites is critical. The potential for small businesses to redevelop brownfields sites has gone untapped for far too long. 
   Although Congress clarified lender liability in 1996--in the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations bill--P.L. 104-208--there has been little progress to enhance small business brownfields redevelopment efforts. Larger corporations have the necessary resources; for example, Bank of America has recognized the economic benefits for brownfields lending. The Small Business Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999 would level this playing field. 
   Our goal with this legislation is to take an existing framework--the Small Business Administration's (SBA) successful loan guarantee and community development corporation programs--and channel important resources into brownfields redevelopment and prevention. It is a concept with multiple objectives. It will provide legitimacy to brownfields investment and lending, which does not now exist; and promote innovative cleanup technologies. 
   By redeveloping brownfields and easing development pressure on greenfields, we are promoting smart growth; and by providing critical financial tools to our small businesses, we are promoting the backbone of our nation's economy. Revitalizing brownfields is pro-business, pro-community, and pro-environment.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on July 21, 1999, NISH will host a ceremony to acknowledge and celebrate the legacy of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a distinguished member of the United States Senate for 24 years. This Congressional leader, long recognized for his work in pension reform, labor and foreign policy, is being celebrated for his enduring contributions to people with severe disabilities through the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program. Elected to the Senate in 1956, Senator Javits was instrumental in expanding the work of the Wagner-O'Day Program to include people with mental retardation, mental illness and other severe disabilities through the 1971 Javits Amendments. 
   NISH is the non-profit agency that assists community rehabilitation programs that employ people with disabilities through the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program. Celebrating its 25th Anniversary, NISH acknowledges the critical role that Senator Javits played in the lives of people with disabilities, through the expansion of the program. Today, more than 30,000 people with disabilities are employed on Javits-Wagner-O'Day projects across the country. 
   It is my pleasure, Mr. President to offer my congratulations and best wishes to NISH as it celebrates its 25th Anniversary. Further, I extend the invitation to all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives to join me in attending the celebration to honor the legacy of Jacob Javits on July 21st from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. in 902 Hart Senate Office Building.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will make my full statement after the vote, but this bill gives new consumer protections to the 48 million Americans in self-insured plans that the States are unable to protect. This bill creates a new, binding, internal/external appeals process for 124 million Americans. This bill also protects 140 million Americans from having their predictive genetic information used to deny them health insurance coverage, and it expands access to health insurance through increasing affordability and choice of health care options. 
   As we prepared this legislation, we had three goals in mind. First, to give families the protections they want and need; second, to ensure that medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients; and finally, to keep the cost of this legislation low so it does not displace anyone from being able to get health care coverage. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights was not crafted easily and it was not crafted hastily. This legislation is a result of over 2 years of work by the Senate HELP Committee. In March of 1997, I chaired the first of 17 hearings on the topic of improving health care quality. In April of 1998, I chaired a committee field hearing at Fletcher Allen Hospital, in Burlington, VT. Numerous leaders from the Vermont medical profession and Vermont insurance regulators pointed out the State of Vermont already has passed 22 patient protections, including direct access to OB/GYNs and a ban on gag rules and a continuity of health care provision. Vermont's most pressing need, according to these State providers, was to enact protections for those individuals in self-funded plans that the States could not protect. 
   The Vermont health providers also stressed their strong concern that any Federal health care legislation not increase costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Kennedy proposal would have raised health insurance premiums by 6.1 percent. A study commissioned by the AFL-CIO concluded that such an increase would cause 1.8 million Americans to lose their health insurance. This would mean approximately 4,000 Vermonters would lose their health insurance. The Vermonter who could still afford health insurance would have to pay an additional $328 a year for family coverage. 
   During the battles over the last few weeks, we have heard a great deal of biting, political rhetoric. But we cannot forget that the real issue is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a package they can afford and that we can enact. We must pass this bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a time of trial for so many Members to finally come to this end and have a victory which hopefully will not stop here but will continue. There is too much good in this bill not to have it become legislation that will be passed into law. I am confident the President, when he understands what is in here, and we work with the House and make  some changes--I am sure we can accommodate the other side and we can end up with a piece of legislation. Hopefully it will be done this year. 
   Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which had jurisdiction over this bill, I would like to take a moment to thank all those who have worked so hard to make this bill possible. This legislation has been developed over the course of more than two years, and a great number of people have positively contributed to the process. 
   This bill represents a tremendous effort by the members of the HELP Committee. I want to thank the members of the Nickles Task Force for their guidance. I wish to thank Senator NICKLES himself, and also the majority leader for their dedication to see this legislation through to the end. 
   The staff to the members of the HELP Committee have contributed greatly to this bill. Rob Wasinger with Senator BROWNBACK, Prescilla Hanley with Senator COLLINS, Libby Rolfe with Senator SESSIONS, and Kate Hull with Senator HUTCHINSON. 
   The staff of the subcommittees carried a great deal of weight. This includes Helen Rhee with Senator DEWINE, Chris Spear and Raissa Geray with Senator ENZI, Anne Phelps and Sue Ramthum with Senator FRIST, and Alan Gilbert with Senator GREGG. 
   The committee markup of this legislation lasted over 11 hours and so I must acknowledge the tireless efforts of Denis O'Donovan, Steve Chapman, and Leah Cooper from the full Committee staff. I also thank Bill Baird of the Legislative Counsel Office. He has provided enormous help. 
   I am grateful for the efforts by the staff of the GOP Health Care Task Force. Michael Cannon with the RPC, Steve Irizarry with Senator HAGEL, Mike Solon with Senator GRAMM, Peter Stein with Senator SANTORUM, and Kathy Means, Bill Sweetnam, and Dede Spritznagel with Senator ROTH. 
   Finally, I would like to thank the assistant majority leader's staff for their leadership. Stacey Hughes, Meg Hauck, Hazen Marshall, Matt Kirk, Brooke Simmons, Gail Osterberg, and Eric Ueland were invaluable. As well as Sharon Soderstrom and Keith Hennessy from the majority leader's Office. 
   On my own staff, I would like to thank Paul Harrington, Sean Donohue, Dirksen Lehman, Kim Monk, and Philo Hall and Marle Power my Staff Director. This certainly could not have happened without my health policy fellows, Tom Valuck, Kathy Matt, and Carol Vannier. I especially want to thank Karen Guice and Pat Stroup, who each provided two years of groundwork on this legislation. 
   The round the clock work, particularly over the past week, of all the staff involved is greatly appreciated. 
   Mr. President, I could not be more proud of all these people. 
   Around-the-clock work, particularly over the past week, of all the staff is greatly appreciated. I cannot be more proud of these people. I want to commend them and thank them profusely. I also thank, of course, the people who work in this great body to make sure that we end up doing the right things at the right time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to explain where we are right now. This monstrosity, whatever you want to call it, of a procedure which was set up by the leaders in negotiating back and forth leads us into these kinds of situations. We, on the Republican side, are trying to end up with the best bill, and we are intending to do that. This provision, which is offered by Senator SNOWE, is responding, to the extent that we desire to do so, to the question which has been raised about mastectomies. 
   If anybody would try to explain, even to our colleagues, as to this chart we use on the parliamentary procedure, we could spend the rest of the week just talking about that. What we are doing now is taking care of the issue raised with respect to women's health and mastectomies. We have a good provision. That is recognized by the other side. It is a fine position. Everybody ought to adopt it. We hope you do. I hope we get 100 votes on this amendment. We are going to take up and the other side will have an opportunity to reinstitute clinical trials at some point. This is the process that has been set up. We are trying to improve our bill, and by doing that we are going to make sure we have the best provision possible dealing with women with breast cancer. That is what we are doing. 
   The fact we attached it to a provision on clinical trials is the way the game is working back and forth. But we all, each of us, want to end up with the best possible bill for our side. Right now I point out we will have an amendment on clinical trials. That will end up eventually being 
   in our bill which will be voted on at the end. People may disagree with what we end up with on clinical trials. They may have their own version. We will have a good provision. What we are trying to do right now is to make sure the best possible policy is established for women with breast cancer. So I hope people will try to understand this somewhat convoluted process is going to confuse you all the way along. You have to wait until the end to see what the final product is. 
   I reemphasize what the Senator from Maine said, as to what the Republican bill is across the board, the whole bill. It is different with respect to the protections people receive. For the first time, the Republican bill will provide to this Nation a standard which is the ``best medicine'' standard. It does away with the multiple standards across this Nation, about what is generally practiced in the area. This will give us the opportunity for every woman and every man to be able to get the advice as to what the experts, by analysis of all the processes that have been used, is the best medicine. 
   That is why this bill does a job in an area which has not been discussed much but we should concentrate on, which is AHCPR. That is the acronym for the agency which has been set up to learn what all of those interested in health care from the beginning of these great discussions starting in 1994 say we need to determine: How do you determine what the best results are? 
   How do you determine what the best results are? You set up a system where you can get outcomes research throughout this country, reporting of what was tried and what worked and what did not work. 
   As a result of that, we now will be able to help physicians across this Nation, under certain circumstances when problems occur, to know, about these following systems and methods, whatever was used to try to cure this disease or whatever, that these are the ones that worked. So that individual, trying to find out what kind of care they ought to get, will have the ability to first appeal it internally. If the doctor will say, ``I do not believe what the HMO tells me I should do is the best medicine,'' they could do that review internally. If they are not happy with the internal review, then they ask for an external review. This external review person must be an expert in the area, an independent person, one who can be relied upon to give an independent judgment. If that individual says, ``No we think the best care would be this process which across the Nation  has worked the best,'' then the decision can be made. If the patient desires it, ``I want the one that has been best across the Nation,'' they can get it. That is what we are talking about. 
   Right now we are in a convoluted process where people are going to be knocking amendments out with an amendment that may even be in a different area, but in the final analysis when we get to it tomorrow night, we expect to have a bill which will provide the best possible health care to all Americans. 
   It is a little confusing.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I have listened to the very excellent debate of my good friend from Connecticut, and it sounds very compelling. It is with some difficulty that I have to remind those across the aisle that we tried last year and we tried this year to have a face-off with the two bills: You put the best bill forward you have, we will put the best bill forward we have, we will allow amendments back and forth, 20 to a side, something like that. No, they did not want that. Why? They figured they would lose. We had a better bill. We have a better bill now. 
   No. 1, this bill, after the vote, assuming we win on the vote, the Senator from Connecticut will have the opportunity, the minority will have the opportunity to offer their provisions on clinical trials again. We will have several opportunities to do that. We are not cutting off the opportunity for that one to be reexamined. 
   What we are saying is, right now, we want to make sure we clear up the problems with respect to mastectomies and want to make sure this body will have an opportunity to, once and for all, bring back the so-called amendment of Senator D'Amato to make sure all women in this Nation have an opportunity for the best possible care for the very difficult problems of breast cancer. 
   We are ready to do that. There will be other votes. We will have more votes, I do not know, 5, 10 more votes between now and the time this debate ends. Right now, we want to have the vote on our amendment which, under this convoluted process we were talked into by the minority, which is very confusing--and maybe they want it that way--creates a mess for the public and even us as Members to understand what the process is or what is going to happen next or how we are going to end up. 
   I want to let everyone know I am sincerely in favor of good clinical trials, and I am sincerely in favor of taking care, as we would right now, of the problems of the mastectomies and also OB/GYN. We will be doing that. Since I am the one who is objecting, I want everyone to know that is my job as leader on the floor. I do not want it to be utilized as some way I am against these things personally. 
   I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to alert those who followed the minority's debate earlier. It was not only confusing but most inaccurate as to scope. The Democrats claim: ``The Republican plan would only apply to 48 million Americans.'' 
   This is accurate for one aspect, but it ignores many extremely important provisions. Further, charges regarding actions by the insurance industry were not only inaccurate but totally baseless. 
   Let me set forth what the scope of the protections actually is. 
   The Republican plan contains nine major patient protection provisions. One of the nine major components has six new access standards to ERISA for the 48 million in self-insured plans that State consumer protection standards cannot reach. 
   These include: the prudent layman's standard for emergency care; a mandatory point of service option; direct access to OB/GYNs; direct access to pediatricians; a continuity of care provision; and a prohibition of gag rules. 
   The majority of Americans already enjoy these protections, since most of the states have already adopted these standards through their regulation of health insurance companies. 
   The other major components of the Patients' Bill of Rights provide significant new protections for millions of Americans. Of these, some provisions are not even included in the Democratic bill. The provisions include: 
   1. A new health plan comparative information requirement to benefit all 124 million Americans covered by group health plans under ERISA; 
   2. Grievance procedures and internal and external appeal rights for all 124 million Americans covered by group health plans under ERISA; 
   3. Providing all 140 million Americans covered by group and individual health plans with new rights that will prevent discrimination based on predictive genetic information; and 
   4. Benefit all 270 million Americans by providing a stronger emphasis on quality improvement in our health care system with a refocused role for AHCPR. 
   The GOP plan creates new enforceable federal health care standards to cover those 48 million of the 124 million Americans covered by ERISA plans that the states, through their regulation of private health insurance companies, under the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, cannot protect. We feel that it would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 state insurance departments--but, that we know from a new GAO report won't be enforced. 
   The Democrats, by contrast, would set health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 state insurance departments and mandate that HCFA enforce them if a state decides not to adopt them. Building a dual system of overlapping state and federal health insurance regulation is in no one's best interest. 
   The federal regulators at HCFA have faced an overwhelming new set of health insurance duties under HIPAA. In the five states that have failed to or chosen not to pass the legislation required by HIPAA (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Missouri), the HCFA is now required to act as insurance regulator for the state HIPAA provisions.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, women have special health needs that require the expertise of practitioners trained in obstetrics and gynecology. We must offer them the best means to provide for their preventive women's health needs, as well as access to an obstetrician to ensure a safe pregnancy and delivery of healthy children. Under our bill, direct access for women to routine gynecological care will be ensured. Obstetrical care and needed follow-up are also ensured without requiring preauthorization by the plan. For coordination of care, providers may be asked to provide on a continuing basis the medical treatment plans in order to allow for good coordination of a woman's health care needs. 
   In Vermont, legislation has ensured that women have direct access for their obstetrical and routine gynecological needs in order to facilitate optimal care. Vermont's law however does not cover 42 percent of women in Vermont who are in self-insured group health plans. Our bill will ensure that all women in Vermont will be guaranteed direct access for their preventive women's gynecological health needs, as well as obstetrical care.  
   I do not support the Democratic bill that requires health plans to designate their practitioners specialized in obstetrics and gynecology as primary care providers. This provision in the Democratic bill would force practitioners specialized in obstetrics and gynecology to practice primary care, independent of whether they feel qualified or have the desire to do so. Some obstetricians and gynecologists may be adequately trained and experienced in primary care medicine as well as their specialty. In those special cases, the plan will be able to review their competency and comfort level, and determine if women in the plan would be well served to be able to designate them as their primary care doctor as well. We must protect our women's health care needs to the same degree as we protect our men's, and ensure that women are being cared for by the people best trained to do so. 
   I want to ensure that women's health care needs are met the best possible way. We will do so by requiring direct access in self-ensured group health plans for obstetrical and routine gynecological services to practitioners specialized in these areas. We will also expect the same degree of training for the providers looking out for the overall health needs of women, by not assuming that all obstetricians and gynecologists are as well trained in primary care as providers who have had focused training and practice experience in providing for the total general health. I strongly urge my colleagues to ensure that the best health care needs for women is met. This will be done by supporting our bill. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.

The patient is in control. The patient has the right, first of all, to an internal review. First of all, the standard is not just necessary; it is necessary and appropriate.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me talk first and then I can yield. I want to inform you because, obviously, you are talking from a poor base of information, so there is no sense discussing it until I explain to you what is in the bill. 
   First of all, we have established for the first time in this country the right of patients to be able to get the necessary and appropriate health care that they deserve and are entitled to under their plan. That is why we have set up an internal review process first, which can be appealed within the HMO. And then if care is not given to the patient that the patient thinks is appropriate and necessary, there is an external review. That external review is 
   made by someone outside of the HMO who is a qualified individual, knowledgeable on the subject, with the authority to overrule the HMO. 
   So how can the Senator get out of that the fact that they have no rights, when for the first time we give them rights? We give much more rights than your bill does to ensure that people in these HMOs have the absolutely necessary and appropriate care that they are entitled to. 
   So I hope that we will not continue to hear this repetition of things that are not true. Yesterday, the Senator from Pennsylvania came and read this to all of you. He read all this, which explains and details this and gives you exactly what the process is. And now you turn around and say it doesn't exist. It does exist.

They cannot define necessary. They cannot define appropriate. That is a standard which we established after evidence as to what the best care is that should be available to them. The provisions are in the bill.

You are using generally acceptable practices, which is a much lower standard. We establish a higher standard that every patient is entitled to the best medical care which is necessary and appropriate. That is a new standard. That is why the doctors are concerned, because they are going to have to reach a new standard.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the tremendous effort the Senator from Utah has made in this debate. I think he has hit upon the critical issue. We must remember, all of us, every time we do make changes which result in increased costs, people become uninsured. That is the advantage of the Republican package and why it is so much better than the Democratic package. 
   If you want to keep score, as my friend from California wishes to do on victories here, they will have 1.8 million victims from their cost increases; we will have about 240,000. And who are those victims? They are the working poor. They are the ones those of us who are compassionate always feel sorry for. We ought to be spending our time and ability to increase their capacity for health care, not throw them off the plans. That is the difference between the two bills in the final analysis when you come down to it; and that is, we will not make the working poor suffer more and throw 1.8 million people off of the rolls of the insured. So keep that in mind when you think about which bill you want to vote for. Because, to me, that is the top concern. 
   In addition to that, we also create a standard, a higher standard for all Americans with respect to what they should get from health care and from the HMOs, et cetera; and that is, to get away from the old standard where you did not have to worry about the changes in the medical profession or what advantages would be accomplished. With all of the work we are doing now in the outcomes of research to determine what works and what does not work, that is going to be available to us. It is available now, but as we move forward it is going to be more and more available. 
   We demand that the doctors must give the best health care, not just something that happens to be generally practiced in the area. 
   So we have two huge advantages with the Republican bill. I hope Members will keep that in mind as we move forward in the process. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean Energy Act of 1999, for myself and Senators LIEBERMAN, MOYNIHAN, SCHUMER, KERRY, LAUTENBERG, DODD, and KENNEDY. 
   Air pollution from dirty power plants threatens the health of lakes, forests, and people across our Nation. Today, we call for an end to code red air pollution alerts, smog filled afternoons and chemical induced haze. Today, we will introduce legislation to protect our environment from the damaging effects of air pollution and move our Nation closer to a sensible energy future. 
   Why should we live with smog, acid rain and code red summer afternoons when the technology is here to capture the sun and wind in our backyard? It is time for our Nation to transition from smokestacks, coal power and smog to a future with windmills, solar power and blue skies. Like the wall in Berlin, we hope to watch the dirty power plants dismantled brick, by brick, knowing that once again we can breath freely. 
   As the U.S. PIRG report indicates, air pollution produced from dirty power plants has skyrocketed. With recent wholesale deregulation, coal fired power plants increased their output almost 16%. This has got to end. 
   Electric utility deregulation has the potential to save consumers millions of dollars in energy costs. At the same time, deregulation can move us away from reliance on dirty fossil fuels. A study by the Union of Concerned Scientists showed that we can decrease electricity prices by 13% while still achieving great public and environmental benefits. 
   Electricity prices in the Northeast are double those in the Midwest. Under current law, old, dirty coal fired power plants in the Midwest are exempt from the same air quality standards that our plants meet. Their emissions settle into our streams, forests, eyes, and lungs. They get the benefit, we get the cost. 
   Not anymore. Our bill will level the playing field for clean Northeast utility companies. It will knock dirty upwind coal burners out of the competitive arena. It will give our utilities the ability to compete successfully in deregulated markets. 
   Our proposal will cap emissions from generation facilities, forcing old coal plants to meet tighter air quality standards or shut down. We attack pollutants that lead to smog, acid rain, mercury contamination and ground-level ozone. 
   Our bill will put in place a nation-wide wires charge to create an electric benefit fund to develop renewable energy sources and promote energy efficiency and universal access. It will mandate that generation facilities purchase increasing percentages of renewable power each year. We begin at 2.5% in 2000 and increase to 20% renewables by 2020. Either buy renewables, or don't play in the market place. 
   Our legislation will make it cheaper and easier for consumers to install renewable energy sources in their homes, farms, and small businesses by simplifying the metering process. And finally, our bill has a comprehensive disclosure provision, giving consumers honest and verifiable information regarding their energy choices. 
   Our Nation's future depends on clean, reliable energy. We can end dirty air from tall utility smokestacks. We can capture the global market for renewable energy. We can stop acid rain from killing our forests and we can keep our summer days from being ozone days. We can increase our energy security. And we can do all this while saving consumers millions of dollars on their utility bills.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know that my worthy opponents have made note of our absence. We are not ignoring this issue. We have a better answer. There will be a Snowe-Abraham amendment presented, probably tomorrow, that will handle this issue. I think the Members will agree that the approach we take will be preferable to the one being taken right now. 
   I would like to address my colleagues generally on the situation at this time. The Patients' Bill of Rights Act addresses those areas of health quality on which there is broad consensus. It is solid legislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system for all Americans. 
   The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the HELP Committee, has been long dedicated to action in order to improve the quality of health care. Our commitment to developing appropriate managed care standards has been demonstrated by the 17 additional hearings related to health care quality. 
   Senator FRIST's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee held three hearings on the work of the Agency for Health Care  Policy and Research, sometimes referred to as AHCPR. Each of these hearings helped us to develop the separate pieces of legislation that are reflected in S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get their health care. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights requires full disclosure by an employer about health plans it offers to employees. Patients also need to know how adverse decisions by a plan can be appealed, both internally--that is, within the HMO--and externally, through an independent medical reviewer. Under our bill, the reviewer's decision will be binding on the health plan. We are talking about an external, outside reviewer, and it is binding. There is no appeal. It is binding. They have to do it. However, the patient will retain his or her current rights to go to court. 
   Timely utilization decisions and a defined process for appealing such decisions are the keys to restoring trust in the health care system. Our legislation also provides Americans covered by health insurance with new rights to prevent discrimination based on predictive genetic information. This is a crucial provision. It ensures that medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients and are based on the best scientific evidence. That is the key phrase. We want to remember that one because you won't see it on the other side. 
   It provides a stronger emphasis on quality improvement in our health care system with a refocused role for AHCPR, taking advantage of all the abilities we have now to understand better what is going on with respect to health care in this country, to sift through the information that comes through AHCPR and make judgments on what the best medicine is. 
   Some believe that the answer to improving our Nation's health care quality is to allow greater access to the tort system, maybe a better lawsuit. However, you simply cannot sue your way to better health. We believe that patients must get the care they need when they need it. They ought not to have to go to court with a lawsuit. They ought to get it when they need it. It is a question of whether you want good health or you want a good lawsuit. 
   In the Patients' Bill of Rights, we make sure each patient is afforded every opportunity to have the right treatment decision made by health care professionals. In the event that does not occur, patients have the recourse of pursuing an outside appeal to get medical decisions by medical people to give them good medical treatment. Prevention, not litigation, is the best medicine. 
   Our bill creates new, enforceable Federal health standards to cover those 48 million people of the 124 million Americans covered by employer-sponsored plans. These are the very same people that the States, through their regulation of private health insurance companies, cannot protect. We will protect them. 
   What are these standards? They include, first, a prudent layperson standard for emergency care; second, a mandatory point of service option; direct access to OB/GYNs and pediatricians--that has not been recognized by the opposition--continuity of care; a prohibition on gag rules; access to medication; access to specialists; and self-pay for behavioral health. 
   It would be inappropriate to set Federal health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I tell you, we have a better health care bill. That is all I am telling you. It will protect more people at less cost. Your bill is so expensive that you are going to affect a million people, and those people are the ones we want most to protect. Those are the people who are working low-income jobs and who will be torn off and removed from health care protection by your bill. We will not do that. We are going to protect those people who need the protection the most from being denied health insurance. 
   I take back the remainder of my time. 
   It would be inappropriate to set Federal health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments. As the National Association of Insurance Commissioners put it:  
   We do not want States to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.....Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have no protections in the self-funded ERISA plans.  
   Senator KENNEDY's approach would set health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments. Worse yet, it would mandate that the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, enforce them, if the State decides otherwise. It would be a disaster--HCFA can't even handle the small things they have with HIPAA, the Medicare and Medicaid problems--to get involved in the demands that would be placed upon them by the Democratic bill. 
   This past recess, Senator LEAHY and I held a meeting in Vermont to let New England home health providers meet with HCFA. It was a packed and angry house, with providers traveling from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. That is who the Democrats would have enforce their bill. It is in no one's best interests to build a dual system of overlapping State and Federal health insurance regulation. 
   Increasing health insurance premiums causes significant losses in coverage. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pegged the cost of the Democratic bill at six times higher than S. 326. Based on our best estimates, passage of the Democratic bill would result in the loss of coverage for over 1.5 million working Americans and their families. 
   Now, why do you want to charge forward with that plan? To put this in perspective, this would mean they would have their family's coverage canceled under the Democratic bill--canceled. Let me repeat that. Adoption of the Democratic approach would cancel the insurance policies of almost 1.5 million Americans, CBO estimates. I cannot support legislation that would result in the loss of health insurance coverage for the combined population of the States of Virginia, Delaware, South Dakota, and Wyoming--no coverage.

   that consumers want, at a minimal cost and without the disruption of coverage, if we apply these protections responsibly and where they are needed. 
   In sharp contrast to the Democratic alternative, our bill would actually increase coverage. With the additional Tax Code provisions of S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, our bill allows for full deduction of health insurance for the self-employed, the full availability of medical savings accounts, and the carryover of unused benefits from flexible spending accounts.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an extremely important amendment. I think everyone ought to understand exactly what we are trying to do. 
   We are entering into a new era with respect to the availability of health care, good health care, excellent health care. We have seen pharmaceuticals being devised which would do miraculous things. We are also having medical procedures designed and devices created. But what we have not seen is their being available everywhere, or a standard that will make them available in areas where they ought to be available. 
   What we are trying to do today is establish that every American is entitled to the best medical care available, not that which is generally available in your area; not be different from one end of the country to the other but that everyone is entitled to that health care, especially if you are in an HMO. They should be, and must be, aware of what is the best health care that would serve you to make you a well person. 
   For a couple of days now, we have heard many tragic stories about children who were born with birth defects or who were injured because the private health care system failed them in some manner. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a bill they believe would address these situations. The Republican health care bill addresses the concerns people have about their health care without causing new problems. 
   Americans want assurance that they will get the health care they need when they need it. I am going to describe exactly how the Republican bill does just that. I am also going to describe how the Republican bill will create new patient rights and protections which  would have prevented the tragic situations 
   described by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   Finally, I want to talk about how the Republican bill achieves these goals in an accountable manner, without increasing health care costs, without a massive new Federal Government bureaucracy, and without taking health care insurance away from children and families. It doesn't cost money to increase your ability to make sure you are aware of what is available. The heart of the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act is a fair process for independent external review that addresses consumer concerns about getting access to appropriate and timely medical care in a managed care plan. 
   The Republican bill establishes gateways that ensure medical disputes get heard by an independent, external reviewer. The plan does not have veto power in these decisions. Denials or disputes about medical necessity and appropriateness are eligible for review, period. If a plan considers a treatment to be experimental or investigational, it is eligible for external review. The reviewer is an independent physician of the same specialty as the treating physician. In addition, the reviewer must have adequate expertise and qualifications, including age-appropriate expertise in the patient's diagnosis. 
   So, in other words, a pediatrician must review a pediatric case and a cardiologist must review a cardiology case. In the Republican bill, only qualified physicians are permitted to overturn medical decisions by treating physicians. The reviewer then makes an independent medical decision based on the valid, relevant scientific and clinical evidence. This standard ensures that patients get medical care based on the most up-to-date science and technology. 
   The Kennedy bill describes medical necessity in the statute. It does not define it in a manner that ensures that patients will get the highest quality care and the most up-to-date technology. 
   The Republican bill ensures that physicians will make independent determinations based on the best available scientific evidence. That is the standard, the best available scientific evidence. It is that simple. Health plans cannot game the system and block access to external review. To ensure this is the case, I have asked the private law firm of Ivins, Phillips & Baker to analyze the Republican external review provision, asking two key questions: First, could a plan block a patient from getting access to external review in a manner that is inconsistent with the intent of our provision? 
   Second, is there any factor that would prevent the external reviewer from rendering a fair and independent medical decision?

<DOCNO>106-jeffords-vt-19-19990713</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me provide examples of how our external review provisions ensure that patients and children get medical care. 
   Chart 1 illustrates under the Republican bill that the health plan cannot ``game the system'' by blocking access to external review or using some cleverly worded definition of ``medical necessity.'' The Republican provision ensures that people get the medical care they need. 
   Here is an example of an HMO that has a planned contract which says the HMO will cover ``medically necessary care'' but the HMO has the sole discretion to determine what is ``medically necessary.'' 
   Of course, this is an extreme example. Let's see if it holds up under our external review provision. In this example, the patient and physician may not know the plan's rationale for denying a claim since it is the HMO's sole discretion to determine medical necessity. This can be frustrating for both the patient and the physician. 
   Under the Republican bill, a denied claim would be eligible for an outside independent medical review. In fact, all denied medical claims under this example would be eligible for review under our provision. This is confirmed by the outside legal analysis which I have submitted for the RECORD. The legal opinion says:  
   The statutory language provides for external review of any determination of medical necessity and appropriateness, even when that determination is intertwined with an interpretation of the plan's terms.  
   The external reviewer would make an independent medical determination. There is nothing in the HMO contract or in the legislative provision that prevents the reviewer from making the best decision for the patient. If the patient needs the medical care, the reviewer will make this assessment. They will get the care. The independent reviewer's decision is binding on the plan. 
   Chart 2 is an example of a cleft palate. This chart illustrates that patients, and especially children, will get necessary health care services. Plans will not be able to deem a procedure as ``cosmetic'' and thus block access to external review. Only physicians can make coverage decisions involving medical judgment. 
   An example we have heard many times from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is of an infant born with a cleft palate. The infant's physician recommends surgery so the child can perform normal daily functions, such as eating and speaking normally. The treating physician says this surgery is medically necessary and appropriate. In this example, the HMO planned contract states: ``The plan does not cover cosmetic surgery.'' It was denied as a claim, saying the child's surgery is not a covered benefit because it is a cosmetic procedure, despite the recommendations of the treating physician. 
   What does this mean? Does this mean this is the end of the road for this child's family? No. Under the Republican bill, this denial of coverage would be eligible for appeal because the decision involves an ``element of medical judgment.'' Under the Republican bill, medical decisions are made by physicians with appropriate expertise. In this case, it means an independent reviewer would be required to have pediatric expertise. 
   Finally, the independent medical reviewer would look at the range of appropriate clinical information and would have the 
   ability to overturn the plan's decision. The child would receive the surgery to correct the cleft palate, and the plan would cover this procedure because the reviewer's decision is binding on the plan. 
   The next chart is on emergency room coverage. The primary point of this chart is that under the prudent layperson standard, parents can use their judgment and take their sick child to the nearest emergency room without worrying about whether the plan will deny coverage. 
   Another example we are all familiar with is of little Jimmy whose tragic story has been told by Senator DURBIN. His parents called the HMO when their baby fell ill. The HMO nurse recommended the parents take their sick child to a participating hospital an hour's drive away. During their long drive, the family passed several closer hospitals along the way. The child's symptoms grew worse and the baby went into respiratory arrest. By the time they got to the hospital, the one that the HMO said was covered by a plan, it was too late. The tissue damage resulted in the loss of a limb and little Jimmy had to endure a quadruple amputation. This is a horrible situation. 
   Let's look at what the Republican bill would do to address this type of tragic and unnecessary situation. First, under our prudent layperson standard, a parent would not have to call the HMO to get permission to go to the nearest emergency room. In this case, the parents could have gone to the closest emergency room and little Jimmy would not have gone into respiratory arrest. This tragedy would have been averted under the Republican provision because our bill ensures that emergency room services must be provided without preauthorization and without regard to whether the services are provided out of network. 
   Say for the sake of argument that the plan denies reimbursements after the hospital has provided the treatment. Under the Republican bill, little Jimmy's family would not be stuck with the hospital charges. They could appeal this decision to an outside reviewer because the decisions about whether care is medically necessary are eligible for external review. 
   The law firm of Ivins, Phillips & Baker says that under our provision:  
   The coverage dispute in this case involves a judgment of medical necessity and appropriateness under the prudent layperson standard mandated by the bill, and therefore is eligible for independent external review under the bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. As Members can see from the examples on these charts, the  Republican Patients' Bill of Rights ensures patients get the medical care they need, that parents can be assured their children will be cared for by appropriate specialists, and that people can go forward to emergency rooms when they are sick, when the children are sick, and can do so with the assurance that their health plan will cover these services. 
   Establishing these important rights will help families avoid illness, injury, and improve the quality of health care. I believe this is why we are debating this issue today. You can't sue your way to health care. Congress can't create a definition of ``medical necessity'' that is better than letting physician experts make decisions on the best available science. They must practice the best available science. 
   However, we can improve access to health care services and ensure that people get timely access to the medical care they need. We can ensure that health care we provide is high quality health care. Most important, we can do all these things without increasing health care costs and causing more Americans to lose their coverage. 
   We accomplish all these goals with the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to answer my good friend from California. I do not believe she was listening to my explanation of what this bill does. In fact, we do throw out 200 years of law practice. That shakes the legal community up a bit because they have to learn what is going on in modern medical situations. They have to become aware of how they find out what the best medicine is, not necessarily what is used in that area. It is the best medicine available. 
   We set a higher standard, and that is why the legal profession is a little bit upset. They do not want to have to learn all this medical stuff. They want to go back to the good old days when they could just call the local doctor and say: What is the general medical practice? And whatever that doctor does is the general medical practice. That is the present standard. We say that is not good enough now. 
   We are going to make sure that every person in an HMO has the right to the best medical care available, and that is what we explained with chart 1, chart 2, and chart 3. The decision is made by the external reviewer who says: Look, you can use this treatment now, you can use this pharmacy prescription, and that can be cured. You did not use it, you are not going to use it--that is wrong. Give them that care.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my good friend on the committee for the work he has done in this area. This is an area where we have joined together. It will ensure that we have a change, a positive change in the clinical trial aspect. I want to work together with the Senator in that regard. 
   I also want to say this bill is not finished yet. We have places to go and time to spend to bring it to a better form than it is now. I look forward to continuing to work to improve the bill. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 1357, the Retirement Account Portability (RAP) Act. This bill is a close companion to H.R. 738, the bill introduced by Congressman EARL POMEROY of North Dakota. It was also included as title III of the Pension Coverage and Portability Act, S. 741, introduced earlier this year by myself and Senators GRAHAM and GRASSLEY. Generally this bill is intended to be a further iteration of the concepts embodied in both of those bills. 
   The RAP Act standardizes the rules in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) which regulate how portable a worker's retirement savings account is, and while it does not make portability of pension benefits perfect, it greatly improves the status quo. No employer will be ``required'' to accept rollovers from other plans, however. A rollover will occur when the employee offers, and the employer agrees to accept, a rollover from another plan.  
   Under current law, it is not possible for an individual to move an accumulated retirement savings account from a section 401(k) (for-profit) plan to a section 457 (state and local government) deferred compensation plan, to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), then to a section 403(b) (non-profit organization or public school) deferred annuity plan and ultimately back into a section 401(k) plan, without violating various restrictions on the movement of their money. The RAP Act will make it possible for workers to take their retirement savings with them when they change jobs regardless of the type of employer for which they work. 
   This bill will also help make IRAs more portable and will improve the use of conduit IRAs. Conduit IRAs are individual retirement accounts to which certain distributions from a qualified retirement plan or from another individual retirement account have been transferred. RAP changes the rules regulating these IRAs so that workers leaving the for-profit, non-profit or governmental field can use a conduit IRA as a parking spot for a pre-retirement distribution. These special accounts are needed by many workers until they have another employer-sponsored plan in which to rollover their savings. 
   In many instances, this bill will allow an individual to rollover an IRA consisting exclusively of tax-deductible contributions into a retirement plan at his or her new place of employment, thus helping the individual consolidate retirement savings in a single account. Under certain circumstances, the RAP Act will also allow workers to rollover any after-tax contributions made at his or her previous workplace, into a new retirement plan. Under the provisions of the bill as drafted, after-tax contributions will be rollable from a plan to an IRA and from an IRA to an IRA, but not from a IRA to a plan, nor on a direct plan to plan basis. I am open to recommendations on how we can improve the treatment of after-tax rollovers and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues and the public on that topic. 
   Current law requires a worker who changes jobs to face a deadline of 60 days within which to roll over any retirement savings benefits either into an Individual Retirement Account, or into the retirement plan of his or her new employer. Failure to meet the deadline can result in both income 
   and excise taxes being imposed on the account. We believe that this deadline should be waived under certain circumstances and we have outlined them in the bill. Consistent with the Pomeroy bill, in case of a Presidentially-declared natural disaster or military service in a combat zone, the Treasury Department will have the authority to disallow imposition of any tax penalty for the account holder. Consistent with the additional changes incorporated by Congressman POMEROY this year, however, we have included a waiver of tax penalties in the case of undue hardship, such as a serious personal injury or illness and we have given the Department of the Treasury the authority to waive the deadline. 
   The Retirement Account Portability Act will also change two complicated rules which harm both plan sponsors and plan participants; one dealing with certain business sales (the so-called ``same desk'' rule) and the other dealing with retirement plan distribution options. Each of these rules has impeded true portability of pensions and we believe they ought to be changed. 
   In addition, this bill will extend the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (PBGC) Missing Participant program to defined benefit multiemployer pension plans. Under current law, the PBGC has jurisdiction over both single-employer and multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. A few years ago, the agency initiated a program to locate missing participants from terminated, single-employer plans. The program attempts to locate individuals who are due a benefit, but who have not filed for benefits owed to them, or who have attempted to find their former employer but failed to receive their benefits. This bill expands the missing participant program to multiemployer pension plans. 
   I know of no reason why individuals covered by a multiemployer pension plans should not have the same protections as participants of single-employer pension plans and this change will help more former employees receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. This bill does not expand the missing participants program to defined contribution plans. Supervision of defined contribution plans is outside the statutory jurisdiction of the PBGC and I have not heard strong arguments for including those plans within the jurisdiction of the agency. I would be pleased to hear the recommendations of any of my colleagues on this matter. 
   In a particularly important provision, the Retirement Account Portability bill will allow public school teachers and other state and local employees who move between different states and localities to use their savings in their section 403(b) plan or section 457 deferred compensation arrangement to purchase ``service credit'' in the defined benefit plan in which they are currently participating, and thus obtain greater pension benefits in the plan in which they conclude their career. 
   As a final note, this bill, this bill does not reduce the vesting schedule from the current five year cliff vesting (or seven year graded) to a three year cliff or six year graded vesting schedule that has been contained in other bills. I support the shorter vesting schedules, but I feel that the abbreviated schedule makes a dramatic change to tax law without removing some of the disincentives to maintaining a pension plan that businesses--especially small businesses--desperately need. More discussion of this matter is needed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserving Access to Care in the Home Act of 1999, also known as the PATCH Act. This important bill has been crafted to protect access to care for those most in need, relieve the cash flow problems faced by agencies, and improve the interaction between home health agencies and HCFA. I want to recognize Senator REED, Senator ENZI, and Senator LEAHY. These cosponsors have shown tremendous effort and dedication in dealing with the crisis in home health care. 
   Abraham Lincoln said ``The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves, in their separate and individual capacities.'' This is the essence of home health care. 
   Home health care means so much to so many people: it means that people recovering from surgery can go home sooner--it means that someone recovering from an accident can get physical therapy in their home, it means our seniors can stay at home, and out of nursing homes. It is smart policy from human and financial standpoints. 
   My own State of Vermont is a model for providing high-quality, comprehensive care with a low price tag. For the past eight years, the average Medicare expenditure for home health care in Vermont has been the lowest in the nation. Vermont's home care system was designed to efficiently meet the needs of frail and elderly citizens in our largely rural State, but the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) reimbursement system was not. HCFA's interim payment system (IPS) has been implemented in a manner that inadequately reimburses agencies for the care that they provide. 
   The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) did a lot of good, providing health care coverage for millions of low income children, providing targeted tax relief for families and students, tax incentives to encourage pensions savings, and extending the life of Medicare. However, as with most things in life, it was not perfect. 
   The BBA failed to recognize how the new home health reimbursement would affect small rural home health care providers. The IPS has caused such significant cash flow problems, that many agencies are struggling to meet their payroll needs. Home health care agencies are now facing the prospect of 15 percent budget cut next year. This budget cut, on top of already stretched budgets, would be disastrous for providers and patients alike. 
   The PATCH Act will rectify these problems.  
   First, the PATCH Act eliminates the 15-percent cut scheduled for next year. The actual savings under IPS have exceeded initial expectations, so the 15-percent cut is unnecessary to achieve the savings originally projected as needed. 
   Second, the PATCH Act clarifies the definition of ``homebound'' so that coverage decisions are based on the condition of the individual and not on an arbitrary number of absences from the home. Many seniors have found themselves virtual prisoners in their homes, threatened with loss of coverage if they attend adult day care, weekly religious services, or even visit family members in the hospital. This makes no sense because all of these activities are steps on the road to successful and healthy recovery. Often, home care professionals want patients to get outside a little bit, as part of their care plan. This helps fight off depression. Eligibility for home care should depend on the health of the patient. 
   Third, the PATCH Act creates an ``outlier'' provision so that medically complex patients suffering from multiple ailments are not excluded by the Medicare program. Agencies will receive reimbursements for reasonable costs so that they can continue to provide care for these complex patients without going bankrupt. Home health agencies can provide care to long-term chronic care patients at a lower cost than nursing homes, or hospitals. 
   Next, the PATCH Act also matches the rate of review to the rate of denial and provides a reward to agencies for ``good behavior'' and incentive to submit ``good claims.'' Conducting high cost, intense audits on all agencies, regardless of the past efficiency of the agency, is expensive and unproductive. Many agencies are finding themselves swamped by pre-payment reviews for claims that they submit. These reviews require that health professionals spend a substantial amount of their time filling out forms instead of providing urgently needed care to the elderly. Matching the rate of review to the rate of denial adds to the efficiency of home health agencies, and the efficiency of the regulatory. If the finalized denial rate of claims for a home health agency is less than 5 percent then (a) there will be no prepayment reviews, and (b) the post-payment review shall not exceed 10 percent of the claims. 
   Finally, the bill restores the periodic interim payment system (PIP) and provides guidelines to HCFA on the development of a prospective payment system (PPS) that will be fair to Vermont's low-cost, rural providers. 
   The sooner you can return patients to their homes, the sooner they can recover. The familiar environment of the home, family, and friends is more nurturing to recovering patients than the often stressful and unfamiliar surroundings of a hospital. Home health allows them to receive treatment for their medical conditions while being integrated back into independence. Home health is also a great avenue for education. It empowers families to assist in the care of their loved ones. This, too, results in lower costs because family members, in addition to health professionals, provide some of the care. Access to care in the home must be saved. 
   I look forward to turning this legislation into law. The women and men who provide home care are on the front line every day and deserve nothing but our best efforts.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment will go a long way toward ensuring the safety and healthy development of children of federal employees who are cared for in federally sponsored or operated child care centers. The Senate passed this amendment last year on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, it was dropped during the last few hours of the conference. So I am back again this year. 
   In 1987, Congress passed the Trible amendment which permitted executive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a portion of federally owned or leased space for the provision of child care services for federal employees. The General Services Administration (GSA) was given the authority to provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to federal agencies for the development of child care centers. In the decade since the Trible amendment was passed, hundreds of federal facilities throughout the nation have established onsite child care centers which are a tremendous help to our employees. 
   As you know, Federal property is exempt from state and local laws, regulations, and oversight. What this means for child care centers on that property are not subject to even the most minimal health and safety standards. Even the most basic state and local health and safety requirements do not apply to child care centers Federal facilities. 
   I find this very troubling, and I think we sell our federal employees a bill of goods when federally owned leased child care cannot guarantee that their children are in safe facilities. The Federal Government should set the example when it comes to providing safe child care. It should not be turn an apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards simply because state and local regulations do not apply to them. 
   As Congress and the administration turn their spotlight on our nation's child care system, we must first get our own house in order. We must safeguard and protect the children receiving services in child care centers housed in federal facilities. Our employees should not be denied some assurance that the centers in which they place their children are accountable for meeting basic health and safety standards. 
   This amendment will require all child care services located in federal facilities to meet, at the very least, the same level of health and safety standards required of other child care centers in the same geographical area. That sounds like common sense, but as we all know too well, common sense is not always reflected in the law. 
   It should also be made clear that state and local standards should be a floor for basic health and safety, and not a ceiling. The role of the Federal Government--and, I believe, of the United States Congress in particular--is to constantly strive to do better and to lead by example. Federal facilities should always try to provide the highest quality of care. The GSA has required national accreditation in GSA-owned and leased facilities for years, and the majority of child care centers in GSA facilities are either in compliance with those accreditation standards or are strenuously working to get there. This is high quality of care towards which we should strive for in all of our Federal child care facilities. 
   Federal child care should mean something more than simply location on a Federal facility. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide safe care for its employees, and it has a responsibility for making sure that those standards are monitored and enforced. Some Federal employees receive this guarantee. Many do not. We can and must do better. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois would strike the $17 million which is included in this bill to support a program offering tuition assistance to DC students who are pursuing postsecondary education. As the author of legislation to authorize this program, I strongly oppose the Durbin amendment. 
   In crafting my legislation--which is cosponsored by Senators HUTCHISON, WARNER, and MOYNIHAN--I have been mindful of the need for fiscal responsibility. The $17 million included in the DC appropriations bill is the amount recommended in the President's budget. Although I would agree that any amounts above this figure should come from sources other than the Federal treasury, I do believe it is appropriate for the Federal government to participate in an effort to place DC students on an even keel with students in other parts of the country. 
   The authorization process for the DC tuition bill is well underway. Under the leadership of Representative TOM DAVIS and DC Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, the House of Representatives approved ``The District of Columbia College Access Act'' without a dissenting vote. The Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring and the District of Columbia--chaired by Senator VOINOVICH--recently held a hearing on this initiative. I am working actively with him and other members of the Senate to move forward with sound legislation. 
   The legislation I have introduced and the measure approved by the House share the same goal. That goal is to provide citizens of the District with a greater range of options in pursuing postsecondary education by having the Federal government offer support that, in other areas of the country, is provided by State governments. 
   Throughout my career in Congress, I have made support for education one of my top priorities, and I have regarded the education of DC students as being an important part of my efforts. 
   I am therefore delighted at the level of interest and support which the DC tuition concept has received. 
   With respect to public postsecondary education, DC students exploring their options find they have a more limited set of choices than any other group of students in the country. A student in any of the 50 states who wishes to attend a public institution of higher education has a number of institutions among which to choose. That student can base his or her decision on considerations such as the size of the institution and the strengths of the various programs it offers. A student in the District of Columbia finds that only one public institution is available. 
   As a practical matter, the District cannot expand its boundaries, nor can it establish a system of public higher education that can offer the diversity of offerings available in the various states. Every State provides support for higher education from which their residents benefit through lower in-state tuition, while out-of-state residents pay a premium to attend. I believe it is appropriate for the Federal government to assume the role of the State, effectively pushing the boundaries to a point where District students are placed on an equal footing in terms of the public education choices available to them. 
   The legislation also recognizes that many District residents choose to attend one of the many private postsecondary institutions in the DC area. Many of these institutions have made extraordinary efforts to enable District residents to succeed in their pursuit of advanced education. A number of states have developed programs, such as the Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant (TAG), to assist students at private institutions in defraying costs. The program authorized in my bill is modeled after these initiatives. 
   This legislation also complements not only those programs such as ``Everybody Wins!'' and the Potomac Regional Education Partnership (PREP) with which I have been directly involved, but also the many other initiatives undertaken by individuals and institutions who work tirelessly to nurture the potential of the children of our Nation's capital. Members of the business community have recently launched a program known as the D.C. College Access Program (DC-CAP) which will offer both financial support for students pursuing postsecondary education and assistance to high school students to assure they are prepared to tackle the challenges of higher learning. 
   An investment in education is one of the most important investments we as a society and we as individuals can make. There are boundless opportunities in the DC area for individuals with education and training beyond high school. DC residents should not be left behind in obtaining the capacity to take advantage of these opportunities.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with Senator KERRY, Senator GRAMS, AND SENATOR WELLSTONE the Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 1999. 
   My work on this bill began several weeks ago out of discussions with Vermont housing advocates and private section 8 property owners, and as well as with Senator ALLARD, Senator GRAMS and Senator GRAMM during consideration of the Financial Modernization bill. We all acknowledge that this issue has rapidly become a serious national problem--one where thousands of low income elderly, disabled, and families with children are increasingly unable to afford privately-owned low income housing units. 
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Commissioner Apgar recently took the step of exercising authority provided by Congress to use additional vouchers to stem the tide of Section 8 opt outs and prepayments. The Affordable Housing Preservation Act will provide a more permanent solution to this crisis. 
   The Jeffords/Kerry Affordable Housing Preservation Act will provide a longterm solution by building on local partnerships between non-profits, state and local governments, and private landlords to keep existing projects available for low income tenants. The bill preserves existing low income projects, as well as increase the units to expand a tight housing marketplace through new acquisition and rehabilitation. 
   In Vermont rents have increased 11 percent over the past three years, making it increasingly difficult to find affordable shelter. To make matters worse, the lack of low income housing makes it simply impossible to find a place to live in areas like Burlington, where the vacancy rate is less than one percent. 
   The need to preserve existing housing from opt outs and prepayments is only exceeded by the need to expand the number of housing units for low-income families, elderly and disabled. The affect of more Section 8 vouchers is undermined when there is nowhere to use them. On any given day in Burlington there are just 60 available rental units in a city of more than 40,000 people. 
   In such circumstances, low income families cannot even find a place to live, much less find one that's affordable. This problem has been a key factor in increasing homelessness, as families seeking help from Burlington's emergency shelter rose over 60 percent between 1997 and 1998. 
   As Section 8 federal subsidies come up for renewal more often, the risk of opt outs by private landlords increases. Housing projects in Brattleboro and Montpelier currently face opt out situations where landlords will raise rents to levels that Section 8 tenants cannot afford. 
   The Affordable Housing Preservation Act will build foundations for cooperation where efforts to raise public and private money are enhanced through federal matching grants. Vermont's community based non-profit organizations have achieved much success by encouraging private landlords seeking to exit the affordable housing business to transfer ownership to these groups. 
   Although ``sticky vouchers'' provide much needed short term relief, the Affordable Housing Preservation Act offers a long term solution to the opt out and prepayment problem by expanding community-based housing preservation and acquisition initiatives. This bill will give hope by providing help for those elderly, disabled, and families facing eviction or homelessness. 
   I look forward to working with the Chairmen and Members of the Housing Committees in the Senate and House to fix this problem and provide a new direction for the nation in affordable housing.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. 
   Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to introduce the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999 (ENDA). I am here today because I believe that the principles of equality and opportunity should be applied to all Americans and that success at work should be based on performance, not prejudice. 
   Unfortunately, qualified, hard-working Americans continue to be denied job opportunities based instead on sexual orientation. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will help put an end to this insidious discrimination. By extending to sexual orientation the same federal employment discrimination protections established for race, religion, gender, national origin, age and disability, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act will further ensure that principals of equality and opportunity apply to all Americans. 
   This bill is about fairness, this bill is about equality, this bill is about basic civil rights. This bill must pass this Congress. 
   ENDA will achieve equal rights -- not ``special rights'' -- for gays and lesbians. This legislation prohibits preferential treatment based on sexual orientation. To remove any doubt, we have added language to expressly prohibit affirmative action on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   ENDA does not require an employer to justify a neutral practice that may have a statistically disparate impact based on sexual orientation, nor provide benefits for the same-sex partner of an employee. Rather, it simply protects a right that should belong to every American, the right to be free from discrimination at work because of personal characteristics unrelated to successful performance on the job. 
   We took a fresh look at ENDA and we have made a number of constructive changes this year. We have re-written the discrimination section to more closely track Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This new language has the benefit of 35 years of legal interpretation. Employers and courts alike understand this language and what is expected under it. 
   One concern that we have heard repeatedly during past debates is that this language will create a tidal wave of litigation. In Vermont, one of 11 states to have enacted a sexual-orientation anti-discrimination law, the legal waters have been more like the Tidal Basin. In the 9 years since the enactment of Vermont's law, Vermont's Attorney General has initiated only 25 investigations of alleged sexual orientation discrimination. 
   Vermont is not unique. According to the GAO, none of the states with  ENDA-type laws have experienced a wave of litigation. Instead, these states have ensured that employees working within their borders cannot be discriminated against for being gay. 
   As I have stated before, success at work should be directly related to one's ability to do the job, period. We first introduced ENDA in 1994. Over the past six years, we have held hearings, listened to the concerns raised and revised this legislation to respond to those concerns. I am pleased to report that it was worth the effort because The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999 is the best bill we have ever introduced. The time has come to make the Employment Non-Discrimination Act the law of the land.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an important time for America to listen to this debate because the lives and health of individuals throughout this Nation are at stake. It is interesting to note, looking back to last year when the Democratic proposal came forward, at first they wanted it to be voted on immediately. Then we worked together on this side of the aisle and worked up a bill that we find is superior to theirs in many respects, which I will talk about later, and all of a sudden they didn't want to bring it up without 100 amendments. We could not get a time agreement to get to the bill. Even though some of the things sound quite dramatic and wonderful, when we analyze them, we find that in many respects we believe the majority's bill is superior. 
   First of all, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act addresses those areas of health care quality on which there is a broad consensus. It is solid legislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system for all Americans. 
   The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has been long dedicated to action in order to improve the quality of health care. Our commitment to developing appropriate managed care standards has been demonstrated by the 17 additional hearings related to health care quality. And Senator FRIST's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee held three hearings on the work of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). 
   Each of these hearings helped us in developing the separate pieces of legislation that are reflected in our Patients' Bill of Rights Act. 
   People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get their health care. The Patients' Bill of Rights requires full disclosure by an employer about the health plans it offers to employees. 
   Patients also need to know how adverse decisions by a plan can be appealed, both internally and externally, to an independent medical reviewer. That is a critical difference. We emphasize good health care. Under our bill the reviewer's decision will be binding on the health plan. However, the patient will maintain his or her current rights to go to court. Timely utilization decisions and a defined process for appealing such decisions are the keys to restoring trust in the health care system. 
   Our legislation also provides Americans covered by health insurance with new rights to prevent discrimination based on predictive genetic information. 
   It ensures that medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients and are based on the best scientific evidence. And it provides a stronger emphasis on quality improvement in our health care system with a refocused role for AHCPR. 
   The other bill uses the generally accepted practice in the area which can deviate very strongly from best medicine. We give you best medicine. 
   Some believe that the answer to improving our nation's health care quality is to allow greater access to the tort system. However, you simply cannot sue your way to better health. We believe that patients must get the care they need when they need it, not just after they go to court in a lawsuit to repair the damage. 
   In the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' we make sure each patient is afforded every opportunity to have the right treatment decision made by health care professionals. In the event that does occur, patients have the recourse of pursuing an outside appeal. Prevention, not litigation, is the best medicine. 
   Our bill creates new, enforceable Federal health care standards to cover those 48 million of the 124 million Americans covered by employer-sponsored plans. These are the very same people that the States, through their regulation of private health insurance companies, cannot protect. 
   What are these standards? They include: a prudent layperson standard for emergency care; a mandatory point of service option; direct access to OB/GYNs and pediatricians; continuity of care; a prohibition on gag rules; access to Medication; access to Specialists; and self-pay for behavioral health. 
   It would be inappropriate to set Federal health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments. As the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, put it: ``(w)e do not want States to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions. . . . Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have 
   no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.'' 
   Senator KENNEDY's approach would set health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance departments. Worse yet, it would mandate that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) enforce them if a State decides not to adopt them. 
   Those of us who have been involved with this know what happened during the recent past when the HIPAA bill was passed on to HCFA. It was a mess. Almost nothing was getting done. 
   HCFA cannot even keep up with its current responsibilities. This past recess Senator LEAHY and I held a meeting in Vermont to let New England home health providers meet with HCFA. It was a packed and angry house, with providers traveling from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. 
   It is in no one's best interest to build a dual system of overlapping State and Federal health insurance regulation. 
   Increasing health insurance premiums causes significant losses in coverage. 
   This is the main difference. You can promise a lot of things when you try to do them. But if the result of what you do is that up to 1 million people lose coverage because of the increased cost, that is not the way we ought to go. 
   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) pegged the cost of the Democratic bill at six times higher than S. 326. Based on our best estimates, passage of the Democratic bill would result in a loss of coverage for over 1.5 million working Americans and their families. To put this in perspective, this would mean that would have their family's coverage canceled under the Democratic bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me repeat that. Adoption of the Democratic approach would cancel the insurance policies of almost a million and half Americans. I cannot support legislation that would result in the loss of health insurance coverage for a population the size covered in the combined states of Vermont, Delaware, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 
   Fortunately, we can provide the key protections that consumers want at a minimal cost and without disruption of coverage--if we apply these protections responsibly and where they are needed. 
   In sharp contrast to the Democratic alternative, our bill would actually increase coverage. With the additional of the Tax Code provisions to S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, our bill allows for the full deduction of health insurance for the self-employed, the full availability of medical savings accounts and the carryover of unused benefits from flexible spending accounts. With the new Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act we provide Americans with greater choice to more affordable health insurance.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the GAO report examines two reports done by the Lewin Group on the impact of premium increases on coverage. 
   A 1997 report by Lewin indicates that a 1% increase will result in 400,000 losing coverage. 
   A 1998 report by Lewin for the AFL/CIO indicates that a 1% increase will result in 300,000 Americans losing coverage. It is this lower number that I used.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. 
   Mr. President, I am introducing today, with Senators HATCH and GORTON, the Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999. 
   The Congress passed landmark legislation in 1997, the Balanced Budget Act. The BBA has played an important role in ensuring the integrity of the Medicare program, but our good intentions to rein in costs went too far, too fast in some areas. In fact, I fear that our zeal may result in decreased access to care and lower quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries if we do not act to soften the impact of BBA implementation on health care providers. 
   I am particularly concerned about the consequences of payment cuts under BBA for Vermont's hospitals and health systems. Norman Wright, President of the Vermont Hospital and Health Systems Association, has said, ``It is clear that the outpatient prospective payment system being implemented from Washington poses a real threat to the continuation of quality services being provided by Vermont hospital outpatient departments.'' 
   Through the Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999, we are seeking to address concerns about outpatient reimbursement cuts for hospitals. The BBA requires the implementation of a prospective payment system (PPS) for the reimbursement of Medicare hospital outpatient department services to control rising costs in that area, as the provision of care has shifted from inpatient to less costly outpatient services. Our proposed legislation would amend BBA '97 by temporarily limiting the reduction in payments under the new outpatient PPS for outpatient department services to give hospitals a period to adjust to the reimbursement cuts. 
   Medicare outpatient margins, already negative in 1999, are estimated to drop to a negative 28.8 percent if costs increase at a historical rate of growth, and to a negative 20.3 percent if costs increase more slowly. The Health Care Financing Administration's analysis of its proposed rule on the implementation of outpatient PPS found that average reductions in outpatient department services reimbursement for all  hospitals would be 4 percent, but that the reimbursement to low-volume hospitals would decline by an average of 17 percent. For example, Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington, Vermont, is estimated to experience a 16 percent decline in payment. The Chief Executive Officer of Mt. Ascutney Hospital in Ascutney, Vermont, stated, ``The new outpatient prospective payment methodology would cut our reimbursement to the point that our operating margin would be in jeopardy. This coming on the heels of other cuts has an additive negative effect.'' 
   If vulnerable rural hospitals are not provided a gradual transition period to reorganize operations, such a large decline in reimbursement could spell financial disaster. Teaching hospitals are also projected to sustain a greater than average loss under the new methodology. I am concerned that financial cutbacks of this magnitude could impact the access to care and the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries by hospitals that are already ailing under payment cuts for Medicare inpatient services and from managed organization payment cuts. 
   The ``Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999'' would limit a hospital's losses for covered outpatient department services furnished prior to and during the first full calendar year of outpatient PPS implementation to 5 percent, so that a hospital would receive no less than 95 percent of what the hospital would have been paid under the current reimbursement mechanism. In the second year, the maximum payment loss would be 10 percent, and in the third year, 15 percent. There would be no limit after the third year. 
   The BBA went too far, too fast in cutting costs, and now it's time to find the right balance by swinging the pendulum back toward quality. The Hospital Outpatient Preservation Act of 1999 would address one area of concern by providing a phased implementation period of three years to allow hospitals, particularly the hardest hit rural and major teaching hospitals, time to adjust to the cuts in reimbursement. Through such legislation, we can maintain the financial integrity of the Medicare program, while guaranteeing access to high-quality health care services for Medicare beneficiaries.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the time has come. Our friends with disabilities have waited patiently. Our bipartisan coalition has remained united. The last obstacles have been resolved. Assurances have been given. I am referring to yesterday's passage of the landmark legislation, S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   When I came to Congress in January 1975, one of my legislative priorities was to provide access to the American dream for individuals with disabilities. It was not an easy task. I learned quickly that providing access for Americans with disabilities was complicated. 
   It involved providing access to education, it involved removing physical barriers, and it involved ensuring access to rehabilitation, job training, and job placement assistance. It required obtaining access to assistive technology and health care. Most importantly, access to the American dream for people with disabilities meant gaining the opportunity to choose and to participate in the full range of community activities. Moreover, it involved making sure that the federal government, along with other entities, be made to comply with laws affecting access for people with disabilities. We have made tremendous progress in the last 24 years. 
   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Assistive Technology Act have changed, and will continue to change lives. Children with disabilities are being educated with their peers. No agency or individual, including the Federal Government, can discriminate against individuals on the basis of disability in employment, transportation, public accommodations, public services, or telecommunications. Job training and placement opportunities for individuals with disabilities are ever expanding because of the reforms we achieved in the Work Force Investment Act of 1998. I am proud of these accomplishments. 
   I began work on the Work Incentives Improvement Act more than 2 years ago. Since then, I have learned a great deal. I suspect the same holds true for the 79 other co-sponsors of this bill. S. 331 addresses a fundamental flaw in federal policy. Individuals with disabilities must choose between working or having health care. This is an absurd choice. Yet, current federal law forces individuals with disabilities to make this choice. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if they are given access to health care. S. 331 does just that--it gives workers with disabilities access to appropriate health care--health care that is not readily available or affordable from the private sector. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if they are given access to job training and job  placement assistance. S. 331 does just that--it gives individuals with disabilities training and help in securing a job. 
   Over the past several months, we have all received letters in support of S. 331. I would like to share one such story with you. Don is a 30 year-old man, who has mild mental retardation, cerebral palsy, a seizure disorder, and a visual impairment. Don works, but only part-time. 
   At the end of his letter, Don wrote:  
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help my friends become independent too. Then they can pay taxes too. But most of all, they will have a life in the community. We are adults. We want to work. We don't need a hand out, we need a hand up.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the gradual but accelerating loss of soil fertility and productive agricultural land worldwide may not be headline-grabbing news. But it is the kind of threat that, if not addressed, will exacerbate global problems of hunger, poverty, migration and conflict over local scarce land and water resources in the 21st century. 
   The process of soil erosion and severe land degradation, often referred to as ``desertification,'' results from over-cultivation, deforestation, improper irrigation and drought. Most Americans are aware of the phenomenon from our own ``dust bowl'' in the 1930's when hundreds of thousands of farmers were forced to abandon their exhausted land. Today, dust bowls are occurring in more than 90 countries with an alarming annual loss of 10 million acres of productive agricultural land worldwide. Because of our own successful soil and water conservation programs, U.S. businesses, universities and non-governmental organizations have a crucial role to play in providing technical expertise and support to communities around the world that are fighting land degradation. 
   Today is World Day to Combat Desertification, which marks the fifth anniversary of a coordinated international initiative to address the land degradation problem. In recognition of this observance, I would like to share a recent Christian Science Monitor op-ed piece on the seriousness of land degradation in Africa written by His Excellency Mamadou Mansour Seck, Senegal's Ambassador to the United States.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I said yesterday, ``The time has come.'' And, now finally it has. I said yesterday, ``Our friends with disabilities have waited patiently.'' I say today, They are more than patient. They are saints with tolerance for congressional schedules. Everyone here--everyone in the White House, everyone in the other body, and because of e-mail, everyone in the country--knows I am referring to our pending consideration of landmark legislation, S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   When I came to Congress in January 1975, one of my legislative priorities was providing access to the American dream for people with disabilities. 
   Well, today, after 3 long years, endless hours of discussion and drafting, and redrafting, we are about to remove the biggest remaining barrier to the American dream for individuals with disabilities--access to health care if they work. What we are about to do was long in coming. It is so important. 
   During the process that got us to this point, I have learned a great deal. I suspect the same holds true for the 77 other cosponsors of this bill. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if given access to health care. This bill does just that--it gives workers with disabilities access to appropriate health care--health care that is not readily available or affordable from the private sector. 
   People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if given access to job training and job placement assistance. This bill does just that--it gives individuals with disabilities training and help securing a job. 
   The work Incentives Improvement Act empowers people with disabilities to control the quality of their lives, to pay State and Federal taxes, to return the investment that society has made in them, and most of all, the bill empowers them so they can go to work. 
   I thank my bipartisan original cosponsors Senators KENNEDY, ROTH, and MOYNIHAN who, with me, created a sound piece of legislation to address this real problem for millions of Americans with disabilities. Their commitment represents the best of what the Senate can accomplish when sound policy is placed above partisanship and beyond who gets credit. 
   I also thank the additional, original 35 cosponsors of this bill and the subsequent 42 cosponsors who represent a total of over three quarters of this body, perhaps a Senate record on health care legislation. 
   Over the last two weeks the majority leader has been the driving force that urged us to work out policy differences that were delaying floor consideration. We did so through good faith efforts that broadened support for the bill and reduced its overall modest cost. 
   In particular, I want to recognize Senators NICKLES, BUNNING and GRAMM for their willingness to reach consensus with us on policy without compromising the integrity of the legislation, thus, allowing S. 331 to move forward. 
   I especially give a heartfelt thanks to people with disabilities who worked with us, trusted us to do the right thing. With their support, encouragement, and energy we have done the right thing. 
   Yesterday the President asked us to give him a bill by July 4th, or at least July 26th, the 9th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act. We can. We should, with 100 votes. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   I thank the disability community. I have never seen such an effort as that provided by those in the disability community of this country to make sure we did not forget our role and our goal. 
   I also thank Pat Morrisey of my staff who has been an incredible workhorse on this matter. She has done a tremendous job in keeping me on the right track. 
   This is the final great step in assuring that the disabled community of our country has reached the goal from which they have been precluded by the mobility to get health care--to be fully reentered into life.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand. I just wanted to make it clear. But what I do want to have everyone understand is that this modification of the amendment is by taking one word out in order to meet a requirement of the budget. The budget requirement may or may not be valid, but once you get it, there is not much you can do about it. The whole disagreement here is with respect to the one word ``unnecessary,'' which we want to delete, because by using that word we inadvertently created a budget point of order. Because as far as the Budget Committee is concerned, there is never any unnecessary use of the airplane, or travel by the Department of Energy, even though they spent some $250 million traveling where and why and who I do not know, which was more than enough, with a reasonable cut in the use of their airplanes, to fund a very important amendment dealing with more emphasis on renewable resources. 
   I would like to, certainly for a question, yield to the Senator from North Dakota.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I certainly thank my good friend from Delaware who has been out front on this issue for many years. I appreciate his efforts in this area. 
   The amendment that Senator ROTH and I desire to offer today is about priorities. I think we all agree that increased domestic energy production should be a priority. We agree that a lower balance of payments should be a priority. We agree that helping farmers, ranchers and rural communities is a priority. We agree that standing up for U.S. companies selling U.S. manufacturing energy technologies in overseas markets is a priority. We cheer the increased job markets in every State in this Nation. We support the small companies across the Nation that are working to capture the booming global energy market, and we would make it a priority to promote clean air. The bill does not do that in its present form. 
   The bill before us further whittles away our Nation's efforts to wean itself from foreign oil. It erodes our efforts to develop technology that increases domestic energy production. It ends commitments made to small energy companies that depend on Federal assistance to enter the giant global energy market. It reduces our efforts to make major advancements in energy development. It reduces our commitment to energy that is affordable, that is clean, and, most importantly, that is made in America. 
   The administration requested a 16-percent increase in renewable funding--from $384 million to $446 million. More than half of the Senate--54 Senators--signed a letter in support of this $62 million increase. The committee did not request an increase in the renewable budget. It did not even hold at a renewable budget level. The committee cut the budget by $13 million. There is a $92 million shortfall between the committee mark and the amount requested by more than one-half of the Senate. 
   A vote for this amendment is a vote for five things, if we are allowed to present it. 
   It is a vote for national security. 
   It is a vote for small businesses across the United States that produce clean, renewable energy. 
   It is a vote for farmers and ranchers in rural communities across America. 
   It is a vote to help American business grab onto a chunk of that rapidly growing export market for renewable products. 
   And a vote for this amendment is a vote for cleaner air for our children. 
   I am going to address each of these reasons why my colleagues should support this bill in turn. 
   First of all, we have charts that allow you to understand better what we are discussing. 
   This is a vote about national security. It is about making our Nation's future secure by securing our energy future.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, no crisis can stop the sun from shining, the wind from blowing, or the Earth from producing geothermal heat. 
   Let's review some alternatives we have and how they can be utilized. Geysers Geothermal Power Plant in California is an example of the sort of energy savings we can gain through ``made in America'' geothermal energy. 
   American soil holds a natural resource available throughout much of this country: Geysers produce the energy equivalent of over 250 million barrels of oil and currently provide electricity for over 1 million people. Geysers Geothermal Power Plant in California is an example. 
   The next chart shows renewable generation by each State, indicating how much renewable energy is produced in every State in the United States. I think all Senators ought to take that into consideration. We are hurting small businesses located in every State in the United States. Every Senator in the United States is a stakeholder in this debate. These States have a substantial energy generation capacity. Much is not utilized, and much more is available. It is very extensive, according to the chart. 
   The next chart shows the top 20 States for wind energy. There is a lot of wind around this place especially, but also around the rest of the country. This chart shows the top 20 States for wind energy potential. Although most of the wind potential generated today has occurred in California, many States have much greater wind potential. The top 20 States for wind energy potential are: North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Illinois, California, Wisconsin, Maine, and Missouri. The American Midwest is the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. North Dakota alone can produce 36 percent of all U.S. electric power needs. New Mexico could produce 10 percent of U.S. electric power needs. The oil wells in Saudi Arabia will eventually run dry. The wind in North Dakota will supply indefinitely a steady source of power. 
   Next is a map of localities with geothermal energy. Like the sun shining on American soil and the wind blowing over it, geothermal energy is a great American resource. It is good for the environment, good for the country, and good for business. This chart shows bountiful geothermal energy supplies, especially on the west coast. 
   I have a series of pictures of renewable energy projects across the country. They demonstrate that a vote for renewable energy is a vote for ranchers, farmers, and small communities all across America. 
   This chart shows the North State Power Wind Farm in Minnesota. The  wind facility has pumped over $125 million into the local economy and provides an extra source of income for local farmers in Lake Benton, MN. 
   Farmers make money through royalty payments for the wind turbines on their lands. They continue to farm their lands and make additional money for the wind that blows above it. This shows municipal utility wind turbines in Traverse City, MI. Note the corn growing. This wind turbine provides clean, renewable, locally produced wind energy for the people of Traverse City, MI. 
   The next chart shows Culberson Wind Plant in Texas. This wind facility is the largest energy producer in Culberson County. It provides $400,000 annually in tax revenues to Culberson County hospitals and schools. That is 10 percent of the county's property tax base. It also provides $100,000 to the Texas public school fund. 
   It is not just wind energy that is helpful in small communities. Photovoltaic helps ranchers and farmers. This is a cattle rancher with a photovoltaic-powered well in Idaho. This Idaho rancher powers his home and pumps well water for his cattle under a photovoltaic program offered by Idaho Power Company. 
   This chart shows Kotzebue Electric Association Village Power Project in Kotzebue, AK. The projects will reduce emissions from diesel plants and reduce fuel transport and costs to the villagers. 
   Next is Ontario Hydro Village Power Project. There is a large market for export of U.S. wind turbines to northern communities in Alaska, Canada, and Russia. This turbine was built in Vermont and exported to Ontario, Canada. In the last 10 years, photovoltaic sales have more than quadrupled. In developing countries, demand has increased because it is attractive to isolated communities that are distant from the power plant and because they have small electric requirements. 
   Although America is still a leader in developing renewable energy technologies, this lead may slip if we lower our renewable research and development funding. Europe and Japan continue to subsidize their renewable industry, putting U.S.-based companies at a severe disadvantage. 
   For example, Japan, Germany, and Denmark use tied aid, offer financing, and provide export promotion for their domestic industries, and our industries have to compete with that. It is very difficult to do. But because of its success and the fact that we have advantages, they have been able to survive, with great difficulty, without having that assistance from loans. This is not the time to lose our lead or to cut funding out of this important industry. 
   There is one final reason why my colleagues should overwhelmingly support this amendment. A vote on this amendment is also a vote for the environment. 
   Consider this chart showing children playing in front of a windmill in Iowa's Spirit Lake district. The wind turbine generates power for the school. It is emission free, completely natural. Few us of us want to have our children play under smokestacks or near oil fields or uranium enrichment plants. Few of us want our children to fight wars in the Middle East over oil. But we are all happy to have our children playing in the wind and the sun. 
   Next is a geothermal powerplant in Dixie Valley, NV. This plant, which produces electricity for 100,000 people, produces no emissions and 1 to 5 percent as much SO  
   X and CO 
   2 as a coal-fired plant of the same size.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will continue with my presentation of the merits of this amendment. I have no intention of holding up this body any longer than necessary; necessary meaning this preemptive strike is designed to make us accomplish our goals. 
   The next chart is the Westinghouse power connection's biomass gasification facility in Hawaii. This demonstrates the potential to convert agricultural waste--sugarcane in this case --into electricity. 
   I have another chart to demonstrate the power of all of these generating plants. This one is at BC International Corporation, biomass ethanol plant in Jennings, LA. This plant will be retrofitted to produce ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and rice waste. 
   That completes my charts. I hope my colleagues have been impressed with what we could have done if we were not prohibited. 
   Let me conclude by reminding everyone we are proposing to add $70 million through our amendment to the Department of Energy's solar, wind, and renewable budget. Federal support for renewable energy research and development has been a major success story in the United States. Costs have declined, reliability has improved, and a growing domestic industry has been born. More work still needs to be done in applied research and development to bring down the cost of the production even further. 
   This is a tremendous opportunity for this Nation which will help us reduce our trade deficits. The need for renewable R&D is not a partisan issue:  
   We must encourage environmentally responsible development of all U.S. energy resources, including renewable energy. Renewable energy does reduce demand upon our other finite natural resources. It enhances our energy security, and clearly, it protects the environment.  
   This was President Bush, September 1991.

It is only appropriate that this body have the right to exercise their will on a vote which will 
   let them modify this bill in a manner which they think will make it more appropriate. 
   I urge all Members, especially the 50 cosponsors, to join with me on appealing the ruling of the Chair to allow this amendment to be placed upon the bill. It is only appropriate considering that the only problem we had was the one word ``unnecessary'' which made it subject to a point of order because the CBO ruled that the word ``unnecessary'' would prevent the funding and, therefore, would not be appropriate. 
   I believe very strongly we ought to have an opportunity for the majority of this Senate to express their will on this bill. Therefore, I am appealing the ruling of the Chair.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased that this weekend I will be helping to celebrate the eightieth anniversary of Vermont's farmer owned Cabot Creamery Cooperative. 
   The Cabot Creamery Cooperative was founded in 1919 by 94 farmers, who came together with a vision of a better way to operate a dairy. The original farmers each pledged $5 per cow and a cord of firewood to fire the boiler. The total investment was $3,700. Today, over 1,600 farm families from all of the New England States and upstate New York belong to the cooperative. The creamery and the Cabot brand name are internationally known, having been named ``World's Best Cheddar'' in 1997 and ``Best Cheddar in the USA'' in 1998. Their outstanding products can be found in stores across the country. 
   The cooperative is a shining example of farmers working together for a common good. Together they control their own financial destiny by owning a brand name, the facilities to produce a high quality product and a cooperative to supply the needed milk. Their way of doing business continues to secure a sound future for their family farms and the unique rural way of life of their communities. Just as the original 94 farmers were visionary in the early part of the century, 80 years later their cooperative has taken the leading role in working for the Northeast Dairy Compact, ensuring a bright future for the dairy industry in the Northeast. 
   During its history, the profits, size and scope of Cabot Creamery Cooperative may have grown, but its small town values and sense of community have continued to dictate the way it does business. These values have kept the original purpose and intent of the cooperative intact over the years and have allowed it to remain a locally owned creamery. 
   For all of these reasons, I couldn't think of a more appropriate way to celebrate Cabot's eightieth anniversary than through the upcoming ``Cabot Creamery Heritage Festival,'' in conjunction with the Vermont Heritage Weekend. I am delighted that the Vermont Historical Society, along with thirty-six community historical societies, will be helping Cabot celebrate by showcasing Vermont's community treasures. These communities will provide examples of the best of Vermont's history, traditions and scenery, ranging from granite artisans, Morgan horses, agricultural exhibits, small town museums, covered bridges, and the beautiful Green Mountains. 
   I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Cabot Creamery Cooperative on its eightieth anniversary and commend it for its positive influence on the past, present, and future of Vermont.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the time has come. Our friends with disabilities have waited patiently. Our bipartisan coalition has remained united. The last obstacles have been resolved. Assurances have been given. I am referring to our pending consideration of the landmark legislation, S.331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   When I came to Congress in January 1975, one of my legislative priorities was to provide access to the American dream for individuals with disabilities. It was not an easy task. I learned quickly that providing access for Americans with disabilities was complicated. 
   It involved providing access to education, it involved removing physical barriers, and it involved ensuring access to rehabilitation, job training, and job placement assistance. 
   It required obtaining access to assistive technology and health care. Most importantly, access to the American dream for people with disabilities meant gaining the opportunity to choose and to participate in the full range of community activities. Moreover, it involved making sure that the Federal Government, along with other entities, be made to comply with laws affecting access for people with disabilities. We have made tremendous progress in the last 24 years.  
   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Assistive Technology Act have changed, and will continue to change lives. Children with disabilities are being educated with their peers. No agency or individual, including the Federal Government, can discriminate against individuals on the basis of disability in employment, transportation, public accommodations, public services, or telecommunications. 
   Job training and placement opportunities for individuals with disabilities are ever expanding because of the reforms we achieved in the Work Force Investment Act of 1998 and because of low unemployment rates. I am proud of these accomplishments. 
   Today we will address the biggest remaining barrier to the American dream for individuals with disabilities--access to health care if they work. 
   I began work on the Work Incentives Improvement Act more than 2 years ago. Since then, I have learned a great deal. I suspect the same holds true for the 77 other co-sponsors of this bill. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if they are given access to health care. This bill does just that--it gives workers with disabilities access to appropriate health care--health care that is not readily available or affordable from the private sector. 
   People with disabilities want to work, and will work, given access to job training and job placement assistance. This bill does just that--it gives individuals with disabilities training and help securing a job. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act gives people with disabilities the power to control their own destiny, the power to pay taxes and return the investment that society has made in them, and most of all the power to go to work. 
   First, I must thank my bipartisan co-sponsors Senators KENNEDY, ROTH, and MOYNIHAN the original co-sponsors of this bill who made a commitment many months ago to work together to create a sound piece of legislation to address this real problem for millions of Americans with disabilities. Such commitment represents the best of what the Senate can accomplish when sound policy is placed above partisanship. 
   I also thank the additional, original 35 co-sponsors of this bill and the subsequent 45 co-sponsors who represent a total of over three quarters of this body, perhaps a Senate record on health care legislation. 
   Over the last two weeks, the Majority Leader has been the driving force who urged us to work out policy differences that were delaying Floor consideration. We did so through good faith efforts that broadened support for the bill and reduced its overall modest cost. 
   In particular, I want to recognize Senators NICKLES, BUNNING, and GRAMM for their willingness to reach consensus with us on policy without compromising the integrity of the legislation, thus, allowing S. 331 to move forward. 
   I especially thank the over two hundred national organizations that offered time, energy, and ideas to create and support a bill that will improve the quality of life for millions of Americans with disabilities who want to work. 
   One at a time, we each have come to understand the importance of health care and a job to individuals with disabilities. Sometimes the power of common sense and the voices of reason transcend politics and help us to forge new policy that will make America a better place for all of its citizens. The Work Incentives Improvement Act is the right policy at the right time, and we all know it.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 250th anniversary of the Town of Bennington, Vermont. On behalf of all Vermonters, I want to wish this historical town a very happy anniversary. 
   In 1749, the Governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth, chartered the first town in the territory that would eventually become the State of Vermont. In 1761, the town was named Bennington in his honor. With its access to the Walloomsac River as a power source, the new town quickly built up industries such as paper mills, pottery, grist mills, and the largest cotton batting mill in the United States. It became an important gateway to the region. 
   During the Revolutionary War, Bennington gained great notoriety with the Battle of Bennington. As the British General, John Burgoyne, marched his troops south from Canada with the plans to capture Albany, they stopped in Vermont intending to forage for supplies. However, they underestimated the strength of their enemy. On August 16, 1777, John Stark, leading a militia of 1500 men, including the Green Mountain Boys, attacked. After two days of fighting, the militia defeated the British with the first decisive victory for the Americans. This critical battle is seen as the turning point in the war because it greatly weakened the British forces, revitalized languishing spirit of the revolutionaries, and ensured another victory at Saratoga. Bennington was also the base of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys who led the taking of Fort Ticondaroga. To celebrate Bennington's vital role in the American Revolution, I've enjoyed marching in many Bennington Battle Day parades. 
   The Town of Bennington holds a special place in the Vermont history books. On Bennington's village green stands the meeting house where legislators in 1791 voted for the Independent Republic of Vermont to become the 14th state. 
   In addition to the town's historical significance, Bennington has a rich cultural heritage. The buildings found in Old Bennington form one the greatest concentrations of early Federal and Georgian architecture in the state. In North Bennington is the Park-McCullough House, built in 1865, which served as home to two Vermont governors. The Bennington Museum houses a collection of paintings by the celebrated folk artist, Grandma Moses, known for her depictions of rural life and the countryside. 
   Today, Bennington offers much to both its residents and to visiting tourists. 
   Continuing a long tradition of artistic appreciation, the new Arts Center helps promote a variety of exhibits, threatre productions, literary readings, artists' work space, and dance and musical performances. Bennington also boasts two private colleges: Bennington College, a small liberal arts school with a strong performing arts program; and Southern Vermont College, a small college that prides itself on providing resources to and giving back to the Bennington community. 
   But the heart of this small town has always been its indomitable people and its close-knit community. It is a community dedicated to improving the lives of all its citizens. This dedication can be seen in several innovative Bennington educational programs, in the town's collaborative approach to helping children and families, and in the significant progress made toward meeting the community's needs for affordable housing. 
   It gives me great pleasure to recognize the Town of Bennington's 250th anniversary, its significant role in both the history of our country and of the State of Vermont, and its strong, diverse citizens.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. For the information of all Senators, tomorrow the Senate will convene at 10 a.m. and, by previous consent, begin 15 minutes of debate on S. 1205, the military construction appropriations bill. Immediately following that debate, the Senate will begin 20 minutes of debate on S. 331, the work incentives legislation. Upon completion of debate on these two bills, the Senate will begin a series of stacked votes. Therefore, Senators can expect the first of two votes to start at approximately 10:40 a.m. on Wednesday. 
   Also by previous consent, following the series of stacked votes, the Senate will debate the motion to invoke cloture on the House lockbox legislation for 1 hour, with that cloture vote to begin after all time has expired or been yielded back. 
   Assuming cloture is not invoked, the Senate will turn to H.R. 1664 regarding steel, oil, and gas appropriations, with amendments in order. It is also hoped that the Senate will be able to complete action on the energy and water appropriations bill during the morning session of the Senate.

   Elliot and I came from similar backgrounds: he lived in my home town of Shrewsbury, Vermont, where we both served on the volunteer fire department; we received our BA's at Yale; and we both served our country in the Navy. 
   The list of contributions Elliott made to the International, National, and local arenas is impressive not only for its length, but also for its variety. This tribute can only touch on a few of them, but I hope the highlights will give the Senate an impression of how great a man we have lost. He began his career writing for the United Nations World Magazine. In 1954, Elliott co-founded the Business International Corporation in New York. Its purpose was to provide information and to help those who worked in the worldwide economic market. In addition to being the co-founder, he also served as the Director, Managing Editor, Editor-in-Chief, and as Chairman of the Board. 
   In 1959, Elliott joined a group of executives called the ``Alliance for Progress,'' who advised then President-Elect Kennedy on US business policy towards Latin America. He then served as the President of the Council for the International Progress of Management and as the Chairman of the Board of the International Management Development Institute, a non-profit organization devoted to managerial training in Africa and Latin American. 
   Elliott was also the manager of numerous International business round tables held throughout the years. While all of these activities would be enough work for two people, Elliott found time to create the US branch of the AIESEC-US, an International organization which gave university students the opportunity to train in businesses throughout the world. Later on in his life, he served as their International Chairman and was inducted into their Hall of Fame. Throughout all of this, he served as an advisor and occasional lecturer for various business schools, including Indiana University, Pace University, and Harvard Business School. 
   Elliott Haynes was also very active in the State of Vermont. He was a member the Rutland Rotary, served on the Board of Directors of the Visiting Nurses Association and was Chair of the Board of the Vermont Independence Fund, which provided seed money to organizations which helped the elderly and disabled lead more active and independent lives. 
   And while Elliott's list of business accomplishments is phenomenal, it was his ability to turn a personal tragedy into an inspiration for others that is his greatest legacy. In 1994 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, and from that moment on, he devoted his life to improving the lives of others with the disease. In 1997, Elliott founded the Rutland Regional Parkinson's Support Group in 1997. He brought the needs and concerns of those with Parkinson's Disease to the attention of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which I chair. Elliott was essential in getting legislation passed which provides federal money for research into this crippling disease. I am so proud to have worked with him on this landmark legislation and I only wish he could have lived to see the fruits of his labor. 
   Elliott Haynes was a wonderful and influential man who's life touched thousands of people in direct and indirect ways. He will be remembered as a man who gave wholly of himself and who was willing to go the extra mile for his friend and neighbor, regardless of whether it was a neighbor in Shrewsbury or a ``neighbor'' halfway around the world. Elliott Haynes will be deeply missed.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize the Vermont Council on the Humanities on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. 
   In 1965, Congress created the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) with the goal of promoting and supporting research, education, and public programs in the humanities. The mission of the NEH was to make the worlds of history, language, literature and philosophy a part of the lives of more Americans. Over the past three decades, the NEH has lived up to its founding mission and has made the humanities more accessible. As Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over the agency, I have been extraordinarily proud to support NEH during my years in Congress. 
   NEH brings the humanities to our lives in many unique and exciting ways. NEH makes grants for preserving historic resources like books, presidential papers, and newspapers. It provides support for interpretive exhibitions, television and radio programs. The agency facilitates basic research and scholarship in the humanities. And NEH strengthens teacher education in the humanities through its summer institutes and seminars. Yet, in my view, one of the most important ways that NEH broadens our understanding of the humanities is through the support it provides for state humanities councils. These state humanities councils, at the grassroots level, encourage participation in locally initiated humanities projects. Every state has one, but few are as innovative, creative and self-sufficient as the Vermont Council on the Humanities. 
   Early on, the Vermont Council on the Humanities determined that the first step in engaging Vermonters in the humanities was to ensure that all Vermonters were able to read. The Vermont Humanities Council met this challenge head on and provided support for reading programs and book discussions targeted at people of all levels of literacy--from the Connections programs which serve adult new readers to the scholar-led discussions held in public libraries. In 1996, the Council initiated the Creating Communities of Readers program. Five Vermont communities received grants to help them achieve full literacy for their communities. This undertaking of ``creating a state in which every individual reads, participates in public affairs and continues to learn throughout life,'' involves an enormous commitment. Yet, undaunted by the enormity of the challenge, the Vermont Humanities Council stepped to the plate and hit a home run. 
   Vermont has taken quite literally the mission of bringing the humanities to everyone and, in doing so, the Vermont Council has distinguished itself as a national leader in promoting reading as a path towards participation in the humanities. Recently, the Vermont Council received a national award of $250,000 from the NEH to implement humanities based book discussions for adult new readers nationwide. Through this national Connections program, 14,000 children's books will become part of the home libraries of adults who are learning to read. 
   There is much we can gain from studying the humanities. The small amount of money that the federal government spends on NEH goes a long way toward building a national community. Coming together to learn from literature, learn from our past, and learn from each other is, in my view, an extraordinarily valuable use of our public dollars. 
   Twenty-five years ago, the Vermont Humanities Council chose the road less traveled, and that has made all the difference in Vermont and in the nation. The Council, with its focus on literacy, chose to experiment by developing new and different ways of bringing the humanities to all Vermonters. By choosing to move to the beat of its own drum, the Vermont Humanities Council has become a unique and independent actor promoting the importance of literacy as a means of pursuing the humanities. 
   In honor of this twenty-fifth anniversary, I offer my sincere congratulations to the Vermont Council on the Humanities for a job well done. I would also like to offer a special note of gratitude to Victor Swenson and the Council's extraordinary Board of Directors. Victor's leadership and the commitment of the Board has made our Council a shining example of excellence. Keep up the good work.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we all recognize that the bottom line of our national defense is quality of our men and women in uniform. They are the core of our security. They make a commitment to the defense of this nation, and we make a commitment to them that includes access to high quality health care. Women serving overseas are particularly reliant on this commitment, as they often have no alternative access to quality health care. 
   The issue of abortion is a matter of individual conscience. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that the decision whether to have an abortion belonged to the individual, not the government. Yet, for American servicewomen, that right to choose is effectively being taken away from them. They are being denied access, even at no expense to the Government, to a safe medical procedure. In most cases, the service woman does not have access to this procedure anywhere else. 
   American servicewomen have agreed to put their lives on the line to defend this country. But yet we are denying them a basic right that all other women are allowed--one that could easily be granted to them at no expense to the federal government. The Murray-Snowe amendment provides that the woman involved would reimburse the government for the full cost of the procedure. In my mind, this is a basic matter of fairness. I would argue that our military women should not be singled out to be unjustly discriminated. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to table the Murray-Snowe amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the vote we are about to take is about compromise. It is an attempt to try to get a bipartisan bill. It is about finding common ground to resolve an issue vital to the Nation. We should join together and show the American people that it is in a bipartisan manner that the Senate can responsibly deal with the issue of guns. 
   As a Senator who voted for the Brady bill, I understand the importance of background checks. I understand the need to keep firearms from felons. I have long supported the concept of background checks at gun shows. 
   This amendment mandates that every gun transaction at a gun show must include a background check, period. There are no loopholes. This is not a smokescreen. This is strict language, strong language, that will force gun sellers and purchasers to follow responsible actions in trading and selling guns. 
   The system we created with this amendment mandates that people purchase firearms legally and, therefore, go through the background check. It is time to tell gun owners and buyers to be responsible. It is time to show the Nation that we understand their concerns and we are acting. 
   The tragic shooting at Littleton and today in Atlanta further demonstrates the need for both sides to come together and to work on this issue to find a common solution to the escalating level of school violence. 
   The amendment Senator SMITH and I are offering will help ensure that timely background checks are performed on a purchase of firearms at gun shows. The Smith-Jeffords amendment should bring this Senate together with the common goal of any illegal firearm sales. The amendment is a bold, bipartisan step and should be adopted. Now is the time for action. Now is the time for reason to prevail over rhetoric. Now is the time to show our Nation's parents that we can get together and end this senseless violence. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment pertaining to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. I respect my colleagues' intentions. They want to make schools safer. Their amendment would not make schools safer, nor the sidewalks leading to the schools, nor their communities. 
   Their amendment would allow a child with a disability caught with a gun or a firearm, whether he knew what he was doing or not, to be suspended or expelled without educational services. 
   If a child with a disability--if any child for that matter--is suspended or expelled for having a gun or firearm in school and subsequently not provided with educational services and adult supervision--Would schools be safer? Would communities be safer? Given what happened outside of Atlanta today, we must shift the debate. Yesterday, our colleagues from Tennessee, Missouri, and Iowa debated if, and for how long, a child with a disability could be removed from his school if he brought a firearm to school. I think they agreed that under IDEA and under the Frist-Ashcroft amendment a child with a disability could be removed from his school. 
   The crux of the remaining disagreement was services--why a child with a disability who brings a gun to school should get services, while his peer without a disability in the same situation, would not get services. We don't solve anything by kicking any child out of school without educational services. 
   There are two letters of opposition to the Frist-Ashcroft on your desk. One is from the National Association of State Boards of Education and one from the National Parent Teacher Association. They make that simple point very well. 
   Ask yourself this question--If you could prevent a child from committing a violent act for the first time or a second time, by providing appropriate services, what would you do? The answer is obvious. You would provide the services--to make your school safe, to make your community safe, but most importantly, to save the child. 
   In the rare instances when it occurs, IDEA provides schools with the tools to control and prevent gun and firearm use by children with disabilities. IDEA recognizes and promotes school safety. IDEA recognizes and promotes teaching consequences for wrongful behavior. IDEA recognizes and promotes adult supervision of, engagement with, and responsibility for children who break school rules or criminal laws. 
   I would like to review some key facts about IDEA. IDEA permits school officials to immediately suspend a child with a disability with a gun or firearm for 10 days without educational services. During that time, a manifestation determination review must be conducted. First, to determine if the child with a disability understood the impact and consequences of having a gun or firearm. Second, to determine if the child's disability did or did not impair the child's ability to control his behavior. 
   In effect, if the child knew what he was doing, the law allows the child to be disciplined in the same manner as other children caught with guns or firearms. One distinction applies. This child with a disability, perhaps unlike his peers, would continue to receive educational services. However, school  officials have total discretion over the details associated with providing these educational services. 
   If a manifestation determination review establishes that the child did not know what he was doing, the child could still be removed from his classroom and school and placed in an interim alternative educational setting for 45 days. After 45 days, if the child continued to be dangerous, the child's placement in the interim alternative educational setting could be extended with the concurrence of a hearing officer. 
   In the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, in the wake of Atlanta, hearing officers will give substantial deference to claims from school officials that a child with disabilities continues to be dangerous. Concurrence of a hearing officer at 45 day intervals is a reasonable standard and an appropriate check and balance on the continued use of an interim alternative educational setting. 
   There is no forum or procedures for due process in the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. How is a child with a disability to prove his innocence? If expelled without education services for 12 months, what will be the impact on the child's family? What will be the reaction of the child's next teacher? What will be the impact on the child's neighborhood? What will be the impact on this child as an adult? 
   The real driving force behind the Frist-Ashcroft amendment is the obligation to provide services, and not school safety. Local school districts do not want the responsibility for paying for new services. If school districts do not now have interim alternative educational settings that can accommodate children with disabilities, they do not want to spend money to create them. If school districts do not now have home-based programs or alternative school programs, they want additional money to have them. 
   School districts do not see a windfall of new Federal dollars on the horizon. So in the name of school safety, they bless the Frist-Ashcroft amendment. In the name of school safety, school districts say it is acceptable for Federal policy to close the school house door on the back of a child with a disability, whether the child knew why the door slammed shut or not. In the name of school safety, they say it is acceptable for Federal policy to leave open whether any agency gives the child and the child's family help, so that they can recover from a gun or firearm episode that profoundly altered their lives. 
   Helping children and their families in these situations is a community responsibility. Schools are part of communities. They must do their part. Other agencies and organizations must do their part. To abdicate responsibility or shift responsibility is not acceptable. It makes no sense. 
   All parents want their children to be safe in school and out. All parents want their children to have due process when they are accused of wrong doing. All parents want their child's education to continue, even if their child did wrong. 
   Are we going to disregard some of America's most vulnerable children in the name of political expediency, by pretending that the Frist-Ashcroft amendment will make schools and communities safer. 
   In an ideal world, we would find a way to work together to develop or expand, and fund, local agencies and organizations that would work collaboratively to assist families and children in crisis, so that the crisis does not reoccur. 
   In an ideal world, teachers and administrators in America's schools would be thoroughly versed in the referral procedures associated with IDEA; and, if IDEA were fully funded, tragedies with guns and firearms could be prevented. 
   We don't have an ideal world, but we must try to make a positive difference, one day at a time, especially in the lives of children.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I listened very carefully. I think when you get right down to it the basic question is, in the final analysis, should the school have to afford an alternative education situation and pay for it. It is a matter of dollars and cents. It has nothing to do with the safety of the children or anything else. 
   Under the circumstances you are dealing with here, if a child comes in with a gun, if it is somebody without an IEP or whatever, they can be thrown out of school and they can be let back into school. That is entirely the discretion of the school officials. They can say this is an aberration or whatever. 
   If a child with a disability comes in, then you go through the 45 days to assess as to whether or not it was as a result of a disability. If it was not the result of a disability, then the child can be disciplined as any other child. If, on the other hand, it was the result of a disability, then they are required to provide an alternative educational situation. It may or may not cost something. But that child is not in the classroom. So no child goes back into the classroom if they are a threat to the classroom.  
   What it comes down to, and what the school officials object to, as I understand it, is they have to set up a special 45-day program for this child, and pay for it. The reason is not to protect the school or protect the kids; it is to make sure they do not have to provide the funds. You can keep those 45 days going forever. Then that costs money. So this is not a safety question. This is a money question. The school boards are saying they don't want to pay for those 45 days. That is what they are saying.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would just like to sum it up. What we are talking about are the problems we have had from the beginning of time, the problems that children with disabilities have and how we handle them. The reason we created IDEA, the reason it was passed, is that we were not allowing the children with disabilities to get any education. It went to the U.S. Supreme Court. A consensus decision by a number of courts, I should say, was reached, in which they determined that if you are going to provide a free and appropriate education generally to the public, you have to have an appropriate education for children with disabilities. And we funded that. We required that. That is why we are here today. 
   What we are now dealing with is we do not want to provide those services. If a student has a disability and provided a threat to the school, it is perfectly clear, if it is a result of a disability, you have to provide that child with an education as the Constitution requires, because, if it was the result of a disability, he is not really responsible for it, so you have to provide it. That gets expensive. 
   If it was not part of the disability, then the child is just treated as any other child and there is no need for a different or additional IEP, away from the classroom setting; the child gets treated and handled like anyone else.

That is the difference. That means an additional expense. The child who does not have a disability and is thrown out of school has to find another school, has to get a tutor or do something else. We are all talking dollars and cents. We are talking about a cost that is added by virtue of the fact that you must provide special services.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the remarks. 
   I, again, point out, if the child is violent and it is not a manifestation of their disability, they can be treated like anyone else as far as removal from school. If it is a manifestation, then special rules apply. Those special rules may well determine that they not be in the general education classroom. That process may require maybe an aide to be assigned to them. That is the way the law works. 
   Many, many students who have disabilities have special aides assigned to them. We cannot let these kinds of very difficult incidents of violence throw out the whole law. We have to examine exactly how you handle students with disabilities, and situations where the disability results in school violence. In such cases they can be removed from the classroom; they can be removed from the school. 
   But they must to be provided an appropriate education under the law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I agree very strongly with Senator BOXER's goal of increasing the availability of positive, engaging activities for school-aged children and youth during the nonschool hours. This is a very important issue that cannot, and should not, be decided within the context of a floor amendment on the juvenile justice legislation. 
   Even without this year's Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, I would have reservations about this amendment. But we do have the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization in progress, and that is the time when this amendment, or something similar to it, ought to be considered.  
   As the author of the original 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act, I have an enormous interest in any changes to this legislation, much less changes as dramatic as those proposed in this amendment. 
   When Congressman Steve Gunderson and I drafted the 21st Century Learning Centers legislation, our purpose was to promote the broader use of school facilities, equipment, and resources. Our largest investment in education is for buildings and equipment, and in most communities these resources are closed more than they are open. 
   By encouraging schools to share their facilities, equipment, and other resources to meet the broader needs of the community, these centers can expand educational and social service opportunities for everyone in the community. 
   Until 2 years ago, the Clinton administration failed to support the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, even to the point of repeatedly requesting that funds for the program appropriated by Congress be rescinded. 
   Then, last year, the administration, through the competitive grants process, substantially changed the focus and indeed, the very nature, of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. Overnight, this initiative to expand the use of existing facilities became an afterschool program, almost to the exclusion of the multi-purpose community centers which were envisioned when I wrote the legislation. 
   This dramatic change in direction for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program raises questions which must be answered before we can consider such a huge expansion of the program. We will be doing that during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is now being considered in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. We need to address questions such as: Can the legislation still serve the purposes for which it was originally intended, with the current, overwhelming focus on providing afterschool programs? If it is to be an afterschool program, are there changes needed in the legislation to make it more effective? 
   If this program is to serve primarily as an afterschool program, where do community organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, fit in? Public schools currently provide less than one-third of the afterschool care, with other community groups providing most of the care. 
   The current grant program clearly demonstrates that schools are, by and large, failing to coordinate their afterschool services with those of other care providers in the community. And the Boxer amendment does nothing but perpetuate that situation. The amendment by Senator BOXER proposes changes that will eviscerate the act.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to assist in the preservation of the great apes. The bill, the ``Great Ape Conservation Act of 1999'', is modeled after the highly successful African and Asian Elephant Conservation Acts, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. It will authorize up to $5 million per year to fund various projects to aid in the preservation of the endangered great apes. 
   Great ape populations currently face many threats, including habitat loss, population fragmentation, live capture, and hunting for the bushmeat trade. Of all these threats, the danger posed by the increasing bushmeat trade is the most severe. This trade is being facilitated by the construction of inroads to logging areas, which allows once remote forests to be linked directly with urban markets. 
   Chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos, once hunted sustainably, now face population destruction due to increased illegal trade, powerful weapons, and high market prices. This consumption of ape meat not only threatens ape populations, but poses severe health risks to humans. Human contraction of many viruses, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has  been linked to the slaughter and consumption of apes. With the loss of ape populations, comes the loss of critical medical knowledge that can be obtained through simple, noninvasive research on wild populations. Some estimates suggest that several thousand apes are killed every year across West and Central Africa, a level that is unsustainable and means the certain destruction of viable populations in the very near future. 
   If we do not act now, not only will great apes face extinction, but the ecosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legislation that can provide funding to the local farming, education and enforcement projects that can have the greatest positive impact. This small, but critical investment of U.S. taxpayer money, matched with private funds, could secure the future of these extraordinary animals.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his very kind words. I want to express my deep appreciation for his efforts throughout his time here in the Senate to assist those people with difficulties and disabilities. 
   Mr. President, let me pose a question. What would most people do if they had health insurance coverage if they stayed home but not if they worked? Believe it or not, this is exactly the dilemma that many individuals with disabilities face today. They must choose between working or having health care. This is an absurd choice. Current federal law forces individuals with disabilities to make this choice. The Work Incentives Improvement Act, S. 331, bipartisan legislation, with 75 cosponsors, addresses this fundamental flaw. 
   Reaching this day has taken 2 years of hard work. Over 100 national organizations endorse our legislation and many helped us craft a consensus-based bill. 
   Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN of the Finance Committee joined Senator KENNEDY and I as original cosponsors along with 35 of our colleagues. The cooperation and support we received, helped us move this important legislation from introduction on January 28, to a full Finance Committee hearing on February 4th, a Finance Committee markup on March 4,  and filing of the committee report on March 26. 
   It is time for the Senate to complete its work on S. 331. Many of our constituents are watching and waiting for us to make this bill a law. 
   In my state, Vermont, 24,355 Social Security disability beneficiaries are waiting for S. 331 to become law. There are 9.5 million people waiting across the country. Under current law, if these people work and earn over $500 per month, they lose cash payments and health care coverage under Medicaid or Medicare. 
   This is health care coverage that they simply cannot get in the private sector. S. 331 allows them to work and have access to health care coverage. It also provides them choices regarding job training and placement assistance. 
   Do Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities really want to work? The answer is a resounding ``Yes.'' Over the last 10 years, national surveys consistently confirm that people with disabilities of working age want to work, but only about one-third are working. 
   I have heard many compelling stories from individuals with disabilities. Some sit at home waiting for S. 331 to become law, so they can go to work. Others work part-time, careful not to exceed the $500 per month threshold which may trigger a cut-off of their health care. Each of us has received letters in support of S. 331. Let me share one story with you. Don is a 30 year-old man, who has mild mental retardation, cerebral palsy, a seizure disorder, and a visual impairment. Don works, but only part-time. 
   At the end of his letter, Don wrote:  
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help my friends become independent too. Then they can pay taxes too. But most of all they will have a life in the community. We are adults. We want to work. We don't need a hand out ..... we need a hand up.  
   We should give Don and his friends a hand up. Doing so would be good for Don and good for the Nation. The hard facts make a compelling case for S. 331: 
   As I indicated, there are 9.5 million Social Security beneficiaries. Of those who work, very few make more than $500 per month. In fact, of working individuals with disabilities on supplemental security income, only 17 percent make over $500 per month and only 10 percent make over $1,000 per month. Another 29 percent make $65 or less per month. Let's assume that S. 331 becomes law, and just 200 Social Security disability beneficiaries in each State work and forgo cash payments. That would be 10,000 individuals across the country out of 9.5 million disability beneficiaries. The annual savings to the Federal treasury in cash payments for these 10,000 people would be $133,550,000. Clearly, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is targeted, fiscally responsible legislation. 
   It enables individuals with disabilities to enter the workforce for the first time, re-enter the work force, or avoid leaving it in the first place. 
   These individuals would not need to worry about losing their health care if they choose to work a 40-hour week, to put in overtime, or to go for a career advancement. Individuals who need job training or job placement assistance would get it. S. 331 reflects what individuals with disabilities say they need. It was shaped by input across the philosophical spectrum. It was endorsed by the President in his State of the Union Address. S. 331 will give us the opportunity to bring responsible change to Federal policy and to eliminate a perverse dilemma for many Americans with disabilities--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, you don't get health care. S. 331 is a vital link in making the American dream an accessible dream, for Americans with disabilities. In closing, I would like to tell you about a young constituent of mine. Her name is Maria, and she faces many daily challenges as a result of her disability. She recently contacted my office to let me know that she is counting on S. 331. Maria is a junior majoring in Spanish at a college in Vermont. She plans to graduate to become a billingual teacher for children and adults from Central and South America. 
   Maria has her whole life ahead of her. She has dreams and she has contributions to make. Enactment of S. 331 will make Maria's dreams possible. She will be able to pursue a career without fear of losing the health care she needs. Let's enact S. 331 now.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator LEAHY, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator KOHL, and Senator HARKIN as an original cosponsor of the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999. This issue is so important to the health and well being of our nation's school children. 
   The Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 is about good nutrition--and a little about milk. The Vermont and Wisconsin Senators at times have a hard time agreeing on federal milk policy, but we all agree that good nutrition plays an important role in the health and education of our children. 
   As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I recognize the importance of having a proper and nutritionally balanced diet in our school lunch programs. A well nourished child is a child more healthy, energized, focused and able to learn. 
   When school children receive a large amount of their daily caloric intake from sugary soft drinks, they are not receiving the fruits, vegetables, vitamins, minerals, and perhaps most importantly--calcium that they need. 
   Soda and other sugary junk foods squeeze more nutritious foods out of their diet. Since many school children may consume between one-third and one-half of their daily intake at school, it is important that we do not allow them to substitute good nutrition with empty calories. 
   Mr. President, teens, in particular, should be drinking milk instead of soft drinks. Twenty years ago, teens drank twice as much milk as soda. Today, the average teenager drinks twice as much soda as milk. 
   The Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 helps close the empty calorie loophole. Soft drinks, sugar candies, cotton candy and the like are already banned from being sold during lunch. This bill would simply ban the free distribution of these ``competitive foods not approved by the Secretary'' before and during lunch at schools participating in the federal school lunch or breakfast programs. 
   Mr. President, I commend Senator LEAHY for his continued leadership in improving the nutrition of America's school children and will work with him and others to see that this bill becomes law.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. 
   Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that I believe will be beneficial to the continued success of our nation's medical schools and teaching hospitals. The bill will provide for a new tax credit, the ``Medical Innovation Tax Credit,'' which will serve as an incentive for private sector firms to invest in clinical research at these important institutions. 
   Medical schools and teaching hospitals fulfill a unique societal and economic role in the United States today. They are not only the training ground for health care professionals but are also centers for important research and development activities that lead to crucial medical breakthroughs. Because they link together research, medical training and patient care, these institutions are incubators of new life-saving drugs, medical services and surgical techniques.  
   Due to the changing health care marketplace these institutions have come under increasing cost pressures that threaten their future. In fact, a recent study by the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) noted an alarming 22 percent decline in clinical research conducted at member hospitals. I believe the medical innovation tax credit would help reverse this disturbing trend, and I am pleased that the AAMC endorses this legislation. 
   The medical innovation tax credit is a targeted, incremental 20 percent credit for qualified medical innovation expenditures on biopharmaceutical research activities, like clinical trials performed at qualified educational institutions. The tax credit would enhance the flow of private-sector funds into medical schools and teaching hospitals by providing an important incentive for companies to perform more clinical trials research at these non-profit institutions. This credit will encourage pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop research partnerships with medical schools and teaching hospitals. The influx of funds from this research will help counteract some of the financial pressures these institutions have been experiencing. To qualify for the credit, research would have to be performed in the United States, so companies will not have an incentive to utilize lower-cost foreign facilities for research activities. 
   It is significantly more expensive for companies to perform clinical trials at teaching hospitals than at commercial research organizations. The medical innovation tax credit will reduce this cost differential. By leveraging additional private-sector support for these institutions in the form of clinical trial research, this new credit will also help these hospitals make the adjustment to the reduction in Medicare payments mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   This legislation is critically important to institutions like Fletcher Allen Health Care in my home state of Vermont. Linked with the University of Vermont's Division of Health Sciences, Fletcher Allen's hospitals combine teaching and research. They are vital training sites for the next generation of physicians, nurses and other health professionals. In Fletcher Allen's nationally known Clinical Research Center, researchers seek to solve the mysteries of cancer, heart attacks, Alzheimer's disease, chronic obesity, cystic fibrosis and other illnesses. The medical innovation tax credit would help Fletcher Allen and hundreds of other institutions across the United States continue in their role as incubators of vital, innovative medical teaching and research technologies. 
   Legislation similar to this was introduced last year; the Joint Committee on taxation estimated that the bill would result in lost revenues of approximately one million dollars per year over the next five years. The bill I am introducing today is substantially similar to the bill introduced last year, although there have been technical changes to the definition of ``qualified academic institution'' to clarify that research expenditures at Veterans' Administration hospitals and certain non-profit research foundations qualify for the credit. As these changes are expected to affect a relatively small number of institutions, I do not expect substantial changes in the cost estimate. I believe this is a small price to pay for the favorable impact this credit will have on research at medical schools and teaching hospitals.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 75th anniversary of the Vermont State Park System. 
   In 1924 Frances Humphreys donated the peak of Mt. Philo and surrounding lands to the State of Vermont as the first State Park. Mt. Philo was the perfect location for the first park; looking east from the summit one views Lake Champlain, North America's most beautiful lake stretching as far as the eye can see to the north and south; looking west one views the Green Mountain range rolling across Vermont to the Connecticut River. There are limitless recreational opportunities within and surrounding our first park. 
   After 75 years, Vermont now has 50 State Parks, from Alburg Dunes on Lake Champlain, to Wilgus on the Connecticut River; from Mount Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak to Quechee, our deepest gorge. 
   Vermont's State Parks are rich in history. Many of the nation's first ski trails were carved out in Vermont State Parks by the Civilian Conservation Corps, creating the New England ski industry. Under the direction Perry Merrill, who oversaw the State Parks for 37 years, more than 40,000 ``CCC Boys'' created a parks infrastructure that is intact, and unparalleled even today. 
   Recognition should also go to the many Vermonters who, over the years, have followed the example of Frances  Humphreys in donating land to become state parks, including one of our newest parks, Sentinel Rock, which was recently donated by Windsor and Florence Wright. 
   Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize 75 years of visionary conservation and recreation development by the State of Vermont, and by those who have conceived and built the State Park System.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our nation's law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 22, a resolution passed earlier this year by the Senate to commemorate and acknowledge the dedication and sacrifice made by these men and women. The resolution declared this Saturday, May 15th, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. 
   Currently, there are more than 700,000 men and women who serve this nation as the guardians of law and order. The duties of a law enforcement officer are both vitally important and extremely dangerous. Officers place themselves between our communities and the criminals who would do us harm. Every year, approximately 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. In 1998, 156 federal, state and local law enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of duty. 
   My home state of Vermont is familiar with the sacrifices made by law enforcement officer. Since 1965, the nine Vermont law enforcement officers listed below have lost their lives in the line of duty. 
   July 9, 1965, Chief Alexander Pontecha, Lyndonville Police Department. 
   December 12, 1972, Chief Dana L. Thompson, Manchester Police Department. 
   January 17, 1978, Deputy Sheriff Bernard J. Demag, Chitternden County Sheriff's Department. 
   April 27, 1978, Game Warden Arnold J. Magoon, Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department. 
   October 1, 1982, Deputy Sheriff George J. Bent, Chittenden County Sheriff's Department. 
   May 13, 1983, Lieutenant Arthur L. Yeaw, Vermont Department of Public Safety. 
   June 14, 1987, Detective Sergeant William J. Chenard, Vermont Department of Public Safety. 
   June 25, 1989, Investigator Eugene N. Gaiotti, Vermont Department of Liquor Control. 
   May 12, 1992, Sergeant Gary Gaboury, Vermont Department of Pubic Safety. 
   It is my hope that the National Peace Officers Memorial Day will remind Vermonters and Americans everywhere of the sacrifices made by law enforcement officers, and of the vital duties they perform every day. Whether by apprehending dangerous felons, assisting stranded motorists on the side of the road, or improving the lives of our young people, law enforcement officers make our towns, cities, states, and Nation safer places to live and work. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those officers, and their families, who have given so much to improve all of our lives.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for allowing me to discuss an important issue that is quickly becoming a serious national problem--American families, elderly and disabled are increasingly unable to afford, or continue to live in, privately-owned housing units. 
   Several recent studies have shown that low-income housing opportunities are on the decline nationwide. In Vermont, rents for housing have increased 11 percent in three years, making it increasingly difficult to find affordable shelter. The need to also expand the number of housing units for low-income families is critical as the vacancy rate in areas such as Burlington has fallen to less than one percent. On any given day there are only 60 available rental units in a city of over 40,000 people, making it simply impossible to find a place to live, much less one that is affordable. Such problems are reflected in increased rates of homelessness, as the number of families seeking help from Burlington's emergency shelter rose from 161 in 1997 to 269 in 1998. Even though additional Section 8 federal subsidies will be available next year, the 800 Vermonters on the Section 8 waiting list would be hard pressed to find somewhere to use this voucher should they receive one. 
   Fewer opportunities for affordable housing are also due to inadequate maintenance. Vermont and the nation desperately need legislation that increases new low-income housing opportunities--whether through new housing construction, rehabilitation of existing housing, additional incentives to keep landlords in the Section 8 market, and expansion of existing tax incentives such as the Private Activity Bond Cap and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am developing legislation that will help preserve existing low-income housing stock, promote the development of new affordable housing, and increase opportunities for the purchase of housing projects by resident councils through a dollar-for-dollar matching grant program. My bill will establish a grant program for states to promote cooperation and partnership among Federal, State and local governments, as well as between the private sector in developing, maintaining, rehabilitating, and operating affordable housing for low-income Americans. These types of initiatives are critical components to meet the growing needs of low-income housing in Vermont and the nation. 
   While the State of Vermont has largely avoided an overwhelming dislocation of tenants from opt-outs and mortgage prepayments, it is unable to accommodate the hundreds of families that seek new federally subsidized housing opportunities in the State. Reform efforts must focus both on preservation of existing federally subsidized housing units, as well as the creation of new opportunities for families seeking an affordable place to live.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Connecticut in introducing the Children of Substance Abusers Reauthorization Act (COSA). Senator DODD is to be saluted for his keen ability to identify conditions that place families and children at risk and for developing innovative solutions and strategies for alleviating those conditions. 
   Substance abuse affects us all. Many of us have a close friend or family member who is a substance abuser or is in recovery. Even those of us not familiar with the personal struggles of substance abuse are affected. My office just received a report from General McCaffrey at the National Drug Control Policy Office that states that drugs play a part in virtually every major social issue in America today, be it health care, crime, mental illness, the dissolution of families, or child abuse. There is no question that Americans want to do ``something'' about substance abuse, but 78 percent of Americans think that the ``War on Drugs'' has failed. So what options for combating substance abuse and addiction should policy makers explore? 
   My state of Vermont has an innovative strategy it is eager to employ. Vermont has done its research and learned that among its school-aged youth a significant portion used illicit drugs; 51% used alcohol, 32% used marijuana, and 5% used cocaine. Twenty-nine percent of Vermont 9th graders (those are 14-15 year-olds!) used marijuana in the past month. About 49% of Vermont students in grades 8 through 12, (almost 19,000 youth) were in need of substance abuse treatment or intervention in 1996. Yet only about 10% of the youth in need of treatment or intervention indicated having received the services. 
   Now the really striking results. Youth in need of alcohol, drug treatment, or intervention services were significantly more likely than those not in need of services to report an array of other school- and health-related problems. Twice as likely to report fighting in the last year; twice as likely to report being threatened or injured with a weapon at school in the past year; two to three times as likely to report having ever had sex; six times more likely to report having ever had sex with four or more people; and three to four times as likely to report having been pressured or forced into having sex. The Vermont report underscored clearly the challenges posed to primary care and substance abuse treatment and intervention providers in Vermont and indicated the wide range of services that are needed to identify and respond to the multiple needs of these kids and their parents. So what options for combating substance abuse and addiction should policy makers explore? 
   We know that prevention is most effective when it is directed at impressionable children. Just as adolescents are the most susceptible to the allure of illicit drugs, so too is it the most imperative to delay or prevent the first use of illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Case studies from the national Centers for Substance Abuse Prevention demonstrate that prevention programs work, especially when the prevention message is reinforced by parents, teachers, clergy, mentors and other role models. The options we policy makers explore must include a comprehensive strategy that provides the constellation of prevention services needed by children of substance abusers and their families. 
   Vermont is ready to implement just such a strategy. Working with the national Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Vermont has confirmed that it's adult based substance abuse treatment models are not age appropriate, they don't work for adolescents, and they need to be redeveloped specifically for youth. Problems with engagement, retention in treatment, and relapse have been chronic in our current system. The CSAT treatment needs assessment determined that almost 40% of youth leave treatment after only one session, or leave against medical advice. Vermont has developed and is ready to implement a strategy but it needs assistance. 
   Vermont would like to build on the demonstrated success of the wraparound models of youth services. Adolescents will receive expanded case management, a broader array of outpatient options, easy access to intensive outpatient care, residential treatment, and encouragement to participate in collateral family treatment. The focus would be on ease of movement between levels of care, case management and integration of community based treatment plans. 
   The bill introduced today can provide States like Vermont much needed assistance in these areas. COSA will provide grants to nonprofit and public entities to provide a constellation of services needed by children and affected families to prevent substance abuse and stop the devastation it causes. Those services can include chid care, remedial education, counseling, therapeutic intervention services, job training. The children of substance abusers and their families is a group that desperately needs help. If we start now, we can begin to bring a close to the endless cycle of inter-generational drug abuse and this measure is the start we need to prevent further substance abuse by the next generation. 
   Mr. President, I would hope that my colleagues will not let this opportunity go unheeded.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Tennessee, Senator FRIST, in introducing the ``Youth Drug and Community-Based Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Act.'' I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation that will reauthorize the very important work conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). I want to commend Senator FRIST for his valuable leadership in this effort. 
   Substance abuse affects us all. Many of us have a close friend or family member who is a substance abuser or living in recovery, and persons with mental illness continue to needlessly face obstacles to their successful treatment that can, and should be eliminated. 
   SAMHSA's role is to improve access to quality mental health and substance abuse services in the nation. It carries out this responsibility to the tremendous advantage of States, local governments, and communities across the nation. This reauthorization bill will improve access and reduce barriers to high quality, effective programs and services for individuals who suffer from, or are at risk for, substance abuse or mental illness, as well as for their families and communities. It strengthens SAMHSA's national leadership in ensuring that knowledge, based on science and state-of-the-art practice, is effectively used for the prevention and treatment of addictive and mental disorders. 
   SAMHSA fosters Federal-State partnerships by supporting State and local community mental health and substance abuse programs. SAMHSA's budget of $2.3 billion is distributed through grants to states, local communities, private organizations, and schools. This reauthorization will increase flexibility for the States and for the Secretary in the provision of these services. This bill will repeal and/or make optional several existing requirements, and instead allows the States to use the grant funds to better serve their particular mental health and substance abuse populations. It dramatically reduces the administrative burden of federal mandates and allows the States greater flexibility to coordinate programs to develop a seamless system of care. 
   This flexibility necessitates a need for increased accountability. This bill improves the way States are held accountable for their use of Federal funds. Under the current system, States are required to spend certain amounts on certain populations and their success is determined on whether they have spent the required amount of  funds. Not on whether they are accomplishing program goals. We will change these programs to focus on performance and results as Congress has done with other programs. 
   I would now like to speak about what I see as the most important provisions of this bill. The first is the Title I provisions relating to services for children and adolescents. It is critical that we focus on treatment for youth. The substance abuse treatment system in this country is focused primarily on adult addicts. A system of care for adolescents is not routinely available. And yet the statistics show that adolescents are more frequently using drugs than they did five years ago. This reauthorization facilitates a system of care that addresses their needs. 
   The events of Littleton, Colorado have made us all keenly aware of the mental health of children in dealing with violence. The provision on Children and Violence in this bill pulls together the abilities of the Departments of Health and Human Resources, Education and Justice to support programs to address children and violence issues at the community levels. Mental health professionals, educators, and law enforcement officials can collaborate so that at-risk youths with disorders can be diagnosed early and moved into the proper treatment setting. 
   School districts will implement the wide range of early childhood development, early intervention and prevention, and mental health treatment services that appear to have the greatest likelihood of preventing violence among children. To ensure the availability of funding for emergencies, the bill establishes an emergency response fund to allow the federal government to support communities which have experienced trauma due to teen violence. To help youth and adolescents cope with violence and emergency crises, the bill establishes grants for developing knowledge with regard to best practices for treating psychiatric disorders resulting from emergency crisis. This is an approach that I understand is supported by both the research and service communities. It makes sense to me and I know that such programs will be helpful in every community in America. 
   I must also point out that this bill includes the formula compromise included in last years's omnibus appropriations bill for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant funds. This is an issue of paramount importance to small and rural states, and I am pleased that this legislation ratifies last year's agreement. 
   Mr. President, this is an important bill that will greatly improve the quality of substance abuse and mental health treatment in this nation. I look forward to considering this bill in the near future in committee, and then I hope it will receive the full attention of the Senate. I would like to once again thank Senator FRIST for putting so much time and effort into crafting legislation that will benefit so many American families.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to participate in honoring our teachers in National Teacher Appreciation Week. 
   I think we all remember those early years of our lives when we started school. I still remember the first day of first grade. I remember going to school in my father's hand and fearing what was going to happen to me. I remember Mrs. Anderson who greeted us all individually at the door and how immediately I warmed up to her. It was then I realized this really wasn't going to be as bad as I thought. I can even remember where my seat was that year. 
   Ms. Maughn, in second grade, was another wonderful person. The teacher I remember more was Viola Burns, my third grade teacher. That was the beginning of World War II. She realized I needed a little further work so she had me read Time magazine and come back to her to talk about it. I also had her in the sixth grade. She was an incredible individual who helped shape my life. 
   Then fourth grade was ``teacher unappreciation year''--I don't want to remember that. We rebelled. We ran through five teachers before we settled down. I wiped that from my memory. I feel sorry for those five teachers. 
   I think everyone has memories and understands what an incredible help a teacher can be in our lives. 
   My mother was a music and art teacher; my sister, a third grade teacher; my niece is a teacher; the man across the street was the principal of our high school. 
   Those schools are gone. My former elementary school is now a private school, a Christian church school; middle school is the fire station; my high school is now the middle school. 
   I still remember the teachers. It is not brick and mortar but the teachers that make a difference. Dindo Rivera goes around the country talking about the changes in education and how important it is. If an office worker had fallen asleep 20 years ago, woke up and walked through a modern office, they would be in incredible despair. They wouldn't know what to do. They wouldn't know how to answer the phone. 
   But he goes on to say that if a teacher had the same experience of falling asleep and waking up now, that teacher would walk into the classroom and find that not much had changed. But the world has changed and our teachers cannot be made the scapegoats. We should not indicate that it is their problem. We, as a nation, have to recognize the teachers need help and we have to give it to them. That means we have to develop professional training. We have to be sure our colleges are producing teachers who are well qualified. At the same time, we have to recognize that our Nation will not prosper if we do not realize it is the teachers who make the difference. We are increasing standards and doing all these things to envelop them with modern technology  which is difficult to understand, especially if you don't have more than 10 minutes in a day to even think about those things. 
   I think it is incredibly important we all remember the teachers, especially this year, since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is up for reauthorization. This is our moment, at a critical time in our history, when we must take a look at the problems and the demands and the difficulties that are presented to our teachers and devise the means to help them help us become the Nation we all want to be. 
   Let's think about our teachers today, remember what they did for us, and think about what we can do for them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``United Nations Population Fund Funding Act of 1999.'' Senators CHAFEE, SNOWE, LEAHY, MURRAY, and DURBIN join me as original cosponsors. 
   I will celebrate the memory of my mother this Sunday on Mother's Day. Very sadly, I know that there are millions of children in the developing world who have very few, or even no memories of their mothers. Nearly all maternal deaths are in developing countries. More than 585,000 women, many of them already mothers, die each year from causes related to pregnancy, including obstructed labor, hemorrhage and postpartum infection, and ectopic pregnancies caused by a sexually transmitted disease. Mothers also die from HIV, malnutrition and anemina, or complications of an unsafe abortion. 
   These are only a few examples of how poverty, lack of knowledge, and lack of basic maternal health care claim the lives of millions of mothers all over the world every year. But the importance of maternal health care to the well-being of women and their families is clear. We can support mothers in poorer countries around the world by removing the ban on U.S. funding for UNFPA. UNFPA is currently the leading maternal health care provider around the world. 
   During the heated debate surrounding international family planning and U.S. funding for UNFPA, ``the baby often gets thrown out with the bath water.'' The ``baby'' in this debate is the vast array of work UNFPA does around the world to improve pre- and post-natal mother's health, access to voluntary family planning programs, STD and HIV education and prevention, and programs to end the practice of female genital mutilation. UNFPA provides couples all over the world access to contraception. It seeks to reduce abortions and related deaths by improving access to family planning and to treatment for complications of unsafe abortion. UNFPA's priorities include preventing teen pregnancy. Too frequently, the bulk of UNFPA's work is overlooked in the international family planning controversy. 
   Many people do not even realize that UNFPA also assists women in crisis situations. UNFPA recently announced it is sending emergency reproductive health hits, including equipment for safe delivery of babies and emergency contraceptives for rape victims, to Albania for thousands of Kosovar Albanian refugee women. 
   The lives of pregnant women and newborns are at particular risk among refugees fleeing Kosovo. These kits include supplies for women who give birth in areas without medical facilities, including materials like soap, plastic sheeting, pictorial instructions for delivering a baby, and razor blades for cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn. These are the most basic of  items. But they can mean the difference between life and death for mothers and their newborn babies. The U.S. should contribute to this humanitarian work. 
   The whole world has been horrified by reports released by human rights organizations stating that the Serbs are using rape as a weapon of war. UNFPA has responded and is leading international efforts to help Kosovar Albanian women who have been raped by Serb forces. UNFPA provides trauma treatment and counseling for other mental health consequences of this form of human rights abuse. 
   As the legislative year progresses, the controversy over international family planning programs will intensify. My legislation calling for renewal of the U.S. contribution to UNFPA will get caught up in the controversy as well. But I will not let one of the most important issues get lost--the health of mothers in poor countries. In the coming months I will work with the cosponsors to this bill and many health care organizations to keep the issue of maternal health visible in the international family planning debate.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is widely known that our nation can no longer commit military force to conflicts, national emergencies and contingency operations without the participation of our National Guard and Reserves. This is expressly provided in our national military strategy. It is confirmed by the 300% increase in the pace of operations for our National Guard alone since Operation Desert Storm. 
   While I enthusiastically support the full integration of our reserve components into a seamless Total Force, I recognize its potential to seriously affect our nation's small businesses. In most communities across this nation small businesses sustain the local economy, yet many of these businesses rely upon key employees, owners or managers who are also Guard members or Reservists subject to being called away to active duty. On Tuesday, the President approved the call-up of 33,102 members of the Selected Reserve to active duty in support of NATO operations in Yugoslavia. We cannot ignore the impact of this on our small businesses. The challenge is upon us. That is why I am happy to join Senator KERRY in introducing the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act. 
   For eligible reservists called to active duty in support of a declared war, national emergency or contingency operation, the bill provides in part: 
   1. An authorization to defer loan repayments on any direct loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA), including disaster loans, to borrowers who are members of the Guard and Reserves called to active duty. 
   2. A low interest economic injury loan program, administered by SBA, which would provide interim operating capital to any small business likely to suffer economic harm caused by the departure of an employee, who is a member of the Guard or Reserves called to active duty. 
   3. Direction to the SBA and all of its private sector partners, such as the Small Business Development Centers, to offer business training and counseling to small business affected by a loss of an employee who is a member of the Guard or Reserves called to active duty. 
   Given that our Guard and Reserve are shouldering an increasing share of our worldwide missions, we cannot overlook the effects of these operations on our civilian workforce and their civilian employers. This legislation ensures that we keep their interests in mind during periods of military conflict.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to make permanent the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and to ratify a Southern Dairy Compact. I am so pleased to be joined by 38 of my colleagues as original cosponsors of this important legislation. 
   In 1996, Senator LEAHY and I fought an uphill battle and secured eleventh hour passage of this landmark legislation. We were met with resistance in every step of the legislative process, yet we succeeded in passing the Compact as a three-year pilot program. 
   The Northeast Compact has a proven record of effectiveness. All eyes have been on New England since the compact became law. The Compact has been studied, audited, and sued--but has always come through with a clean bill of health. Because of the success of the Compact it has served as a model for the entire country. Since the Northeast Compact was approved by Congress as part of the 1996 Farm Bill, it has been extremely successful in balancing the interests of processors, retailers, consumers, and dairy farmers by helping to maintain milk price stability. 
   The 1996 Farm Bill authorized the Dairy Compact for three years and was originally due to expire in April of 1999. Senator LEAHY and I, during the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill, included language that extended the life of the Compact for six additional months. The Compact will expire on October 1, 1999, unless congressional action is taken. 
   Mr. President, in addition to the six New England states, 23 states have either passed or are considering legislation for dairy compacts that would help both farmers and consumers in their states. During the past year Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia have passed legislation to form a Southern Dairy Compact. Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas are also considering joining the Southern Compact. The Oregon legislature is in the process of developing a Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact as well. 
   New Jersey, Maryland and New York have passed state legislation enabling them to join the Northeast Dairy Compact. Delaware, Pennsylvania and Ohio may also join if passed in their states. These states have recognized how dairy compacts can help provide stability to the price paid to dairy farmers for the milk they produce, while protecting the interests of consumers and processors. The Dairy Compact Commission that was established by the 1996 Compact legislation is made up of 26 members from the six New England states. The members, which are appointed by each state's governors, consist of consumers, processors, farmers and other state 
   representatives. 
   The legislation being introduced today, establishes that the dairy compacts may regulate only fluid milk, or Class I milk. It ensure that the dairy compacts compensate the Commodity Credit Corporation for the cost of any purchases of milk by the corporation that result from the operation of the compacts. In addition, the legislation exempts the Woman, Infant and Children (WIC) program from any costs related to the dairy compacts. More importantly, the Daily Compact operates at no costs to the federal government. 
   A 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the economic effects of the Dairy Compact illustrates the Compact's success. The OMB reported that during the first six months of the Compact, consumer prices for milk within the Compact region were five cents lower than retail store prices in the rest of the nation. OMB concluded that the Compact added no federal costs to nutrition programs during this time, and that the Compact did not adversely affect farmers outside the Compact region. 
   Helping farmers protect their resources and receive a fair price for their products in vital to Vermont's economic base and, indeed, its very heritage as a state. Establishing a fair price for dairy farmers has been an on-going battle throughout my time on Capitol Hill. Few initiatives in my long memory have sparked such a vigorous policy debate as the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am so pleased and proud at how industry and government leaders from throughout Vermont and the New England region pulled together to pass the Compact. I am also impressed by the tremendous coalition of support for permanent authorization of the Northeast and Southern Dairy Compacts. 
   The adoption of the Northeast Compact in 1996 simply could not have happened in Congress without the help and dedicated work for the veritable army of Compact supporters from throughout Vermont and the country. This year, our legislation again is supported by Governors, State legislators, consumers and farmers from throughout the country. 
   Mr. President, on March 5, 1999, the Basic Formula Price (BFP) paid to farmers dropped from $16.27 to $10.27, the largest month to month drop in history, bringing the lowest milk price in about 20 years to dairy farmers. In the beginning of April the full impact to farmers was $7.07 per hundredweight loss from December of 1998's BFP. This drop in price will have a severe negative impact on dairy producers from throughout the country. In New England, the Dairy Compact that currently  exists will help cushion the price collapse, with no cost to the federal government. 
   Farmers from throughout Vermont and New England have praised the Compact for helping maintain a stable price. ``Without the Northeast Dairy Compact, we would be in real trouble, the price drop would put a lot of people of out business.'' Simply it's a blessing--no, that's an understatement--it's a lifesaver''. 
   Mr. President, earlier today, I joined several of my Senate and House colleagues on the Capitol lawn to announce the introduction of this important legislation. I was so pleased to see the support and interest for this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Give the states their right to join together to help protect their farmers and consumers by supporting this bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation introduced by Senator ROTH that would permanently protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The fate of the Arctic Refuge has been one of the highest profile natural resources issues of the past 20 years and will continue to be a key issue in the environmental debate. The Refuge is one of the last unspoiled wilderness areas in the United States, and is most often referred to as the ``biological heart'' of Alaska and ``America's Serengeti.'' 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the only place in the United States where a full range of sub-arctic and arctic ecosystems are protected in one unbroken stretch of land. This 1.5 million acre coastal plain is home to a vast number of species including arctic foxes, musk oxen, wolves, polar and grizzly bears, wolverines, and more than 135 varieties of birds. The area is also the main calving ground for the 120,000 head porcupine caribou herd, which migrates each spring to feed on the vegetation found there. 
   In the summer of 1997, I traveled to the refuge and was able to see first hand how beautiful and important this land is to both Alaska and the Nation. As part of a Senate delegation, I visited the port of Valdez, where oil is loaded onto tankers, and I traveled along the pipeline that brings oil from the north. I also flew over the refuge itself, including the Mollie Beattie Wilderness. I was astounded by the natural beauty of this area that is home to such variety of plants and animals that rely on the delicate balance that exists in this pristine wilderness. I also visited a number of native communities along the North Slope and spoke to the inhabitants about their life in this unique environment that they depend on for both their cultural identity and their survival. As a nation we must continue to protect this vital ecosystem and work to bring good jobs, education, and health care to these native communities. 
   I continue to believe that the United States dependence on oil and its byproducts cannot overshadow the importance of keeping ANWR free from the traditional impacts of oil drilling and exploration. The technological improvements within the oil industry make it possible for the oil companies to use a slant drilling technique to harvest the oil in a manner that may not impact the ecosystem to the degree traditional techniques would. But drilling and exploration in this gentle Arctic wilderness at this time could have a lasting impact that would forever damage the environment of this region. 
   I applaud the Senator from Delaware's commitment to permanent protection for this unique linkage of ecosystems upon which the local communities depend, and the American community as a whole should value as a national and natural treasure.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day to introduce the National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 1999. I introduce this bill again today because I firmly believe that deposit laws are a common sense, proven method to increase recycling, save energy, create jobs, and decrease the generation of waste and proliferation of landfills. Unfortunately, recycling rates for beverage containers have recently dropped, making this legislation even more important. 
   The experience of ten states, including Vermont, attest to the success of a deposit law or bottle bill as it is commonly called. The recycling rates in these states for aluminum cans is 80 percent, while the overall national average in 1998 was only 55 percent. Cans recycled in deposit states accounted for half of all cans recycled in the country during this period. Although a national recycling rate of 55 percent may seem significant, every three seconds, 14,000 aluminum cans are discarded as waste. 
   Such waste is rapidly overflowing landfills, washing up on our beaches, and piling up on our roadways. Our country's solid waste problems are very real, and they will continue to haunt us until we take action. The throw-away ethic that has emerged in this country is not insurmountable, and recycling is part of the solution. 
   The concept of a national bottle bill is simple: to provide the consumer with an incentive to return the container for reuse of recycling. Consumers pay a nominal cost per bottle or can when purchasing a beverage and are refunded their money when they bring the container back either to a retailer or redemption center. Retailers are paid a fee for their participation in the program, and any unclaimed deposits are used to finance state environmental programs. 
   Under my proposal, a 10-cent deposit on certain beverage containers would take effect in states which have beverage container recovery rates of less than 70 percent, the minimum recovery rate achieved by existing bottle bill states. Labels showing the deposit value would be affixed to containers, and retailers would receive a 2-cent fee per container for their participation in the program. 
   This legislation I introduce today is consistent with our nation's solid waste management objectives. A national bottle bill would reduce solid waste and litter, save natural resources and energy, and create a much needed partnership between consumers, industry, and local governments. I urge my colleagues to join these ten states, including Vermont, and support a nation-wide bottle deposit law. Because for our children, the health of the planet may be our most enduring legacy.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I must congratulate the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, for producing an on-time budget for only the second time in the 24-plus-year history of the Budget Act. 
   I rise today to support the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution now before the Senate. I am pleased that this budget will pay down the Federal debt, boost education spending, and increase veterans health care spending. I am disappointed that budget conferees could only fund $6 billion of the $10 billion proposed by myself and Senator DODD in child care grants for low-income families and child care tax cuts. However, I appreciate the hard work Senator DOMENICI and others put into getting these funds. 
   While I realize that our amendment would not have guaranteed an increase in child care spending, Congress needs to face up to the reality that low-income mothers need to work, and to make work pay they need child care assistance. As Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I can assure supporters of child care subsidies that this will not be the last word on this issue during the 106th Congress. 
   On a more positive note, this budget adheres to the historic Balanced Budget Act of 1997, while at the same time, over the next ten years, pays down $1.8 trillion of the $3.6 trillion in publicly held debt and provides for modest tax cuts until larger on-budget surpluses emerge. 
   Additionally the Republican budget will fence off the portion of the surplus generated through Social Security payroll taxes. I would like to reassure all Vermonters that not a dollar of these funds will be used to fund tax cuts. Instead, Social Security payroll taxes will go towards shoring up the program and possibly go toward providing capital for an overhaul plan. While this alone will not ensure the long-term financial health of the program, it will have the effect of reducing Federal debt and extending the solvency of the program. 
   Mr. President, the budget before the Senate also protects Medicare for our nation's seniors. Funding for Medicare is increased significantly, but like Social Security, the long-term health of the program is dependent not on providing additional funds, but on enacting needed structural changes. As the resolution indicates, Medicare beneficiaries must have access to high-quality skilled nursing services, home health care services and inpatient and outpatient hospital services in rural areas. The availability of these services is at risk, especially for rural populations, and I will do all I can to ensure that they are addressed as a part of any Medicare legislation. I am particularly pleased that the resolution includes a Medicare drug benefit reserve fund. The availability of a drug benefit for seniors is one of my highest priorities, and I plan to work with other members of the Finance Committee to have it included as a part of any Medicare reform effort. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased that section 210 of the budget resolution sets forth a reserve fund ``to foster the employment and independence of individuals with disabilities.'' The language makes clear that, in the Senate, revenue and spending aggregates and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits may be adjusted and allocations may be revised for legislation that finances disability programs to promote employment. This direction will facilitate the consideration of S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, which now has 72 cosponsors. 
   I am also pleased that the resolution contains Senator COLLINS and my Sense of the Senate in support of increased funding for the Pell grant program, the campus based programs, LEAP and TRIO. These programs have helped make the dream of college a reality for many of our nation's neediest students. Providing an increase in  funding for these tested and proven programs will open the doors of higher education to more academically motivated young people, specifically those who have the most financial need. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, given world events and the ever increasing demands we place on our military, I am pleased that this budget calls for an increase in military pay. We need to do more to alleviate the quality of life concerns of our men and women in uniform. However, I am concerned that some of the military increases in this budget are not going to the things that the military needs most, as evidenced by the current crisis in Kosovo. 
   This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of political intent and a starting point for bargaining. Much work remains to be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that actually fund the government. In areas where I disagree with the budget resolution, I plan to work hard with appropriators to adjust spending levels and turn this budget into reality.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, we are considering the conference report to the only outstanding education issue remaining from the last Congress--the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. Today, we will complete last year's unfinished business. 
   Over a year ago, the President told the Nation's Governors that passage of this legislation ``would dramatically reduce the regulatory burden of the federal government on the states in the area of education.'' 
   The National Governors' Association has strongly urged the Congress to pass Ed-Flex this year and today we will act on their request. 
   The Education Flexibility Partnership Act, H.R. 800, will give States the ability, if they so choose, to make limited resources go further toward the goal of improving school and student performance. It offers a deal no one can refuse--results rather than red tape. 
   Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives a State authority to grant waivers within a State, affording each State the ability to make decisions about whether school districts may be granted waivers pertaining to certain Federal requirements. 
   It is very important to note that States cannot waive any Federal regulatory or statutory requirements relating to health and safety, civil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, equitable participation of students and professional staff in private schools, parental participation and involvement, and distribution of funds to state or local education agencies. 
   Currently 12 States have Ed-Flex authority which was created through a Federal demonstration program, originally created in 1994. 
   My home State of Vermont is one of the twelve using Ed-Flex authority. Vermont has used Ed-Flex to improve and maximize Title I services for those students participating in Title I programs in smaller rural school districts. In addition, my home state has also used their Ed-Flex authority to provide greater access to professional development, which is essential to educational reform and improvement. 
   Two weeks ago, the Independent Review Panel, which was created under the 1994 Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the purpose of reviewing federally funded elementary and secondary education programs, issued its report. 
   One of the sections of the report focuses on waivers including the use of waiver authority by the current 12 Ed-Flex States. The report states:  
   Waivers also encourage innovation; they allow educators to focus first on identifying the most promising strategies for improving academic achievement and then on requesting waivers to remove obstacles to their efforts. 
   I believe H.R. 800 is structured to ensure that the primary function of  issuing waivers is to positively impact overall school and student performance. 
   The bill before us today, H.R. 800, under the sponsorship of Senator Bill FRIST and Senator Ron WYDEN, has significantly improved the accountability aspects of the 1994 Ed-Flex demonstration program. This legislation emphasizes that flexibility is a tool in helping States and districts achieve education goals and standards. It also highlights the importance of States having, in place, first-rate accountability systems that will track the progress of schools and students impacted by the waivers granted under Ed-Flex. 
   I believe passage of this legislation also gives us an excellent introduction to the debate we must have on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the law which contains most of the federal programs designed to assist students and teachers in our elementary and secondary schools. This law must be renewed in this Congress. 
   Through the Ed-Flex debate, we have discussed the importance of accountability, the roles that the various levels of Government play in the elementary and secondary education system, professional development activities for teachers and other school personnel, and most importantly, student achievement. All of these issues are essential elements to the structure of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization effort. 
   As we embark on a new century, it is the perfect opportunity for us to examine the federal role in our education delivery system. At the beginning of this current century, the biggest education challenge facing this country centered around increasing the number of individuals graduating from high school. In the early 1900s, fewer than seven percent of seventeen year-olds graduated from high school. In 1999, that percentage has risen to slightly over eighty percent. 
   Although continuing our efforts on increasing high school graduation rates is still important, our biggest challenge at the close of the 20th century is to ensure that our Nation's schools are all high quality academic institutions. The bill before us today gives states and towns greater flexibility in meeting that challenge. 
   This legislation is not meant to serve as the sole solution for improving school and student performance. 
   However, it does serve as a mechanism that will give states the ability to maximize various education initiatives through flexibility with real accountability. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the conference report to H.R. 800, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator BILL FRIST for his leadership in this area. He has worked tirelessly over the last year on this legislation with Senator WYDEN. I thank both of them for their dedication and efforts. 
   I would also like to thank the ranking member of the committee, Senator KENNEDY. He has been especially helpful in adding many of the accountability provisions contained in the conference bill before us. I thank him for his cooperation and leadership. 
   I also thank all of the Senate conferees for their assistance and cooperation. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of the chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman BILL GOODLING and the House sponsors of this legislation, Representatives MIKE CASTLE and TIM ROEMER. They have worked very hard on this legislation. 
   I would also like to thank Wayne Riddle with the Congressional Research Service and Mark Sigurski with the Senate Legislative Counsel Office. They have been very helpful with their technical advice and assistance. 
   I also extend my appreciation to Gail Taylor and Bob McNamara with the Vermont Department of Education. They have been extraordinarily helpful with their technical assistance. 
   Mr. President, we are now considering the Ed-Flex conference report which passed the House 368-57 about an hour and a half ago, so we are on our way, at this moment, to getting the bill down to the President, so that he can sign it. And, the President has agreed to sign this bill. 
   This is the last unfinished business that we had on a number of education bills that we passed last year. This one passed the education committee, but did not go any further. 
   The major changes that were made in conference dealt with the question of how much flexibility we should give the States in the utilization of funds for the purpose of the 100,000 teacher provisions that were attached to the bill. 
   When the bill left here, the Senate gave the towns the flexibility to use the teacher hiring funds for IDEA if they felt it would be better utilized. That was objected to by the President, who felt it was more important to have the funds elsewhere other than to help with special education. 
   We did reach an agreement, however, which was satisfactory, obviously from the vote in the House. This agreement is that those States which are already at the 1-teacher-to-18-students ratio would not have to utilize the funds to hire teachers. Rather, those States that have already reached the goal of 1 teacher per 18 students would be able to use the funds for professional development. 
   We have, I think, a good compromise, though I am sure the Senate, as indicated by its previous vote, would prefer to help special education. Another very high priority is the question of improving teacher performance. 
   Mr. President, I yield to Senator FRIST such time as he may consume.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on that time, no one could talk about education today without thinking of the tragedy yesterday in Colorado. As Members have expressed their sorrow over yesterday's events and the five earlier school tragedies, the same question comes to everyone's lips: What can we do to prevent this from happening again? 
   The contribution of the Federal Government towards State schools has been defined in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act. It has always been my intention, as a part of the hearings being held by the Health and Education Committee toward reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that I would hold hearings especially examining the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act. 
   So, to those who have asked me today what is the Federal Government doing, or what can we do, I want to inform my colleagues that the Health and Education Committee will have hearings addressing the problem of drugs and violence in schools and I will hold the first hearing early next month. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know that education has a lot to do with what happens in these cases, and the failure of our educational system in some regards is certainly a contributing factor. As we get into the dropout protection aspects of the bill and also the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act, I think you will learn some startling things. 
   I remember not long ago here we had a speaker who told about the amoral generation we are raising in gangs across the country leading to these kind of problems. I think it is incredibly important that when we do take up, which only occurs once every 5 years, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we have to examine what happens and why we have these problems. I look forward to working with my friend to design hearings which should be productive to our society. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing today--along with Senators HUTCHISON and WARNER--the ``Expanded Options in Higher Education for District of Columbia Students Act of 1999.'' The purpose of this measure is to provide citizens of the District with a greater range of options in pursuing postsecondary education by having the Federal government offer support that, in other areas of the country, is provided by State governments. 
   Our legislation takes a three-pronged approach toward meeting this objective: 
   First, it offers a broader array of choices available to students who wish to attend public institutions of higher education by picking up the difference in cost between in-state and out-of-state tuition for DC residents who attend public postsecondary institutions in Maryland and Virginia. 
   Second, it provides additional support to the one public postsecondary education institution in the District, the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), by authorizing funds for the strengthening activities outlined in Part B of Title III of the Higher Education Act. 
   Third, it offers support to those students choosing to attend private institutions in the District and neighboring counties by providing grants of up to $2,000 to help defray tuition costs. 
   With respect to public postsecondary education, students exploring their options find they have a more limited set of choices than any other group of students in the country. A student in any of the 50 states who wishes to attend a public institution of higher education has a number of institutions among which to choose. That student can base his or her decision on considerations such as the size of the institution and the strengths of the various programs it offers. A student in the District of Columbia finds that only one public institution is available. 
   As a practical matter, the District cannot expand its boundaries, nor can it establish a system of public higher education that can offer the diversity of offerings available in the various states. Every State provides support for higher education from which their residents benefit through lower in-state tuition, while out-of-state residents pay a premium to attend. I believe it is appropriate for the Federal government to assume the role of the State, effectively pushing the boundaries to a point where District students are placed on an equal footing in terms of the public education choices available to them. 
   The legislation also makes additional support available to the District's public institution, UDC. Although UDC is a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), it has been precluded from obtaining the support made available to other HBCUs under Part B of Title III of the Higher Education Act. Part B funds are designed to enable institutions to strengthen their programs through activities such as acquisition of laboratory equipment, renovation and 
   construction of instructional facilities, faculty exchanges, academic instruction, purchase of educational materials, tutoring, counseling, and student activities. The funds made available to UDC under my legislation are to be used for activities authorized under Part B. 
   Finally, the legislation recognizes that many District residents choose to attend one of the many private postsecondary institutions in the DC area. Many of these institutions have made extraordinary efforts to enable District residents to succeed in their pursuit of advanced education. A number of states have developed programs, such as the Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant (TAG), to assist students at private institutions in defraying costs. The program authorized in this bill is modeled after these initiatives. 
   An investment in education is one of the most important investments we as a society and we as individuals can make. There are boundless opportunities in the DC area for individuals with education and training beyond high school. DC residents should not be left behind in obtaining the capacity to take advantage of these opportunities. 
   There is a need at every level of the education system to improve the opportunities available to District students. Throughout my career in Congress, I have made support for education one of my top priorities, and I have regarded the education of DC students as being an important component of my efforts. 
   The legislation we are introducing today complements not only those programs such as ``Everybody Wins!'' and the Potomac Regional Education Partnership (PREP) with which I have been directly involved, but also the many other initiatives undertaken by individuals and institutions who work tirelessly to nurture the potential of the children of our Nation's capital. Members of the business community have recently launched a program known as the D.C. College Access Program (DC-CAP) which will offer both financial support for students pursuing postsecondary education and assistance to high school students to assure they are prepared to tackle the challenges of higher learning. 
   I am encouraged by the positive response which I have received in discussing this concept and which has greeted similar legislation put forward by Representative TOM DAVIS. I look forward to working with all my colleagues in advancing this proposal.

   Ms. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, ``Education is a social process ..... Education is growth.........Education is, not a preparation for life; education is life itself.'' 
   John Dewey, a distinguished Vermonter, philosopher and educator wrote these words decades ago, yet they ring true today. Education provides us with opportunities to explore, to experience, to grow, and to improve. Education is a great equalizer--it affords these positive opportunities to anyone who is able and interested in pursuing knowledge. Yet often times, young people in our country are discouraged from engaging themselves in learning because of financial hardship. 
   It is with these thoughts in mind that I rise today to submit this Senate Concurrent Resolution--a resolution that calls on the Congress and the President to increase funding for the Pell grant program and for campus based student aid programs--programs that provide assistance to individuals with financial need to participate in higher education. I am pleased to be joined by Senators COLLINS, KENNEDY, DEWINE, DODD, HUTCHINSON, HARKIN and REED in this effort. 
   Last Congress we had a number of great successes in the area of education. Passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 is high on that list of important education bills that the Congress authored. With bipartisan backing and unanimous support, the Senate adopted the conference report to accompany the Higher Education bill. It is my belief that we achieved broad agreement on this bill because we all kept focused on the ultimate goal of crafting a bill that offered all our nation's students more opportunities to pursue post-secondary study. 
   And in fact, as a result of this legislation, the window of opportunity for students has been opened wider than ever before. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 lowered the interest rate for new students to the lowest level they have been in 17 years. It strengthened and improved grant aid and campus based programs. It will improve the delivery of financial aid for all students through the newly created performance based organization housed in the Department of Education. It invests in programs like TRIO and GEAR UP so that many more of our nation's young people who aspire to getting a college education will be able to pursue their dream. Finally, the bill reaffirms and strengthens the federal government's small but important commitment to graduate studies and will provide important support for our nation's neediest graduate students. 
   In submitting this resolution today, we have taken another step forward in meeting the goals that we set out in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. Our resolution follows the blueprint that was laid out during reauthorization. It follows up on the important work of Senator COLLINS who sponsored the Sense of the Senate amendment on Pell grants, campus based aid and TRIO that was included in the final budget resolution. 
   As some of my colleagues may recall, in February I called for a $400 increase in the 
   maximum Pell grant. The importance of this program cannot be overstated--it is the cornerstone of our federal investment in need-based grant aid. It has helped millions of young people obtain a degree. The Pell grant has made a positive difference in the lives of individual students who received it and it had made a positive difference in the well being of our nation. Thanks to the Pell grant, more Americans have received a post secondary degree, the knowledge base of our nation has been expanded and the earnings base of our nation has increased. 
   Our resolution also calls on Congress and the President to boost funds for other programs that complement the Pell grant and provide needed supplementary aid to our nation's neediest students. The campus based programs are targeted to provide additional assistance to students who really need it the most. These funds often times make the difference for a student between making it through school or dropping out. Therefore, our efforts today in support of these programs are critical. 
   It is my hope that we will be able to work together, in a bi-partisan fashion,  as we did during consideration of the Higher Education Act and pass this resolution. It is my hope that in adopting this resolution, it will bring us one step closer to adopting higher levels of funding for these important programs. In funding these programs at a higher level we will be making the dream of college a reality for so many young people. We will be helping motivated and engaged young people to achieve to the full level of their potential. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this resolution.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I congratulate the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, for producing an on-time budget for only the second time in the 24-plus-year history of the Budget Act. 
   I rise today to support the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution now before the Senate. I am pleased that this budget will pay down the Federal debt, boost  education spending, and increase veterans health care spending. I am disappointed that budget conferees could only fund $6 billion of the $10 billion proposed by myself and Senator DODD in child care grants for low-income families and child care tax cuts. However, I appreciate the hard work Senator DOMENICI and others put into getting these funds. 
   While I realize that our amendment would not have guaranteed an increase in child care spending, Congress needs to face up to the reality that low-income mothers need to work, and to make work pay they need child care assistance. As Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I can assure supporters of child care subsidies that this will not be the last word on this issue during the 106th Congress. 
   On a more positive note, this budget adheres to the historic Balanced Budget Act of 1997, while at the same time, over the next ten years, pays down $1.8 trillion of the $3.6 trillion in publicly held debt and provides for modest tax cuts until larger on-budget surpluses emerge. 
   Additionally the Republican budget will fence off the portion of the surplus generated through Social Security payroll taxes. I would like to reassure all Vermonters that not a dollar of these funds will be used to fund tax cuts. Instead, Social Security payroll taxes will go towards shoring up the program and possibly go toward providing capital for an overhaul plan. While this alone will not ensure the long-term financial health of the program, it will have the effect of reducing Federal debt and extending the solvency of the program. 
   Mr. President, the budget before the Senate also protects Medicare for our Nation's seniors. Funding for Medicare is increased significantly, but like Social Security, the long-term health of the program is dependent not on providing additional funds, but on enacting needed structural changes. As the resolution indicates, Medicare beneficiaries must have access to high-quality skilled nursing services, home health care services and inpatient and outpatient hospital services in rural areas. The availability of these services is at risk, especially for rural populations, and I will do all I can to ensure that they are addressed as a part of any Medicare legislation. I am particularly pleased that the resolution includes a Medicare drug benefit reserve fund. The availability of a drug benefit for seniors is one of my highest priorities, and I plan to work with other members of the Finance Committee to have it included as a part of any Medicare reform effort. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased that the budget resolution adopts my Senate-passed language that will provide funding to foster the employment and independence of individuals with disabilities. I am also pleased that the resolution contains Senator COLLINS' and my Sense of the Senate in support of increased funding for the Pell grant program, the campus based programs, LEAP and TRIO. These programs have helped make the dream of college a reality for many of our Nation's neediest students. Providing an increase in funding for these tested and proven programs will open the doors of higher education to more educationally motivated young people, specifically those who have the most financial need. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, given world events and the ever-increasing demands we place on our military, I am pleased that this budget calls for an increase in military pay. We need to do more to alleviate the quality of life concerns of our men and women in uniform. However, I am concerned that some of the military increases in this budget are not going to the things that the military needs most, as evidenced by the current crisis in Kosovo. 
   This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of political intent and a starting point for bargaining. Much work remains to be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that actually fund the government. In areas where I disagree with the budget resolution, I plan to work hard with appropriators to adjust spending levels and turn this budget into reality.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on this day when Americans must file their tax returns, I am introducing the Conservation Tax Incentives Act of 1999, a bill that will result in a reduction in the capital gains tax for landowners who sell property for conservation purposes. This bill creates a new incentive for private, voluntary land protection. This legislation is a cost-effective non-regulatory, market-based approach to conservation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it. 
   Our tax code already has a tax incentive to encourage people to donate land for conservation purposes or to donate conservation easements. The charitable contribution deduction provides this incentive, and this deduction has been instrumental in the conservation of environmentally significant land across the country. 
   Not all land worth preserving, however, is owned by people who are able to give it away. For many landowners, their land is their primary financial asset, and they simply cannot afford to donate it for conservation purposes. While they might like to see their land preserved in its undeveloped state, the tax code's incentive for donations is of no help to them. 
   The Conservation Tax Incentives Act will provide a new tax incentive for sales of land for conservation by reducing the amount of income that landowners would ordinarily have to report--and pay tax on--when they sell their land. The bill provides that when land is sold for conservation purposes, only one half of any gain will be included in income. The other half can be excluded from income; the effect of this exclusion is to cut in half the capital gains tax the seller would otherwise have to pay. The bill will enable landowners to permanently protect their property's environmental value without forgoing the financial security it provides. The bill's benefits are available to landowners who sell land either to a government agency or to a qualified nonprofit conservation organization. They are also available when landowners sell partial interests in land for conservation. Thus owners of farms and forests may be able to take advantage of the bill's benefits, yet still continue to harvest crops or timber from their land, if they sell a conservation easement on the property. The purchaser must provide the seller with a letter of intent manifesting the purchaser's intent that the land acquisition will serve such conservation purposes as protection of fish, wildlife or plant habitat, or provision of open space for agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation or scenic beauty. 
   Land is being lost to development and commercial use at an alarming rate. By Department of Agriculture estimates, more than four square miles of farmland are lost to development every day, often with devastating effects on the habitat wildlife need to thrive. Without additional incentives for conservation, we will continue to lose ecologically valuable land. 
   This bill provides an incentive-based means for accomplishing conservation in the public interest. It helps tax dollars accomplish more, allowing public and charitable conservation funds to go to higher-priority conservation projects. Preliminary estimates indicate that with the benefits of this bill, nine percent more land could be acquired, with no increase in the amount governments currently spend for conservation land acquisition. At a time when little money is available for conservation, it is important that we stretch as far as possible the dollars that are available. 
   State and local governments will be important beneficiaries of this bill. Many local communities have voted in favor of raising taxes to finance bond initiatives to acquire land for conservation. My bill will help stretch these bond proceeds so that they can go further in improving the conservation results for local communities. In addition, because the bill applies to sales to publicly-supported national, regional, State and local citizen conservation groups, its provisions will strengthen private, voluntary work to save places important to the quality of life in communities across the country. Private fundraising efforts for land conservation will be enhanced by this bill, as funds will be able to conserve more, or more valuable, land. 
   Let me provide an example to show how I intend the bill to work. Let's suppose that in 1952 a young couple purchased a house and a tract of adjoining land, which they have maintained as open land. Recently, the county where they live passed a bond initiative to buy land for open space, as county residents wanted to protect the quality of their life from rampant development and uncontrolled sprawl. Let's further assume that the couple, now contemplating retirement, is considering competing offers for their land. One offer comes from the county, which will preserve the land in furtherance of its open-space goals. The other offer has been made by an individual who does not plan to conserve the land. Originally purchased for $25,000, the land is now worth $250,000 on the open market. If they sell the land at its fair market value to the individual, the couple would realize a gain of $225,000 ($250,000 sales price minus $25,000 cost), owe tax of $45,000 (at a rate of 20% on the $225,000 gain), and thus net $205,000 after tax. 
   Under my bill, if the couple sold the land to the county for conservation purposes, they would be able to exclude from income one half of the gain realized upon the sale. This means they would pay a lower capital gains tax; consequently, they would be in a position to accept a lower offer from a local government or a conservation organization, yet still end up with more money in their pockets than they  would have had if they had accepted the developer's offer. Continuing with the example from the preceding paragraph, let's assume the couple sold the property to the county, for the purpose of conservation, at a price of $240,000. They would realize a gain of $215,000 ($240,000 sales price minus $25,000 cost). Under my bill, only half of this gain $107,500, would 
   be includible in income. The couple would pay $21,500 in capital gains tax (at a rate of 20% on the $107,500 gain includible in income) and thus net $218,500 ($240,000 sales price minus $21,500 tax). Despite having accepted a sales price $10,000 below the individual's offer, the couple will keep $13,000 more than they would have kept if they had accepted his offer. 
   The end result is a win both for the landowners, who end up with more money in their pocket than they would have had after a sale to an outsider, and for the local community, which is able to preserve the land at a lower price. This example illustrates how the exclusion from income will be especially beneficial to middle-income, ``land rich/cash poor'' landowners who can't avail themselves of the tax benefits available to those who can afford to donate land. 
   A real-life example from my home state illustrates the need for this bill. A few years ago, in an area of Vermont known as the Northeast Kingdom, a large well-managed forested property came on the market. The land had appreciated greatly over the years and was very valuable commercially. With more than 3,000 acres of mountains, forests, and ponds, with hiking trails, towering cliffs, scenic views and habitat for many wildlife species, the property was also very valuable environmentally. Indeed, the State of Vermont was anxious to acquire it and preserve it for traditional agricultural uses and habitat conservation. 
   After the property had been on the market for a few weeks, the seller was contacted by an out-of-state buyer who planned to sell the timber on the land and to dispose of the rest of the property for development. Upon learning of this, the State moved to obtain appraisals and a quick legislative appropriation in preparation for a possible State purchase. Indeed, the State and The Nature Conservancy subsequently made a series of purchase offers to the landowner. The out-of-state buyer, however, prevailed upon the landowner to accept his offer. Local newspaper headlines read, ``State of Vermont Loses Out On Northeast Kingdom Land Deal.'' The price accepted by the landowner was only slightly higher than the amount offered by the State. Had the bill I'm introducing today been on the books, the lower State offer may well have been as attractive--perhaps more so--than the amount offered by the individual. 
   In drafting the bill's language, I was careful to ensure that the tax incentive applies to lands that truly serve conservation purposes. First, only publicly-supported conservation charities and governmental entities qualify as purchasers for transactions that make use of this tax incentive. Conservation organizations and governmental natural resource and environmental agencies have a long and respected record of serving the public interest in acquiring and managing land for conservation purposes. This bill builds on that record of trust and responsible stewardship, without imposing new and administratively cumbersome requirements to ensure that the public purpose is served. The tax code already provides for adequate oversight to guard against a potential breach of the public trust by a conservation organization. 
   Second, the bill requires a statement of intent from the purchaser reflecting the purchaser's intent that the acquisition will serve one of the specified conservation purposes. This language was crafted to protect the public's conservation investment by establishing the purchaser's intent, but not creating a tax-driven land use restriction. In essence, I wanted to make sure that the purchaser's intent to conserve the land does not rob the land of commercial value, for which the landowner must be justly compensated if this conservation incentive is to work effectively. The purchaser's letter of intent should not be construed to impose new restrictions on the property or covenants running with the land; to do so would create an appraisal problem that would defeat the very purpose that this bill is designed to address. Thus, the property being acquired should be appraised at its unencumbered, full fair market value. Furthermore, the value of the property in the hands of the purchasing conservation entity should be its full fair market value, notwithstanding both the purchaser's intended conservation use of the property and the required statement of intent. This principle would apply even when the original conservation purchaser, like a land trust, subsequently conveys the property to another cooperating conservation purchaser (e.g., a governmental agency) on behalf of which the land trust may have pre-acquired the property. 
   As this bill also applies to partial interests in land, the exclusion from income--and the resulting reduction in capital gains tax--will, in certain instances, also be available to landowners selling partial interests in their land for conservation purposes. A farmer could, for example, sell a conservation easement, continuing to remain on and farm his land, yet still be able take advantage of the provisions in this bill. The conservation easement must meet the tax code's requirements i.e., it must serve a conservation purpose, such as the protection of fish or wildlife habitat or the preservation of open space (including farmland and forest land). 
   There are some things this bill does not do. It does not impose new regulations or controls on people who own environmentally-sensitive land. It does not compel anyone to do anything; it is entirely voluntary. Nor will it increase government spending for land conservation. In fact, the effect of this bill will be to allow better investment of tax and charitable dollars used for land conservation. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of the Conservation Tax Incentives Act of 1999.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a comprehensive child care bill, the ``Caring for America's Children Act''. This legislation recognizes that quality child care is a shared responsibility that ultimately benefits government, communities, and, most importantly, families and their children. 
   Parents know best how to care for their children, and will choose the best if it is affordable and accessible. This legislation increases the opportunities for American children and their parents to choose the best care for their children, including the choice to forgo a second income to stay home with their children. 
   But for many families, staying home is simply not an option. Today, more than 12 million children under the age of five--including half of all infants under one year of age--spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. In Vermont alone, there are approximately 22,000 children, under the age of 6, in state-regulated child care. 
   There are millions of school-aged children who are in some form of child care at the beginning and end of the school day as well as during school holidays and vacations. And just as many six to twelve year olds are latchkey kids--returning home from school with no supervision until their parents get home from work. Far too many of these children spend that time in front of the television with a soda and a bag of chips. 
   Child care is a necessity for most working parents and high quality child care is a critical investment in our country's future. In the first three years of life, the brain either makes the connections it needs for learning or it atrophies, making later efforts at remediation in learning, behavior, and thinking difficult, at best. The experiences and stimulation that a caretaker provides to a child are the foundations upon which all future learning is built. 
   The brain's greatest and most critical growth spurt is between birth and ten years of age--precisely the time when non-parental child care is most frequently utilized. A Time magazine special report on ``How a Child's Brain Develops'' (February 3, 1997) said it best, ``..... Good, affordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe benefit for welfare mothers and working parents but essential brain food for the next generation.'' 
   The ``Caring for Children Act'' embodies two important goals. First, to expand the choices available to parents--including the most basic choice--to stay at home and care for their children. And second, to move child care from babysitting to early childhood education and positive youth development. 
   How does the ``Caring for Children Act'' accomplish this? By increasing the tax benefits for all families with children we provide more opportunities for families, whether they stay at home or place their children in the care of others. We provide families with additional income to spend on child care or to manage the household budget without a second income. 
   Through state incentives to improve the quality and remove barriers to higher quality care the legislation provides the opportunity to improve child care for everyone. By creating more after school activities that promote positive youth development and making them more affordable for low-income families, the bill increases gives parents and their children the opportunity to choose activities that will be fun and help in the acquisition of the skills necessary to become a productive, happy adult.  
   The ``Caring for Children Act'' is good for families. The legislation creates more equity between the tax benefits received by working parents who pay others to care for their children, and parents who stay home to care for their children. It increases the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) for low- and middle-income families who use child care while they work. It increases current $500 Child Tax Credit to $900 per child. It increases the Dependent Care Assistance Plan (DCAP) for two or more dependents and permits DCAP funds to be used to reimburse a parent or grandparent who provides full-time care for a child under the age of mandatory school attendance. Taxpayers are given the opportunity to select the best tax benefit option for each of their children, based on the individual family's economic and child care circumstances. 
   The ``Caring for Children Act'' expands current consumer education services so that parents have better access to information on high-quality child care and can feel more confident as they make decisions about who will care for their children. It creates new opportunities to meet the needs of school-aged children and their parents during the non-school hours. 
   The ``Caring for America's Children Act'' is good for child care providers. Almost every child care provider that I have talked with over the past few years wants the opportunity to expand their services, increase their skills, and improve their facilities. But the child care business is a financially unstable endeavor. 
   Child care centers and home-based providers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, to buy the supplies and equipment that will promote healthy child development, and even to keep their doors open. 
   The Shelburne Children's Center in Vermont closed earlier this year because it could not afford to stay open. Nearly forty percent of all family-based child care and ten percent of the center-based care close each year. Parents can only pay what they can afford, and far too often that is barely enough to keep the child care provider in business. 
   The ``Caring for America's Children Act'' creates the opportunities that will help keep current providers afloat and encourage more people to enter the business. It creates a high-tech infrastructure for the training of child care providers --and makes that training more accessible for providers in every community. It establishes a block grant to help states improve the quality of child care. 
   Funds can be used to provide salary subsidies and more training for providers, to improve the enforcement of state regulations, to help providers better care for children with special needs, or to increase the supply of infant care. States will have the opportunity to try innovative approaches designed to improve the quality of child care. 
   The legislation also creates financing mechanisms to support the renovation and construction of child care facilities. 
   The ``Caring for America's Children Act'' is good for business. Child care is a growing concern for businesses, large and small. In my home state of Vermont, companies have learned that being ``family friendly'' is good for business. It increases employee retention, improves job satisfaction, and lowers absenteeism. The legislation encourages businesses to take an active role in the child care needs of their employees and in the community-at-large. It provides a tax credit to employers who contribute to child care arrangements for their employees. 
   The legislation expands the charitable deduction to encourage businesses to donate equipment, materials, transportation services, facilities, and staff time to public schools and child care providers. In short, it creates the opportunity for companies to make an investment in their future, by becoming involved in child care. 
   I have divided the ``Caring for America's Children Act'' into four smaller, more narrowly focused bills, which I also am introducing today. The ``Tax Relief for Families with Children Act'' combines all of the tax provisions (Title I and Subtitle A of Title II) of the ``Caring for America's Children Act.'' 
   The ``Child Care Construction and Renovation Act'' focuses exclusively on the financing of child care facilities contained in Title VII of the larger bill. ``The ``Federal Employees Child Care Act'' deals exclusively with ensuring the safety and quality of child care facilities operated for employees of the federal government. 
   The ``Creating Healthy Opportunities and Improving Child Education'' or ``CHOICE'' Act combines the remainder of the ``Caring for America's Children Act.'' It focuses on improving the quality of child care, expanding non-school hours care for older children, increasing professional development for child care providers, and helping low-income families who will not benefit from the tax provisions. 
   As we all know, quality child care costs money. It costs money to parents who bear the biggest burden for the expense of child care. It costs businesses both through the direct assistance that they provide to employees to help with the expense of child care, and through their ability to hire and retain a skilled workforce. It costs government through existing tax provisions, direct spending, and discretionary spending targeted at child care. 
   But we must remember that the costs of not making this investment are even higher. Those costs can be measured in the expense of remedial education, the cost of having an unskilled labor force, the increase in prison populations, and most importantly, the blunted potential of millions of children. 
   Not only must we engage in a public debate on ``who cares for our children,'' but we also must take action to better support families in doing their most important work----raising our nation's children. Last year, child care legislation held a prominent place on the Congressional agenda. This year, little has been said, although the needs have not diminished. I hope that these bills can put child care back on the Congressional agenda where it belongs---because our children and families cannot wait much longer. 
   As I said on Tuesday night during the debate on the Budget Resolution, I am not going to let the issue of child care go away. All of us here today, and all of the co-sponsors of this legislation are committed to whatever it takes to help our children maximize their opportunities. That is what this legislation is about--Opportunities. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me and Senators DODD, LANDRIEU, KENNEDY, and KOHL, as well as with Congressman GILMAN and his House colleagues, in co-sponsoring and supporting this important legislation. To do nothing to improve the quality of child care and provide parents with more opportunities to choose the best care for their children is grossly unfair to the children and far too costly for our nation. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a section by section description of the ``Caring for America's Children Act'' be placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rushed over here in hopes of getting to the floor on time, and I appreciate very much the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. 
   I have worked with the Senator from Connecticut for years on child care. Every time we think we have a victory, it somehow disappears. Yet the need for quality child care does not disappear. The need continues to increase. We must take advantage of the information we have learned and recognize that the early years of life are so incredibly important in a child's development. The first 3 to 5 years are critical. At this point, we do little or nothing for this age group and these are the most important years of your life in many respects. Fortunately, few babies get totally ignored during that period. But this is the period in time which the brain develops most rapidly. It is the one which can be most damaged by the lack of adequate child care. 
   I will be introducing on Thursday and I thought it was going to be the filler for what we did on the budget bill. We were all ready to go, and now we are back to ground zero on this  issue. Well, I am going to introduce the bill on Thursday in hopes that this issue does not go away and that it will continue to be heard before the conference. We must continue to try to do what must be done for the children of this country. 
   In addition, we have to look at businesses and do something to give them the incentives to have their own child care. We have to make sure that we take care of the most critical thing and to make sure that we deliver quality child care and learn how to maximize the period of time in a child's life which is so critically important. 
   I want to do everything I can, and I am sure the Senator from Connecticut joins with me in saying we are not going to let this issue go away. We will do whatever it takes to make sure this country is in a position to allow our children to maximize their opportunities in school by having the best child care possible. 
   This is an incredibly important issue. I know that the Senator from New Mexico is with us in the sense that he understands the essential aspects of maximizing opportunities during the most critical period in a child's life. In the past, the Senator has been supportive of us, and I hope he continues to do so. At this point, I will close and say, I am going to plow forward. I know we will work with the Senator from Connecticut and we are not going to let this issue go away.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, joined by many of my colleagues, I am submitting a Senate concurrent resolution calling for a delay in authorizing or appropriating of funds for new educational initiatives until we fully fund IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. My colleague, Representative GOODLING, is introducing a companion resolution in the House today as well. 
   In 1975 Congress made a commitment to contribute up to 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for each child with a disability being educated by our Nation's schools. We are nowhere close to that target of 40 percent. We are committed to achieving that target, and until we do reach the target, we should refrain from undertaking major new education commitments. 
   According to the latest estimates from the Department of Education, this school year there are 6.1 million children with disabilities being served by our Nation's schools. States and local communities are spending $72.9 billion of non-federal dollars to educate  these children. The federal contribution available to use in this school year is $3.8 billion. That level of funding represents 10.8 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for each child with a disability. That represents a mere $635.83 per child. It's time to deliver on the missing 29.2 percent. 
   In a letter of March 24, 1999, the National School Boards Association urges us to increase funding for IDEA by $2.1 billion a year for the next ten years. It reports that 38 cents of every new tax dollar is being spent on special education. Local school districts desperately need our help. If IDEA had been fully funded in fiscal year 1999, my State, Vermont, would have received $20 million more than the $5.7 million it will receive this July 1. 
   By putting our urge to create and fund new initiatives on hold and by focusing on increased funding for IDEA as our first priority, we will be giving relief to school districts, resources to teachers, hope to parents, and opportunities to children with disabilities. 
   Please join us in cosponsoring this important resolution.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding Vermonter, Patricia Barr, of North Bennington, Vermont. Pat's commitment to improving the health status of Vermonters and all Americans, serves as a model to us all. She is a stunning example of how one person can have a positive effect on many others. 
   Over the course of her life, she has been an advocate and strategic planner for breast cancer research and ethical issues. Pat has tirelessly championed these causes and for that, we are forever grateful. 
   Pat has served on the national Breast Cancer Coalition Board, and currently serves as President of the Breast Cancer Network, which she founded in 1993. Her devotion to health, medical and ethical issues has landed her numerous other roles and responsibilities, including positions on the Center for Disease Control's Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection and Control Advisory Committee, the Human Genome Project's Task Force on Genetic Testing, and the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Breast Cancer Progress Review Group. She has also served on NCI's Cancer Genetics Working Group, and the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer's Biological Resources Working Group Subcommittee on Ethical Issues. In these and in other capacities, Pat has made numerous presentations in Vermont, throughout the Nation, and even outside of the country, regarding ethical and cancer issues. 
   Through word and action, Pat has touched, and improved, the lives of many individuals. Of all those who have crossed my path over the years, few individuals have such a distinguished and proven track record of commitment to breast cancer and related issues. By helping to educate, promote and advocate for change through newsletters, grant programs, support groups, projects such as the Ladies First Program, and lobbying public officials, Pat's involvement helped blaze the trail for success. 
   We have been well served by Pat and look forward to her continued leadership. Vermonters, and all Americans, owe her a debt of gratitude for her passionate, steadfast work on these vitally important issues.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there is strong bipartisan support for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Last year, Congress unanimously passed a five-year reauthorization of LIHEAP. In addition, 52 Senators signed a letter in support of $1.2 billion in funding for LIHEAP. This year, the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition is circulating a similar letter, which has already garnered the support of 30 Senators. 
   Support has not waned for the LIHEAP program since the May 1996 Sense of the Senate on LIHEAP. Eighty-eight Senators voted to maintain current expenditure levels for LIHEAP. Nevertheless, it appears time to re-confirm the Senate's commitment to LIHEAP. Last year, there was a failed attempt to zero out funding for LIHEAP. The threat looms again this year. 
   I, along with my colleagues from the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, offer this Sense of the Senate to demonstrate the broad, bipartisan support for the LIHEAP program. The amendment is simple. It maintains LIHEAP funding at a minimum of current levels, which is $1.1 billion. This is still 50% lower than LIHEAP funding was in 1985. 
   I recognize that these are difficult budgetary times; however, LIHEAP is an effective tool for maintaining the basic needs of low-income households.  It promotes self-sufficiency, something our welfare-to-work laws advocate; and it ensures that our nation's children, elderly and disabled never go to sleep in a freezing cold farmhouse or a stifling hot apartment. 
   Some would argue that energy costs are low and winter temperatures have been milder. My response is that the need for LIHEAP has never been greater. The eligible population has grown; eligibility has been restricted; benefit levels have been reduced; and welfare rolls have been shrinking. LIHEAP provides a critical safety net to the working poor, the elderly and families with children. 
   The statistics demonstrate the need for LIHEAP best. More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have annual incomes of less than $8000, approximately one-half have annual incomes below $6000. It has been estimated that low-income households typically spend four times what middle-income households spend on utility services. Middle-income households spend about 4 percent of their income for energy purposes, whereas low-income households spend between 14% and 16%, and in many instances up to 25% for utility costs. 
   The other argument I hear against LIHEAP is that only cold weather states reap its benefits. Wrong again. In 1998, eleven southern states received $150 million in emergency LIHEAP funding alone. I have seen news articles from Oregon, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kansas discussing the importance of LIHEAP. This is an important national program.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with my colleague from Maine in offering this important amendment to the Budget Resolution. Senator COLLINS has been a leader in the area of higher education and she has contributed a great deal as a member of the Health, Education and Labor and Pensions Committee. 
   Last year, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee reported and Congress passed the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. We adopted the conference report to accompany that bill by overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 96-0. Throughout the process, we were determined to craft legislation that offered students more opportunities. We kept our sights clearly focused on the goal of increasing educational opportunities for all our nation's students. 
   We achieved our goal and as a result, students will receive significant benefits from the passage of that legislation. They will benefit from the lowest interest rate in 17 years on their new student loans. They will benefit from strengthened and improved student grant programs and campus based programs. They will benefit from the creation of a performance based organization housed in the Department of Education which will vastly improve the delivery of student financial aid. More of our nation's aspiring students will be prepared for and able to pursue higher education because of programs like TRIO and GEAR UP. Clearly, that bill went far in opening the door to all who dream of pursuing higher education. 
   We have an opportunity today to take another step forward in meeting the goals that we set out in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
   The Sense of Senate offered by Senator COLLINS, myself and others follows the blueprint that we laid out during reauthorization and encourages the Appropriations Committee to increase funding for some of the most critical programs designed to help our neediest students succeed at the undergraduate level. 
   Earlier this year I called for a $400 increase in the maximum Pell grant. The importance of this program cannot be overstated--it is the cornerstone of our federal investment in need-based grant aid. It has helped millions of young people obtain a degree. The Pell grant has made a positive difference in the lives of individual students who received it and it is has made a positive difference in the well being of our nation. Thanks to the Pell grant, more Americans have received a post secondary degree, the knowledge base of our nation has been expanded and the earnings base of our nation has increased. 
   This Sense of the Senate also calls on Congress to increase funds for other programs that have as their goal increasing access to post secondary study for our nation's neediest students. The SEOG program, Perkins Loans, LEAP, Federal Work Study and TRIO all are targeted to provide additional assistance, both financial and educational, to students who really need it the most. These funds often times make the difference for a student between making it through school or dropping out. Therefore, our efforts today in support of these programs are critical. 
   We are pleased to have the support of nearly all the major higher education groups on this amendment. These organizations represent the students and institutions and they have a deep, first-hand understanding of how important this federal investment is to today's undergraduate students. 
   I applaud my colleague from Maine, Ms. COLLINS for her contributions to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 and for the effort she is making today. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the men's and women's ice hockey teams of Middlebury College. This small school nestled in the heart of the Green Mountains boasts not only extremely talented and motivated students, but some of the finest winter athletes in the country. On behalf of the Vermonters who are proud to call Middlebury College their own, I wish to congratulate both the men's and women's ice hockey teams for a most outstanding season. 
   This year, the top-ranked Middlebury College women's ice hockey team finished the season with a record of 23-2-1, won their fourth straight Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship and set the school record for most wins in one season. 
   The men's ice hockey team, with a record of 21-5-1, won their fifth straight NCAA Division III National Championship, an accomplishment never before achieved in college hockey at any level. 
   Mr. President, again I wish to honor these outstanding student athletes who have devoted themselves to excellence in play, sportsmanship, and academics. I also commend those who have supported them on and off the ice: men's coach Bill Beaney, women's coach Bill Mandigo, and their many friends and family.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the situation in Kosovo is cause for grave concern to all of us. One cannot read the press reports flooding out of Kosovo for the past many months and not be moved. The suffering of the people of Kosovo is tragic, and the potential for this conflict to spread and to destabilize the entire region is very real. Something must be done. 
   But before we commit ourselves to military action, we must be sure that any action we undertake has a good chance of achieving our primary objectives. I am concerned about the current course of action as outlined by the President and Secretary of Defense Cohen. I agree that we need to be part of a NATO effort to resolve the current impasse and put an end to the fighting. But we should not be contributing ground troops to that effort. Our European allies must take the lead on the ground, and we should support that effort with our superior air power and intelligence operations. Just as we take the lead on problems in this hemisphere, it is important that Europe take the lead in Kosovo. 
   The airwaves are now heavy with the talk of impending air strikes against Serbia following Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's final rejection of the proposed peace plan. Milosevic refuses to allow NATO troops on Yugoslav soil, even though NATO has agreed that Kosovo should remain a province of Yugoslav and the Kosovar Albanians have signed on to the peace deal. The United States has put a great deal of effort into trying to achieve a political settlement in Kosovo. We have taken the lead in the negotiations, and the personal intervention of Secretary Albright, Ambassador Holbrooke and Former Senator Bob Dole has done much to advance the cause. But Milosovic remains intransigent and the violence continues to escalate. Both sides are now poised for an all-out military offensive. And United States-led air strikes against targets in Serbia are imminent. 
   I am uncomfortable with the tactic of launching a major military bombing campaign in order to force someone to the peace table. For two reasons, one, it rarely works; and two, real peace will only come when both sides realize they have more to gain by setting aside the military option. If they do not really want peace, there is little we can do to force them into it. Targeted air strikes without a synchronized campaign on the ground are unlikely to make a serious change in the strategic situation in Kosovo. Stopping a large-scale Serbian offensive for anything more than a short period of time is extremely difficult if one's only tool is a stand-off air campaign. 
   However, we must do something and do it soon. But our action must be with the equal participation of our European allies, with each partner contributing what they do best. In our case, that is aerial control and intelligence collection and analysis. I would not oppose that kind of American participation in a closely coordinated operation led by our European allies where the objectives, duration and methodology were clearly explained to Congress and the American people. I believe this is the only operation likely to meet with success in the long run. And we have no time to waste! 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will eliminate unnecessary distinctions drawn by the Internal Revenue Code in the tax treatment of payments received by people who open their homes to care for foster children and adults. Currently, the law allows an exclusion from income for foster care payments received by some providers, while denying eligibility for the exclusion to other providers. My bill expands the law's exclusion for foster care payments. By simplifying the tax treatment of foster care payments, the bill will remove the inequities and uncertainties inherent in the current tax treatment. 
   Under current law, foster care providers are permitted to deduct expenditures incurred for the care of foster individuals. Providers must maintain detailed records to substantiate these deductions. In lieu of this detailed record keeping, section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code allows certain foster care providers to exclude from income the payments they receive for providing foster care. Eligibility for this exclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three factors: the age of the person in foster care; the type of foster care placement agency; and the source of the foster care payments. For children under age 19 in foster care, section 131 permits providers to exclude payments when a State (or one of its political subdivisions) or a charitable tax-exempt placement agency places the individual in foster care and makes the foster care payments. For persons age 19 and older, section 131 permits providers to exclude foster care payments only when a State (or one of its political subdivisions) places the individual and makes the payments. 
   This bill will simplify these anachronistic tax rules by expanding the tax code's exclusion to include foster care payments for all persons in foster care, regardless of age. The exclusion will also be available when the foster care placement is made by a private foster care placement agency and even when foster care payments are received through a private foster care placement agency, rather than directly from a State (or one of its political subdivisions). To ensure appropriate oversight, the bill requires that the placement agency be either licensed by, or certified by, a State or a political subdivision thereof. 
   A qualified foster care payment under this bill must be made pursuant to a foster care program of a State or a political subdivision thereof. My intention is for this bill to cover the wide variety of foster care programs developed by States, some of which are part of larger State programs designed to provide a variety of home- and community-based services to individuals. These foster care programs place children--and in some cases adults--in homes of unrelated families who provide foster care on a full-time basis. Families providing foster care give those in their care the daily support and supervision typically given to a family member. Like traditional families, foster care providers ensure that foster children or adults have a healthy physical environment, get routine and emergency medical care, are adequately clothed and fed, and have satisfying leisure activities. Foster families provide those under their care with intellectual stimulation and emotional support that is all too often lacking in institutional or large congregate settings. 
   In some States, the State itself (or a political subdivision) administers both child and adult foster care programs. Many States, however, are increasingly entrusting administration of these programs to private placement agencies, approved through licensing or certification procedures, or government-designated intermediary tax-exempt organizations. Through the approval process, private placement agencies are accountable for their use of funds and for the quality of services they provide. The bill is intended to cover both those governmental foster care programs funded solely by State or political subdivision monies, and--especially in the case of adult foster care--programs funded by the federal government, typically through a State's Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver program approved by the federal government under 42 U.S.C. section 1396n(c). 
   While foster care for children has been in existence for decades, foster care for adults is a more recent phenomenon. Sometimes referred to as  ``host homes'' or ``developmental homes,'' adult foster care facilities have proven to be an effective alternative to institutional care for adults with disabilities. My home State of Vermont has been at the forefront of efforts to develop individualized alternatives to institutional care. In 1993, Vermont closed the state institution for people with developmental disabilities. Vermont has chosen to rely on foster families, so that people with developmental disabilities can live in homes and participate in the regular routines of life that most of us take for granted. The foster care model has provided people with disabilities a cost-effective opportunity for successful lives in communities, with valued relationships with their foster families that have developed over time. 
   Vermont authorizes local developmental service providers to act as placement agencies and to contract with families willing to provide foster care in their homes. The tax law's disparate tax treatment of foster care payments impedes these types of arrangements. Persons providing foster care for individuals placed in their homes by the government can exclude foster care payments from income. For providers receiving payments from private agencies, however, the exclusion is not available (unless the individual in foster care is under age 19 and the placement agency is a nonprofit organization). Because of the complexity of current law, providers often receive conflicting advice from tax professionals regarding the proper tax treatment of foster care payments they receive. In addition, these rules discourage willing families from providing foster care in their homes to persons placed by private placement agencies, thus reducing the availability of care alternatives. 
   Mr. President, this bill will advance the development of family-based foster care services, a highly valued alternative to institutionalization. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the spectrum of emerging missile threats to our national security cannot be ignored. I am very concerned about the implications of the North Korean missile recently launched over Japan. Research and testing on similar missile  systems likely continue in Iran, Iraq, China, and other countries. These circumstances suggest that the Senate should carefully consider our ability to appropriately counter these threats. 
   I am concerned, however, that the existing national missile defense (NMD) technology has not yet proven to be effective, could be very expensive to deploy and has the potential to adversely affect Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty negotiations with Russia. These concerns should serve to caution us against premature deployment of NMD systems. However, I am now satisfied that amendments to the bill address these concerns. One amendment makes funding for deployment subject to the annual appropriations process and therefore up to Congress to set the appropriate level each year. Another amendment provides that the United States will continue to seek reductions in Russian nuclear forces, and the Administration now states that it can move cautiously on deployment so as to stay within our commitments to the ABM treaty. The bill has consequently become a policy guiding deployment, rather than a decision to deploy. 
   I have long supported a full program of research, testing and development and resisted a premature decision to deploy. I hope that research will lead to some technological breakthroughs or ways to counter ballistic missiles. Their proliferation, especially in the hands of irresponsible leaders such as North Korea's Kim Jung II, requires that we actively investigate possible defenses, but we must not rush to build, at great cost, the first system that passes a flight test. There is still a great deal of research and development work to be done. 
   The fledgling NMD systems now being contemplated for deployment simply do not compare in priority to many of our other military needs, such as our need to immediately recruit, train and retain quality men and women for our military. This is why the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, the military pay, education and benefits bill, was the first major legislation considered this session, and it swiftly passed the Senate with overwhelming support. Well-educated Americans in uniform comprise the foundation upon which we maintain the strong defense of this country. While the Senate unanimously agreed on the urgency of enacting this legislation, it still has found no way to pay for it. In my mind this takes priority over deployment of expensive and unproven NMD technology. 
   Given the competing demands on our finite budget and the high costs to deploy a NMD system, we cannot afford to get it wrong. I hope that this vote will not be seen as endorsement of a rush to deployment, but rather a set of policy guidelines governing an eventual decision to deploy. I will do what I can to ensure this ultimate decision is not made in haste.

   Senator DODD has been a leader on child care and other youth issues for his entire congressional career. He has continually worked to craft effective legislation that will help children and their families, and I appreciate his tireless efforts. 
   By working together, I have little doubt that we can greatly improve the Federal Government's response to the needs of school-aged children and their families.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the remainder of my time to myself. 
   I have noticed over the years with my good friend from Massachusetts, that the weaker his arguments, the louder the volume. He exceeded all my expectations today. 
   My Democratic friends have a number of amendments that will be coming up for votes shortly. As I have pointed out this week, we will be considering the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act this Congress. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has already held several hearings on the ESEA, and many more are in the works. I will oppose all amendments that are relevant to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I will do this, not because I am callous to these issues, in fact, I ve championed them, but because these amendments should be discussed in the normal committee process. I will, however, support amendments that are designed to let local educators direct more money to special education. The reauthorization of special ed occurred last year, and it is open to have more money. The amendment I introduced on behalf of Senator LOTT and others will provide local communities with a choice regarding how much they will use their share of the $1.2 billion included in last year's omnibus appropriations bill for education. 
   Under our amendments, a school system may use the funds either to hire teachers or to support activities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. What fairer system can you have under the circumstances? That is all we are doing. We are saying give them an option, give the locals an option: More teachers or more money for special ed. Our amendment will permit local school officials themselves to decide whether they need more money to educate children with disabilities or whether they need funds to hire more teachers. 
   In Vermont, I am betting the funds will be used for IDEA. Time and again, Vermonters have made clear to me that special education funding is far and away the most pressing need of our communities. And time and again, Vermonters have pressed me to find out whether the Federal Government will honor its promise to pay 40 percent of the costs of special education. We are fortunate in Vermont to have already achieved the small class sizes which the President is trying to promote with his teacher hiring program. We do not need more. We need more money for special ed. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment for your local school districts. This is the most important amendment you will have this afternoon. I emphasize that this is extremely important for your local school districts. 
   The pending amendment would amend the class size reduction provisions of the fiscal year 1999 Department of Education Appropriations Act. It would allow any local educational agency the choice of using its share of the $1.2 billion provided under those provisions either to hire teachers or to carry out activities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. 
   We reauthorized IDEA last year, and this is the perfect time to do this. Local school officials would have the opportunity to determine which of these two activities is a greater need for their schools, and to spend the additional funds accordingly. 
   In addition, the amendment contains a finding that reemphasizes a simple fact--full funding of IDEA would offer LEAs the flexibility in their budgets to develop class size reduction, or other programs that best meet the needs of their communities. 
   I believe this approach offers a good middle ground. It is a compromise between those of us who are urging we live up to our promises, with respect to IDEA funding, and those who believe we should undertake a massive new effort to hire teachers for local schools. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it ought to be unanimous.

   All of our schools want total flexibility, especially in order to have money for special education. We have promised them 40 percent, but have given them 11 percent. We are the cause of the terrible problems local schools have in trying to do what they can to improve their school systems. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will not support the amendment offered by my colleagues from Washington and Massachusetts. 
   First and foremost, the 100,000 teacher proposal is flawed. It puts quantity over quality. There is little or no emphasis on improving teacher quality in the proposal. Yet, the research shows with certainty that the quality of the teacher leading the class is significantly more important than the size of the class. 
   Furthermore, adopting a new, untested, multi-billion dollar program without hearings or local input is no way to make good public policy. We have begun the process of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and we should examine this proposal during consideration of that bill. I give my assurance to my friends on the other side of the aisle that I intend to fully examine this question. But the proper way to do it is under the orderly committee process. We are in the middle of that right now. We have begun the process of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and this issue should be appropriately addressed during this process. 
   So I inform my colleagues that I will, at the time of the vote, move to table the amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is very similar to the amendment we previously voted on, referred to as the Lott-Jeffords amendment. The pending amendment would amend the class size reduction provisions of the fiscal year 1999 Department of Education Appropriations Act to expand the choices available to local school officials. They would have the opportunity to determine whether hiring teachers or educating children with disabilities is a greater need for their schools, and to spend the additional funds accordingly. 
   I am sure that many areas would choose to hire teachers, although I strongly suspect that most communities in my home State would choose to use their funds for IDEA. A number of small States are already at the level of teachers they need, but we are grossly underfunded in taking care of our special needs children. I have heard many times during my trips home, that the current level of funding for IDEA falls far short of the 40 percent we promised in 1975. Full funding of IDEA would offer local school officials the flexibility in their budgets to develop dropout prevention or other programs that best meet the needs of their communities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am reluctant to oppose this amendment because I have such great empathy and sympathy for the problem, and, because I respect the Senator from New Mexico a great deal. We have worked together on so many programs and problems over the years, and we will continue to do so. And I respect his judgment. However, to address this issue at this time is not appropriate. This is a program already in existence, though obviously, not working well. The program is within the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am dedicated to working closely with the Senator from New Mexico to find out how and what we should do to amend existing programs in order to have better dropout programs. So I hope he would understand that, and that by opposing this amendment, which I will move to table eventually, I am not doing anything other than saying wait--wait until we go through the reauthorization of the ESEA this year. We are going to hold hearings and make sure we do the best thing possible to solve the dropout problem.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. The amendment we have now is Lott No. 67. Fulfilling a  promise is not as exciting as raising new expectations with new programs. We don't get much press coverage, presumably, for doing the right thing, but if we fulfill our obligation to fund IDEA, State and local agencies will be able to target their own resources toward their own, very real needs. These may be needs for afterschool activities, or for dropouts, or for any number of the pressing needs facing our Nation. All of this is going to be discussed in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will likely oppose this amendment because, again, this will be reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Actually, this program is already part of the law in a way. It is the 21st Century Schools program I got in in 1994. The administration has, by regulation, kind of changed it into an afterschool program. I do not mind that, but I think the 21st Century Schools was much broader and a better program. We can argue this out, and we will have hearings on it and evidence presented during the next few weeks and months. At this point, I would have to oppose the Boxer amendment, and eventually, after time runs out, I will move to table it.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am going to now ask for a voice vote on Lott amendment numbered 68. This is basically the same amendment we have been voting on. I think I talked to the other side of the aisle and they have no reason not to have a voice vote. 
   At this point, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays on Lott amendment No. 68.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me explain this amendment. Like the previous Lott amendment, this would amend the class size reduction provisions of the fiscal year 1999 Department of Education Appropriations Act to expand the choices available to local school officials. They would have the opportunity to determine whether hiring teachers or educating children with disabilities is a greater need in the schools and spend the additional funds accordingly. 
   I am sure that many areas will choose to hire teachers, although I strongly suspect that most communities in my home State would choose to use their funds for IDEA, special education. If a locality has a plentiful supply of unemployed qualified teachers and lacks only the funds to hire them, that locale will use the $1.2 billion to hire teachers. If that is not the case, those funds will be put to better use by supporting existing efforts to educate special education students. 
   I urge my colleagues support this amendment. I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an amendment which I think everyone would agree is an appropriate amendment regarding the rules with respect to discipline and carrying a weapon into a school. A decision was made, that the law only applied to those individuals who carried a weapon to the school. But, if the weapon was in the possession of someone within the school, the law did not apply. This would make sure that possession, as well as carrying it in, is a violation. That is why I will obviously support the amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am sorry that I must disagree with the words of my colleague and member of my committee. 
   Ed-Flex, as it currently operates, demands accountability of participating States. It is important to keep in mind that accountability has been a part of Ed-Flex since its inception, and the manager's package builds upon those strong accountability provisions. The manager's package, adopted last week, adds the following accountability features: State Ed-Flex applications must be coordinated with the title I plan or with the State's comprehensive reform plan; emphasis on school and student performance; requires additional reporting by the Secretary regarding rationale for approving waiver authority. 
   It is very important to keep in mind that the Department of Education, the Secretary, is the entity that determines whether or not a State qualifies as an Ed-Flex State. That is retained. 
   The September 1998 GAO report stated:  
   The recent flexibility initiatives increase the amount of information districts need, rather than simplifying or streamlining information on Federal requirements. Federal flexibility efforts neither reduce districts' financial obligations nor provide additional dollars.  
   For those reasons, I ask my colleagues to oppose the Wellstone amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to say thank you to the Senator from Oregon, because without him we would have had a much more difficult time. It was bipartisan from the start, and it ended up very bipartisan. We ended up, I think, with a 98 to 1 vote. 
   Also, Mr. FRIST, I am going to use 30 seconds, and then allow those who wish to speak longer to do so. 
   I want to express my particular gratitude to all the members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, who have worked especially hard on this legislation. I very much value the time, effort, and commitment they have brought to this task. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the two sponsors of the Ed-Flex bill, Senators FRIST and WYDEN. It is in large part due to their dedication and commitment that we were able to pass this bill with such overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   Finally, I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to the many staff people who contributed to the passage of this important Ed-Flex legislation: 
   Sherry Kaiman, Mark Powden, Jenny Smulson, Heidi Scheuermann and Susan Hattan of my staff; 
   Townsend Lange and Denzel McGuire with Senator GREGG; 
   Lori Meyer, Meredith Medley, and Gus Puryear with Senator FRIST; 
   Paul Palagyi with Senator DEWINE; Chad Calvert with Senator ENZI: Holly Kuzmich with Senator HUTCHINSON; Julian Hayes with Senator COLLINS; Cherie Harder with Senator BROWNBACK; Jim Brown with Senator HAGEL; and Jim Hirni with Senator SESSIONS. 
   I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance offered by Mark Sigurski with Senate Legislative Counsel, and Wayne Riddle with the Congressional Research Service. 
   Mr. President, I also thank all of the staff here who have worked so many hours to expeditiously pass this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I submit for the RECORD the following remarks made by Ms. Beth Macy at an event honoring Senator Claiborne Pell, hosted by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU). Ms. Macy, a former Pell Grant recipient, spoke eloquently about the positive difference that the Pell grant made in her life and the difference it has made in the lives of the students she now teaches. Senator Pell, a statesman committed to education, was visionary in his creation of the grant that now bears his name. The Pell Grant still serves as the very foundation of our federal commitment to postsecondary study and it has helped make the dream of higher education a reality for millions of low-income individuals. I was pleased and honored to participate in this event for Senator Pell. 
   I urge my colleagues to take the time to read Ms. Macy's remarks. They remind us of why our support for the Pell grant program is important.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 280, the education flexibility partnership bill. The leader would like to announce that negotiations are ongoing between the two sides in an effort to complete action on this important legislation. However, until an agreement has been reached, the Senate will continue consideration of the Ed-Flex bill, as outlined in yesterday's unanimous consent agreement. 
   Pursuant to that order, the time until 1 p.m. will be equally divided for debate on the bill and, at the conclusion of that debate time, the Senate will proceed to two back-to-back rollcall votes. The first vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the Kennedy-Murray motion to recommit and, assuming that fails, a second vote will occur on a motion to invoke cloture on the Jeffords-Lott IDEA amendment. 
   Following those votes, and if an agreement has been reached, all Members will be notified of the remaining schedule for today's session. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to discuss very briefly the Boxer amendment. Back in 1993, I offered--and it was endorsed in 1994, when we were reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the basic amendment that Senator BOXER is talking about. We called it the 21st Century Schools at the time, though it was only minutely funded. 
   This past year, the President decided that was a good program. He put $200 million into the program and I deeply appreciate this acknowledgment that it was a good program. Thus, we are talking about something which I agree with and that Congress did back in 1994. The time to review it, however, is when we're reviewing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has already begun with hearings and will continue. 
   So the concept is one that is acknowledged by everyone as being important. The need for remedial education has increased dramatically, and the way that can be addressed is through afterschool programs. When we get to this issue later in the year, at the proper time, I will be endorsing the concept and welcoming amendments from either side to make the initiative more consistent with the current needs. 
   I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, let me review for a little bit where we are. As the Senator from Washington pointed out, we have on the floor, an alternative to what would be provided in the Murray amendment. Schools would be able to have some flexibility on the expenditure of money that intended for schools, if they want, to add more teachers--the new teachers are in the President's new 100,000 teachers program. 
   First, I will point out some of the problems with the President's program as it is presently drafted. The guidelines have just come out on it, and they still don't seem to cure this problem. I was on a national press hookup this morning, and at least two States who were on that hookup--Wyoming and North Dakota--have already reached the goal of 18 children per classroom. They would not, under the current guidelines, be able to use the money for what they want to use it, professional development. Vermont is in that same category. The 100,000 new teachers program would affect states differently, and some states would not benefit at all from. Those are just two problems with it. 
   That is why we have the option I suggested, which is in amendment form. We will have a chance to vote on it. It would say that you would have the option of using these funds--which will be substantial; in many cases, $1.2 billion is involved--toward reaching the commitment we made back in 1975 and 1976, to provide 40 percent of the funding for special education. We are down to less than 10 percent at this point. 
   The chart behind me shows that very well. The orange in that chart is what we should be paying to the schools across the Nation for special education assistance, and we are not. In addition to that, a recent Supreme Court decision has said that schools must not only take care of the educational aspects, but they must also take care of the medical aspects of a child who needs medical assistance in the schoolhouse. That is going to add hundreds of millions of dollars more in special education costs, I would guess, in the years ahead, and probably even this year. 
   To refresh people's memory, the agreement on the $1.2 billion, 100,000 teacher proposal happened in the wee hours of final passage of the bill, and I was not present. If I had been present, I certainly would have fought at that time what they did in the language of it. What we are trying to do is make sure the communities would have the option of using that money to defer some of their cost of special education, and then have other funds freed up to provide the kinds of changes or money expenditures they need. 
   The amendment proposed by Senator LOTT yesterday offers what 
   I have been talking about. I believe it would be a good middle ground between those of us who are urging that we live up to our promises with respect to IDEA funding, and those who think we should undertake a massive new effort to hire teachers for local schools. The Lott amendment essentially permits local school officials to decide whether they need more money to educate children with disabilities, or whether they need to hire additional teachers. From what I am hearing from Vermont teachers, IDEA funding is the first, second, and third issue raised with me about education when I visit the State. 
   We are fortunate in Vermont to have already achieved the small class sizes the President is trying to promote with his teacher hiring program. Reducing class size further is not a priority at this time. Meeting the needs of children with disabilities is. This is what is hampering our local schools from doing the things they need to do. We would like very much to see the flexibility include such things--which are a priority--as the ability of our teachers to be given additional training so they can perform better in the classroom. 
   I realize that some localities in other areas may hold a different view. They could use their portion of $1.2 billion to hire teachers. The point is that it should be their choice, not ours. In listening to the debate over the past several days, one might get the impression that hiring more teachers is the silver bullet. Clearly, that is not the case. What is missing in the discussion is the quality of the teacher in the classroom. I think it is common sense that the most important aspect of teaching is to have a teacher that is a good teacher. The classroom size can go down to 10, but if the teacher is a lousy teacher, you are not going to have much quality education. On the other hand, if you have a qualified teacher, whether the class size is 18 or 20 or 23, you will have quality education. The size is not going to make much difference. When I was growing up, our average class size was about 30, and I had good teachers. The biggest problem is making sure that we have professionally qualified teachers. 
   In the last Congress, during the process of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, there was a great deal of concern about the quality of our teachers and the effectiveness of the various programs that existed to address these concerns. We thought that the programs that had never been utilized, or were not effective, could be changed to take care of what is the primary need of the Nation. This need is the need for fully qualified teachers--not only qualified in teaching, but in knowing what the standards are that have to be met. They must know how we can move kids into a situation where they have the math standards essential to perform in the international markets, and where the young people graduate from high school ready for jobs that pay $10, $15 an hour. We don't have that kind of thing in most areas of the country. 
   In hearings on that subject, I believe every member of our committee expressed grave concerns that the quality of teaching was not at the levels to ensure that our students meet educational goals. As part of the higher education bill, we included an entire title devoted to teacher quality. And because we were dealing with higher education, we focused largely on the training of future teachers. I believe we developed a very positive and comprehensive approach for dealing with that issue. 
   Another issue along those lines that we have to look at, is what we can do in the higher education areas to make sure the colleges and the universities that have teacher colleges understand the changes that are necessary to ensure that when they graduate people from the education departments, they are qualified teachers. 
   I have examined many, many of the programs for teacher scholarships that are in existence and have found that they are missing a lot of important information for young people who are graduating. These graduates will be our teachers for the next century, and they really don't have the kind of education they should have to graduate and be a good teacher, a professional teacher, one who is qualified to go into the classroom. We have a lot to do in that regard. The money would be much better spent there, than it would be spent on classroom size. The place to do that, however, is in the context of the elementary and secondary education authorization, not piecemeal as we are doing now on the Senate floor. 
   Until we get a better handle on the teacher quality issue, we are making a big mistake by sending local officials out to look for more teachers. Where are they going to come from? Are they  going to be good teachers? And, are they going to have a classroom? If you have 100,000 new teachers, where are they going to teach? That is a question that has not been answered. If you suddenly reduce the class sizes, you have to have someplace to put the students who are pushed out of the existing classrooms. You have to have classrooms to put them in. 
   On Monday, it was suggested that the first question a parent asks of his or her child is, Who was in your class? I would suggest that the first question is, Who is teaching your class? If a locality has a plentiful supply of unemployed quality teachers and lacks only the funds to hire them, that locality will find the Class Size Reduction Program to be beneficial. If that is not the case, those funds will be put to much better use by supporting existing efforts to educate special education students. 
   If, in the context of the ESEA reauthorization, we determine that helping to hire teachers is an important component of the overall approach to supporting teaching, then we can do that. I hope, if we do that, that we proceed in a thoughtful way to work through the real needs of schools and students. The 100,000 teacher program does not now adequately address the differences in needs of local schools around the country. Some schools may need more professionals while others need more professional development. I would say it is much more of the latter than the former. 
   In the meantime, let's take Senator LOTT's suggestion to allow schools to choose how they spend these funds made available for fiscal year 1999, the $1.2 billion. It is not too late to make this option available. Guidance on teacher hiring programs has been available for less than a week, and funds will not be provided until July. 
   Mr. President, let me again go over the basic problem we have here. 
   First, we had a wonderful bipartisan relationship last year. It really makes me sad to think that has broken down on the first education bill we have taken up this year. Last year we passed 10 good, sound, education bills out of my committee. They are now in operation, and we are looking toward improvement, even though we still have the appropriations fight to go through this year. But, we worked in a way, last year, that benefited all of us. We shared our ideas and worked them out in the committee. 
   This year, this Ed-Flex bill was voted out of committee 10-to-1. The Democrats chose not to be present when it was voted out, and that is fine, because there didn't seem to be any conflict in it. It was basically the same bill we had voted out of committee 17 to 1 last year. So I thought, fine, that is all right; they have other things to do. 
   But now this has turned into what is basically, I think, a political demonstration project to get political advantage by proposing various amendments to this bill. These amendments should be taken care of not on the Senate floor right now, but through the normal committee process, during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we are already in the process of holding hearings on. We must examine each one of the programs that have been addressed. They should not be placed on 
   this Ed-Flex bill and bypass the committee process. 
   Certainly we have to worry about the issue after school programs. That is an incredibly important issue. The proposal in the amendment of the Senator from California, is a program that I put into the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA. Perhaps the program needs to be modified--although it is a pretty good program right now--to take care of the changing demands upon our educational system. However, that should be done during the reauthorization of ESEA, and there shouldn't be much controversy over it. The President has already endorsed it and has added funds to it, making it a substantially better program as far as funding goes. And through the reauthorization of ESEA, we will just improve it to make sure it is better as far as handling our young people. The others are also all worth taking a look at. 
   I certainly agree that we have to end ``social promotion.'' That is a term that has just recently come into use. Let me explain a little bit about where that term came from. 
   Literacy studies have shown that 51 percent of the young people we graduate from our high schools are functionally illiterate. That is a disaster. You ask any businessman. A potential employee says, ``Why don't you want to look at my diploma?'' The businessman says, ``It doesn't mean anything. I don't even know if you can do ordinary math or reading.'' So that is the social promotion that we have to end. We have to make sure that every child who graduates from high school meets certain standards or they don't get a diploma. That makes common sense. 
   There are other amendments being offered which also ought to be considered, but they ought to be considered in the normal committee process, not just for purposes of politics, or whatever else. 
   I am, though, encouraged to learn from the leadership that we have, apparently come to an agreement, which will be expressed in the not-too-distant future. This will give us the opportunity to get on with the educational situation by passing the basic bill, the Ed-Flex bill. And we may agree on some amendments to be offered, and we will vote on those. 
   So I am hopeful that before the afternoon is finished we will have the opportunity to move forward on this bill, and then get back to discussing education in the committee room, within the context of the ESEA reauthorization, where we should be, instead of on the Senate floor. 
   Mr. President, I am now going to read a message from the leader, if that is all right. 
   For the information of all Senators, negotiations are ongoing, and we are very close to an agreement with respect to the overall Education-Flexibility bill. Having said that, the agreement would be vitiated on the scheduled cloture vote. But that agreement has not been fully cleared by all interested parties. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of the leader, that the pending vote scheduled to occur at 1 p.m. be postponed until 1:30 p.m.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I then will continue to go forward and hope that maybe we are coming to an end. It s not that I don't like being on the Senate floor continuously day after day, starting in the morning and ending at night, but there are other things on my own schedule that sometimes suffer. Hopefully, we can reach agreement. Again, the status of our educational system is what we are talking about here generally. Hopefully, with this agreement, we will get back to an orderly process to examine the needs of this Nation. 
   Let me reflect again, as I have before, upon the status of education in this country and why we are concerned about it. 
   Back in 1983, under the Reagan administration, Secretary Bell at that time did an examination of our educational system and compared it with our international competitors. He took a look at where we stood with respect to our young people graduating from high school, and also those graduating from skilled training schools, and determined that we were way, way behind our international competitors--the Asian and European communities. In fact, the commission that was set up to do the examination was so disturbed that they issued this proclamation. To paraphrase, they said, if a foreign nation had imposed upon us the educational system that we had at that time we would have declared it an act of war. Well, we still have that education system. You would think that a tremendous change would have occurred, but it hasn't. 
   I am on the goals panel, and we meet once a year to determine whether or not our schools have improved. 
   Most recently, we took a look at the situation last year to see what had happened to improve our educational prowess and standards relative to the rest of the world. What we determined was there has been no measurable improvement since 1983. That was 15 years ago. We have not improved. That cannot continue, and that is why we are here today and will be working on this as we move forward. 
   As shocking as that revelation was, we found that the only data we had to measure whether there had been improvement was 1994 data. We do not  even have a system which will provide us with current data to show us whether we have any improvement or not. That is a terrible situation. We cannot even measure our performance to determine whether or not we have had any improvement. 
   Hopefully, as we move forward, that situation will be taken care of in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. A primary focus of what I will be doing this year, in order to address the situation, is to thoroughly review the Department of Education. Mr. President, $15 billion is spent on elementary and secondary education, and it seems to me that one of the primary focuses of the Department of Education should be to find out whether we are improving. Does this program or that program work or not? Are the young people are influenced by this or not? Yet, with $15 billion, we have not been able to determine whether or not anything is happening. 
   We have important changes to make in the Department of Education. We have to take a look at where our priorities are and take a look at where the $260 million is spent on research. I am frustrated as chairman of the committee to think at this point in time that we are spending all this money and we do not know whether the programs we have been using work or not. If we can't find out with $260 million whether our educational system is improving, we better take a good look at our research programs. That is one thing we will be looking at on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   It is certainly going to be an interesting year, and I am hopeful that in the next 25 minutes we will find that there has been an agreement that will allow us to go forward in an orderly process. 
   Now, back to our educational system and the problems we have with it. To refresh the memories of Members as to what this means to our future, we have had terrible problems with finding young people with the skills necessary for this Nation to compete in the world. 
   In fact, we are so short that we have somewhere around 500,000 jobs out there available that are not being filled. Actually, that is down somewhat, I should say. We made a significantly downward push. But why? How? By changing the immigration laws to bring in more people from foreign nations who have the skills to come in and help our businesses compete. 
   That is not the way it should be happening. We should not be looking toward amending immigration laws to supply our businesses with the skilled workers they need to meet the demands of the present-day jobs. This is another area that is of deep concern to me. 
   Several years ago, we set up a skills panel to establish standards to measure whether we were meeting the goals of our industry. I do not know how long ago that was, but it has been many years. We have yet to establish even one standard. Obviously, we have a long way to go if we are going to meet the needs of our businesses. 
   The first thing we have to do--and I know the President endorses this also--is make sure that every student who graduates from high school is functionally literate and not functionally illiterate, as the studies show, and that is a big charge. 
   We do have some things that are good news, though. Although, unfortunately, there is usually bad news connected with that good news. The good news is, we have all sorts of technology which has been developed over the years with various programs. The bad news 
   is that these programs started to become available in the midseventies, and we are not yet in a position to determine how they could be better utilized in our school systems. 
   You can also utilize software in your home computer where you can learn simple elementary math, algebra, and calculus by yourself if you want to. All of these things have been available for over 20 years, but they are not readily available, nor are they in any way coordinated in their use in our school systems. 
   My own kids have caught up on matters by having it available to them individually. However, there is no coordination nor evaluation connected to the utilization of that technology in assisting young people who are having a difficult time or want to go ahead of their class in understanding calculus or other high standards of math, there is no coordination nor evaluation. 
   I was at a conference recently in Florida where the technology people came in, and I was able to talk with them. There are wonderful programs out there, but there is no evaluation system, not even in the industry itself, to determine what works and what does not work. We have all of these wonderful programs--AT&T has a good one and many companies do--and they are available, but there is no assessment of them. There is no evaluation of whether, one, an individual benefits from it; or, two, whether it can be used on a broad basis or how to fit it into the classroom to make sure the young people will be able to take advantage of this technology. 
   That is another thing we have to look at with the ESEA reauthorization: First, how can we set up a situation where we can evaluate these programs? And second, how can we make sure that, in the afterschool area, we have programs available that will allow our young people to catch up and move ahead? 
   I see the sponsor of the bill is present on the Senate floor. I congratulate him for the introduction of this bill and the hard work he has put into it. He has helped move it forward. I am sure he shares with me the glimmer of hope which will burst forth with a resolution to this problem. 
   I yield to the Senator from Tennessee such time as he may need.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to proceed to explain very briefly the position that we will have on the amendments that have been offered here. 
   This is an agreement, unanimous consent agreement, that was made to enable us to get through this bill. And I appreciate all those that have entered into this agreement. 
   I would like to explain to my colleagues, however, that because these are all--these two that are being talked about right now, the school report card and the ending of social promotion, are both amendments within the purview of the committee dealing with elementary and secondary education. It is my intention to listen very carefully and carry forward the information that is provided on these until such time as we are marking up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   However, it will be my procedure, in order to have an orderly hearing process in going ahead on these matters, to probably table the amendment of the Senator from California. But I do understand and believe that a great deal of what she says, if not all, is very relevant to our educational system but should be done in the orderly committee process. I want to make that clear so everybody understands when we vote on these things it is because they should be done in the proper order under an orderly committee process. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, at this time I would just like to make some brief comments on the amendments which have been presented by the minority. I would like to again reiterate for my colleagues that the process we are going into was an agreement reached in order to move this bill along. This bill, which is known as the Ed-Flex bill, is relatively noncontroversial. I think the only vote in opposition in committee, and may well be in the Chamber, was by Senator WELLSTONE. But we are in the process to move this bill along, to move it along with the House bill, which I believe was passed, or will be passed today in order to get it into law in time so that States may have a maximum benefit from its passage. It is a bill with which all 50 Governors agree, a bill with which the President agrees, and the Department of Education has been sending the guidelines out for its utilization. All of this is ongoing. 
   However--and it is understandable--the minority has a desire to be able to put amendments on the bill because they feel strongly that these initiatives ought to be put into law. However, as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I must say that we are in the process now of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That act is where most of these amendments should be. Some of them are perhaps relevant. For example, part of the Wellstone amendment is relevant to the Ed-Flex bill. 
   If we are going to assure that the committee system works--where evidence is presented at hearings, where we have people from the local schools all the way up to the States' Department of Education testify, where we can be absolutely sure of what we are doing in this incredibly important bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has some $50 billion in Federal dollars, I believe it should not be done in this kind of ad hoc process of attaching amendments. Well-intentioned as the amendments may be, some of which I would agree to, some of which I have even offered in the past, we can not offer them in a way that does not make sense when you are trying to be more effective with the expenditure of Federal funds. 
   There is $50 billion included, and yet, as I mentioned earlier, over the last 15 years, ever since we understood we had some serious problems in education in this country, we have seen absolutely no measurable improvement in the test results of our young people. 
   That is an intolerable situation. It does not make any sense to reauthorize a bill, which has obviously not had much impact on improving education in this country, without holding hearings or before fully examining it. 
   I am put in the very difficult position of having to allow these amendments to be presented in order to move the bill along, and then I will be the one to have to move to table. A motion to table means you do not allow the amendment to be voted on, and I will do this because the amendment should be offered when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is before us. But, my move to table will give the political argument that I killed all these amendments. I am just trying to help this country's education system improve and not to do it in this ad hoc, messy way. 
   Therefore, I must oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have long advocated that we, as a Nation, need to address, head on, the issue of social promotion. In fact, we made some progress in this area last Congress. Funds made available for title II of the Higher Education Act, teacher quality enhancement grants, may be used by States to develop and implement efforts to address the problem of social promotion and prepare teachers to effectively address the issues raised by ending the practice of social promotion. 
   ``Social promotion'' is a term which educators know, but I am not sure everyone does. It simply means that we sort of gave up on young people saying, well, it is not really that important that they know how to read because there are jobs that you can get without having to read. 
   That situation has changed. We are going into the next century, and we know that unless a child has an excellent education when they graduate, they are not going to be able to get a good job. The literacy studies show that 51 percent--this is an incredible statistic--of the young people who graduated from high school, when measured for their performance, were functionally illiterate. We have to stop that. Ending social promotion is what that is all about. 
   However, the amendment by Senators FEINSTEIN and DORGAN is one I will reluctantly have to move to table, in order to make sure that we can move on in an orderly process on the ESEA reauthorization. 
   The other amendment, by Senators BINGAMAN and REID on school dropouts, is in a similar situation. We all know that we have to do something about school dropouts. We know that the so-called forgotten half in our educational system for years has been ignored, and when they get to sixth, seventh, and eighth grades they do not see any relevance to education in their lives. Everybody is pushing: You have to go to college; You have to go to college. And now we know there are many high-paying, skilled jobs that young people can get, and that young people would have the ability for if they had the proper schooling efforts in order to learn those skills that are necessary. 
   And so we have to accommodate that. We have to make sure that the young people in the sixth and seventh grades understand that if they do things to get the education, they will be able to get a good job. 
   There has been a tremendous move in that direction in some States. In Mississippi, with one of the worst records in the sense of educational performance, they are spending millions of dollars making sure that young people start looking at careers in the sixth grade so that they know there is a relevancy to the education and they won't drop out. It is very important. But it should be considered on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is now before the committee,  and on which we are holding hearings. I certainly agree with Senator BINGAMAN in what he is doing. 
   There is another amendment that has to do with report cards that we have listened to, and that is fine, as well. But that is an issue for the States to address, not for the Federal Government to mandate. 
   In many cases, the States are ahead of us in addressing the quality of their schools. Mr. President, 36 States already require report cards. We need to also remember that funding for education is primarily a State and local responsibility. So, again, that is another good approach, but it is something we should do in the orderly committee function. 
   Senator WELLSTONE has amendments. I have to say at least one of them is relevant to the underlying act. He is on the committee. He had an opportunity to offer it, but did not. Under the present situation, Ed-Flex demands accountability of States that are participating. It is important to keep in mind that accountability has been part of Ed-Flex since its inception, and the managers' package builds on those strong accountability provisions. So, again, this one could have been offered in committee. He chose not to offer it in committee, so I must oppose that one as well. 
   Mr. President, I again want to put everyone on notice that I have the responsibility to protect the ability of this committee to work in an orderly fashion. Because of that, I will have the unpleasant duty of probably moving to table these amendments when they come up, or to oppose them. 
   I would like to also refer to the Boxer amendment. This is another one that is very familiar to me. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers is a program that I created back in 1994 as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I fought hard to include this program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and was successful, in spite of opposition from the very same administration. Getting the program funded was not easy in the face of the administration's opposition to this program. In fact, the administration proposed rescinding the fiscal year 1995 funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers. All of a sudden, the administration woke up and said: Hey, Republicans sometimes have a good idea. It is an amazing thing for this administration to recognize. But anyway, all of a sudden they put $750,000 into the program--I am sorry they asked to rescind it at another time. 
   More recently, the administration decided that they now like this program, and in fiscal year 1997 they recommended $15 million for this program. Now they are increasing it even more. So, obviously, I am a great friend of that one. It was a bill I got passed back in 1994 in the last reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   I have enormous interest in changes to any of this legislation, certainly changes as dramatic as proposed by this amendment. This amendment almost completely rewrites the 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It changes its purpose, use of funds, and other aspects of the legislation. Last year, the administration, through the competitive grants process, substantially changed the focus and, indeed, the very nature of it by rewriting regulations. That was an unfortunate matter. Overnight, an act to expand the use of existing school facilities became an afterschool program--retracted it. 
   All these other things are just as valuable. Certainly I understand the desires of Senator BOXER to work on that bill. We will have plenty of opportunity. She will have all the opportunity she wants when the bill comes out of the committee later this year. 
   So, I could go on and on. But right now I again want to reiterate, in order to get this bill through we have been forced to go into this kind of amendment process, which some will say gives them the opportunity to do something constructive, knowing full well at the end of the day they on the other side of the aisle will not prevail because they do not have the votes. Fortunately, I believe my colleagues in the Senate, at least the majority of them, will say: Yes, let's use the orderly process, the one this institution was designed to utilize, in passing out legislation, passing out bills. And the process of offering amendments should be done first in the committee where they can have a good review after hearings and then secondly done on the floor. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

I put them on notice that if I do not hear from them within 10 minutes, we may end up drawing the session to a close. As far as the other side of the aisle, I also inform them. I believe we have notified the minority that if they have no further speakers, we would appreciate knowing that. If we hear from no one within 10 minutes, we will presume they have no further people to be heard and then yield the remainder of the time back so that tomorrow we can start on schedule. 
   I also notify Senators that the order of the amendments tomorrow will be the order that was originally delineated and not as they may have been presented, so that Senators will know exactly when their amendments will be coming before us.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will use a little of the morning business time myself to just bring everyone up to date as to where we are at this point. This concludes the debate time for today. Tomorrow there will be, I believe, 1 hour evenly divided for Members to talk on the amendment process. 
   The purpose of that time will be to try to make sure everybody understands the amendments, because we have a number of amendments. They seem low in number--there are about eight or nine amendments--but some of those are complicated by combinations of amendments. So I urge all of our Members to make sure that they understand the amendments. 
   Because this is an important piece of legislation, which I want to get through, and the leader does also, we will be using probably a tabling situation for many of the amendments. I want to explain why that is. That is because most of these amendments should be on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization which is being worked on at this time. That is a very important bill. It is a $15 billion bill. It has most of the Federal programs. And we will be looking at it very closely to determine whether there should be a paring down of programs, how effective the various agencies and departments have been, and we will be spending the time of deliberation to better utilize and to make sure we can maximize our improvement. 
   As I said earlier today, the evidence is very clear that we have made very little improvement in our schools over the last 15 years, although we have been trying. Thus, it is important we take a close look at the Department of Education to see that those funds are being well spent.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am sorry to interrupt, but it is our time. 
   Today marks the fifth day of discussion by the Senate on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. We have spent time discussing several education issues that are important to debate, but do not necessarily pertain to the underlying bill. 
   The Education Flexibility Partnership Act, which has overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle--all the Governors in the Nation; the President supports it; everybody supports it--what is it? The Secretary of Education gives a 
   State some authority to determine whether some schools may be granted waivers pertaining to certain requirements for the purpose of enhancing services to students through flexibility and real accountability. 
   It is important to note that States cannot waive any requirements pertaining to health and safety, civil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of service, equitable participation of students and professional staff in private schools, parental participation and involvement, and the distribution of funds to State or local agencies. 
   Currently, 12 States have ed flexibility authority. Through Ed-Flex, these 12 States have been better able to coordinate programs which create a seamless education delivery system that benefits both teachers and students. 
   During the first day of debate, I offered a managers' package which contained various accountability provisions which we worked out through a bipartisan agreement. Those provisions and additional accountability provisions which were added last Thursday  will improve school and student performance, which should be the mission of every education initiative. I will remind my colleagues that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is up for review this year. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the foundation for most of the Federal programs that assist students and teachers in our elementary and secondary schools, and it accounts for $15 billion in Federal spending, excluding IDEA--that is, special ed money and vocational education. 
   We are currently engaged in the hearing process. One of the first hearings we held regarding this legislation looked at various education proposals offered by Members of this body. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues as we draft the first Elementary and Secondary Education Act of the 21st century. We only do that once every 5 years. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the most important education legislation we will consider this year. There are a number of good ideas being discussed which deserve a thorough review. That is what these amendments are about. They deserve a thorough review before we leap off prematurely, ahead of the committee process, to put the President's programs, which have not been reviewed, in place without thorough hearing and understanding. 
   It is for this reason that we should not be debating many of the amendments that have arisen in the Ed-Flex debate. We should be debating these proposals in conjunction with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Last year, as I pointed out earlier, we passed 10 education bills, all out of the committee, by either unanimous or close to unanimous votes, because we worked in committee to work the matters out, like we should, and not to do it on the floor before any hearing. 
   I urge my colleagues not to short circuit the process of offering major elementary and secondary education initiatives on Ed-Flex. The Education Flexibility Partnership Act is not designed to be the sole response by the Federal Government to improving school and student performance. However, Ed-Flex does give States the ability to augment education services for students and teachers. 
   I also point out that the amendment that I have is perfectly consistent with this policy. What it says is, okay, we appropriated last year $1.2 billion for a program--and this was decided in the back halls of the Capitol somewhere; I was not present--that we should take the President's 100,000 teachers, put the first year in effect. We are saying, wait a minute, we haven't had any review of that, but we will do this. We will let the local governments for this year decide whether they would prefer to have it, not knowing what is going to happen in the future, until we work it out in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   We would like to give them the flexibility at the local level to determine as to whether or not they would prefer this year to use that money to augment their special education funds or whether they want to start off on a course, which may not be followed, to start hiring new teachers. I point out, there are a lot of questions about a bill which gets you on the route to new teachers. If you have 100,000 new teachers, you need 100,000 new rooms. If you have 100,000 new teachers and you do not know where the funds are going to come from in the future, how are you going to pay for it? These are all important questions to be answered when that bill gets into final shape, if it does get into final shape. 
   Mr. President, I hope that we can make progress. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle, we are at a point where we can either vote this out and get on with other business or we can just spend the rest of the year in this kind of a debate and inability to act together. 
   I am proud of our committee. We have worked so many things out in a bipartisan manner. And to think that we could get stalled and find ourselves without the ability to pass a simple bill which merely gives flexibility to the States--I do not understand how we could go forward with that kind of process. We have important bills coming up. We have health care bills, we have all sorts of bills out of my committee, extremely important bills, and we are getting off to a rough start here by the inflexibility of the minority.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are again back with the Ed-Flex bill, which is a bill, as everybody knows, that would merely attempt to make it easier for States to be able to utilize regulations to their advantage by being able to waive them for communities or school systems within their jurisdiction. This has been used successfully by 12 States now--6 originally, and then another 6. It has demonstrated that there are problems in the present system which make it impossible to take care of very, very minute differences in schools in order to get them to be able to have the flexibility for the utilization of the title I funds. 
   We are also facing, apparently, a filibuster. Therefore, we will have a cloture vote at 5 o'clock this afternoon. It is my hope that we can proceed perhaps on to another amendment, and then we will be able to make some progress on this bill. 
   This is our fourth day on the Ed-Flex bill. This bill, which is supported by the administration and all 50 Governors, has broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and in the House. I urged my colleagues last week to limit their amendments to the bill before us. As we have shown, we are perfectly willing to work with the limited issues raised by the Ed-Flex bill. 
   As my colleagues know, later this year we will be considering the statute that governs the K-through-12 educational programs, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and that is where the debate on these larger questions should take place. I say this not because I am a stickler for procedure, but because the whole point behind the committee system is so that complicated issues can be debated and examined in detail. That is not possible on the floor of the Senate. This doesn't happen in every instance, and I have been on both sides of the question, but I cannot recall when we have been in a similar situation where one side is trying to load up a small, noncontroversial proposal when the logical vehicle for the debate and consideration of these larger questions is only a few months away. 
   We have never really considered these issues in committee. To be fair, Senator MURRAY offered her class size amendment to the Ed-Flex bill last year. But Republicans felt then, as we feel now, that this issue should be considered as part of the ESEA reauthorization. The amendment was not adopted. 
   Reducing class size in our Nation's schools is a fine idea. Common sense tells us that a smaller class allows a teacher to spend more one-on-one time with each student. According to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, common sense has been backed by data that also reinforces that small class size is correlated to higher student achievement. 
   There is something else that most of the data says. It says that the quality of the teacher leading that classroom makes a significant difference. Contrary to statements made on the floor last week, the class size proposal of my colleague from Washington does little or nothing toward improving teacher quality. Funds allocated for professional development are limited to 15 percent in the first 3 years it is authorized. Worse yet, the legislation prohibits funds from being used to enhance teacher quality in the last 2 authorized years. What kind of sense does that make? 
   Only after class size is reduced to an average number of 18 students does a school district have the flexibility to use those funds to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom. Proponents point to studies which show that smaller classes make a difference and improve academic achievement. I argue that class size is less important than having a quality teacher. That, to me, is common sense. 
   As I mentioned, this common sense idea can also be backed with hard data. Ronald Fergeson, in an article entitled ``New Evidence on How and Why Money Matters,'' notes:  
   What the evidence here suggests more strongly is that teacher quality matters and should be a major focus of efforts to upgrade the quality of schooling. Skilled teachers are the most critical of all schooling input.  
   Bill Sanders, a statistician at the University of Tennessee, stated in a 1997 article in ``The Tennessean'':  
   Teacher effectiveness is the single largest factor affecting the academic growth of students. Poor teachers hold students back,  while strong teachers can push students ahead by nearly a grade. When compared to class size, expenditures, and so forth, they all fail in comparison. The residual effects of teachers can linger at least three years, regardless of the performance of subsequent teachers.  
   The report ``Doing What Matters Most; Investing in Quality Teaching'' states that:  
   Studies discover again and again that teacher expertise is one of the most important factors in determining student achievement, followed by smaller, but generally positive influences of smaller schools and small class size.  
   Eric A. Hanushek, a researcher from the University of Rochester, concludes:  
   All things being equal, small classes are preferable to larger ones because teachers can give students more individual attention. However, all things are seldom equal, and other factors, such as the quality of the teacher, have a much more decisive impact on student achievement. Moreover, the huge expense of class-size reduction may impede the ability of schools to make other important investments in quality.  
   In fact, in nearly all the studies that I looked at on the subject mentioned quality and class size together. While my colleagues say that the class size reduction proposal has quality components, this program actually prohibits funds from being used for improving teaching in the outyears. 
   This legislation is seriously flawed. It puts quantity over quality. In my opinion, it is not a well-thought-out proposal, and, not surprisingly, it is becoming apparent that it will not work very well in rural America. We have not held one hearing on it. We have not heard from anyone at the local level as to whether this program will meet the real needs that they have in their communities. 
   And we have not heard where these tens of thousands of well-qualified teachers will come from. 
   Where is the emphasis on teacher quality in this proposal? My colleagues keep telling me there is an emphasis on quality, but nowhere in this proposal do I see a real commitment to professional development. 
   This amendment would have us agree that a teacher's being ``certified'' is synonymous with ``high quality.'' Does ``certified'' equal ``high quality''? 
   Not necessarily. Currently 91 percent of teachers are ``certified'' in their main field of teaching assignment. Are we all comfortable saying that 91 percent of our nation's teachers are highly qualified? There is a great deal of debate on that issue. 
   Furthermore, State certification requirements, in many instances, are lacking. Title II of the Higher Education Act we adopted last year recognized that fact and actually encourages States to improve certification standards. Sadly, by today's measure, certification is not a ``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.'' 
   And as I mentioned before, the proposal actually prohibits the use of funds for professional development for teachers in 2004 and 20005 unless the local educational agency has reduced its average class size to 18. 
   We have an opportunity to address these problems and consider this legislation in a timely yet thoughtful manner during consideration of the Elementary Secondary Education Act Reauthorization. 
    Let's not rush ahead. Let's take some time to consider what will really make a positive difference for our nation's students. 
   The class size initiative is built on a foundation of sand. It came about because President Clinton insisted that it be part of the omnibus appropriations bill last October. It was drafted in a back room by a few people with virtually no input from anyone else. 
   This happens from time to time, and it doesn't really bother me. But I think it is a bit of a stretch to characterize this process as a ``bipartisan agreement'' that the Senate is obliged to extend. As I've said, I don't think we should be getting into these issues on the ed flex bill. 
   But if the ed flex bill is going to spill over in to broader issues, I think we should perhaps revisit whether this attempt to hire one teacher in a hundred or more is the best use of federal funds. 
   At this point, I think the answer is ``no.'' Education policy must be built on consensus, not focus groups. I have no doubt but that this class size initiative is politically appealing, and the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Committee has already made clear that he wants to use it against those of us who might be running for reelection next year. 
   But that is exactly my point. As soon as educational policy is driven by the electoral needs of one party or another, we have undermined it. It will change every two years based on the outcome of the elections. And state and local governments, which already chafe at the restrictions that accompany the 7 percent of funds derived from the federal government, will become even more frustrated. 
   My Democratic colleagues argue that school districts need certainty in planning for the future. Yet the source of the uncertainty is their own failure to build consensus for this proposal. You can, and we all do, force things through in the waning hours of a Congress. But you cannot expect that this process transforms a weak idea into a strong one. 
   I do not want to paint too bleak a picture. We do have plenty of consensus in education policy. In the last Congress we passed an amazing number of major pieces of education legislation by unanimous or nearly unanimous votes. And none of this would have been possible without support from our Democratic colleagues. 
   I do not think there is any greater consensus than on the subject of the federal role in helping schools educate the disabled. 
   The first hearing we held and the first bill we passed were on Individuals with Disabilities Act. I don't think there is any more important federal role than to meet the basic commitment which we made nearly 25 years ago. 
   The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held a hearing last month on education budget proposals that drove home this point. 
   Representative Albert Perry from the Vermont State Legislature and Allen Gilbert, a school board member from Worcester, Vermont, told us unequivocally that the single most important thing we could do to help local school districts was to fulfill our pledge to fully fund IDEA. 
   Fulfilling an old promise is not as exciting as raising new expectations with new programs. We won't get much press coverage for simply doing the right thing. 
   But if we fulfill our obligation to fund IDEA, state and local agencies will be able to target their own resources toward their own very real needs. 
   For some districts this may mean school construction or class-size reduction. In other districts the most pressing needs may include teacher training or music and art education. 
   If we decide to use this forum to discuss budget priorities, we should all come together and agree that no new and untested elementary and secondary education programs should be funded until we fulfill our basic commitment to programs--like IDEA--that are tried and proven. 
   The real issue today is not whether the legislation before us addresses all of the problems that plague our education system. 
   There are issues which are important to me--for example, in the areas of professional development--which I have not addressed on this bill because I believed that it was more appropriate that these issues should be addressed in the context of the reauthorization of ESEA. 
   My own view is that we should have a longer school year, that children lose too much ground over the summer months. But is this area ripe for federal involvement? I don't know. 
   The real issue we are considering today is simple. Are we going to give state and local communities the flexibility they have requested to improve the performance of their own students? 
   I want to emphasize this point. They have not requested this flexibility solely to make their lives simpler or as a way to avoid delivering important services. The accountability requirements that are contained within this bill and that have been implemented in current Ed-Flex states like Texas and Vermont make it clear that this is not their goal. 
   And we would not expect this to be their goal. I have traveled across the State of Vermont meeting with students, parents, and educators. I can tell you that no one cares more about the  educational achievement of students than do their own parents, teachers and community leaders. 
   Let us keep ourselves focused on this simple but important task. We must fulfill the commitment we made more than 25 years ago and we must move to quickly pass this important legislation. 
   In order to do so, I am offering an amendment proposing that all funds made available in Fiscal Year 1999 for class-size reduction will be used instead for part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). 
   I believe it is important that we honor past commitments before taking on new obligations--particularly those as expensive, untested, and fractious as the class-size reduction initiative. We have never come close to providing local school districts with the level of IDEA assistance promised to them in 1975. 
   Yet, rather that meeting this long-standing commitment, we are instead encouraging them to take on additional obligations in order to reduce class size. These are obligations for which States and localities will be solely responsible once Federal assistance for class-size reduction efforts disappears. 
   It is not too late to correct this mistake. No funds are scheduled to be distributed until July. Most school districts have not yet received guidance on the class-size reduction program, as the guidance was not issued until this past weekend. 
   Perhaps the situation will change now that guidance is available, but school officials in Vermont have been telling me that they have been unable to get answers to even relatively simple questions about the program. 
   Supporting programs for students with disabilities is a far better use of the $1.2 billion provided in fiscal year 1999 than is starting up an untested teacher hiring program which was written in about a day-and-a-half in the closing days of the 105th Congress as part of an appropriations bill. 
   In fact, several school districts may be faced with entirely unforeseen increases in their IDEA funding needs because of last week's Supreme Court decision. Freeing up these funds for IDEA, a program which is in place and the contours of which are well known, is a better use of the appropriations scheduled to be distributed this coming July. 
   Mr. President, I see the Senator from Washington. I believe she is ready and desires to introduce her amendment.

<DOCNO>106-jeffords-vt-11-19990308</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in hopes that we can, again, emphasize what the proper procedure is for this bill--to try to see if we can get it through with the least possible delay. At the same time, since there seems to be a desire to utilize the amendment process, we can try to rectify what was an attempted procedure on an appropriations bill at the end of the last session, to get to the question of funds for schools. 
   We believe very strongly, as we have emphasized over and over again, that the best way to help the schools out, with the money that was appropriated at that time, is to have that money flow to the schools to assist in taking care of children with disabilities. There is no question in the mind of anybody outside of Washington that the best way to help local communities is to get them out from under the problems that were put on them by the Federal Government when it promised to fund 40 percent of special education and only funded it at around 10 percent. That has put huge stress on the local communities, and this stress has just been made even worse by the recent Supreme Court decision which has emphasized, that it is the school's responsibility to have health care available to a child in order for the child to get what is promised under the Constitution, an appropriate education which is free. And ``free'' is the key word here with respect to the recent Supreme Court decision. 
   Obviously, if a child cannot concentrate or be effective, as far as the learning process goes, without some help from medication or a nurse, then, without that help, that free and appropriate education is not being provided. 
   Just to emphasize again where we are, this is the time for us to be helping the States out, to increase their flexibility and their ability to use title I funds in particular. It is not a time to try to place upon them new restrictions or to utilize the funds for less desirable programs than those which are available now, and encumber them with only being able to do it through the decrease in class size, as in the amendment as passed out of the Congress last year. 
   So I am hopeful we can take the time now to analyze where we ought to be going in education. I already discussed  that to a substantial extent previously, but would like to point out again, as we go forward trying to improve the education of this Nation, this can only be done by the Federal Government and the local communities and the States all working together to provide the kind of educational changes which will maximize the ability of our children to learn. Certainly all the Governors in the country have agreed that the best way to do that is to free the communities from the huge burden we placed upon them back in 1975. Although we made a commitment to take care of 40 percent of that, as has been explained on the floor, we are well lacking that. We have been showing a chart to you for some time which dramatically emphasizes that huge shortfall. 
   I am hopeful as we go forward today, we will continue to try to find a way to get this bill passed. It is unfortunate it is being objected to for reasons which really are not relevant. It is very important, as we progress towards the end of this year, that we not keep stalling and preventing action that would result in benefiting communities, and stop encumbering ourselves with legislation which will accomplish what is not the highest priority. Depending upon where you are, we would accomplish relatively low priorities. The need for flexibility is immediate in order to help students and teachers, and in order to allow the local communities to be free to provide the education which would be much more beneficial than what could be achieved with the restrictions they currently face.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, let me give Members a little bit of information on where we are. We are now on debate for cloture. We are trying to get this bill--which is very small in the sense of the number of words--but would be very helpful to the Governors with respect to trying to utilize their title I funds in a better way. The States would be able to assist the maximum number of children in need of help. The 50 Governors support it as it will help them have more flexibility. It does no damage to anyone and would be helpful to many. According to the latest estimates for the Department of Education, this school year there are 6.1 million schoolchildren. 
   We are also looking at an alternative--if you continue to refuse to let the bill go out in order to help the Governors to help the children, we have offered, and will continue to offer, second-degree amendments. These amendments will not run into the problem of being under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act jurisdiction of the committee, where we are now holding hearings, as the other amendments have. These amendments will say that the highest priority now and the best thing to do now, would be to take the funds appropriated last year or authorized last year and to have those instead utilized to reduce the burden on our local schools caused by the failure of the Federal Government to live up to their promise to provide 40 percent of the funding for children with disabilities. We believe that is, by far, the better option and would not in any way impair our ability to continue to move forward on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   However, and it is unfortunate, the minority believes they would rather try to have the President's program. There are many parts of the President's program that I don't have a problem with. To put these proposals up at this time, however, without going through the normal process of debate, analysis, and hearings that normally go on in the committee process, is irresponsible. We must be able to determine whether the programs work, how best to put them in, what kind of law change would be needed--all those things are normally handled during the committee process. We have already had several hearings and we will have many more hearings on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am anxious to move forward now and continue with those hearings, and at the same time give the Governors maximum flexibility in their ability to be able to utilize funds presently appropriated, especially under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Twelve States have demonstrated how you can utilize this to enhance the education of your children. Texas and Vermont have had a special success in utilizing these flexibilities, but there are now 38 other States that would like to have the same benefits. Why we would want to stall and delay that time, I am not sure, but that is the situation we are in right now. 
   We, therefore, are going to have 2 hours of debate from now until 5 o'clock on the motion to invoke cloture so that we can proceed to this very important but relatively simple bill. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I just want to remark very briefly. All we have done--and I do not understand why my good friend from Minnesota cannot agree with it--is to give the Senate a choice. Do you want to send it for special ed, where it is desperately needed, or do you want to see whether the States would prefer to have it to put more teachers in place? It is as simple as that. We are not getting an opportunity to vote on our amendment either. 
   Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee----

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, let me comment on the remarks of the Senator from Washington. 
   First of all, this bill is a very simple bill to help the Governors have flexibility--the States to have flexibility to maximize the utilization of title I funds, in particular. I don't think anybody disagrees with it. 
   What I have set out as a policy for me, working with the leader, is that this bill ought not to be encumbered by matters which are under the jurisdiction of the committee which should be considered separately and after due hearing and after all of the elements of the legislation are considered. The amendment of the Senator from Washington really shortcuts that. 
   Now, I agree that is an existing piece of legislation which needs some improvement. However, it does not fall out from the jurisdiction of the committee. On the other hand, with an appropriate amendment, I will endorse it. So I don't understand the concern of my partners on the other side of the aisle. 
   We have an offer which will be before the Senate, and this side can endorse her amendment with the modification that is in that amendment. What that modification does is say, all right, let's reach a compromise here. The compromise would be, very simply, let the local governments decide whether they want to use the money which was appropriated but not quite available; they should have the local option. If they want to spend it on more teachers, additional teachers, they should have that option. If they want to spend it on IDEA, which I think most of the communities would do, they would have that option. 
   I don't see why you can say that we are placing ourselves in a position of preventing the amendment from going forward. I don't want to do that. 
   Let's also take a look at the problems of this committee. This committee has huge jurisdiction. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act spends about $15 billion, and amendments that have been addressing this bill would bypass the committee's ability to review all of these programs, which we should do. We haven't done so for 5 years, and the education of this country is suffering badly from not being able to maximize the opportunities for our young people. 
   We have already had several hearings. We will have more hearings on it, and in the orderly process we ought to take those amendments up and vote on them at that time, but not now when we are just starting the legislative session. 
   We will have an opportunity for the Senate to vote on an excellent amendment to the amendment of the Senator from Washington and give this body an opportunity to express itself. It will be, apparently, filibustered. I don't understand why or how anybody could filibuster an option for the local communities to decide whether they want to use it for new teachers or for special education.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that my colleague Senator BAUCUS and I are re-introducing titled the, ``Post Office Community Partnership Act of 1999.'' 
   Aside from a few technical changes, the bill is similar to the one we introduced in the 105th Congress that was supported by so many of our colleagues in a 76-21 vote last July. Unfortunately our postal language was dropped from the underlying bill during conference with the House. However, I am hopeful that this year our bill will become law. I should add that this year we have coordinated our efforts with Representative BLUMENAUER of Oregon and an identical companion bill is being put forward in both the Senate and the House. 
   Mr. President, I live in a small town in Vermont. I understand the importance downtowns and village centers play in the identity and longevity of communities. Downtowns are the social and economic hearts of small communities. They are where neighbors catch up on the news, shop, worship, and celebrate national holidays. 
   Our bill will enable the residents of small villages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides that their local post office will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. Local post offices are important tenants in any vibrant downtown. A recent article in USA Today cited a 1993 study that found that 80 percent of people who shopped downtown planned their visit around a visit to the post office. 
   There is much talk in the news today about revitalizing our downtowns and encouraging smart growth. I say to my colleagues, if you want to encourage smart growth, let's start by doing what we can to keep federal facilities such as post offices in downtowns. 
   Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is necessary. A story from my home state of Vermont will answer that question. 
   A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, Vermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the small village center for a new building outside of town. By the time the community was aware of the relocation, plans were so far along--the new building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the post office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully investigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in contrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we certainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more to get our mail.'' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented that as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of community are woven and reinforced. ``It may be intangible, but its real, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation of the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like Perkinsville.'' 
   In other Vermont towns such as Springfield, Arlington, and St. Albans, the threat of our legislation has encouraged the Postal Service to work more closely with these communities as plans are developed to expand their local post offices. Our bill would codify the process that communities should go through and would avoid a one-size fits all approach to community needs. 
   Mr. President, post office closings and relocations are occurring all across the country and especially in small and rural communities. My colleagues will quickly discover similar examples in their own states where the removal of the post office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown area, deprived citizens without cars of access, and contributed to sprawl. 
   The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in a community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction of a post office. This bill does not give the citizenry the ultimate veto power over a relocation, closing, consolidation, or construction. Instead, the bill sets up a process that makes sure community voices and concerns are heard and taken into account by the Postal Service. 
   Additionally, this bill will require the Postal Service to abide by local zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal buildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the ability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has led to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety standards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such as storm water management.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, climate change poses potential real threats to Vermont, the Nation, and the World. While we cannot yet predict the exact timing, magnitude, or nature of these threats, we must not let our uncertainty lead to inaction. 
   Preventing climate change is a daunting challenge. It will not be solved by a single bill or a single action. As we do not know the extent of the threat, we also do not know the extent of the solution. But we cannot let our lack of knowledge lead to lack of action. We must start today. Our first steps will be hesitant and imperfect, but they will be a beginning. 
   Today I am joining Senator CHAFEE, Senator MACK, Senator LIEBERMAN, and a host of others in cosponsoring the Credit for Early Action Act in the U.S. Senate. 
   Credit for Early Action gives incentives to American businesses to voluntarily reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. Properly constructed, Credit for Early Action will increase energy efficiency, promote renewable energy, provide cleaner air, and help reduce the threat of possible global climatic disruptions. It will help industry plan for the future and save money on energy. It rewards companies for doing the right thing--conserving energy and promoting renewable energy. Without Credit for Early Action, industries which do the right thing run the risk of being penalized for having done so. We introduce this bill as a signal to industry, you will not be penalized for increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy, you will be rewarded. 
   In writing this bill, Senators CHAFEE, MACK, and LIEBERMAN have done an excellent job with a difficult subject. I am cosponsoring the Credit for Early Action legislation as an endorsement for taking a first step in the right direction. I will be working with my colleagues throughout this Congress to strengthen this legislation to ensure that it strongly addresses the challenges that lie ahead. The bill must be changed to guarantee that our emissions will decrease to acceptable levels, and guarantee that credits will be given out equitably. These modifications can be summarized in a single sentence: credits awarded must be proportional to benefits gained. This goal can be achieved through two additions: a rate-based performance standard and a cap on total emissions credits. 
   The rate-based performance standard is the most important item. A rate-based standard gives credits to those companies which are the most efficient in their class--not those that are the biggest and dirtiest to begin with. Companies are rewarded for producing the most product for the least amount of emissions. Small and growing companies would have the same opportunities to earn credits as large companies. This system would create a just and equitable means of awarding emissions credits to companies which voluntarily increase their energy efficiency and renewable energy use. 
   The second item is an adjustable annual cap on total emissions credits. An adjustable annual cap allows Congress to weigh the number of credits given out against the actual reduction in total emissions. Since the ultimate goal is to reduce U.S. emissions, this provision would allow a means to ensure that we do not give all of our credits away without ensuring that our emissions levels are actually decreasing. 
   With these two additions, Credit for Early Action will bring great rewards to our country, our economy, and our environment. It will save money, give industry the certainty to plan for the future, and promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, all while reducing our risk from climate change. This legislation sends the right message: companies will be rewarded for doing the right thing--increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy use.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to follow up by saying I think it's important that all of my colleagues understand that, hopefully, what will happen tomorrow is we will be able to make some progress. I hope that my colleagues will read the amendment that we have offered and that we will hopefully have action tomorrow, which will give an opportunity for the schools themselves to make the choice as to whether or not they desire to either spend the money on new teachers or to spend it on special education. 
   It is a simple amendment, and I hope that the members will give it some consideration. We desire to move the process along. It is hard for me to understand how anyone could disagree with giving the local schools that option. The President had this bill put in and it had no hearings. It was put in in the final moments of the last session. I am sure that if we had an opportunity, we might have been able to get this amendment on. This will move the process along. 
   I point again to the chart behind me, which indicates that what we are trying to do is to relieve the incredible pressure that is placed on our local governments by having to fund special education themselves in the States--primarily all of it. We promised to fund 40 percent of it back in 1975 and 1976. We are now at around 11 percent. If we were to fully fund it, it would do more to allow the local communities and the States to be able to meet the educational needs of their people than any other act of this Congress. That is what we are pushing for. I think it is a reasonable thing to do. It would have no impact, of course, on the Elementary and Secondary Education reauthorization, except to give a tremendous opportunity for local governments to be freed up to work, and we could design programs to go along with those options. 
   With that, I hope tomorrow we will be able to move matters along with this amendment, which I think everybody ought to find desirable. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week the Senate has been debating S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. During the debate, we have heard various interpretations of Ed-Flex. I want to take a moment to remind my colleagues about the idea behind Ed-Flex. 
   The Department of Education, under the leadership of Secretary Riley, has stated that Ed-Flex authority will help States in ``removing potential regulatory barriers to the successful implementation of comprehensive school reform'' efforts. 
   Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives a State some authority to grant waivers to a State, giving each State the ability to make decisions about whether some school districts may be granted waivers pertaining to certain Federal requirements. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues that States cannot waive any Federal regulatory or statutory requirements relating to health and safety, civil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, equitable participation of students and professional  staff in private schools, parental participation and involvement, and distribution of funds to State or local educational agencies. It is very limited, but very helpful. 
   I believe this week, working in a bipartisan fashion, we strengthen the accountability aspects of the Ed-Flex bill even beyond that of the bill that was passed out of committee last year by a vote of 17-1. The accountability features of the bill are designed to improve school and student performance, which should be the mission of every education initiative. 
   For a moment it appears that the debate on this bill has become mired in a debate over other education proposals not related to education flexibility but related to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the foundation for most Federal programs designed to assist students and teachers in our elementary and secondary schools. This year, this legislation is up for review. 
   As we embark on a new century, it is the perfect opportunity for us to examine the Federal role in our educational delivery system. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--the HELP Committee--is currently engaged in the hearing process and has been since last December. 
   Through the hearing process, we are evaluating currently authorized programs and exploring new ideas. The first hearing the committee held this year in regard to education examined various initiatives that have been introduced by Members of this body. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the most important education legislation we will consider this year, and probably the most important one we have. There are a lot of good ideas that are being discussed in and out of this Chamber that deserve a thorough review. 
   It is for this reason that we should not be debating these issues as amendments to the Ed-Flex bill but should be debating these proposals in the context of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, so that they can receive adequate attention in determining their merits. 
   For this fiscal year, the Federal Government is currently spending approximately $15 billion on programs related to elementary and secondary education. This figure excludes special education and vocational education. 
   How are these dollars being spent? Who is being served? Is student performance improving? What types of professional development programs are helpful to our classroom teachers? Are those teacher training activities translated into better teaching methods? What are the proper roles for the various levels of government? These are questions that must be, and will be, addressed in the coming months during the Elementary and Secondary Education reauthorization. 
   I urge my colleagues to work with me and the other members in the committee in finding the answers to these questions through the reauthorization process. Do not attempt to short circuit the process by offering those proposals to the Ed-Flex bill. 
   The Education Flexibility Partnership Act is not meant to serve as the sole solution to improving school and student performance. However, it does serve as a mechanism that will give States the ability to enhance services to students through flexibility with real accountability. I urge my colleagues to support immediate passage of S. 280. 
   Now, we have had, over the past few days, the desire--and I can understand that desire--to move ahead of the schedule of hearings and thorough review of the present Federal programs, 
   to introduce the programs basically that have been recommended by the President for the purposes of trying to add them to this Ed-Flex bill way ahead of when they should be offered after a thorough examination and review of the problems we are facing as well as what the recommended programs would do to solve those problems. 
   It is the unenviable position I am placed in of trying to pass a bill called the Ed-Flex bill which will immediately give help to the States in better utilizing those resources that are already available and not to encumber it in the process by amending and trying to create programs which will hold up the passage of this bill not only here in the Senate but through the Government in the legislative process. So I don't know why we should or would like to do that. 
   I also point out where we are and will take a few minutes just to point out where we are presently with respect to our attempts and ability to be able to try to improve the educational process. 
   Back in 1983 during the Reagan years, Secretary Bell held a Senate hearing on the status of education in the United States. As a result of that, a report, ``A Nation at Risk,'' was handed down in 1983 and, with words which are incredibly, I would say, looking towards the future in examining our educational system, said, ``If a foreign nation had imposed upon this Nation our educational system we would have considered it an act of war.'' Those were incredibly strong words. We didn't fully understand what they meant for years. 
   In 1988, the Governors met in Virginia, in Williamsburg, and they agreed, after examining where we were not within ourselves, the tendency we have in this country is to try to compare ourselves among ourselves. In Vermont we say, ``Oh, my gosh, we are doing better than most of the other States. We must be in good shape. We don't have to do anything.'' But it did prevail throughout Vermont and the country for some time. But gradually we recognized the problems. 
   One of the most, I think, poignant demonstrations of that problem was by the Motorola company when they had a real problem with the quality of their production in this country. They found that the Japanese were moving ahead of them in the area the United States should have been the leader in--cell phones. The president of Motorola at that time brought his leaders together, the board of directors, and said, ``What do we do?'' The recommendation was, first of all, we ought to find out what our problem is in education, and secondly--I think the tone of it was--we ought to look elsewhere, to other countries, to find the educated population that we need in order to produce in competition with the Japanese. 
   The CEO did not like the thought or the idea of sending our jobs overseas because they were better educated. So he asked to have an examination of his own employees to see what could be done in order for them to produce the quality that was necessary. The results were amazing. They did not have the capacity in math. But that wasn't the basic problem. They found out--this is amazing in a corporation like Motorola--that the people who were given the math problems couldn't understand the math problems because they couldn't read. Wow. That sent a shudder through them. But the CEO went on, saying, ``I don't care. We can do it.'' 
   So they set up remedial education programs in reading so they could get their employees up to skills in reading 
   sufficiently to be able to understand the math problems. Then they had the training in math. Although the staff still recommended that they ought to send the jobs overseas to Malaysia, the CEO said, ``We will do it here.'' 
   It turned out that with the proper remedial training and upgrading of math, they not only were able to produce on a par with the Japanese but were also superior to them. Therefore, they were able, after considerable problems getting into the Japanese market, to outperform the Japanese and kept the jobs at home. 
   In 1988 it was established that we had a problem by the Governors. But it took until 1994 before the Congress reacted and passed what is referred to as the ``Goals 2000'' bill. We took a look. Here it is now, 15 years after the ``Nation At Risk'' report and a goals panel which Senator BINGAMAN and I sat on with respect to the Senate, and we found, to our alarm, that we had no measurable improvement in the 15 years since the Nation was put on notice we had to improve--no measurable improvement, except our children were coming to school healthier. In other words, when they reached the sixth grade, they were healthier than they were 15 years ago. That still is not a very successful thing. 
   Then the thing we learned this last time, which was even more amazing, was that the data we were using to determine whether or not our young people were improving was 1994 data. We did not even have the capacity in this  Nation, after 15 years, to find out where we were. This is very extreme and a key element of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as to why we could not as of yet find out in an expeditious way where our young people stand as well on the kind of standard we need to be competitive internationally.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. In answer, I say that the Senator is right, absolutely right. What we need to do is to get this country in a position where the Governors have the flexibility to assist us as we move forward. 
   I would point out that what we have done also as a fallback in that sense is, with second-degree amendments, to point out that the best thing we can do right now for the Governors and the Nation is to fully fund IDEA, which is the largest expense that local schools have in doing what is constitutionally required; that is, to provide a child with an appropriate and free education. 
   A recent Supreme Court decision just the other day points out how important that is now, where, under the 1988 Americans with Disabilities Act, the schools are now responsible to ensure that health care, which is necessary in order to allow the child to be able to obtain the maximum they can, is to be paid for by local governments. 
   Now, we promised to pay 40 percent of that bill when it was passed. I was on the committee, so I feel a little personally responsible. We said we would pay 40 percent. If you look at the chart behind me here, you can see that we are far from doing that. The total cost now--and that is going to go up significantly with the Supreme Court decision--is $40.5 billion a year. The Federal Government, in order to take up its share, which would obviously be around $10 billion--well over $10 billion, right. But we are far from that. Right now we are still $11 billion short

   Mr. JEFFORDS. That is absolutely correct. I praise the Senator for raising that issue and for the introduction on the Ed-Flex bill, because that is a no-cost measure. In fact, it is a ``no-brainer'' in the sense of passage. It ought to be passed. All it does is give the States flexibility to maximize the utilization of Federal funds. That should be on the books before we add any new programs and have the Governors have the maximum flexibility. 
   Mr. President, I want to also alert people about the program for this morning. We have promised that we will have a vote before 10:30 in order to accommodate several Senators. So I want to continue to expand on where we should be going right now. I am hopeful that we can be finished with another amendment in the next 20 minutes so we can call the vote before 10:30 to accommodate those Senators. I again urge that the only amendments I will consider on this bill with respect to education will be those that will not encumber this bill with programs which should appropriately be on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we will be discussing, and on which we are already holding hearings. We may accommodate amendments, but not those that will interfere with an orderly process of this legislation going forward, unencumbered, on bills that should be appropriately brought before the committee with respect to education and other matters.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me explain the position I have taken. My concern is getting amendments now which should be on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which is presently under consideration by the committee, if we are to start passing programs out here that should be more properly considered in committee as to how to allocate expenditure of funds and matters like that. 
   I understand that the pending amendment--we all know in the exigencies of time, and sometimes in order to get a message through, a situation arises where it is necessary, in a sense, to add an amendment that is really nongermane in order to send a message downtown. That is the understanding, and I think clear from the vote, that the Members want to send a message downtown that the process toward getting involved in the privacy of individuals' banking is not one which is acceptable to the Senate. 
   I suspect it will disappear into the great unknown at some point, but my main concern is to make sure that the committee, which is addressing the serious problems we have in education in this country, does it in an orderly process. We do recognize that the funds which local communities would like to have in order to meet the demands of some of the restrictions and regulations put on them are needed to replace the funds which should have been coming from the Federal Government with respect to IDEA or with respect to what is more commonly referred to as ``special education.'' We were committed to 40 percent, and we are only sending less than a quarter of what we are committed to. 
   So I will do all I can to make sure that anything which is possible to enhance the local communities, as well as bring us closer to meeting the commitment we have to 40 percent of the cost of special education, is considered. But I am not going to allow amendments, or do my best not to allow amendments, to this bill which was meant to be expedited to assist the local communities to have an opportunity to be more flexible in meeting the needs, as they see them, under the restricted resources they have by virtue of the fact that we have not fully funded our commitment under special  education. I intend to do that, to try to see how we can ensure that they get the resources to which they are entitled.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I do not believe he has spoken out on that. He is supportive of our efforts to try to improve the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I would say that he would not be unduly concerned if the President's program got attached to this amendment, obviously. He is the Secretary, he supports the President's programs, and they would like to get them implemented any way possible. 
   On the other hand, I doubt very seriously if he would take a position adverse to knowing what we were doing when we put together the bill, which is the one which will have more impact upon elementary and secondary education in this country than any other Federal act--that it is done well, that it proceeds with due care, and that we examine the present situation to see how things can be improved. 
   Right now we are spending somewhere close to $15 billion on primary and secondary education. And, as I stated earlier, there is no demonstration that we have had any improvement since the 1983 acknowledgement that this country had a serious problem in education. So I think it is incumbent upon us to try to look at why, after spending all those billions of dollars over those years, things have not improved since we understood we had a serious problem back in 1983. To just continue spending the money we are spending the way we are now, without looking at why it has had no measured improvement--which is an important part of the process--and to go ahead and just pass new programs without fully taking those matters into consideration, in my mind, would be irresponsible.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator knows as well as I know that in the final hours of any legislative session things happen in the exigencies of trying to get something together where people are dealing with the issues and probably are not fully aware of the implications of what they do. And that is what happened here. 
   These matters, through the pressure of the administration wanting to get something they had not been able to get through the normal legislative process, were able to get on the bill, which was that bill that was 40 inches high. Nobody knew what was in it until it got read. And the reason we are here with Senator MURRAY is there were some problems in the way that bill was thrown together that need to be attended to. And I understand that. It may be helpful in the amendment process that we get into next week with amendments. We might be able to make that bill more meaningful. 
   So that is not off the table, as far as I am concerned, as long as the changes that are made are constructive in making that bill that passed to be more usable by the communities. But right now, obviously, we are here with an amendment, because when it gets thrown together like that at the end of a session, they end up doing something that they do not know what they are doing.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. There is only one study which has been considered to have been done in a way that would give you evidence, and that study did come to that conclusion. The other studies were not really worth discussing. 
   However, again, these decisions were made in a back room, in the wee hours of the night; and obviously we would not be considering an amendment if it had been done well. Furthermore, the great debate, in my mind, of what is more important, reducing the class size from 20 to 18 or having a teacher teaching the class who knows the subject which he or she is teaching--I will bet you 10 to 1 you get better results by improving the quality of the teacher and the qualifications of the teacher than you will by reducing the class size by 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. I do not think anybody would debate that. 
   That is one thing we should consider, the flexibility under the bill--and this may come up--as to whether those moneys could not better be used and should not better be left to the discretion of the school systems to use those moneys to improve the proficiency of the teachers rather than just merely reducing the class size by 2 or 3 or 4. 
   Certainly if we get to her amendment next week, we will consider other options as well. And it may prove to be a productive experience. Hopefully it will. And I am very pleased to have listened to the leaders on both sides, that we can agree to a small number of amendments which we can consider next week, and move this bill on so that the benefits of the flexibility can be given to the Governors to help improve education overall; and the local communities will be able to do what they feel is necessary to improve that flexibility. 
   I know the Presiding Officer has been very active in trying to make sure that the local communities have more to say on how their schools can improve. So I think we are moving on a path right now that leads us through next week being a productive exercise, 
   to have the kind of flexibility that the Governors need to help the communities. At the same time we may make some changes that will be beneficial but that do not involve superseding the normal process of the Education Committee to bring about some meaningful reform within the Federal structure. 
   As I pointed out, there has been no evidence that the huge Federal structure has made any improvement over the last 15 years in our education. We are on our way this year to being the most education-minded Congress that we have had in this century. I am hopeful that when we finish this year we will all be proud of the accomplishments we have made in this country to  get us on a path to making sure we will survive the strong competition we are getting from overseas, unduly impaired by our present educational system.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that my colleague Senator BAUCUS and I are reintroducing titled the ``Post Office Community Partnership Act of 1999''. 
   Aside from a few technical changes, the bill is similar to the one we introduced in the 105th Congress that was supported by so many of our colleagues in a 76-21 vote last July. Unfortunately our postal language was dropped from the underlying bill during conference with the House. However, I am hopeful that this year our bill will become law. I should add that this year we have coordinated our efforts with Representative BLUMENAUER of Oregon and an identical companion bill is being put forward in both the Senate and the House. 
   Mr. President, I live in a small town in Vermont. I understand the importance downtowns and village centers play in the identity and longevity of communities. Downtowns are the social and economic hearts of small communities. They are where neighbors catch up on the news, shop, worship, and celebrate national holidays. 
   Our bill will enable the residents of small villages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides that their local post office will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. Local post offices are important tenants in any vibrant downtown. A recent article in USA Today cited a 1993 study that found that 80 percent of the people who shopped downtown planned their visit around a visit to the post office. 
   There is much talk in the news today about revitalizing our downtowns and encouraging smart growth. I say to my colleagues, if you want to encourage smart growth, let's start by doing what we can do to keep federal facilities such as post offices in downtowns. 
   Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is necessary. A story from my home state of Vermont will answer that question. 
   A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, Vermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the small village center for a new building outside of town. By the time the community was aware of the relocation, plans were so far along--the new building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the post office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully investigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in contrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we certainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more to get postal services.'' 
   Mr. President, post office closings and relocations are occurring all across the country and especially in small and rural communities. My colleagues will quickly discover similar examples in their own states where the removal of the post office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown area, deprived citizens without cars of access, and contributed to sprawl. 
   Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are centers of social and business interaction. In communities where post offices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become integral to these communities' identities. I believe that this legislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal Service, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. I urge my colleagues to join Senator BAUCUS and me in support of this important legislation.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank both Senators for raising this issue. There is no question but one of the most severe problems we have--probably the most severe problem we have--is the large number of dropouts in the schools. Certainly they have delineated their feelings on that very accurately. 
   But I also point out, however, we are dealing this year with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization. These programs, and I am sure there will be others which will be offered on this bill, are all worthy of a very substantial examination. In fact, we have already started holding hearings on reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Those hearings are going well. We will be holding many more. Two-thirds of all the money we spend in education at the Federal level is on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is where the money is. Thus, that is where these amendments are appropriate. 
   I want to assure both Senators that it is my intention to give top priority to such programs as those for dropouts. This Nation, however, has a very serious problem with respect to education. The Senator from New Mexico and I sit on the Goals 2000 Panel. We have been there, frustrated, because over the period of time we have been on it we have not had any measurable change in the statistics in this country about the state of our education. 
   The President has appropriately also pointed out the difficulties of social promotion. We are looking into that, obviously. There are programs that are required for that, but it is not easy to do it program by program. That is just not the way it should be handled. It should be handled in a coordinated effort, which we are doing, with hearings, to fully 
   understand why, for instance, there are dropouts, why kids are dropping out, before we suddenly come up with a program that is going to attempt to alleviate the problem. 
   So I want Members on both sides to please refrain from offering amendments that should be appropriately considered in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act's reauthorization, because only with coordinated hearings and sitting down and working together can we come up with a coordinated plan to handle all of these very serious issues which we have. I am hopeful the Senators would withdraw this amendment at this time. They have my assurances that we will be discussing fully the matter of school dropouts when we get into the hearing process. 
   We are already into the hearing process. They are all tied together. We did pass, this past year, at least one or two efforts: The Reading and Excellence Act, which gets into the questions of why people drop out; and we have others that we passed last year that we are studying in terms of professional training and all that. There will be other amendments, I am sure, that we have heard about, that will also be right in line addressing the problem. 
   There is one, I understand, on principals, principal training, and there will be a number of other amendments which they will offer. But I want to say I am not willing to accept amendments which will do what may be a good idea because of our purpose right now. Every 5 years we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We should concentrate on this right now. We have to have a coordinated effort on it. 
   First, we must delineate specifically what the students should have when they leave the school. We know they should read. We have the social promotion situation that if they don't read, we just push them on through. The statistics are startling in that regard. Over half of the young people who have graduated from high school have graduated functionally illiterate. The primary cause of that is social promotion. What we do to try to alleviate that through ESEA is something we have to look into.  
   Why do students drop out? We need to look into that very thoroughly. Obviously, a great deal of that usually occurs in the middle school area where young people come through and they don't see any relevance of education to their lives. We have to look into how to alleviate the middle school problem. 
   One of the problems there is the lack of training of principals. That is another area we should be looking at in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But right now I want to be very clear: I do not think we should be using this bill to do that. This bill is one which will just help the States now to be able to deal with some of these problems with more flexibility in the way they can handle their school systems in the allocation of funds. They need that flexibility now to handle these problems. We should concentrate on the reauthorization and not try to do it piecemeal on this bill, which is left over from last year. We got 10 good bills out. We didn't get this one out. The committee handled the bill. I don't think these were offered as amendments at that time. Certainly I had the same attitude then as I do now. 
   With that, I urge Senators seriously to consider not offering these at this point and wait for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to do that. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am sorry for not being successful in getting the Senator from New Mexico to withdraw the amendment. I understand the feelings. But to me, the best way right now that we can help immediately without having to wait through the whole process is to be dedicated to ensuring that we fully fund the money that is used for special ed. 
   If we can use all of these funds that we want to be used otherwise just to do that, we would free up the States and local governments to be able to handle some of these problems. So I want to make it very clear that the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is so important that we cannot prematurely adopt amendments which would put us in the position of having to undo things which this body does. It should be done in a very coordinated way that will allow us to thoroughly understand the impact of what we do. 
   I also bring to the Senate's attention the front page of the Washington Post this Monday. The Post carried a story regarding the months of delay which learning-disabled students in Prince Georges County are experiencing in obtaining educational services. This is important to know, that we should take action now in this area. 
   Antonio Martin, a 15-year-old resident of Prince Georges County, has been sitting home for a year waiting for placement in a school that can meet his needs. Today's Post carries a story regarding a Supreme Court decision requiring that schools pay for full-time nursing care in some situations, which will undoubtedly increase costs for any school which finds itself in this situation. 
   But this is not just a Washington problem. This is a problem in every school in every State in the country. When I visit with school board members or principals in Vermont, funding IDEA, special education, is the first, second, and third thing they want our help on. 
   The amendments that my Democratic colleagues are proposing are all well-intentioned, but they are not responding to what I am hearing from Vermont educators and educators around this whole country. 
   Vermont's legislators are telling me the same thing. I visited the Vermont educational communities during the recent recess, and time and again they asked that the Federal Government uphold its commitment to fund IDEA. They did so without regard to party. Democrat and Republican legislators agreed that funding IDEA is easily the most important thing we can do by far. 
   Last month, when our committee held hearings on education budget priorities, a representative, Al Perry, a Democrat from my good State of Vermont, was very persuasive on this point. In 1975, the year I came to Congress, we promised that we would provide funding that would be 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for each school-age child with a disability. We have not delivered on that promise. 
   In fiscal year 1998, we provided 10.8 percent of the excess costs of educating children with special needs. If we follow through on this promise, we will free up critical local funds. Once we do, local communities, and not the Federal Government, will be in the position to decide how to spend their local dollars--for teachers, for textbooks, for technology, or for some other locally determined educational policy. 
   Senator WELLSTONE, yesterday, talked about listening to 
   community needs. Anyone who has done so has probably heard the same thing that I have. The President certainly has--from school boards across the country and from the Governors. Yet the President has ignored their plea. In his budget request for fiscal year 2000, the 25th anniversary of IDEA, there is no increase in funding. In his public statements on education, he has ignored IDEA entirely. At a time when no educational issue seems to escape the administration's purview, special education seems stuck in the White House purgatory. 
   A year ago I urged President Clinton to join Congress and keep the promise that we all made in 1975. He declined. Again, in December 1998, I implored the President to join us in meeting our commitment to children with disabilities. He ignored it. 
   Instead, the President has made many new promises in his budget for fiscal year 2000. But what good are all these new promises if past promises are empty in the area of greatest need? Year after year we have seen budget requests from the administration that represent no real funding increase for special education. This constitutes a pattern of neglect and a lack of concern that cannot be defended. Children suffer, families suffer, and school districts suffer. 
   In each of the last 3 years, Republican Congresses have increased Federal funding for special education by over 85 percent. We are fully committed to reaching that promise made 24 years ago. 
   I show you a chart. What we have done has been fine, but look at what is left to do. In the orange there is what we should be paying but we are not paying. That is shown on that chart. If the President thinks Congress will take care of business and increase funding for special education, he is right. We will, through this amendment and other amendments. If he thinks because we will, he can put his funding priorities elsewhere, he is wrong. 
   School districts are demanding financial relief. Children's needs must be met. Parents expect accountability. There is no better way to touch a school, help a child, or support a family than to place more dollars into special education. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. If we put money into IDEA, school districts will be in a position to address class size or whatever they determine to be local priorities. They can ensure that children like Antonio Martin won't sit in education limbo for months on end. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has made an excellent point. I do not argue with him. I, in fact, would have supported those appropriations and have supported the appropriations that have been recommended for education totally. 
   I think the point Senator GREGG was making was that this administration does not place high enough priority on IDEA. I think the record bears this out. While the administration's proposed new programs increase funding elsewhere, it has shortchanged IDEA. The funding we are charged with under our promises and under the law as it reads--to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education--those costs are going up and are really making it difficult for our local communities to carry out other programs that have been recommended to help them. So I just wanted to make sure everyone recognizes that.

We introduced it jointly together, and your support, although you are not on the Finance Committee, has been most helpful in ensuring its success. We had a good hearing. There are a couple amendments which may come about, which I think can be taken care of without any serious diminution of the impact of the bill. 
   I say on behalf of all the Senators on the committee and those that have signed on, we now have 62 cosponsors to that bill. This is an incredible step forward for people with disabilities who desire to work. I do not think there are  very many who don't desire to work. They have been placed in this incredibly terrible position of, if you go to work, you lose your health care and you lose your SDI benefits or other benefits that you have to help you live. You just 
   cannot do it except under very unusual circumstances. 
   Thus, we have finally opened the door, after many years. The Senator worked on all these issues, too, starting with the bill that we have been talking about, special education, back in 1976, when we passed what is called IDEA. That opened the first big door, and that is to get an education. Without an education, you do not have any hope of being able to be employed. 
   Since then, we have marched up through with ADA. I remember one of the amendments I had, which probably created the most stir, was when I was with John Brademas on his committee. I said, John, do you realize that the Federal Government is exempt from 504, which removes barriers for people with handicaps? He said, No. He said, Well, let us fix it. So over in the House, you have the day when you put all these unimportant amendments through and nobody looks at them. We had a little committee amendment on that which affected all the Federal buildings. I remember it well because when I got back to the office a couple days later, somebody had finally read the bill. It was filled with the head of the Post Office and everybody else asking me if I knew what I had done. I said, well, I didn't know how important it was until now, but that got the Federal Government by. 
   Then we worked together on assisted technology as well. That bill we reauthorized last year, which is incredibly important at this time, to assist all those people with disabilities to have a better opportunity of getting employed because they have the assistance of technology to do that. 
   It is a great day. I am confident that we certainly will prevail on the Senate floor. I think that the two Senators who have some problems we can take care of, but I thank you for your tremendous support over all the years we have been working together.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. I am sure the Senator shares this with me, too. There were some staff members--Pat Morrissey on my staff had been working on this for 20 years or more, I guess. I know on the Senator's staff, members have had similar input. I think we ought to remember who it really is sometimes that moves this legislation along.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to state where we are and what we hope to accomplish the rest of the day. 
   Unfortunately, we have broken down in the sense of being able to efficiently and effectively consider amendments on the Ed-Flex bill. 
   I remind everyone, the Ed-Flex bill is a very limited bill which is supposed to assist States to manage their educational systems better by having a waiver capacity in title I particularly. 
   Just to give some examples of what we run into on that bill, at this point the State of Vermont has found with Ed-Flex--we are one of the six States that has Ed-Flex--to be at a great advantage in making modifications without the necessity of a waiver, and those modifications can be made within the State. 
   What this does is allow, in certain circumstances where we have specific percentages set forth which must be reached or you cannot do certain things--.5 percent is an important one with respect to poverty. Thus, communities that have slightly less than .5--say in our case like .48--it is just impossible for you to do anything even with the next-door school which has .5. 
   And there is no reason why those schools should be treated differently. You have to have waiver authority for that outside of the State. 
   So this bill just makes it so much better for Governors to be able to administer and to be able to take advantage of Federal programs within their States. Thus, it really isn't creating for us any problem at all. That is all we are talking about. 
   I want to keep reminding people that this bill is something which the Governors, every single Governor wants, and I think everyone here in the Senate should. 
   I understand Senator MURRAY would like some time. I would be happy to yield to her if I could regain the floor at 4:55. Would that be all right?

   Mr. JEFFORDS. That is no problem. I will go forward under either circumstance and do the same thing. 
   I certainly commend the Senator from the State of Washington for presenting the results of the study. I understand that is the only study that has been done. Obviously, considerable effort was put into doing that. 
   Again, I emphasize, as I have to all Members, that I want to keep this bill, the Ed-Flex bill, clear of amendments in order that we can expedite its passage. This will have good reception in the House. I want to get this done so the Governors can, as soon as possible, have the flexibility to be able to handle the problems created in the present law--especially title I. 
   I am not going to accept any amendments that are related to the elementary and secondary education reauthorization. Otherwise, we will be here all the rest of this year talking and blocking all other legislation because we cannot get this little Ed-Flex bill out, which is small but is really important. I have alerted everyone that I will not accept and will oppose any amendments which are related to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization on which we are presently holding hearings. We have already had several hearings and we will have more hearings. To do it piecemeal, as Members are attempting to do, to do things in this piecemeal fashion before we have held the necessary hearings is very counterproductive at this particular time. 
   Also, I remind Members, for those amendments which do set forth an authorization for the expenditure of funds, I will second degree those  amendments and have that money go not to the intended purpose of the amendment but, rather, to fully fund the IDEA; that is, money for special education. If there is a shortfall in funding, there is no question that the shortfall in funding is in IDEA. 
   Behind me, Senators can see a chart that demonstrates how incredibly stingy the Federal Government has been in meeting its obligations. I was on the committee that wrote the original IDEA in 1976, and I remember when we made the pledge to make sure that the Federal Government was responsible for 40 percent of the cost of special education. As Members probably realize by this time, yesterday a Supreme Court decision greatly expanded the potential for expenditure of funds by saying that under IDEA, we have the obligation now--the States do; I think the Federal Government as well--to pay for health care costs related to special education children. That is a great expansion of the present situation. 
   This is not a mandate, as someone called it, of the Federal Government. This is a constitutional requirement. Any State that offers free education must offer the free and appropriate education to special education children. Thus, this is a constitutional requirement which we agreed to pay 40 percent. 
   Now, what our goal is--the Republican goal--we have increased the funding by some 85 percent over the last 3 years. That was all done by Republicans for the purpose of trying to get us closer to that 40 percent that we agreed to do back in 1976. 
   I want to make that clear as we try to move forward on this bill. I know there are a number of amendments that have been put forward contrary to my feeling that we should not be amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act until such time as we have held the appropriate hearings, and that we should only concentrate on the Ed-Flex bill to free the Governors of the kind of complications they have now with respect to trying to get through the maze of regulations, in order to free up flexibility to help more of their communities with the limited funds they have. 
   Hopefully, we will be offering an amendment in the not-too-distant future that will assist in moving toward improving the Ed-Flex bill, so that we can bring it to an end and be able to pass it out in an expeditious way to help the States be able to handle the problems from which they are suffering. 
   I am hopeful Members will understand. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will not try to take advantage of this opportunity to prematurely amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I hope they will wait until the hearings are finished, and until such time as we have an orderly process, to delineate what the new Elementary and Secondary Education Act should contain. 
   In a moment I will send an amendment to the desk in order to make progress on the Ed Flex bill. This amendment is drafted to the text of S. 280 rather than the pending substitute. Members should be aware that we will vote shortly after that--depending, of course, on debate--in relation to the amendment.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will not resist the opportunity to make a few comments about what we have been doing here today. Both sides are very much interested in improving education. I don't think the enthusiasm of one side is outweighed by that of the other side, or vice versa. But the question of how to do it at this particular moment is the question with which we are faced. 
   This side believes very strongly that we need to ensure when we vote for new programs, when we vote billions of dollars for the existing programs, we ought to know whether or not they are working. Our system is set up in a very logical way. Every 5 years we take a look at programs, and we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is up this year. It is the most important piece of education legislation we have. It is not something which should be ignored, saying, ``We don't need any hearings. We don't need to worry about anything. We know the answers already.'' 
   Let's examine where the ``already'' is, and what has happened. We had notice in 1983 that we had a terrible educational crisis in this country. The Nation at Risk report came out during the Reagan administration. The Governors got together in 1988, and they formulated the goals that we ought to be meeting. Here it is in 1999--and I sit on the Goals Panel--and there is no evidence that we have made any improvement in anything that is measurable. 
   So why would we go racing out to fund programs about which we have had no hearings at this time? That is neither an appropriate nor a logical way to proceed. What do we know? We know a couple of things. First of all, we know from the experiences we have had with the experimental programs in six, and then twelve, States that more flexibility in existing program regulations will enable States to more efficiently and effectively use that money. All of the Governors say, ``Please, help us and release us from the growing volume of burdensome regulation.'' That  is all we are trying to do. It is something we can do quickly, now, and get action immediately. 
   Second, where is the greatest need for resources right now in this country? It is at the local level. The programs that are being discussed are dealing with matters which are primarily being addressed at the local level. But where Federal support is needed most is where we promised it would be provided back in 1975-76 when we passed the bill to open up vistas for children with disabilities so they had an opportunity for the kind of education which was appropriate for them. We guaranteed--quote-unquote, I suppose, from a Federal perspective--that we would provide 40 percent of that funding. Yesterday's Supreme Court case has greatly, incredibly worsened that situation by requiring that not only do we have to provide an appropriate education at the State level, but also that somebody has to provide the health care to ensure that when that child is in school, he or she receives the best health care to enhance their education. 
   Where is that burden going to be? Right now it has just been placed right at the local level, where it remains if we do not do something about that as soon as possible. What we have been saying today, and what we have been dedicated to as Republicans for the last 3 years, is that we must ensure that those communities that are trying to provide educational opportunity for children with disabilities have money enough, as promised to them by the Federal Government, to enable them to meet those needs. 
   It would take $11 billion to raise that level now to what we promised back in 1976. What we are saying is, before we go off into untried programs which have not even had hearings, we ought to provide that money immediately or make it available for the process of appropriations immediately. So, we will take the money that is in these programs that are untried--the authorizations--and say: Give it to where it is really needed, to the local governments and the States so they can provide an education for the young people, all of the young people, which they cannot do by themselves because the demands are so high and because we have failed to provide to them the $11 billion they are entitled to under our promise. 
   So I implore, my good friends on the other side, we are not trying to in any way hold anything up. What we are trying to do is to get a straightforward bill passed which will immediately help the States to maximize their resources. That's what we want to do. Instead, rather than being able to take this small step forward, we are having to go through this whole process of being asked to adopt all these programs about which we have no evidence whether or not they will work. 
   The Department of Education now is spending, I think, $15 billion under Federal programs supporting elementary and secondary education, and we do not know if they are working. As far as we can tell, little or nothing is working. So we have to get in there and make a careful examination of these programs. That is what we should be doing--and what we are doing--through the reauthorization process. We have already had hearings to find out what is working, what is not working, and why is it not working. We will have further hearings to explore these issues. I cannot even tell now, from reading reports, from research, or anything, what impact this money is having. Before we start new programs with large sums of money, we ought to at least know whether the ones we are supporting now are working. We simply cannot go charging off to try to grab scarce resources to fund programs that are not effective. 
   We in no way are trying to hold things back. We want to give help immediately to the States in order to loosen up existing resources to help the local communities improve their schools. 
   I really get a little bit excited when the claim is made that we are trying to stop things from happening, when our whole purpose here is to try to make available to all 50 States the opportunity to improve their ability to deliver quality education. Then, we must have the hearings we need so we can go forward responsibly in reviewing Federal efforts in elementary and secondary education in their totality and do what our job is supposed to be. 
   Some examples: The program which has been mentioned with respect to afterschool activities is one which I authored in 1994 and which was enacted as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization bill that year. That program--21st Century Schools--already exists. The President has embraced it as his own. He now thinks it is a great initiative, after previously refusing to put any money in it at all. I am happy that that program is now funded and is likely to receive further funding increases. I am also aware that the President would like to see changes in the program, but this is not the time to try to suddenly put them in place. We need to go through the regular authorization process. I am anxious to do just that, but I want to do it right. 
   We are just trying to proceed in an orderly fashion. I hope that we have an opportunity, even tomorrow, to move this bill forward. We can pass it tomorrow. Then, let us put all our effort into hearings on elementary and secondary education so that when we do things, we know what we are going to do, and hopefully we will find some things that will work. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I introduce the ``Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1999,'' with my colleagues, Senators SNOWE, FRIST, HAGEL, and COLLINS. These protections will give all Americans the assurance that the scientific breakthroughs in genetics testing are only used to improve an individual's health and not as a new means of discrimination. 
   On May 21st of last year, I held a Labor and Human Resources Committee hearing on ``Genetic Information and Health Care,'' which proved to be one of the most important of the Committee's hearing during the 105th Congress. At that hearing, the Committee was presented information regarding the enormous health benefits that genetic testing research may contribute to health care, particularly in preventative medicine. Additionally, we heard compelling testimony from witnesses who fear that genetic testing will be used to discriminate against individuals with asmyptomatic conditions and to deny them the access to health insurance coverage that they have traditionally enjoyed. 
   Following that hearing, I directed my staff to work with the offices of Senator FRIST and the other members of the Labor Committee, together with the office of Senator SNOWE, to draft legislation that build on Senator SNOWE's bill, S. 89, to ensure that individuals would be able to control the use of their predictive genetic information. The results of these efforts are reflected in the genetic information provisions of S. 300, ``The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act.'' 
   Our legislation addresses the concerns that were raised at the hearing: 
   1. It prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies in all markets from adjusting premiums on the basis of predictive genetic information. 
   2. Prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies from requesting predictive genetic information as a condition of enrollment. 
   3. It allows plans to request--but not require--that an individual disclose or authorize the collection of predictive genetic information for diagnosis, treatment, or payment purposes. In addition, as part of the request, the group health plans or health insurance companies must provide individuals with a description of the procedures in place to safeguard the confidentiality of the information. 
   For a society, it is often said, demography is destiny. But for an individual, as we are learning more and more, it is DNA that is destiny. Each week, it seems, scientists decipher another peace of the genetic code, opening doors to greater understanding of how our bodies work, how they fail, and how they might be cured. 
   Everyday we read of new discoveries resulting from the work being conducted at the National Center for Human Genome Research. As our body of scientific knowledge about genetics, increases, so, too, do the concerns about how this information may be used. There is no question that our understanding of genetics has brought us to the brink of a new future. Our challenge as a Congress will be to help ensure that our society reaps the full health benefits of genetic testing and also to put to rest any concerns that the information will be used as a new tool to discriminate against specific ethnic groups or individual Americans. 
   With the enactment of the ``Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1999'' as a part of S. 300--``The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act''--we will be able to ensure that these scientific breakthroughs stimulated by the Human Genome Project will be used to provide better health for all members of our society and not as a means of discrimination.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, climate change poses potential real threats to Vermont, the Nation, and the World. While we cannot yet predict the exact timing, magnitude, or nature of these threats, we must not let our uncertainty lead to inaction. 
   Preventing climate change is a daunting challenge. It will not be solved by a single bill or a single action. As we do not know the extent of the threat, we also do not know the extent of the solution. But we cannot let our lack of knowledge lead to lack of action. We must start today. Our first steps will be hesitant and imperfect, but they will be a beginning. 
   Today I am joining Senator CHAFEE, Senator MACK, Senator LIEBERMAN and a host of others in cosponsoring the Credit for Early Action Act in the United States Senate.  
   Credit for Early Action gives incentives to American businesses to voluntarily reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. Properly constructed, Credit for Early Action will increase energy efficiency, promote renewable energy, provide cleaner air, and help reduce the threat of possible global climatic disruptions. It will help industry plan for the future and save money on energy. It rewards companies for doing the right thing--conserving energy and promoting renewable energy. Without Credit for Early Action, industries which do the right thing run the risk of being penalized for having done so. We introduce this bill as a signal to industry: you will not be penalized for increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy, you will be rewarded. 
   In writing this bill, Senators CHAFEE, MACK, and LIEBERMAN have done an excellent job with a difficult subject. I am cosponsoring the Credit for Early Action legislation as an endorsement for taking a first step in the right direction. I will be working with my colleagues throughout this Congress to strengthen this legislation to ensure that it strongly addresses the challenges that lie ahead. The bill must be changed to guarantee that our emissions will decrease to acceptable levels, and guarantee that credits will be given out equitably. These modifications can be summarized in a single sentence: credits awarded must be proportional to benefits gained. This goal can be achieved through two additions: a rate-based performance standard and a cap on total emissions credits. 
   The rate-based performance standard is the most important item. A rate-based standard gives credits to those companies which are the most efficient in their class--not those that are the biggest and dirtiest to begin with. Companies are rewarded for producing the most product for the least amount of emissions. Small and growing companies would have the same opportunities to earn credits as large companies. This system would create a just and equitable means of awarding emissions credits to companies which voluntarily increase their energy efficiency and renewable energy use. 
   The second item is an adjustable annual cap on total emissions credits. An adjustable annual cap allows Congress to weigh the number of credits given out against the actual reduction in total emissions. Since the ultimate goal is to reduce U.S. emissions, this provision would allow a means to ensure that we do not give all of our credits away without ensuring that our emissions levels are actually decreasing. 
   With these two additions, Credit for Early Action will bring great rewards to our country, our economy, and our environment. It will save money, give industry the certainty to plan for the future, and promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, all while reducing our risk from climate change. This legislation sends the right message: companies will be rewarded for doing the right thing--increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy use.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Today, Mr. President, we are taking up what I would call ``unfinished business'' from last Congress. Our bipartisan efforts in the last Congress resulted in nearly 30 public laws, about a third of them in the area of education. However, there was one bill that was reported from the Health and Education Committee with broad bipartisan support, the Ed-Flex bill, that was not enacted into law. 
   A year ago, the President told the Nation's Governors that passage of this legislation--and I quote him--``would dramatically reduce the regulatory burden of the federal government on the states in the area of education.'' 
   Six months ago, Secretary Riley wrote me to reiterate the administration's support for the Ed-Flex bill and urged its passage. The Senate Health and Education Committee heeded his advice and passed it with only one dissenting vote. 
   The National Governors' Association, under the chairmanship of Governor Carper from Delaware, has strongly urged the Congress to pass Ed-Flex this year. 
   Last November, the General Accounting Office looked at this program in detail, both at the dozen States that now participate in the Ed-Flex program and the 38 that potentially could participate under this legislation. It found that views among the current States varied, but it was seen as modestly helpful. 
   It would be a gross overstatement to suggest that this bill will revolutionize education. It will be a sensible step in making our limited resources go further toward the goal of improving our education delivery system. 
   The Department of Education, under the leadership of Secretary Riley, has stated that Ed-Flex authority will help States in ``removing potential regulatory barriers to the successful implementation of comprehensive school reform'' initiatives. 
   I would like to take a moment to briefly review the history of Ed-Flex. The original Ed-Flex legislation was first conceived by former Senator Mark Hatfield, as many of us know, an individual deeply committed to improving education. His proposal had its roots in his home State of Oregon which has long been a role model in education. 
   Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives a State some authority to grant waivers within a State, giving each State the ability to make decisions about whether some school districts may be granted waivers pertaining to certain Federal requirements. 
   It is very important to note that States cannot waive any Federal regulatory or statutory requirements relating to health and safety, civil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, equitable participation of students and professional staff in private schools, parental participation and involvement, and distribution of funds to State or local education agencies. They have no authority to waive any of those. 
   The 1994 legislation authorized six Ed Flex states, three designations were to be awarded to states with populations of 3.5 million or greater and 3 were to be granted to states with populations less than 3.5 million. 
   These states were not chosen randomly nor quickly--the selection process was 2 and one-half years in duration. The Department of Education sent out a notice and a state interested in participating in Ed Flex submitted an application. 
   In the application, each interested state was required to describe how it would use its waiver authority, including how it would evaluate waiver applications from local school districts and how it would ensure accountability. 
   The original six are: Kansas, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and my home state of Vermont. Another six states came on board between May 1996 and July 1997. Those additional states are: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, and New Mexico. 
   Vermont has used its Ed Flex authority to improve Title One services, particularly improving services for those students in smaller rural areas. In addition, my home state has also used Ed Flex authority to provide greater access to professional development, which is a very critical area and perhaps has the greatest impact on enhancing student performance. 
   The Department of Education has stated that the 12 current Ed Flex states have ``used their waiver authority carefully and judiciously.'' 
   In last November's GAO report on Ed Flex, several state officials from the established Ed Flex states, said that ``Ed Flex promotes a climate that encourages state and local educators to explore new approaches......'' 
   The bill before us today, S. 280, under the sponsorship of Senator BILL FRIST and Senator RON WYDEN, has significantly improved the accountability aspects of the 1994 Ed Flex law.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. First, Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts. We have been working with him on the questions of accountability. I am hopeful that we will reach agreement on an amendment, which he may propose, so that we will not have issues in that regard. I point out that the substitute amendment which I offered today includes many improvements with respect to accountability over the bill that we passed last year out of committee 17-1. 
   I will run through, very briefly, the areas where we have already improved the accountability and are still attempting to reach agreement with the minority. 
   First, the substitute amendment I offered strengthens the accountability features already included in S. 280. It adds State application requirements relating to the coordination of the Education Flexibility plan with the State comprehensive reform plan, or with the challenging standards and assessment provisions of title I of the ESEA. 
   This Managers Package adds emphasis that student performance is an objective of Ed-Flex. It adds provisions regarding annual performance reviews, by the State, of local educational agencies and schools which have received  waivers, and reemphasizes the authority of the State to determine waivers if LEAs or schools are not meeting their goals. It also adds provisions of public notice and comment, and provisions requiring additional reporting by the secretary regarding his rationale for approving waiver authority and the use of that authority. We will continue to work and, hopefully, we can reach agreement so that we will not lengthen the time necessary for passing this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I'll use a few moments to take a look at last year. What we are talking about right now is where we ended last year as far as passing bills on education. 
   Let us take a look at what we did accomplish during that period of time. This chart lists all of the bills which we passed out of our committee, almost all of them by unanimous or close to unanimous votes. They all became law. They were very important. 
   First of all, we had the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, for which we had tremendous bipartisan agreement, 
   and we took time to do it. It came out and passed practically unanimously by both the House and Senate. That is what happens when we have good, bipartisan working together. 
   The next one was the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997. We had some important problems that came up with respect to student loans, but were able to take care of them. This Act passed with a very substantial vote. 
   Next, was the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, which had not been reauthorized for many years. An important component of the National Science Foundation is education; we sometimes forget that. But a tremendous amount of funding for the important areas of education, in  the areas of science, comes through this bill, and that was accomplished. 
   Then we had a real step forward with the Work Force Investment Act of 1998, including the Rehabilitation Act Amendments. That bill has turned this country around in its attitude and ability to prepare people for the workforce. Not only that, but it recognized that workforce training is nonstop at high schools and colleges. Training goes on and on and on. We now have the nontraditional students of the past who are actually outnumbering the so-called traditional students on the recommendation that a person's job is going to change many times during a lifetime. We had close to unanimous agreement on the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. 
   And for the first time in 5 years, we did a thorough review of the Higher Education Act, taking into consideration the needs of the Nation. Again, with very hard work and long, long hours, we were able to complete the Higher Education Amendments. Also included were the Education of the Deaf Act Amendments of 1998. The Higher Education Amendments took a close look at not only higher education, but what higher education was doing with respect to the teacher colleges. We found we had serious problems with the teacher colleges and things had to be changed. We also recognized that we had a huge problem trying to get our teachers in schools the kind of retraining that is necessary in order to bring them up to speed on the needs not only in the next century but this century. This Act passed close to unanimously. 
   The work being done now in professional development--we eliminated all the bills on professional development in there. They were useless. We have now created a very firm foundation for professional development in higher education institutions to assist us in our K-through-12 education. 
   The Reading Excellence Act was unanimous here. In close cooperation with the President, we came out with that act, and it is in law and already having an impact upon the serious problems we have with a number of young people graduating from high school who are presently functionally illiterate and do not have the basic skills necessary to warrant a diploma. We have had what is called social promotion, and the President emphasized that we have to do away with social promotion. The way that can be done is to try to make sure every kid can read, and the Reading Excellence Act will be an important part of that. 
   In addition, we had the Charter School Expansion Act. As we go forward, it is necessary to experiment in the kinds of institutions we can create to have the flexibility and dedication to be able to change the relatively low results we have been getting out of our K-through-12 educational system. Some of the charter schools are working well. We have learned a lot. Those will be models for what we can do in the public school system. It is an important step forward. 
   In addition, we had the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998. That is Head Start and other programs for the very young, as well as for those in special low-income areas. It was the first reauthorization of Head Start in many years. We came out with an excellent bill, all working together, Republicans and Democrats, and with the White House. 
   Finally--and this is an important act--is the Carl D. Perkins Vocational-Technical Education Act Amendments. We had not been able to get that amended in many years. We did a thorough 
   review of its application. We upgraded it and brought it into the modern day situation. 
   I am pleased to say that we almost reached our goal on all the bills that we had. However, one bill didn't make it, and it was this Ed-Flex bill. The reason it didn't make it is not because the Members did not agree with what we had in the bill, but it was seen to be a vehicle on which perhaps many other ideas and thoughts about how to change education could be amended to it. 
   I hope that doesn't occur this time. I hope we don't find ourselves in the position of not taking a bill which everybody agrees is important. The President has said that he favors it. He gave strong words of support for it. The Governors have unanimously agreed that they want it. I hope we will be able to get this out in the next few days in order to be sure that we can give the flexibility to the States that they need. 
   My State has had it. It has worked very well. It is not a huge success in the sense that it is going to change that much that goes on, but it makes it easier for States to coordinate things. You have situations--at least in our State--where school districts are very close to the 50 percent or the 125 percent thresholds for poverty. If you don't quite make it, it fouls everything up. With the flexibility we have had in Vermont as one of those six States that have been able to use the flexibility, we have found that it has reduced the time and effort which go into trying to work with title I. That is all we are trying to do today. 
   I think we are hearing now an agreement on accountability. If we have learned anything over the past year, it has been the tremendous lack of accountability in this country in our educational system. If there is any area that we need to improve upon--and I serve on the Goals 2000 panel--it is accountability. One of the most disturbing things I have found is that we really don't know what is going on in this country. We still can't measure performance, still can't determine--in fact, in the report we have no evidence that there was any improvement from the date that we got the ``Nation at Risk'' report in 1983. Fifteen years and there is no measurable improvement in our schools. But then we found that the data we were using to determine whether or not there was any improvement was 1994 data, and here it was 1998. 
   So we have other improvements to make, and one of those is accountability and to be able to measure what is going on in our school system. The flexibility will help the States to be able to really ascertain and work better with their school systems to determine exactly what is going on, how to measure success. That is one of the reasons. So I am hopeful that that one bill we were unable to get passed last year in the area of education, which we knew was appropriate and necessary--I hope we can get it done quickly this week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an amendment by Senator WELLSTONE. I will give you a little history. This bill was voted out of committee earlier this year. It was basically the same amendment which was passed out of the committee unanimously last year--I am sorry, with one objection last year. It is generally agreed to. However, there are some areas that some Members wanted to address. I rise in opposition and I will move to table the pending Wellstone amendment. 
   This issue was addressed in the managers' amendment package by including the eligibility of the State as a condition for approval and consideration. Also, under the eligibility requirement, States must have the very standards and assessments as laid out in title I. SEAs are prohibited from waiving statewide requirements for local school districts. And, finally, the States are required to implement corrective action pursuant to title I. 
   Therefore, we believe it is redundant and unnecessary. At the appropriate time I will move to table. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, most small businesses in Vermont rely on  electronic systems to operate. Many of these businesses are looking to the Year 2000 with apprehension or outright despair. Small businesses rely on microprocessors for manufacturing equipment, telecommunications for product delivery, and the mainstay of data storage--computer chips. These businessmen and women are concerned about the financial effects of the Year 2000 Computer Bug will have on their efforts to remedy the problem, as well as those after-effects caused by system failures. This is why I firmly believe that the quick enactment of Senator BOND's bill, S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act should be a top priority for Congress. 
   The legislation will go a long way toward providing vitally needed loans for the nation's small businesses. This bill serves three purposes: first, it will authorize the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to expand its guaranteed loan program so eligible small businesses have the means to continue operating successfully after January 1, 2000. Second, the bill will allow small businesses to use Y2K loan proceeds to offset economic injury sustained after the year 2000 as a result of Y2K problems. Third, the legislation will highlight those potential vulnerabilities small businesses face from Y2K so small businessmen and women understand the risks involved. 
   Unfortunately, while many small businesses are well aware of the Y2K Millennium Bug, recent surveys indicate that a significant proportion of them do not plan on taking action because they do not believe it is a serious enough threat. This bill will raise awareness of Y2K risks so small businesses who may face problems will choose to upgrade their hardware and software computer systems. As costs of doing so could be prohibitive for small businesses the legislation will meet the financial needs of small businesses by ensuring access to guaranteed SBA loans. 
   The operation of this legislation will remain the same as the current SBA loan program, where the agency guarantees the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to assist new small businesses seeking to correct Y2K computer problems. Those lenders currently participating in the SBA's 7(a) business loan program will also be able to participate in the Y2K loan program by accessing additional guaranteed loan funds. 
   Mr. President, I commend the efforts of Chairman BOND on this legislation and I hope for its quick enactment. While this legislation will not eradicate the potential effects Y2K may have on electronic systems, it will at least ensure that resources are available to those small businesses who try to protect themselves from the threat, or recuperate following a Y2K-related difficulty.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the Committee and to publish those rules in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of the first year of each Congress. On January 20, 1999, the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held a business meeting during which the members of the Committee unanimously adopted rules to govern the procedures of the Committee. Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, today I am submitting for printing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a  copy of the Rules of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\1\ \1\ Pursuant to S.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``American Financial Institutions Privacy Act of 1999.'' This legislation will delay the implementation of the ``Know Your Customer'' regulations proposed by the federal banking agencies. Additionally, this legislation would require these agencies to perform a comprehensive study, to be submitted to Congress in 180 days, on the privacy, freedom of association and economic issues implicated by these regulations. Only with Congressional authorization will these regulations be allowed to take effect. 
   These regulations mandate that banks identify each customer, find out the normal source and use of his or her funds and then watch transactions in the account to see if they deviate from ``normal'' and ``expected'' patterns. If the unexpected transactions seem ``suspicious'' banks are required under current law to report them to the Suspicious Activity Reporting System, a federal database that can be searched by the Internal Revenue Service, bank regulators, the FBI and other federal agencies. 
   Mr. President, I have heard from my constituents expressing great concern over the privacy implications of these regulations, and I think a resolution recently adopted by the Vermont House best expresses the concerns of Vermonters. The resolution states,  ``.....the regulation will result in a substantial invasion of privacy and an illegal search in violation of innocent customers' rights. .....'' I will include a complete copy of this resolution in the RECORD. 
   The stated purpose behind these rules is to guard the banking system against harm from those who would launder money from drugs and other criminal activities. This is an admirable goal and one that is important in our continuing battle against crime. However, these regulations have moved beyond just a tool used to combat crime and into the realm where the government needs to know all of your personal, financial information. This is an unacceptable change. 
   Mr. President, the study is a necessary part of this legislation and will give Congress the factual basis to evaluate the effects of this regulation on people's privacy and freedom of association, as well as its economic implications. These facts will allow Congress to properly evaluate the regulations and reach a final determination on the regulation's ultimate fate. The study will also give the federal banking agencies time to consider clarifications to the regulations, or rescind them. 
   I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of the American Financial Institutions Privacy Act of 1999 and help stop this privacy infringement on all Americans.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the amendment Senator CLELAND and I have proposed. Specifically, we propose allowing our men and women in the Guard and Reserve the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) in the same manner S. 4 provides to their colleagues on active duty. 
   Allowing members of the Guard and Reserve to participate in the Federal Employees TSP is long overdue and I strongly support the proposal to make it law. This program is good for federal workers and it would benefit members of the Guard and Reserve financially for them to participate in the TSP. Under this system, they would be the sole contributors to their accounts, much like civil servants who are under the old Civil Service Retirement System. Since there would be no federal match to their accounts the cost would be very low to the branches of the military and to the taxpayers, as well. Additional savings in individual accounts will be important to those individuals who serve our Nation in regular, but temporary capacities. The payroll deduction feature of the TSP is an easy way to save. The accounts are managed prudently by the Thrift Savings Board. Participation in the system is high and satisfaction with it is also very high. 
   Those of us on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committees have been spending quite a bit of energy trying to encourage Americans to save more money. As a New Englander, I speak for my constituents when I say that we know a lot about thrift. This is a good amendment that will encourage thrift and I hope my colleagues will support it. 
   Given that our Guard and Reserve are shouldering an increasing share of our world-wide missions, they should have the same savings opportunity that S. 4 gives to the active duty. Now is the time to ensure that our reserve component personnel are not overlooked.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have long been a strong advocate for a well-educated American work-force. Vermont's quality of life is related closely to the educational opportunities available to her citizens. Education is a cornerstone of our healthy economy. These same notions apply with similar effect to our men and women in the military. Modern, technologically advanced systems and complex missions depend on the skills and wisdom of well-educated personnel. S. 4 modestly enhances the educational opportunities for our men and women on active duty. It should do the same for the members of our Guard and Reserve. 
   This bill is appropriately named ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights.'' It is appropriate because use of the term ``Bill of Rights'' invariably suggests the concepts of fairness and equity. 
   Perhaps Secretary of Defense William Cohen had this in the back of his mind in September of 1997 when he instructed the Department of Defense to eliminate ``all residual barriers, structural and cultural'' to effective integration of the Guard, Reserve and Active Components into a ``seamless Total Force.'' Precisely one year later his Deputy, John Hamre, looked back to that day and observed:  
   We have made great progress integrating our active and Reserve forces into one team, trained and ready for the 21st century. Our military leaders are getting the message. Structural and cultural barriers that reduce readiness and impede interoperability between active and Reserve personnel are gradually being eliminated. We must now assess the progress we have made, acknowledge those barriers to integration that still exist, and, most importantly, set our plans into motion.  
   If these wise words are to have full effect we must work to rectify an oversight in S. 4, which, as written, enhances educational benefits for a portion of our seamless Total Force but neglects the remainder. Consequently, to promote parity among all components of our military Senator LANDRIEU and I are offering the following two amendments: 
   The First: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve the ability to accelerate payments of educational assistance in the same manner currently provided in S. 4 to the Active Duty military. 
   The Second: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve who have served at least ten years in the Selected Reserve, an eligibility period of five years after separation from the military to use their entitlement to educational benefits. (Active duty military members have a ten year period.) 
   Just a few weeks ago, four Reserve Component members lost their lives when their KC-135 went down in Germany while flying active duty missions for the Air Force. Death did not discriminate between Active and Reserve Components. Nor should S. 4. 
   The opportunity to face this ultimate risk will only increase as we place greater demands on our Guard and Reserve units to participate in our global missions. Since Operation Desert Storm the pace of operations has swelled by more than 300% for the Guard alone and is widely expected to climb higher. 
   We all know the value of the Guard and Reserve for missions close to home. In Vermont they saved our citizens from the drastic effects of record setting ice storms last winter. Recently, other units helped with hurricanes in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. They assist our citizens during droughts and blizzards. They enrich our communities with Youth Challenge programs and they conduct an ongoing war on drugs. Just last year we added protection of the U.S. from weapons of mass destruction to that list, and the list keeps growing. 
   It is now time to bring their educational benefits in balance.  
   As many of you know, I believe in the value of life-long learning to our society. Access to continuing education has become an essential component to one's advancement through all stages of modern careers. S. 4 modestly improves this access for our brave men and women on active duty. It should do the same for our Guard and Reserves. 
   I urge my colleagues to help bring parity, equity and fairness to the educational opportunities available to all components of our military. The Guard and Reserve have been called upon increasingly to contribute to the Total Force. They face similar challenges to recruiting and retention. They should have similar access to educational opportunities. 
   Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation, which is, basically, now pending, to allow certain Medicare-eligible veterans to go to Veterans' Administration facilities for their care and to allow the Veterans' Administration to bill Medicare for those services, just as a private provider would do. Seventeen of my colleagues joined Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator SPECTER, and myself in introducing the Veterans Equal Access to Medicare Act, S. 445. It is this legislation that Senator ROCKEFELLER now offers as an amendment to this bill, and I support him. 
   America's veterans and the Veterans Health Administration are eager to launch this demonstration project which establishes up to 10 demonstration sites around the country where this policy would be tested. The Department of Defense is currently running a very similar demonstration project for military retirees, and the Veterans' Administration is anxious to do the same for veterans. 
   Allowing veterans to take their Medicare eligibility to a Veterans' Administration building gives them greater flexibility in choosing their care provider. This is good for veterans. It makes good sense, and it would allow the Veterans' Administration to get reimbursed for the care it would provide above and beyond those veterans it is currently treating. 
   This legislation is budget neutral and is limited in scope, capping Medicare trust fund payments to the Veterans' Administration at $50 million per year for 3 years, payments that would otherwise go to private-sector providers. 
   Mr. President, veterans want the option of getting their Medicare-covered care at the VA. 
   The VA wants the option. And we ought to move expeditiously to get this demonstration project underway. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. This bill will give all our nations' veterans the freedom to choose where they receive their  medical care. I am joined by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senators SPECTER and ROCKEFELLER, as well as Senators THURMOND, MURKOWSKI, CAMPBELL, CRAIG, HUTCHINSON, MCCAIN, SNOWE, DASCHLE, GRAHAM, AKAKA, WELLSTONE, MURRAY, HOLLINGS, CLELAND, LANDRIEU, JOHNSON, and my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY.  
   Known to some as ``Medicare Subvention,'' this legislation will authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to set up 10 pilot sites around the country where Medicare-eligible Veterans could get Medicare-covered services at a Veterans hospital. The VA would then be reimbursed at a slightly reduced rate for provision of those services. Many Medicare-eligible veterans want to receive their care at a VA facility. This bill would allow certain veterans that option. 
   My legislation would implement a pilot project that is eagerly sought by both the Veterans Administration and the Veterans Service Organizations. Veterans want the right to choose where they get their Medicare-covered services. Many of them would like to go to a Veterans Administration facility where they would feel more comfortable. We want to make that option possible for those who have given so much of themselves in service to their country. 
   Our legislation starts with a 10-site demonstration project, limiting total Medicare reimbursements to $50 million annually. The VA is required to maintain its current level of effort, and provisions in the bill prevent it from shifting any current costs to the Medicare Trust Fund. In 
   the event that the demonstration project in any way increased Medicare's costs, the VA would reimburse Medicare for these costs and suspend or terminate the program. 
   An independent auditor would monitor the demonstration project annually and make reports to Congress on its findings. A final report to Congress three and a half years after commencement of the project from the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services would recommend whether to terminate, continue or expand the program. 
   Almost two years ago, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I successfully included similar legislation in the 1997 Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act. The full Senate endorsed this measure. Unfortunately, our amendment was later dropped in conference. 
   But we feel strongly that now is the time to enact this legislation. Veterans want and deserve this option, and the VA should be allowed to become a Medicare provider. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Veterans Administration have already reached an agreement on how such a program would be implemented. It's time for us to give this project the green light. 
   In 1997 the Department of Defense Medicare Subvention program alleviated what our country's military retirees call a ``lockout'' from the military health care system. This bill will finish the job by allowing all our veterans access to the best and most appropriate health care facility of their choosing. Our nation's veterans deserve no less. 
   I look forward to working with the Senate Finance Committee, Secretary West and the Administration, the Veterans Service Organizations and my colleagues here and in the House to get this legislation signed into law this year.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. On January 7, 1999, the House of Representatives presented the Senate with two articles of impeachment against President William Jefferson Clinton. The articles charged the President with lying under oath before a federal grand jury and with obstruction of justice. In the days following the House's presentation of the articles, many have criticized the Senate for continuing on where the House left off. They argue that if there are not enough votes in the Senate to remove the President, then the Senate should not have bothered proceeding with the trial. While this may seem like a reasonable way of disposing of an unpopular process, the Senate has a Constitutional duty to hold an impeachment trial. Although the Constitution provides little guidance, one thing was clear: In order to fulfill this duty, we had to come together as a body and proceed in a manner that was judicious, deliberative and fair. That meant that before the Senate could make any decision on the articles of impeachment, each side had to be given the opportunity to present its case. 
   Now that we have heard from the House Managers, the President's counsel and viewed the deposition testimony of three key witnesses, it is the appropriate time to render judgment on the articles of impeachment. I must state at the outset that this has been one of the most difficult experiences that I have endured in my 23 years in Congress. 
   A. A Loss of Respect.   
   This process has been distressing on a personal level because I came into it with a great deal of respect and admiration for President Clinton. Over the past six years, we have enjoyed a good working relationship. While we do not share the same party and we often approach issues from different points of view, the President and I have worked together on a number of important projects. Given my esteem for the President, I have been saddened and gravely disappointed by much of what I have learned over the last few weeks. Whatever the final outcome, I will leave this trial with the knowledge that the President has indeed committed shameful acts, misled the American people and brought disrepute on the office of Presidency. By his own actions, he has ensured himself a place in history alongside President Andrew Johnson. 
   B. Setting An Important Precedent.   
   This process has been trying on a professional level because I recognize the enormous historical significance of my decisions. This trial will establish precedents to examine and judge the conduct of all future Presidents. While our founding fathers clearly intended impeachment for only the greatest offenses, confronted with a series of tawdry acts, the facts and circumstances do not neatly fit into the definition of ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' I am gravely concerned that a vote to convict the President on these articles may establish a low threshold that would make every President subject to removal for the slightest indiscretion or imperil every President who faces a Congress controlled by the opposing party. Yet, at the same time, I am concerned that a vote of acquittal could be mistaken by future generations to mean that perjury and obstruction of justice are not impeachable offenses. 
   II. HAVE THE HOUSE MANAGERS PROVEN THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? 
   A. The Standard of Proof: Clear and Convincing Evidence   
   The Constitution provides very little guidance to the Senate for its trying of the impeachment of the President. There is absolutely no reference at all to the standard of proof that senators shall use when evaluating the Articles of Impeachment. I believe the fact that the Framers gave this body the duty to try an impeachment, but no guidance as to what standard of proof to use in the trial, gives each senator the discretion to select the standard he or she deems appropriate. 
   In making my decision, I have focused on the nature of the proceeding; The impeachment trial is a unique process, it is neither criminal nor civil. I also focused on the purpose of the proceeding; The Senate holds an impeachment trial to determine whether there is proof that the President's misconduct rises to the level which demonstrates that he or she is no longer fit to hold office. 
   Given the nature and purpose of an impeachment trial, I have decided that the ``preponderance of the evidence'' standard would not be appropriate as being too low a standard. On the other hand, I believe that ``proof beyond a reasonable doubt'' would raise too high a standard. The question we must ask ourselves is: Do the President's actions demonstrate that he is unfit to serve, thus warranting his removal in order to protect the public? Since we are concerned with the public's protection I  would suggest that the clear and convincing standard, which lies somewhere in between, would be more appropriate to make the very fateful decision of removing the President from office. 
   Accordingly, I have used the clear and convincing evidence standard to judge the impeachment charges against President Clinton. I understand that this standard is little used, however, I feel that in impeachment trials it is most appropriate to use a standard that is somewhere in between the extremes. 
   B. Article I: Perjury Before the Grand Jury.   
   Article I alleges that the President provided perjurious false and misleading testimony before the federal grand jury. The House Managers applied the federal perjury statute found at 18 U.S.C.  1623 to the President's testimony. The elements of perjury are met when: (1) while under oath (2) one knowingly (3) makes a false statement as to (4) material facts. While I agree that some of the President's statements before the federal grand jury were false and misleading, I have concluded that some of the allegations simply do not rise to the level of perjury and that the House Managers have not proven the remaining perjury charges by clear and convincing evidence. 
   The first allegation is that the President committed perjury before the grand jury when he testified about the nature of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. In his testimony before the grand jury, the President admitted that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was ongoing and that it involved inappropriate intimate contact. Based on the House Managers' presentation, there is no doubt in my mind that the President's prepared statement to the grand jury was inaccurate in part. While I disagree with the House Managers' conclusion that the President's use of the terms ``on certain occasions'' and ``occasional'' were intentionally misleading, I agree with the House Managers that the President lied about when and how his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began. However, given that the President admitted to the key issue before the grand jury, I am not persuaded that lies about these immaterial details justify a charge of perjury. I also reject the related allegations pertaining to the President's testimony regarding the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case. 
   The second allegation of this Article is that the President committed perjury in his grand jury testimony by repeating the perjurious answers he had given in his civil deposition. The House Managers have certainly proven that the President lied about a number of issues in his civil deposition. However, Article I concerns the President's grand jury testimony, not his deposition testimony and the House Managers seem to rely upon the President's reaffirmation of his deposition testimony as proof that he committed perjury. Since I do not find that the President reaffirmed his deposition testimony before the grand jury, I reject this allegation of perjury. 
   The third allegation is essentially that the President committed perjury when he testified before the grand jury that he was not paying attention to Mr. Bennett's misstatement that the Lewinsky affidavit meant that ``there was no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form.'' Although the video tape of the President's civil deposition does show the President staring in Mr. Bennett's direction, we cannot know what the President was actually thinking at that time. We have all had moments where we appear to be paying attention to a speaker, when we are actually lost in our own thoughts. Because the House Managers could not possibly prove whether or not the President was actually paying attention to the exchange, they have not met the burden of proving that the President's testimony was false. 
   The final allegation in Article I is that the President testified falsely about his attempts to obstruct justice in the Jones case. I reject this perjury allegation outright because I believe it was improper for the House Managers to include a restatement of the obstruction of justice allegations within Article I. I have considered the obstruction of justice allegations in Article II. 
   C. Article II: Obstruction of Justice   
   The second article of impeachment charges the President with obstruction of justice. Article II charges that the President prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of justice, both personally and through his subordinates and agents, in a Federal civil rights action. To prove a case of obstruction of justice under the Federal statute found at 18 U.S.C. 1503, the House Managers must prove that the President acted with intent and that he ``endeavored to influence, obstruct or impede the due administration of justice.'' After considering these allegations, I have concluded that the House Managers failed to prove all but one of the obstruction of justice charges. My basis for this conclusion is the following: 
   The first allegation in Article II is that the President obstructed justice by having his friend Vernon Jordan assist Ms. Lewinsky in her New York job search in exchange for her silence in the Jones case. To prove this allegation, the House Managers presented compelling circumstantial evidence that Mr. Jordan assisted Ms. Lewinsky with both her job search and with her affidavit. The House Managers also pointed to the fact that Ms. Lewinsky received her job offer just two days after she signed a false affidavit. However, there are also circumstantial facts that belie the ``quid pro quo'' claim. First, there is evidence that the President enlisted Mr. Jordan's help well before Ms. Lewinsky's name appeared on the Jones witness list. Second, Mr. Jordan testified in his Senate deposition that he had ``stepped up'' the job search before he learned that Ms. Lewinsky was involved. On a final note, a conspiracy takes two willing actors. I would have a hard time convicting the President of this charge when both Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky have denied that there was any connection between the job search and the false affidavit. 
   Another allegation is that the President obstructed justice by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones case. The House Managers have shown that when the President informed Ms. Lewinsky that her name had appeared on the Jones witness list, he suggested that she might file an affidavit to avoid being deposed. To find that the President obstructed justice, however, I must infer from the evidence that the President was encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit. I cannot make this leap when Ms. Lewinsky herself testified that President Clinton made no connection between their false cover stories and the contents of the affidavit. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky testified repeatedly that the President never discussed the contents of the affidavit with her and that, at the time of their conversation, she did not think that the affidavit necessarily had to be false. 
   Article II also alleges that the President obstructed justice by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to hide his gifts. The thrust of the House Managers claim is that the President instructed Ms. Currie to pick up the gifts from Monica Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, so that Ms. Lewinsky would not have to turn the gifts over to Paula Jones' attorneys. I would agree that the 
   circumstances of the President's secretary, Ms. Currie picking up the gifts several hours after Ms. Lewinsky suggested to the President that Ms. Currie might hold onto them for safekeeping are certainly suspect. If the House Managers could prove that Ms. Currie initiated the gift pickup there would be clear and convincing evidence that the President was in fact encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to hide the gifts. Because there is conflicting evidence on this critical issue, the House Managers did not meet their burden. 
   In addition, Article II alleges that the President obstructed justice by making false and misleading statement to his aides about Ms. Lewinsky. Given that the President had an ongoing relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, it was spurious, mean spirited, defamatory and morally wrong for the President to refer to Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker or to in any way impugn her reputation. The House Managers and all of us have every reason to be incensed by the President's actions. That being said, it is clear that the President made these remarks in his continuing effort to conceal the true nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. There is no evidence that the President knew that these aides would be called to testify.  Therefore, I believe that this allegation has no merit. 
   While I found the other charges alleged in Article II to be either legally or factually deficient, there is one allegation of obstruction of justice which I believe that the House Managers have proven by clear and convincing evidence; the President's post-deposition statements to Bettie Currie. Ms. Currie testified that on two occasions in the days following the President's deposition in the Jones case, the President called her into his office and made a series of remarks to her ``You were always there when she was there, right? We were never alone. You could see and hear everything. Monica came on to me and I never touched her, right? She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.'' 
   I simply do not believe the President's explanation that he was questioning Ms. Currie in an ``effort get as much information as quickly as I could'' or that he was ``trying to ascertain what the facts were'' or ``what Ms. Currie's perception was.'' I am also not persuaded by the fact that Ms. Currie testified that she did not feel pressured to agree with the President. Rather, I agree with the House Managers that if the President was actually seeking information he would not have been asking rhetorical questions. I also believe that the President's explanation would be more plausible if his statements to Ms. Currie were not false. 
   The fact is that the President gave false testimony in the Jones deposition, that during his deposition he repeatedly referred to Ms. Currie as someone who could back up his testimony and that immediately following the deposition he summoned Ms. Currie into work on a Sunday and cleverly spoon-fed his cover stories to her. Despite the President's counsel's protestation, there was still a possibility that Ms. Currie could be called to testify in the Jones case. Accordingly, I believe that when the President called Ms. Currie to his office and repeatedly recounted these false statements he ``endeavored to influence, obstruct or impede the due administration of justice'' in violation of the federal obstruction statute. 
   III. HAS PRESIDENT CLINTON COMMITTED A HIGH CRIME WARRANTING HIS REMOVAL FROM OFFICE? 
   A. To Decide Whether the President's Actions are a High Crime, We Must Look at the Underlying Circumstances.   
   The House Managers has left us with the impression that once we conclude that the President has committed either perjury or obstruction of justice, we have a Constitutional duty to vote to remove the President from office. They maintain that perjury and obstruction of justice must be considered high crimes per se because they carry the same penalties as bribery. I reject this premise. In fact, the severity of a bribery sentence is dependent on subject matter and the amount of the bribe. Similarly, a conclusion that the President committed obstruction of justice should not automatically warrant his removal. It is incumbent upon each of us to examine the underlying facts and circumstances to determine whether or not the President has committed a high crime. 
   B. Background: How Did We Get Here Anyway?   
   Now, having found that the President is guilty of obstructing justice in the Paula Jones case, I had to determine whether the violation is a ``high crime'' warranting removal from office. This led me to think about what justice was actually being obstructed and to consider the underlying circumstances that brought us here today. 
   In the narrow legal sense, this entire impeachment trial rests on the Independent Counsel statute and the Paula Jones case. 
   As many of my colleagues remember, Congress enacted the Independent Counsel statute in the wake of the Watergate scandal, after President Nixon ordered the dismissal of special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox over his refusal to drop a subpoena for Nixon's incriminating White House tapes. Congress designed the Independent Counsel statute to insulate and protect investigations of alleged criminal conduct by the President and other high-level federal officials. Unfortunately, the statute has not worked as Congress envisioned it would. This well intended statute has resulted in a proliferation of interminable, expensive investigations against public officials. It has cost our taxpayers more than $130 million and considering all the time, effort and expense, there have been very few successful prosecutions resulting from the statute. 
   One such investigation under the statute originated in August 1994, when Judge Kenneth Starr was appointed as an Independent Counsel to investigate alleged wrongful acts in the so-called Whitewater land deal. During the course of the next four years, the Office of Independent Counsel (``OIC'') expanded its investigation of President Clinton a number of times. At the same time, the President was defending a civil rights action by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who alleged that President Clinton sexually harassed her during the time he served as Governor. Last January, the OIC was able to expand its investigation and redirect its D.C. based Whitewater Grand Jury panel to investigate the President's concealment of his extramarital affair with White House employee Monica Lewinsky. 
   We must not forget that the reason that the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was even an issue in the Jones suit was because Paula Jones was trying to show that the President's treatment of Ms. Jones was part of a pattern and practice of sexual harassment. Judge Wright initially ruled that Paula Jones was entitled to information on the so-called Jane Does, because that evidence might help establish the President's pattern of sexually harassing conduct. However, Judge Wright ultimately ruled that evidence about the President's harassment of other women would not change her decision to dismiss the case because Paula Jones failed to establish that she, herself was harassed. I quote from the Judge's April 1, 1998 decision:  
   One final matter concerns alleged suppression of pattern and practice evidence. Whatever relevance such evidence may have to prove other elements of plaintiff's case, it does not have anything to do with the issues presented by the President's motion for summary judgment, i.e., whether plaintiff herself was the victim of alleged quid pro quo or hostile work environment sexual harassment. ..... Whether other woman may have been subjected to workplace harassment, and whether such evidence has allegedly been suppressed, does not change the fact that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she has a case worthy of submitting to a jury. [emphasis added]  
   Why is this ruling so important in my decision? Well, we are essentially here today because the Whitewater investigation was expanded to determine whether President Clinton's efforts to conceal his consensual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky obstructed Paula Jones' right to justice. The plain fact is that the Jones case was thrown out because Judge Wright ruled that Paula Jones had no case and that even if the President had revealed the true nature of his consensual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, it would not have changed the outcome of Paula Jones case. While President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was morally wrong, there is absolutely no evidence that the President was sexually harassing Ms. Lewinsky. 
   Although I have concluded that the President obstructed justice by trying to influence the testimony of Bettie Currie, the fact is that the President's actions did not actually hinder Paula Jones. Indeed, in the midst of the OIC investigation, Paula Jones appealed Judge Wright's ruling and the President agreed to pay her $850,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Some might even argue that as a perverse result of the President's obstruction of justice, Paula Jones ended up with greater monetary relief than she would have otherwise received. Therefore, while the articles of impeachment came about as a direct result of President Clinton's actions in the Jones case, it is clear that in the end, the President's actions did not negatively effect Paula Jones' justice. In other words, there was no justice to obstruct in the Jones case. 
   C. Is the President Fit to Serve?   
   Most of us now believe that the President lied about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky when he testified under oath and that he also lied about the nature of his relationship to his staff, his family and the American people. I have concluded that the President not only lied about the affair but that he took at least one illegal action in an attempt conceal the truth from  Paula Jones. However, I believe that President Clinton took these steps to avoid deep personal embarrassment, not to seize, maintain or subvert the power of the state. 
   Let us not forget that the ultimate question we must each answer is whether on these facts arising out of these circumstances this President poses such a danger to the state that we can no longer permit him to remain in office. The ultimate issue here is a determination of whether the President is fit to serve. 
   Consider our constitutional guidance: The President of the United States ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The Framers intentionally set this standard at an extremely high level to ensure that only the most serious offenses would justify overturning a popular election. The concept of ``maladministration'' was considered and rejected. 
   I believe that whether the President's misconduct occurred in the private sphere or in his public or official capacity is also an important distinction to make when deciding his fitness to serve. Clearly, there are those private acts which in no way reflect on a president's fitness for office. On the other hand, there are public or official acts which I think no reasonable person would doubt reflect poorly on a president's fitness for office and would warrant impeachment and removal. I think we can all see the difference in gravity between the offenses of which President Clinton stands accused and a hypothetical accusation that he took a bribe. While the former reflects poorly on his character and discretion, the latter reflects on his fitness to serve and describes a classic case of abuse of office. 
   For the President to do what he did was reprehensible and morally wrong. I believe that the President lied to avoid embarrassment. However, the Framers did not envision such behavior as being encompassed by the phrase ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
   The bottom line is that old maxim that bad facts lead to bad law. Such a low threshold for removal of a president from office would be dangerous. After careful consideration, I have concluded that President Clinton has not committed an offense that indicates the President is not fit to serve. Therefore, I will not vote to convict President Clinton. 
   D. Time to Move On.   
   I do not want the President to come away from this trial thinking that he is forgiven, or that what he has done is not serious, because I think it was most serious. I do not want the people of this nation to think that a vote of acquittal means that the President's conduct is acceptable because it is not acceptable. Lying and obstruction are wrong. I also hope that my vote does not lend any credence to the notion that sexual harassment is not that important, because it is important. A determination to let the President serve out his term should not be taken as an exoneration of his actions. At the same time, I think it is extremely important that we leave this chapter behind us and move on to the nations' business.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on January 27th, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions approved S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. Given the conflicts presented by meetings related to the impeachment trial, our Democratic colleagues were unable to attend the executive session. 
   When this legislation was considered in the last Congress, it was adopted on a 17-1 vote with Senator WELLSTONE in opposition. Senator WELLSTONE remains opposed to this legislation, and provided the committee with a proxy so that he could be so recorded again this year. However, due to a misunderstanding and the absence of the Ranking Democratic Member, I did not exercise his proxy. I do want the record to indicate that Senator WELLSTONE remains opposed to this legislation.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with eight other members of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in introducing the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' I think it is solid legislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system for Americans. 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, with its jurisdiction of private health insurance and public health programs, I anticipate that the Committee will have an active health care agenda during the 106th Congress, including early consideration of patient protection legislation. In fact, on January 20th, the Committee held a hearing on the Department of Labor's proposed rules on health plan information requirements and internal and external appeals rights. 
   Last week's hearing builds on the foundation of 14 related hearings, which my Committee held during the 105th Congress. These included 11 hearings related to the issues of health care quality, confidentiality, genetic discrimination, and the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) implementation of its new health insurance responsibilities. And Senator BILL FRIST's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee held three hearings on the work of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). Each of these hearings helped us in developing the separate pieces of legislation that are reflected in our ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' 
   People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get their health care. The ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' requires full information disclosure by an employer about the health plans he or she offers to employees. Patients also need to know how adverse decisions by the plan can be appealed, both internally and externally, to an independent medical reviewer. 
   The limited set of standards under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) may have worked well for the simple payment of health insurance claims under the fee-for-service system in 1974. We have moved from a system where an individual received a treatment or procedure, and the bill was simply paid. In our current system, an individual frequently obtains authorization before a treatment or procedure can be provided. And it is in the context of these changes that ERISA needs to be amended in order to give participants and beneficiaries the right to appeal adverse coverage or medical necessity decisions to an independent medical expert. 
   Under the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' enrollees will get timely decisions about what will be covered. Furthermore, if an individual disagrees with the plan's decision, that individual may appeal the decision to an independent, external reviewer. The reviewer's decision will be binding on the health plan. However, the patient maintains his or her current rights to go to court. Timely utilization decisions and a defined process for appealing such decisions is the key to restoring trust in the health care system. 
   Another important provision of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' would limit the collection and use of predictive genetic information by group health plans and health insurance companies. As our body of scientific knowledge about genetics increases, so, too, do the concerns about how this information may be used. There is no question that our understanding of genetics has brought us to a new future. Our challenge as a Congress is to quickly enact legislation to help ensure that our society reaps the full health benefits of genetic testing, and also to put to rest any concerns that the information will be used as a new tool to discriminate against specific ethnic groups or individual Americans. 
   Our legislation addresses these concerns by prohibiting group health plans and health insurance companies in all markets from adjusting premiums on the basis of predictive genetic information; and it prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies from requesting predictive genetic information as a condition of enrollment. 
   Many of our colleagues argue that the current accountability structure of ERISA is insufficient to protect patients from bad decisions made by health plans. They would like to hold health plans accountable by removing the ERISA preemption and allowing group health plans to be sued in State court for damages resulting from personal injury or for wrongful death due to ``the treatment of or the failure to treat a mental illness or disease.'' 
   Mr. President, patients already have the right to sue their health plan in State court. Patients can sue health plans for personal injury or wrongful death resulting from the delivery of  substandard care or the failure to diagnose and properly treat an illness or disease. Furthermore, the courts have determined that health plans can be held liable for having policies that encourage providers to deliver inadequate medical care. 
   You simply cannot sue your way to better health. We believe that patients need to get the care they need when they need it. In the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' we make sure each patient is afforded every opportunity to have the right treatment decision made by health care professionals. And, we make sure that a patient can appeal an adverse decision to an independent medical expert outside the health plan. This approach, Mr. President, puts teeth into ERISA and will assure that patients get the care they need. Prevention, not litigation, is the best medicine. 
   As the Health and Education Committee works on health care quality legislation, I will keep in mind three goals. First, to give families the protections they want and need. Second, to ensure that medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients. And, finally, to keep the cost of this legislation low, so that it displaces no one from getting health care coverage. 
   Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a package that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' we have introduced today will be enacted and signed into law by the President.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today Senators KENNEDY, ROTH, MOYNIHAN, and I, joined by many of our colleagues are introducing the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. The reason for this broad bipartisan effort is both compelling and simple. Currently, individuals with disabilities must choose between working or getting health care. Such a choice is absurd. But, current federal law forces individuals with disabilities to make that choice. Our legislation addresses this fundamental flaw. 
   The federal government helps individuals with significant disabilities, who earn under $500 a month. Individuals, who have less than $2,000 in assets and have not paid into Social Security, receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) cash payments and access to Medicaid. Individuals, who have worked and paid into Social Security, receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) cash payments and access to Medicare. Yet, the current system offers no incentive for SSI and SSDI recipients to work to their full potential, to be taxpayers, to contribute to their well-being and that of their families. The facts bear out this assertion. Less than one half of one percent of the 7.5 million individuals on the Social Security disability rolls leave them. 
   Do these individuals really want to work? The answer is a resounding, ``Yes.'' Over the last 10 years, national surveys consistently confirm that people with disabilities of working age want to work, but only about one-third are working. 
   Are the numbers low because of discrimination or because of lack of skills? Congress has tackled these issues. We passed the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. It is against the law to discriminate against an individual on the basis of disability in employment as well as in all other contexts. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and most recently the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 contribute to the access of individuals with disabilities to the education and training they need to become qualified workers. 
   However, protection against discrimination is not enough. Access to education and training is not enough. Colleagues, the biggest remaining barrier is health insurance. Individuals with significant disabilities who meet the rigorous eligibility criteria of the Social Security disability programs cannot often get reasonably priced, appropriate health insurance coverage from the private sector. These individuals can only get health insurance from the government, and the government gives it to them only if they stay home, or at best, work a minimal amount. 
   It is difficult to measure fully the effect of having a job on an individual's life. It has a positive impact on a person's identity and sense of self-worth. Having a job results in satisfaction 
   associated with supporting oneself and one's family or at least not being a burden on it. If only one percent of the 7.5 million SSI and SSDI recipients go to work and forgo cash payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA), this would result in a cash savings of $3.5 billion to the federal Treasury over the lifetimes of these individuals. If we factor in the income taxes these individuals would pay, their lack of need for food stamps, subsidized housing, and other forms of assistance, that $3.5 billion dollar figure would be even higher. 
   Beyond the individual, there is another factor. Recently we learned that our unemployment rate, 4.3 percent, is the lowest it has been since 1956. Our economy, to stay vibrant and strong, needs access to a qualified and enthusiastic pool of potential workers fro which to draw. SSI and SSDI recipients are an untapped resource. Many of the jobs that currently go unfilled, in the service sector and technology industry, are the very jobs that many SSI and SSDI recipients are ready and willing to fill, if only they could have access to health care. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is targeted, fiscally responsible legislation. It would enable individuals with significant disabilities to enter the work force for the first time, reenter the work force, or avoid leaving it in the first place. These individuals would need not worry about losing their health care if they choose to work a forty hour week, to put in overtime, to go for a career advancement or change with more income potential. 
   Under current law, a poor individual with a disability who has not worked and not paid into Social Security, who meets rigorous criteria, receives monthly SSI payments. Once eligible for SSI cash payments, these individuals have access to Medicaid. In some states these individuals may have coverage of personal assistance services and prescription drugs through Medicaid. An SSI recipient who chooses to earn income, and then exceeds his or her state's threshold for earned income for an SSI beneficiary, loses SSI cash payments and access to Medicaid. 
   Also under current law, an individual who has worked and paid into Social Security, has a disability, and meets rigorous criteria, receives SSDI payments. After 24 months, these individuals have access to Medicare. Medicare does not cover the cost of personal assistance services or prescription drugs, items an individual with a disability may need to work at all. To access coverage of these items, an individual must spend-down his or her resources until he or she has under $2,000. Then, the individual can become eligible for coverage of these items through Medicaid in states where they are offered. An SSDI recipient who chooses to work and earns $500 monthly in a 12 month period, loses SSDI cash payments. SSDI beneficiaries continue to receive Medicare coverage after returning to work throughout a 39-month extended period of eligibility, but afterwards must pay the full Medicare Part A premium, which is over $300 monthly. 
   The bill would allow states to expand Medicaid coverage to workers with disabilities. These options build on previous reforms including a recent provision enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). The BBA provision permitted states to offer a Medicaid buy-in to those individuals with incomes below 250 percent of poverty who would be eligible for SSI 
   disability benefits but for their income. 
   The first option in our legislation would build on the BBA provision. States may elect to offer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities who work and have earnings above 250 percent of poverty. Even so, participating States may also set limits on an individual's unearned income, assets, and resources and may require cost-sharing and premiums on a sliding scale up to a full premium. 
   The second option in our legislation would allow states that elect to do so to cover individuals who continue to have a severe medically determinable impairment but lose eligibility for SSI or SSDI because of medical improvement. Although medical improvement for individuals with disabilities is inextricably linked to ongoing interventions made possible through insurance coverage, under current law improvement can jeopardize continued eligibility for that coverage. 
   The legislation requires that states not supplant existing state-only spending with Medicaid funding under either of these options and maintain current spending levels on eligible populations. 
   A state which elects to implement the first option or the first and second options would receive a grant to support the design, establishment and operation of infrastructures to support working individuals with disabilities. A  total of $150 million would be available for five years, and annual amounts would be increased at the rate of inflation from 2004 through 2009. In 2009, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would recommend whether the program is still needed. 
   The bill includes a ten-year trial program that would permit SSDI beneficiaries to continue to receive Medicare coverage when they return to work. This option in effect extends the current 39-month extended period of eligibility. 
   The legislation includes a time-limited demonstration program that would allow states to extend Medicaid coverage to workers who have a disability which, without access to health care, would become severe enough to quality them for SSI or SSDI. This demonstration would provide new information on the cost effectiveness of early health care intervention in keeping people with disabilities from becoming too disabled to work. Funding of $300 million would be available for the demonstration, which would sunset at the end of FY 2004. 
   The legislation eliminates other programmatic disincentives. It would encourage SSDI and SSi beneficiaries to return to work by providing assurance that cash benefits remain available if employment proves unsuccessful. Specifically, the legislation would prohibit using employment as the sole basis for scheduling a continuing disability review and would expedite eligibility determinations for those individuals that need to return to SSDI benefits after losing such benefits because of work. 
   We estimate the total cost of these health care-related provisions to be a total of $1.2 billion over five years. 
   Recognizing that some SSI and SSDI recipients will need training and job placement assistance and that they seek choices related to these activities, in our bill we include provisions modeled on Senator BUNNING's legislation that passed the House last year. These ``ticket to work and self-sufficiency'' provisions would give SSI and SSDI beneficiaries more choices in where to obtain vocational rehabilitation and employment services and would increase incentives to public and participating private providers serving these individuals. The ``ticket'' provisions would create a new payment system for employment services to SSI and SSDI beneficiaries the result in employment. For each beneficiary a provider assists, the provider would be reimbursed with a portion of benefits savings to the federal government that would occur when the beneficiary earns more than the current law Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) standard of $500 per month. These ticket provisions have been estimated to cost a total of $17 million over five years. 
   To assist individuals with disabilities to understand the myriad options available to them and their interrelationship, the legislation would create a community-based outreach program to provide accurate information on work incentives programs to individuals with disabilities, and a state grant program to help people cut red tape to access work incentives. For the community-based work incentives outreach program, up to $23 million per year would be provided for grants to states or private organizations. SSA would have the authority to provide state grants ($7 million annually) to provide help to beneficiaries in accessing the ``ticket to work'' and other work incentives programs. 
   The legislation would reauthorize SSA's demonstration authority which expired June 10, 1996. In addition, through mandated demonstration projects SSA is to assess the effect of a gradual reduction in cash benefits a earnings increase. Under current law, SSI recipients have access to a gradual reduction in their cash payments, but SSDI recipients do not. SSDI recipients lose cash payments immediately after earning $500 monthly in a 12 month trial work period. SSDI recipients participating in the demonstration would lose one SSDI dollar for every $2 earned. 
   Finally, the legislation directs the General Accounting Office (GAO) to study three issues: (1) tax credits and other disability-related employment incentives under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; (2) the coordination of SSI and SSDI benefits; and (3) the effects of the Substantial Gainful Activity (currently $500 monthly) standard on work incentives. 
   These provisions have been estimated to cost a total of $55 million over five years. 
   This legislation represents two years of work. It reflects what individuals with disabilities say they need. It was shaped by input across the philosophical spectrum. It was endorsed by the President in this State of the Union Address. It is an opportunity to bring responsible change to federal policy and eliminate a perverse dilemma for many Americans with disabilities--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, you don't. 
   This legislation is a vital link that will make the American dream a reality for many Americans with disabilities. Let's work together to make the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 the first significant legislation enacted by the 106th Congress.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending Senator NICKLES and all of the members who participated in putting the legislation together. I think it is solid legislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system for Americans, and I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.'' 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, with its jurisdiction of private health insurance and public health programs, I anticipate that the Committee will have an active health care agenda during the 106th Congress. In fact, on January 20th, the Committee held a hearing on health plan information requirements and internal and external appeals rights. And, this hearing builds on the foundation of fourteen related hearings that my Committee held during the 105th Congress. 
   People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get their health care. The ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus'' requires full information disclosure by an employer about the health plans he or she offers to employees. Patients also need to know how adverse decisions by the plan can be appealed, both internally and externally, to an independent medical reviewer. 
   The limited set of standards under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) may have worked well for the simple payment of health insurance claims under the fee-for-service system in 1974. Today, however, our system is much more complex, and there are many types of decisions being made--from routine reimbursements to pre-authorizations for hospital stays. And it is in the context of these changes, particularly the evolution of managed care, that ERISA needs to be amended in order to give participants and beneficiaries the right to appeal adverse coverage or medical necessity decisions to an independent medical expert. 
   The provision of our bill giving consumers a new right of an external grievance and appeals process is one of which I am particularly proud, since it is the cornerstone of S. 1712, the Health Care QUEST Act, which I introduced with Senator LIEBERMAN during the last Congress. Under the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus,'' enrollees will get timely decisions about what will be covered. Furthermore, if an individual disagrees with the plan's decision, that individual may appeal the decision to an independent, external reviewer. The reviewer's decision will be binding on the health plan. However, the patient maintains his or her current rights to go to court. 
   As the Health and Education Committee works on health care quality legislation, I will keep in mind three goals. First, to give families the protections they want and need. Second, to ensure that medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients. And, finally, to keep the cost of this legislation low so that it displaces no one from getting health care coverage. 
   Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a package that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus'' we have introduced today will be enacted and signed into law by the President.

    Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend our tax law's treatment of scholarships awarded under the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarship program. Although, as a general rule, scholarships are excludable from income, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that NHSC scholarships are includible in income. Imposing taxes on the scholarships could have disastrous effects on a program that for over 20 years has helped funnel doctors, nurse-practitioners, physician assistants, and other health professionals into medically underserved communities. 
   Under the National Health Service Corps program, health professions students are given a scholarship covering the cost of tuition and fees, together with a monthly stipend covering living expenses. For each year of scholarship funding, NHSC scholars are obligated, upon completion of their training, to provide a year of full-time primary health care in one of 2,000 designated health professions shortage areas. These shortage areas include the nation's neediest communities, both rural areas and inner cities. NHSC scholars who renege on their service obligations are required to re-pay an amount equal to three times the scholarship, plus interest. 
   Generally, the Internal Revenue Code provides that amounts received as scholarships are not includible in a recipient's gross income. There is an exception to this rule, however, when a scholarship is provided in exchange for services or a promise to perform services. Without such an exception, an employer could disguise compensation as a scholarship. National Health Corps Service scholarships, however, are not disguised compensation. Upon completion of their studies, the large majority of NHSC scholars do not work for the Federal government, which awarded them the scholarship. Instead, they work at places like low-income clinics or inner-city hospitals. Consequently, this is not a situation where an employer is transforming compensation into a scholarship. 
   I introduced a bill similar to this one during the last Congress. It was passed by the Senate as part of the Education Savings and School Excellence Act of 1998, and was included in the conference agreement for that bill. This bill was vetoed by the president, so the problem still exists. The conference committee also determined that amounts received under the F. Edward Hebert Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program should also be eligible for tax-free treatment. This is a program similar to the National Health Service Corps available to members of the armed forces. The bill I am introducing today also provides for exclusion from income for scholarships received under this program. 
   Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that providing an exclusion from income for amounts received under these two scholarship programs would have a negligible effect on budget receipts. I do not expect any change in that analysis, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Majority Leader in introducing the ``Educational Opportunities Act.'' This legislation extends programs authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and will serve as the foundation for our efforts this Congress to expand and strengthen those programs. 
   The 106th Congress will see the close of the 20th century and the birth of the new millennium. At such a time, one quite naturally begins to imagine the advances and challenges--the promises and perils--which lie ahead. As a nation, we have viewed the future with optimism. We know the march of civilization may at times be uphill, but we see it as nevertheless moving upward. We know as well that the success of our efforts will not rely upon luck, but upon hard work and thoughtful planning. 
   It comes as little surprise, therefore, that at this time in history our thoughts turn to education. From the kitchen table to the board room to the halls of Congress, education heads the agenda. That is as it should be, as we rediscover the truth in Aristotle's observation that ``all who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth.'' 
   Reauthorization of federal elementary and secondary education programs offers this Congress an opportunity to make a lasting mark on the programs and policies which will define the role of the United States in the coming century. Our international competitors have long observed and admired our system of education. Unfortunately, in all too many cases, the pupils have surpassed the teacher. We lag behind many of our competitors. We must pick up the pace, and we must do so without delay. 
   The renewed emphasis on education has stimulated thinking and has produced a wealth of ideas regarding the paths we should follow. As chairman of the Senate committee charged with pulling these ideas into a sound and coherent package, I am looking forward to a Congress which is both challenging and productive. 
   It is my hope that the Educational Opportunities Act will build upon the education successes of the 105th Congress. We enacted nearly a dozen important initiatives which touched the lives of students of all ages--from youngsters in Head Start and Even Start, to special education students, to high school vocational students, to college undergraduates and graduate students, to adults in need of remedial education. 
   These successes were possible because of a willingness to work together towards common objectives. In the United States Congress, we begin with 535 individual road maps marking a course to our destination. Arriving there will require the good faith give-and-take which has characterized our finest moments as a democracy. 
   The legislation which Senator LOTT and I are introducing today does not fill in all the blanks regarding federal elementary and secondary education policy. What it does do is set the cornerstone for a final product in which I believe each and every member of Congress will take pride. 
   The findings and purposes contained in this legislation are intended to underscore the basic building blocks of  success; parental involvement, qualified teachers, a safe learning environment, and a focus on high achievement by all students. 
   Everyone has a role to play in assuring our students acquire the knowledge and skills they need to make the United States number one in the world. 
   Parents are the first and most consistent educators in a child's life. Reading to young children and emphasizing the importance of education instils a love of learning which lasts a lifetime. 
   The teacher in the classroom is at the core of educational improvement. Without a strong, competent, well prepared teaching force, other investments in education will be of little value. It has been 15 years since the national crisis in education was raised by the ``A Nation At Risk'' report. The admonition was given in these terse words: If a foreign government has imposed on us our educational system we would have declared it an act of war. 
   Yet little has changed. There is some improvement in science but little in math. Children are coming to school slightly more prepared to learn, but this is primarily in the area of health. 
   It is obvious that nothing is going to change unless it changes in the classroom. And nothing will change in the classroom until the teachers change. And the teachers can't be expected to change until they have help in knowing what is expected of them. 
   The Higher Education Amendments enacted into law last October took significant steps towards demanding excellence from our teacher preparation program. With the Educational Opportunities Act, we now have the opportunity to focus on those already in the teaching force. 
   State and local officials are also important players. Not only do they provide the bulk of financial support for elementary and secondary education in the country, they are also undertaking significant initiatives to determine what children should know and to assess whether they have mastered that material. 
   The federal government, since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was initiated in 1965, has offered support for these efforts--as well as providing critical additional resources to offer extra help to educationally disadvantaged students. In addition, the federal government makes a significant investment in research. A key challenge for us will be determining how the federal investments can be most effectively targeted. The research we support must not only be sound but must also be useful and readily available to states and localities. 
   Ultimately, the focus of all of our efforts must be on the student in the classroom. The training of teachers, the establishment of expectations, and the development of assessments are all pieces of the puzzle which take shape in the classroom itself. If we keep that objective foremost in mind, we will build the educational system we need and that our children deserve.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on this first legislative day of the 106th Congress I rise in the Senate Chamber to express my strong support for the bill Senator SNOWE and I are introducing and urge my Senate colleagues to join as cosponsors of this important legislation. 
   Throughout the last Congress the Senate spent many legislative hours debating campaign finance reform. In fact, since my election to the House in the wake of the Watergate scandal, I have spent many long hours working with my colleagues to craft campaign finance reform legislation that could endure the legislative process and survive a constitutional challenge. We came close in 1994 and last year, and I believe circumstances still remain right for enactment of meaningful campaign finance reform during this Congress. 
   I believe that the irregularities associated with our recent campaigns, and especially in the 1996 elections, point out the fact that current election laws are not being strongly enforced or working to achieve the goals that we all have for campaign finance reform. The proof obtained from the hearings in both the House and the Senate on campaign finance abuses should alone be enough to motivate my colleagues to complete work on this issue in the Senate. Without action, these abuses will become more pronounced and widespread as we go from election to election. 
   The Snowe-Jeffords bill, the Advancing Truth and Accountability of Campaign Communications Act (ATACC), will boost disclosure requirements and tighten the rule on expenditures of corporate and union treasury funds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election. 
   I would like to begin with a story that may help my colleagues understand the need for this legislation, and that many of my colleagues may understand from their own campaigns. Two individuals are running for the Senate and have spent the last few months holding debates, talking to the voters and traveling around the state. Both candidates feel that they have informed the voters of their thoughts, views and opinions on the issues, and that the voters can use this information to decide on which candidate they will support. 
   Two weeks before the day of the election a group called the People for the Truth and the American Way, let's say, begins to run television advertisements which include the picture of one of the candidates and that candidate's name. However, these advertisements do not use the express terms of ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' These advertisements discuss issues such as the candidate's drinking, supposed off-shore bank accounts and the failure of the candidate's business. 
   The voters do not know who this group is, who are its financial backers and why they have an interest in this specific election, and under our current election law the voters will not find out. Thus, even though the candidates have attempted to provide the voters with all the information concerning the candidate's views on the issues, they will be casting their vote lacking critical information concerning these advertisements. 
   Some people may say that voters do not need this information. But as James Madison said, ``A popular government without popular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' 
   Mr. President, the ATACC act will arm the people with the knowledge they need in order to sustain our popular government. And the need to arm the people with this knowledge is becoming greater every year. As my colleague Senator SNOWE has stated, the amount of money spent on issue advocacy advertising is increasing over time at an alarming rate. In the 1995-1996 election cycle an estimated $135-150 million was spent on issue advocacy, while in the recently completed cycle an estimated $275-340 million was expended on these types of advertisements. This is a doubling of the amount of money spent on issue advocacy ads in one election cycle, and I fear entering an election cycle that includes a Presidential election that we may see at least another doubling of these type of expenditures. 
   I have long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' The  disclosure requirements in the ATACC act are narrow and tailored to provide the electorate with the important pertinent information they will need to make an informed decision. Information included on the disclosure statement includes the sponsor of the advertisement, amount spent, and the identity of the contributors who donated more than $500. Getting the public this information will greatly help the electorate evaluate those who are seeking federal office. 
   Additionally, this disclosure, or disinfectant as Justice Brandeis puts it, will also help deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption that many already feel pervades our campaign finance system. This, too, is an important outcome of the disclosure requirements of this bill. Getting this information into the public purview would enable the press, the FEC and interest groups to help ensure that our federal campaign finance laws are obeyed. If the public doesn't feel that the laws Congress passes in this area are being followed, this will lead to a greater level of disillusionment in their elected representatives. Exposure to the light of day of any corruption by this required disclosure will help reassure our public that the laws will be followed and enforced. 
   While our bill focuses on disclosure, it will also prohibit corporations and unions from using general treasury monies to fund these types of electioneering communications in a defined period close to an election. Since 1907, federal law has banned corporations from engaging in electioneering. In 1947, that ban was extended to prohibit unions 
   from electioneering as well. The Supreme Court has upheld these restrictions in order to avoid the deleterious influences on federal elections resulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital. By treating both corporations and unions similarly we extend current regulation cautiously and fairly. I feel that this prohibition, coupled with the disclosure requirements, will address many of the concerns my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have raised with regards to our current campaign finance laws. 
   Mr. President, I think it is important to clarify at this time some of the things that this bill will not do. It will not prevent grass-roots lobbying communications, it does not cover printed material, nor require the text or a copy of the advertisement to be disclosed. Finally, it does not restrict how much money can be spent on ads, nor restrict how much money a group raises. These points must be expressed early on to ensure that my colleagues can clearly understand what we are and are not attempting to do with our legislation. 
   We have taken great care with our bill to avoid violating the important principles in the First Amendment of our Constitution. This has required us to review the seminal cases in this area, including Buckley v. Valeo. Limiting corporate and union spending and disclosure rules has been in area that the Supreme Court has been most tolerant of regulation. We also strove to make the requirements sufficiently clear and narrow to over come unconstitutional claims of vagueness and over breadth. 
   Mr. President, I wish I could guarantee to my colleagues that these provisions would be held constitutional, but as we found out with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, even with near unanimous support, it is difficult to gauge what the Supreme Court will decide on constitutional issues. However, I feel that the provisions we have created follow closely the constitutional roadmap established by the Supreme Court by the decisions in this area, and that it would be upheld. 
   I know that campaign finance reform is an areas of diverse viewpoints and beliefs. However, I feel that the ATACC act offers a constructive and constitutional solution that addresses some of the problems that have been expressed concerning our current campaign finance system. The American people are watching and hoping that we will have a fair, informative and productive debate on campaign finance reform. I know that the proposal that Senator SNOWE and I have put forward will do just that. 
   The electorate has grown more and more disappointed with the tenor of campaigns over the last few years, and this disappointment is reflected in the low number of people that actually participate in what makes this country and democracy great, voting. I feel that giving the voters the additional information required by our legislation will help dispel some of the disillusionment the electorate feel with our campaign system and reinvigorate people to participate again in our democratic system. 
   In conclusion, the very basis of our democracy requires that an informed electorate participate by going to the polls and voting. The ATACC act will through its disclosure requirements inform our electorate and lead people to again participate in our democratic system.

   Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am joining with my colleague from New York, Senator MOYNIHAN, to introduce a bill that will eliminate an aspect of our internal revenue laws that is fundamentally unfair to taxpayers with income from foreign sources. 
   Under our system of taxation, U.S. citizens and domestic corporations earning income from sources outside the United States are subject to U.S. tax on that foreign-source income. In all likelihood, that income will also be subject to tax by the country where it was earned. Thus, the same income could be taxed twice, by two different countries. To guard against the double taxation of this income, the tax code allows taxpayers to offset their U.S. tax on foreign-source income with the foreign taxes paid on that income. This is accomplished by means of a foreign tax credit; that is, the foreign tax paid on foreign source income is credited against the U.S. tax that would otherwise be payable on that income. The details of the foreign tax credit rules are extraordinarily complex. (Indeed, virtually all of the Internal Revenue Code's provisions governing international taxation are complex.) The basic principle underlying the foreign tax credit rules, however, is simple: to provide relief from multiple taxation of the same income. 
   Many U.S. taxpayers have to perform two tax computations. First, they compute their ``regular tax.'' Then, they compute their ``alternative minimum tax'' (AMT). As a rule, taxpayers pay the larger of these two computations, the ``regular tax'' or the AMT. The AMT was enacted to ensure that taxpayers qualifying for various tax ``preferences'' allowed by the Internal Revenue Code must pay a minimum amount of tax. While foreign tax credits guard against double taxation in the ``regular tax'' computation, the principle of providing relief from double taxation falls by the wayside in the AMT computation. Under AMT rules, the allowable foreign tax credit is unlimited to 90 percent of a taxpayer's alternative minimum tax liability. Because of this limitation, income subject to foreign tax is also subject to U.S. tax. This rule operates to ensure double taxation, and the result is double (and even triple) taxation of income. 
   There is no sound policy reason for denying relief from double taxation to taxpayers subject to the AMT. The foreign tax credit is not a ``preference'' that serves as an incentive for a particular activity or behavior, rather, it simply reflects the fundamental principle that income should not be subject to multiple taxation. The 90 percent limitation was enacted as part of the 1986 tax bill solely as a method of raising revenue. The bill that Senator MOYNIHAN and I are introducing today will eliminate the AMT's 90 percent limitation on foreign tax credits. Eliminating this limitation will mean that taxpayers subject to the AMT will get the same relief from double taxation allowed to taxpayers subject to the regular tax.
