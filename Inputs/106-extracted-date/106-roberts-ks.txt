   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, there has been some discussion on the floor in reference to this bill, the Defense authorization bill, on the merits of including a hate crimes provision. I am struck by the fact that we have just witnessed an international terrorist hate crime with the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, leaving, according to my notes, 5 dead and 36 wounded, 12 missing. All of our U.S. military are on alert in terms of force protection. Our intelligence services are working full time to make sure that we have the proper force protection as they do their duty. In fact, I think that is a hate crime to which this particular bill speaks. 
   I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished chairman. While Members on both sides have strong feelings about the hate crimes bill, in no way should this defense authorizations bill be further held up or impeded. 
   I express my sincere condolences, as my colleagues have, to the families and friends of the crewmembers of the U.S.S. Cole who were killed and injured today in the Port of Aden in Yemen. They died or they were injured in the services of this Nation, and we all feel their sacrifice. The apparent--I say ``apparent''; I think we all know it was--terrorist attack on the U.S. ship was brutal, it was unprovoked, it was an act of terrorism. All the information is not yet available to determine the source and the motivation of the attack. The Government of Yemen has said they are certainly not involved, so we have to reserve judgment on the response, if this is a terrorist strike. 
   No matter what the cause of the explosion, this again points out the risks that our service men and women face every day. We have to be ready every day. There is no strategic response to terrorism in regard to the service they provide to our Nation. 
   We must never forget that we ask the members of the military to be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy, and, unfortunately, they are the obvious targets of terrorist groups. 
   I have the privilege of being the chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee. As has been indicated by Senator LEVIN and others, we have the responsibility to make sure we are ready and we have the proper resources to combat terrorism. 
   I can make a solemn promise to the families involved and to our military: We are going to continue to do our very best budgetwise and our very best in regard to legislation and policy to assure the force protection that we must have to protect our troops. 
   I rise to add my compliments to the chairman and the distinguished ranking member, Senator LEVIN, of the Armed Services Committee on a job that I think is well done. Through their hard work and their perseverance over the last legislative year, and in particular in regard to the conference with our colleagues in the House, we are presenting to the Senate a bill that will make significant 
   progress. 
   Senator SESSIONS has made what I consider to be an excellent speech on the state of military readiness, the problems and the challenges we face. I see the distinguished chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, the Armed Services Committee, Senator INHOFE, who does a splendid job in that regard. He has been sounding the alarm for years in regard to the readiness problems we face. We will make significant progress toward stopping what I call the readiness drain now facing our military. It is not enough, but this bill does actually lay down a marker that the Congress is very serious, that the committee is very serious about its commitment to reversing the damaging readiness cuts. We owe the men and women of the Armed Forces nothing less. 
   Over time, the last several years, we have authorized significant increases in pay. We have certainly done a better job in regard to the retirement system. We reformed that. As the distinguished chairman and the ranking member have pointed out, under the health care banner, we are now providing health care for the military retired. That is an obligation we must keep. 
   As I have indicated, I have the privilege to serve as the chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I am very proud of our accomplishments this year in the subcommittee. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, for his assistance, as well as all the members of the subcommittee, working in a bipartisan fashion to produce this work product. 
   Behind the success was the hard work of our staff. I have always said that there are no self-made men or women in public office today. It is your friends who make you what you are. I put staff in that category. We are only as good as our staff in terms of the work product we are able to pass. I take this opportunity to thank them. They are not expecting this, but I want to take this opportunity to present: The head of our Emerging Threats and Capabilities ``posse,'' if I can refer to us in that  vein, and who I consider to be the iron lady and the iron fist of the science and technology world, Ms. Pam Ferrell; Mr. Military Transformation, who did an outstanding job, Mr. Chuck Alsap; the strong duo dealing with counterterrorism, the very subject we are dealing with today, even as I speak, as the 250 members of the U.S.S. Cole try to right the ship and save the ship, is Mr. Ed Edens and Mr. Joe Sixeas; the guy, the young man or the staffer that the drug cartels probably fear as much as anybody, Mr. Cord Sterling; our cyber warrior, Mr. Eric Thommes; and our tough negotiator in dealing with the Russian programs, the counterthreat reduction programs, an investment for us, and we think an investment for the Russians, as well, Miss Mary Alice Hayward; and the cleanup hitter, Miss Susan Ross. 
   I thank each and every one of them for their hard work, their professionalism, and the work product we were able to produce. 
   There are many successes for this year I want to address, but time is an issue. 
   I know the Senators from Oklahoma and Iowa want to make some remarks, but there are four areas I would like to highlight of which I am especially proud. 
   First, we have two educational programs designed to increase research and the number of technically trained Americans. We have a technology personnel gap. I do not know what the acronym is for that. We hear about gaps in the past in terms of arguments in regard to the military. But, boy, this is a gap that is real and it is a gap that must be filled. 
   We have authorized $15 million to establish what is called an Information Security Scholarship Program for the Secretary of Defense to award grants to institutions of higher education to establish or improve programs in information security and to provide scholarships to persons who would pursue a degree in information assurance in exchange for a commitment of service within the Department of Defense. That is a breakthrough. 
   Senator WARNER gave his personal leadership to this. As a matter of fact, it is his initiative. I like to think I had something to do with it, as well as all members of the committee in a bipartisan fashion. 
   We have also authorized $5 million to establish something called an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information Protection. This institute will conduct research in technology development in the area of information assurance and to facilitate the exchange of information with regard to cyber threats, technology tools, and other relevant issues. 
   Again I go back to the technology personnel gap. This will assist us to really close that gap. As a matter of fact, when we asked the experts in our subcommittee, What keeps you up at night? they mentioned a lot of things, but they mentioned two things of priority interest. No. 1 is the possibility of the use of biological weaponry by some state-supported terrorist or non-state-supported terrorist. The second thing they worry about is cyber attacks, information warfare. So we think this institute is long overdue. We have authorized $5 million. That is going to get it started. 
   The second thing I would like to mention is that we ensure that the Department of Defense will focus real coordination in their responsibilities to combat terrorism activities through a single office. We had four people before the subcommittee testifying in regard to DOD responsibilities and the challenge they face in regard to terrorism, so I asked the witnesses: Would you sit in order of your authority. Nobody knew where to sit--No. 1, 2, 3, 4--because they didn't know. We had so many people within the DOD who shared partial responsibility for this that we did not find one person in charge. So that is what we are going to have after this bill passes. 
   We made a suggestion on the Senate side; we really singled it out and put it in a particular person's area of responsibility. The House came back and said let's let the Secretary of Defense decide that. But I will tell you again, we are going to ensure the Department of Defense is focused in regard to their responsibilities to combat terrorism through one single office. 
   We included a provision that would designate one Assistant Secretary of Defense as the principal civilian advisor to the Secretary for Department of Defense activities for combating terrorism--one guy in charge, one lady in charge, one person in charge. This provision ensures there is a single individual 
   within the Department responsible for providing focused and comprehensive and well-funded DOD antiterrorism policy. 
   I have said that about three times now, but three times I want to say how important that is. I think it is a real step forward. 
   The third area is to reduce the risk of the expansion of weapons of mass destruction and to help provide opportunities to Russian scientists outside of their weapons development. We authorized over $1 billion for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs for the Departments of Defense and Energy to assist nations of the former Soviet Union in preventing the expansion of their weapons of mass destruction and dissemination of their scientific expertise. This is a program really started by Senator Nunn and Senator LUGAR. Conferees included several initiatives to obtain greater Russian commitment to these programs--these programs are not without controversy--and the necessary U.S. access to ensure these programs do achieve their threat reduction goals. 
   We authorized $443.4 million for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program for fiscal year 2001 to reduce the threat posed by the former Soviet Union weapons of mass destruction. So, let's see, there is $443.4 and $1 billion for the nonproliferation and threat reduction programs. That is quite an investment to assist the Russians, to work together with the Russians to reduce that kind of capability. 
   Last, I would like to say to help the military continue to put a solid effort in the invaluable area of science and technology and to ensure we are ready to address the emerging threats, we added $209 million for the Defense Science and Technology Program; that is the S&T programs, the science and technology programs. We focused on revolutionary technologies to meet the emerging threats. And we required the services to undertake a comprehensive planning process to identify long-term technological needs in consultation with the warfighting and the acquisition communities, and to ensure that the services' programs in regard to science and technology are appropriately designed to support these needs. 
   I could list some other significant accomplishments in the joint warfighting area, in the continued focus on helping our military communities prepare for the possibility that they may have to handle the consequences of a terrorist attack on our homeland. 
   We all know about the U.S.S. Cole. That threat exists in regard to our domestic situation as well and in several other key areas where we have jurisdiction. But I am going to let that go. I will probably put something in the RECORD at a later date in regard to what I think we have done in meeting our responsibilities in that area. 
   Again, I thank the chairman, Senator WARNER, who has labored long and hard. We did this several months ago. We have been in conference for 2 or 3 or 4 months. In the rush to complete our business, we had all sorts of things pop up out of the woodwork, almost a gauntlet to get this bill done. I thank Senator WARNER, Senator LEVIN, all members of the committee for their leadership, their guidance, their help during the development of this year's Defense bill. 
   There is no more important bill. Our first obligation as Members of this body is to do what we can in behalf of our national security. Today's events certainly prove that is the case. That has been spoken to by the distinguished chairman. 
   I think it is a good bill. We need to get it passed, and it needs a big vote. It needs a big, solid vote for the responsibility we have to our men and women in uniform. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. He made a recent statement in regard to the very issue the Senator from Oklahoma is pointing out. I think it will be helpful if I read this, if the Senator from Oklahoma will permit me. This is somebody from the administration. He stated this:  
   We are trapped in a death spiral.  
   I do not think one could make it any more plain than that.  
   We are trapped in a death spiral. The requirement to maintain our aging equipment is costing us more each year in repair costs, down time, and maintenance tempo. But we must keep this equipment in repair to maintain readiness. It drains our resources--resources we should apply to modernization of the traditional systems and development of new systems.  
   Then the Secretary went on to say:  
   So we stretch out our replacement schedules to ridiculous lengths and reduce the quantities of new equipment we purchase, raising the cost and still further delaying modernization.  
   I do not think one can be any plainer than that. So the Senator's remarks are backed up not only from what we hear in testimony but also from the many bases at home and overseas. I thank my distinguished colleague for all the effort he makes from his personal time and other duties to go to bases all over the world. He checks with the enlisted; he checks with the NCOs; he checks with the officers; and he checks with the commanders and shows them his candor and integrity. We talked about this at great length. 
   In terms of readiness, there is no other person in the Congress of the United States or, for that matter, whom I know in this city who knows better the readiness problems we have, and it is backed up by this statement by a Secretary of the administration. We owe the Senator from Oklahoma a debt of gratitude.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise on the Senate floor today to pay tribute and to really eulogize one of our colleagues from the House of Representatives and a personal friend. I am speaking of Herb Bateman, the late Congressman from America's First District, the First District of Virginia. 
   As most of my colleagues know, Herb passed away last month following a rich life of public service, family commitment, and 18 years of distinguished service in the House of Representatives. Herb had announced his retirement last January, and in doing so, he had received well-deserved accolades and awards and letters of appreciation. They were from virtually everyone whose life he touched--and he touched many from all walks of life. I might add, the letters of appreciation and thanks are still being sent to newspapers in his district. 
   From September 12 through 14, Members of the House paid a very deserved tribute to Herb, and in doing so, really captured the essence of the man. The essence, simply put, is that Herb epitomized integrity in public service. I commend these moving and very accurate portrayals of Herb Bateman to the attention of my Senate colleagues. 
   Let me also say that the comments by our colleagues in the House also represented a most appropriate segue to the services that were held for Herb in his hometown of Newport News. I am compelled to say that I have never attended services more appropriate, more moving, and more fitting in celebrating the life of someone so respected and so loved. I was privileged to join many of Herb's colleagues and my former colleagues in the House; Senator BUNNING; the distinguished senior Senators from Virginia, Senator WARNER and Senator ROBB; and hundreds of friends and relatives who were in attendance. 
   There simply wasn't enough room in Our Lady of Carmel Catholic Church in Newport News last September 15 to hold all of Herb Bateman's friends and constituents who joined his wife Laura and their family, yes, to mourn his loss, but also to pay tribute and celebrate his life. 
   The remarks by Monsignor Michael D. McCarron were not only appropriate and especially uplifting in their religious context, providing Herb and Laura's family and all of us in attendance the strength and faith that we needed, but they also captured with humor and grace the perspective of one's life devoted to public service. 
   Herbert H. Bateman Jr., ``Bert'' Bateman, eulogized his Dad in moving remarks that only a loving son could give. Bert's eulogy was a gift of solace and comfort to his mother, his family, his sister Laura and her family, to all  of the relatives present--and with regard to that special father-son relationship we all would hope for--it was a gift to us all. 
   The last speaker during the service for Herb Bateman, was his long time Chief of Staff, Dan Scandling. And, it is Dan's eulogy that I am going to ask to be put in the RECORD today. 
   I do so for a special reason. 
   Dan Scandling's remarks are not only a fitting tribute to his boss, Congressman Herb Bateman, they also speak for all of the Bateman staff members during 18 years of Herb's distinguished service. They speak for Dan, and they speak for his long-time and valued executive assistant, Peggy Haar, and for all of the staffers who served Herb so well during his 18 years in the House of Representatives. 
   After hearing Dan speak, I believe his comments also represent that special relationship that most congressional staff members have with their congressman or their senator. 
   My appreciation for Dan Scandling's remarks, like others who are privileged to serve in this body, are because I am a former staffer--or as we say in Kansas, a bucket toter, if you will, in my case working for both a Senator and my predecessor in the House of Representatives. In each case, my boss was the Senator or the Congressman. So it was and is for Dan and all of the Bateman staff. They admired and loved him and their work demonstrated that and in turn their work earned the respect and gratitude of the people of America's First District. 
   I am fond of saying that there are no self-made men or women in public office; that it is your friends who make you what you are. In this respect Herb was indeed a self-made man but also made better by his friends, more particularly his staff. I am also fond of saying you are only as good--in terms of accomplishment and making a difference--as your staff. Herb accomplished much and made a difference. 
   Dan Scandling captured those thoughts and much more in his moving tribute to his boss, Congressman Herb Bateman. His personal tribute to Laura Bateman, a great lady, was especially appropriate and captured Herb's commitment and love for his wife. 
   Dan summed up the life of Herb Bateman and his public service attributes as only a trusted aid could do--Herb's credibility, integrity, his hard work and commitment to his fellow man. He also reflects on their personal relationship with honor and affection.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I commend his remarks to all Senators and more especially all staff in both the House and Senate. It captures that special relationship--the analogy might be--my boss, right or wrong--my boss. In the case of Herb Bateman and Dave Scandling the rightness of their work was 100 percent--there was no wrong. 
   In closing, I would like to quote Helen Steiner Rice to Laura Bateman, to the family, to the staff, and to the friends and constituents of Herb Bateman, my friend. 
 When I must leave you for a little while, Please go on bravely with a gallant smile And for my sake and in my name, Live on and do all things the same-- Spend not your life in empty days, But fill each waking hour in useful ways-- Reach out your hand in comfort and in cheer, And I in turn will comfort you and hold you near.  
   I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, my friend and colleague, for his comments. 
   I wasn't planning on doing this. But I might just provide 
   the chairman with a reflection. As he knows, we were in conference on the Defense authorization bill--the bill we are trying to get finished here. It is so essential to our Nation and our national security. There was not anybody in Congress who worked harder or who was more effective in regard to national security than our dear friend, Herb Bateman. 
   The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats on the Senate side, of which I am accorded the privilege of being the chairman, was meeting with several other subcommittee chairmen because the House does not follow suit in terms of our organization or duties and we think the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, which was largely formed out of the leadership of the distinguished chairman, encompasses so many different things that are so important to our national security. We were meeting in conference. The distinguished gentleman from the First District of Virginia came in, and he was a tad late. The only amendment we had that was still outstanding was the Bateman amendment. I asked Herb if it was a little late for his tee time. He laughed and said: No, not today but tomorrow. 
   I informed all those present that the Senate had strong feelings about Mr. Bateman's amendment--very strong feelings--and, despite that, we would accept the amendment under one reservation. Herb was a little concerned because it was a very fine amendment. He looked at me and said: Well, Mr. Chairman, PAT, friends and colleagues from the House, what would that reservation be? I said: Only if we call your amendment the ``Herb Bateman Common Sense Amendment.'' Obviously, it was agreed to and passed. 
   That was on a Thursday. We lost Herb over that weekend--something I could not believe as I came to work on Monday. But as I reflect back on that, it was probably his last amendment, and it was ``common sense,'' as he always stood for. 
   So from that standpoint, I think the distinguished chairman's suggestion about what we do in the next Congress is most appropriate. I appreciate his contribution. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to pay tribute and special thanks to Scott Kindsvater, who happens to come from my hometown of Dodge City, KS, who is a major in the U.S. Air Force and is a congressional fellow in my office. He is an F-15 pilot second to none. He is going to be assigned to the Pentagon. His tour of duty will end about the same time as the election. I thank him for all of his help, all of his homework, all of his study, and for gathering together the material that has been so helpful to me to take part in this foreign policy dialog. 
   I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator CLELAND. We again come to the floor of the Senate for what is our fifth dialog with regard to our Nation's role in global affairs and our vital national security interests. This effort has been prompted by our conviction, as the Senator has said, that such a dialog, such a process is absolutely necessary, if we are to arrive at a better bipartisan consensus on national security policy, a consensus our Nation deserves and needs but has been lacking since the end of the cold war. 
   Both Senator CLELAND and I have the privilege of serving together on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The distinguished Presiding Officer also serves on that committee and provides very valuable service. As a matter of fact, Senator CLELAND and I sit directly opposite one another. During hearing after hearing on the leading national security issues of the past 4 years, it became obvious that while we did not agree on each and every issue, we shared many similar views and concerns. I call it ``the foreign policy and national security eyebrow syndrome''; that is to say, when MAX and I hear testimony we think is off the mark, a little puzzling, or downright silly, 
   our eyebrows go up, and that is usually followed by a great deal of head shaking and commiserating. 
   The result has been a series of foreign policy dialogs: No. 1, what is the U.S. global role? No. 2, how do we define and defend U.S. vital national security interests? No. 3, what is the role of multilateral organizations in the world today and our role within them? No. 4, when and how should U.S. military forces be deployed? 
   Today Senator CLELAND has chosen a theme taken from the 19th century military strategist, Gen. Karl von Clausewitz, called ``The Trinity of War Making,'' or the role of government, the military, and the public in conducting and implementing our national security policy. 
   Finally, in closing these dialogs for this session of Congress by Senator CLELAND, I have prepared a summary of agreed upon principles which we suggest to this body that both he and I believe represent a suggested roadmap for the next administration and the Congress. 
   With regard to two of the Clausewitz so-called trinities, the need for government to gain public support for national security policy, Senator CLELAND already summarized our purpose very well when he said:  
   We must find more and better ways of communicating with our constituents on the realities of our national interests and the costs in securing them.  
   Senator CLELAND went on to say:  
   We must find more and better ways to increase the exchange of experiences and ideas between our Government and our military.  
   Finally, MAX said:  
   We must find more and better ways of ensuring that both the executive and our legislative branches properly fulfill their constitutional responsibilities in the arena of national security policy.  
   In this regard, I will comment on the first of Senator CLELAND's points, the fact that our political leadership must make sure that the public understands and supports the use of military force. 
   Former Joint Chief of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell asserted our troops must go into battle with the support and understanding of the American people. General Powell contended back in 1993 that the key to using force is to first match the political expectations to military means in a wholly realistic way and, second, to attain very decisive results. He said a decision to use force must be made with clear purpose in mind and added that if the purpose is too murky--and, goodness knows, we have had a lot of that in recent years--our political leadership will eventually have to find clarity. 
   As Senator CLELAND has pointed out already, unfortunately, today it seems that national security and foreign policy issues represent little more than a blip on the public's radar screen. Obviously, the public this evening will be tuned to either the baseball playoffs or the debate. He quoted news surveys and polls showing foreign policy and defense ranking last among issues cited by the public as most important that face the country. That is amazing to me. 
   A case in point: While we are all hopeful that the situation in the former Yugoslavia will result in the end of the Slobodan Milosevic regime and the possible transition to a more democratic government, U.S. and NATO military intervention and 
   continued presence in the Balkans lacks a clearly defined policy goal or any realistic timetable for any conclusion. As a result, while most Americans may have really forgotten about or are not focused on Kosovo today, nevertheless, 6,000 American troops still remain there and could remain there for another decade. That is a difficult sell with regard to public understanding. 
   In that regard, as Senator CLELAND has pointed out, Congress bears part of that responsibility. It is easy to criticize, but we bear part of that responsibility. Unclear political objectives do not allow our military leaders to create clear, concise, and effective military strategies to accomplish any specific goal. Unclear political goals lead to wars and involvement with no exit strategy. 
   A brief examination of the chain of events leading up to the use of force in Kosovo certainly proves the point: 
   On March 23 of 1999, the Senate conducted minimal debate regarding the use of force in Yugoslavia after troops had already been deployed. S. Con. Res. 21 passed, authorizing the President to conduct military air operations. 
   On March 24, one day later, combat air operations did begin. 
   On March 26, the President notified Congress, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, that operations began on March 24. 
   On March 27, after the fact, the House considered the use of force and failed to pass S. Con. Res. 21 on March 28. 
   On April 30, 18 Members of the House, having serious objection to that policy, filed suit against the President for conducting military activities without any authorization. 
   Then on May 20, 1999, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 finally passed, and it provided funding for the ongoing U.S. Kosovo operations. 
   On May 25, the 60-day deadline passed following Presidential notification of military operations, and the President didn't seek a 30-day extension, noting instead that the War Powers Resolution is constitutionally defective. 
   Then on February 18, 2000, a Federal appeals court affirmed the district court decision that the House of Representatives Members lacked standing to sue the President relative to the April 30 suit of the previous year. 
   I might add at this juncture that Senators CLELAND and SNOWE, I, and others had all previously successfully amended various appropriations measures mandating the administration report to the Congress specific policy goals and military strategy objectives prior to the involvement of any U.S. troops. 
   Most, if not all, of those reports were late, were not specific or pertinent to the fast changing situation in the Balkans. We at least tried. 
   And, Mr. President, I remember well the briefing by members of the Administration with regard to why the ongoing military operation in Kosovo was in our vital national interest. I still have my notebook and the list: 
   The Balkans represent a strategic bridge to Europe and the Middle East. 
   The current conflict could spin into Albania and include Macedonia, Greece and Turkey. After all World War I started in the same region. 
   We should act to prevent a humanitarian disaster and massacre of thousands of refugees. 
   If we do not act, it will endanger our progress in Bosnia. 
   The leadership and credibility of NATO into the next century is at stake.  
   We must oppose Serb aggression. 
   With all due respect Mr. President, these arguments did not match the fast-changing conditions in the Balkans. 20-20 hindsight now tells us the incremental bombing campaign and publicly ruling out the use of ground troops exacerbated the refugee tragedy. 
   The present Presiding Officer serves with me on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and we had a hearing after part of these problems developed. Somehow intelligence reports predicting the law of unintended effects went unheeded or were ignored. 
   And, in the end, U.S. stated goals changed when the original goals fell short. We were assured we were fighting, not for our national interest but selflessly to save lives and promote democracy, fighting in behalf of humanity. Mr. President, in my view, neither the Senate, the House or the administration can square these goals with what has actually taken place and is taking place in the Balkans. I don't question the intent. 
   The most optimistic lien today is that Kosovo is liberated after the mighty efforts of the U.S. led NATO coalition. Well, as described by James Warren of the Chicago Tribune, it is a liberated total mess. 
   He quotes British academic and international relations analyst Timothy Garton Ash, a professor at St. Antony's College, Oxford, who reviewed six books on the conflict with unbiased perspective. 
   According to Warren, most Americans have forgotten about the war by now, so they don't care much about the fact the so called winners are totally unprepared for dealing with peace. Violence and chaos reign in Kosovo. The victims and the ``good guys,'' the Kosovars have conducted reverse ethnic cleansing under the noses of U.S. and NATO troops. 
   We have, in fact, created a new Kosovo apartheid. Having failed to stop the killing, we are proving unable to win the peace or prevent revenge inspired reverse ethnic cleansing. 
   Moreover, since the Balkan war, badly fought and with no clear end game, other nations have increasingly been united in criticizing U.S. clout as we wield unparalleled power on the world stage and have reacted with what some refer to as a new arms race. 
   Since we can be sure there will be other calls for intervention in the world, it is incumbent on us to ask whether a more effective approach exists. 
   President Clinton has, in fact, proclaimed to the world, that if a state sought to wipe out large numbers of innocent civilians based on their race or religion, the United States should intervene in their behalf. Stated such, a public support can be garnered for such a policy. 
   But, as Kosovo has demonstrated, things are not that simple. As Adam Wolfson pointed out in his article within Commentary magazine; 
   Certainly the vast majority of Kosovars were subjected to harassment and much worse and their crisis was as President Clinton described, a humanitarian one. But, the Kosovars also had their political objectives and ambitions; an independent Kosovo ruled by themselves; a goal they press for today by political intimidation and violence. 
   The United States has, on the other hand, continued to oppose independence and has supported a multicultural society for Kosovo. Vice President GORE has said that in Kosovo there must be a genuine recognition and respect for difference and the creation of a tolerant and open society where everyone's rights are respected, regardless of ethnic or religious background and where all groups can participate in government, business, the arts and education. 
   These are fine and noble goals but they are ``ours'' not those of the Kosovars. We have two choices. First, we can accept the political ambitions for a mono-cultural and independent state purged of non Albanians or second, we can attempt to stay in Kosovo until we can somehow transform entrenched and long standing political and ethnic culture and teach the values of diversity and religious toleration. This is on small task and in my view, It may not sustainable over the long term both in terms of cost, benefit and public opinion. 
   Will the American people respond? Do they even care? In their book, ``Misreading the Public, the Myth of a New Isolationism,'' Steven Kull and I.M. Destler of the Brookings Institution, make the case that the notion that public attitudes are typified today by new isolationism, greater parochialism and declining interest in the world is simply not true. 
   They argue most Americans do not believe we should disengage from the world and support international engagement and for the United States to remain involved but with greater emphasis on cooperative and multilateral involvement. They also argue that when presented with facts, reasonable goals and alternatives, that public support can be gained. 
   That is the point, Mr. President. We have to do a better job. Member of the Senate need to participate in the daily grind of overseeing Administration policies, passing judgment, and behaving as a co-equal branch. When a majority, if a majority can be found, feels a President oversteps constitutional barriers or threatens to do so, we should respond with statutory checks, not floor speeches and sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. 
   In this regard Senator CLELAND has done us a favor with his proposal derived from the current system for Presidential approval and reporting to Congress on covert operations. Senator CLELAND has candidly pointed out his bill does not represent a consensus view and his introduction of the legislation is to stimulate further discussion. Let the discussion begin. 
   Mr. President, having spoken to the role of government and the public with the specific example of Kosovo, let me turn to the third topic of the ``Clausewitz Trinity'', the military. 
   Mr. President, I am sure that no General throughout history, be he Clausewitz or Eisenhower would condone 
   sending troops that are not ready into battle. In the not-mincing-any-words department, I am concerned and frustrated that our United States Military today is stressed, strained, and in too many cases hollow. 
   I often say in Kansas that our first obligation as Members of Congress is to make sure our national security capability is equal to our vital national security responsibilities. How do we do this? 
   One way is to do exactly what Senator CLELAND and I try to do and that is to personally visit our men and women in uniform stationed here at home and throughout the world. We, along with a majority of members of the Armed Services Committee, visit with and seek advice from the ranks; our enlisted, our non-commissioned officers, officers and commanders. 
   Mr. President, when doing that and when making remarks and observations before many military groups; active duty, reserve and guard units, I always acknowledge those in the military must operate and perform their duties within the chain of command. But, I also ask them for their candor and honesty. 
   And they have provide me and others that with spades. 
   Those in the Navy tell me the Navy cannot or soon will not be able to perform assigned duties with current force structure. The bottom line is there are not enough ships or submarines in the fleet and training and weapons inventories are inadequate. 
   Those in the Army tell me the training and doctrine command is almost broken and peacekeeping operations are taking their toll on combat readiness. 
   Those in the Air Force repeat what is common knowledge--pilot retention problems are legion. The Air Force is short about 1,200 pilots today. Strategic lift in both air and sea is inadequate. 
   The Marines tell this former marine they have significant problems in the operation and maintenance of their Harrier and helicopter fleet. They tell me they are meeting their recruiting and retention challenges but they are working harder and harder to achieve that goal. 
   Overall, those in command tell us--and the figures are plain to see--that operation and maintenance accounts have been robbed for eight years to pay for ever increasing peace keeping and now peace enforcement missions. 
   Spare parts are hard to come by, we are short of weapons both for practice and combat. Mission capable rates are consistently down. Recent press reports state 12 of 20 major Army training centers are rated C-4, the lowest  readiness rating. A Navy Inspector General Report says Navy fliers are leaving port at a lower stage of readiness. The Air Force reports that its readiness rates for warplane squadrons continues to decline. 
   Many units are on frequent temporary duty assignments or are deployed most of the year on missions that many believe are of questionable value. When the troops come home, their training is shortchanged based on the lack of time available for training and lack of resources. Maintenance required for old equipment takes significant time away from other missions, from family and it is very costly. 
   There is another related problem and challenge, that of morale. There is a growing uneasiness with military men and women that their 
   leadership either does not care or is out of touch with their problems. By leadership, I am including the Congress of the United States. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines tell me they are stressed out and dissatisfied and leaving. 
   This has been an anecdotal outpouring from military commanders in the field simply fed up with current quality of life and readiness stress. Pick up any service, military or defense publication or read any story in the press and what we have is equal opportunity frustration.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, with all those accolades, the Senator missed one--I had one other line in there. 
   I commend my good friend for his commonsense approach to our country's future. I thank him. I applaud him for his leadership. He has begun what I think is a trail-blazing initiative. This has been, as he has indicated, a year-long bipartisan foreign policy dialog endeavor. We thank staff and various folks on the floor for their patience. I learned a great deal from the distinguished Senator from Georgia. He said he learned from me. I learned from him. 
   As the Senator mentioned, we would now like to present our lessons learned from our year-long dialogs, these dialogs that we began because we both felt our foreign policy agenda had run aground. We wanted to start a series of these dialogs, these debates or colloquys, in order to arrive at a consensus concerning the future of our Nation's foreign and defense policies. 
   We condensed our five dialogs into seven foreign policy principles. These principles are not only a compilation of our dialogs, but also a summary of the lessons learned from the various discussions with colleagues, as the Senator has indicated, foreign policy elites, from academia and the government, and from several consultations with many military leaders. These seven foreign policy principles are simple. They are realistic. They are sustainable. We believe they would support and secure our national interests. We strongly believe the following principles are a step in the right direction. 
   We urge the next administration of Congress and all of our colleagues in the Congress to begin the process of trying to articulate a coherent national security strategy. 
   I again yield to the Senator from Georgia.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Here is principle No. 2 that the distinguished Senator and I have agreed upon. 
   The President and the Congress need to, first, find more and better ways to increase communications with the American public. We both have talked about this at length in our previous discussion with the American public on the realities of our international interests and the costs of securing them. 
   I could go into a long speech on how I tried to convince the Kansas wheat farmer that first he must have security, then he must have stability, then he must have an economic future, then he may get $4 wheat at the country elevator, but it all starts with security. 
   Second, it finds more and better ways to increase the exchange of ideas and experiences between government and the military to avoid the broadening lack of military experience in the political elite. 
   We must find more and better ways of ensuring that both the executive and legislative branches fulfill their constitutional responsibilities in national security policy concerning military operations other than declared war. 
   And, as a result of our second principle, Senator CLELAND sponsored the bill of which I was proud to cosponsor, S. 2851, requiring the President to report on certain information before deployments of armed forces. This bill basically requires the President to report information of overt operations very similar to the law requiring the President to report certain information prior to covert operations. It makes sense to me. I yield to the Senator from Georgia.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Let's try principle No. 4. We are the only global superpower, and in order to avoid stimulating the creation of a hostile coalition of other nations, the United States should, and can afford to, forego unilateralist actions, except where our vital national interests are involved.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Principle No. 6: In the post-cold-war world, the U.S. should adopt a policy of realistic restraint with respect to the use of U.S. military force in situations other than those involving the defense of vital national interests. In all other situations, we must: Insist on well-defined political objectives; determine whether non-military means will be effective, and if so, try them prior to any recourse to military force. We should remember the quote from General Shelton:  
   The military is the hammer in our foreign policy toolbox but not every problem is a nail.  
   We should ascertain whether military means can achieve the political objectives. 
   We should determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs (political, financial, military), and that we are prepared to bear those costs. 
   We should determine the ``last step'' we are prepared to take if necessary to achieve the objectives. 
   I wonder what that last step would be. It is one thing to have a cause to fight for. It is another thing to have a cause that you are willing to die for. In too many cases today, it doesn't seem to me that we have the willingness to enter into a cause in which we are ready to die but it seems to me we are sure willing to risk the lives of others in regards to limited policy objectives. That's not part of the principle. That's just an observation in regard to the last step recommendation. 
   We should insist that we have a clear, concise exit strategy, including sufficient consideration of the subsequent role of the United States, regional parties, international organizations and other entities in securing the long-term success of the mission--Kosovo is a great example. 
   Finally, insist on Congressional approval of all deployments other than those involving responses to emergency situations. 
   The Senator referred to the amendment introduced by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and that of Senator BYRD. I voted for that. I do not think it was an abdication of our responsibilities. 
   Again, those of us in Congress, the majority, should approve all deployments other than those involving responses to emergency situations. 
   I yield to the Senator.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a relatively new organization designed to enhance U.S.-Cuba relations. The Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy was created in early 1998 to foster better political, economic and cultural relationships between our country and Cuba. Its board is compromised of distinguished Americans, including some of our former colleagues in the Congress. 
   Clearly the time has come to bring ``responsibleness'' to the debate regarding U.S.-Cuba relations. 
   The Alliance has briefed me and my staff regarding their first-hand experience in Cuba. I encourage them to continue their fact finding and information gathering missions to Cuba.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, late in the afternoon of this coming Thursday, the U.S. Marine Corps will conduct a retirement ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, VA. 
   It would not be too surprising for all who know the honoree, if those legendary marines raising the flag atop Mt. Suribachi at the Iwo Jima Memorial and ensconced in statuary history might actually plant the flag, come to attention and give a proud salute to Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm. Now retired after 35 years of service and the former commander of the U.S. Southern Command, Charles Wilhelm has been the epitome of dedication, professionalism, and pride. Simply put, he has been a marine's marine. In paying tribute to General Wilhelm, my remarks are in keeping with the appreciation, admiration, and thanks of my colleagues in the Senate, more especially the chairman and members of the Armed Services Committee, all those privileged to serve on committees of jurisdiction dealing with our national defense and foreign policy and former marines who serve in the Congress. I think Charles Wilhelm was destined to serve in our Nation's sea service and become an outstanding marine in that he was born of the shores of Albemarle Sound in historic Edenton, NC. He graduated from Florida State University and later earned a master of science degree from Salve Regina College in Newport, RI. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1964 and saw two tours of service in Vietnam where in the full component of command positions, he served with distinction: as a rifle platoon commander; company commander; and senior advisor to a Vietnamese Army battalion. 
   For his heroism under fire, he was awarded the Silver Star Medal, Bronze Star Medal with Combat V, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, and the Army Commendation Medal with Combat V. General Wilhelm's other personal decorations include the Defense Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and Combat Action Ribbon. The last thing that Charley Wilhelm would want or stand for would be for some Senator like myself to stand on the Senate floor and list the rest of all of  the assignments and tours and accomplishments that make up his outstanding career. But, since I am on the Senate floor and relatively safe, I hope, from the well known and respected iron will of the general, a marine, who with respect and admiration and a great deal of circumspect care--certainly not in his presence--was called ``Kaiser Wilhelm,'' I'm going to give it a try. I do so because of the immense respect this man has within the ranks of all the services, U.S. and international, whohave served under his command. 
   General Wilhelm's service was universal in scope and outstanding in performance: inspector-instructor to the 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, a Reserve unit in Gulfport, Mississippi; Deputy Provost Marshal, U.S. Naval Forces Philippines; operations officer and executive officer, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, Camp Pendleton, California; staff officer for Logistics, Plans and Policy Branch, Installations and Logistics Department, Headquarters Marine Corps; J-3, Headquarters, U.S. European Command. Then in August of 1998, while assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force, Charles Wilhelm was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as the Director of Operations, Headquarters Marine Corps. Two years later, he was chosen to serve as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Policy and Missions within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict. 
   This experience served him well, when, as commanding general of the 1st Marine Division, General Wilhelm served as Commander, Marine Forces Somalia as part of Operation Restore Hope. I might add a personal observation at this point in stating with Charles Wilhelm, the United States has a respected resource with regard to the difficult but necessary challenge our military has in meeting vital national security interests and balancing those interests with the many, if not overwhelming, peacekeeping and humanitarian missions we find ourselves involved in today. 
   It goes without saying that in the past members of our military have been sent into peacekeeping missions where there was no peace to be kept. When that happens, why peacekeepers become targets and tragedy results. Gen. Charles Wilhelm knows the difference and we should take heed. He went on to serve in a series of command positions to include: Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command; Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic; Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, South; Commanding General, Second Marine Expeditionary Force; Commanding General, Marine Strike Force Atlantic. 
   General Wilhelm assumed duties at U.S. Southern Command in September, in 1997 where he served until his retirement just a few weeks ago. As commander of the U.S. Southern Command, General Wilhelm devoted his enormous personal energy--and boy does he have that--his visionary leadership and his remarkable diplomatic skills to achieving vital national security objectives and strengthening democratic institutions and governance--and thereby individual freedom and economic opportunity--throughout the Southern Hemisphere. 
   General Wilhelm's personal decorations are testimony to his valor and bravery. He is indeed recognized within the U.S. Marine Corps as a warrior among warriors. But, he is also part military and political theorist, diplomat, and humanitarian. He enhanced civilian control of military institutions throughout Latin America; he improved multilateral relations among the 32 nations--that is 32 nations and 12.5 million square miles stretching from Antarctica to the Florida Keys. 
   Concurrently, General Wilhelm oversaw the integration of the Caribbean into the command's theater, supervised the implementation of the 1977 Panama Canal treaties--no small feat--he energized United States Interagency efforts to counter the flow of illegal narcotics into the United States and finally, sought and obtained congressional support for the U.S. assistance plan for Colombia's counter drug program. While doing all of this in his 3 year stint, he restructured his command's architecture and theater engagement strategy to position the command to meet the challenges of the 21st century. I am tempted to say that in the midst of all this he rested on the 7th day but in fact he did not. 
   As chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee--that is the subcommittee of jurisdiction over virtually all of the missions within the Southern Command--I want the record to show that the general accomplished his goals at precisely the same time the Southern Command suffered tremendous budget and infrastructure challenges. That is the nicest way I can put it. He always said he did not have problems; he had challenges. That was due to U.S. involvement in the Balkans and the drawdown of the tremendous budget and essential infrastructure support to the general's mission and the mission of the Southern Command. 
   I do not know how, quite frankly, he accomplished his tasks. I might add, from my personal standpoint, in terms of our immediate and pressing challenges with regard to refugees, more than in the Balkans, the problems and challenges of immigration, drugs, terrorism, trade, the commonality of interests within our own hemisphere, and our domestic energy supply--we now get roughly 17 to 18 percent of our energy supply from Venezuela; there are real problems in Venezuela--our vital national interests, General Wilhelm has tried his very best to alert the Pentagon, the administration, and the Congress to these concerns and suggest rational and reasonable policy options. His advice is sound, based upon years of experience and hard, hard work. The value and worth of his policy recommendations, I will predict, and his cornerstone efforts to build on that success will be proven correct. 
   Carol Rosenberg of the Miami Herald newspaper recently captured what I am trying to say in an article that accurately describes the successes General Wilhelm has achieved and the character of the man as well. 
   Ms. Rosenberg simply put it this way:

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am not really surprised at this man's many accomplishments. Several years ago, our distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, took an overdue codel to Latin and Central America. I was privileged to go. On one of our first stops, we were briefed on the overall situation, again within the 32-nation sprawling Southern Command. Pressed for time, General Charles Wilhelm gave one of the most complete, pertinent, and helpful briefings I have ever heard. I have been a Wilhelm fan ever since, and I certainly value his advice and his suggestions. 
   General Wilhelm stated our vital national security interests very well when he said the following:  
   I see our future prosperity in the Americas, not in the Far East....... Forty-six percent of our exports flow within the Americas, 28 percent to the Far East and 26 percent to Europe. I see the balance shifting even more to the Americas over the first 25 years of this century. The future prosperity of the United States is linked to the Americas.  
   Throughout his career as a United States Marine, General Charles Wilhelm demonstrated uncompromising character, discerning wisdom, and a sincere, selfless sense of duty to his Marines and members of other services assigned to his numerous joint commands. 
   His powerful leadership inspired his Marines to success, no matter what the task. All Marines everywhere join me in saying to the general: Thank you  and well done. The results have guaranteed United States security in this hemisphere and throughout the world. 
   In behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our congratulations to him and to his wife Valerie and his son Elliot on the completion of a long and distinguished career, and I trust more to come. God bless this great American and Marine. Semper Fi, General, Semper Fi.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, Senator REID and I would like to offer a few observations at this point. I thank my colleagues for allowing us to proceed before them regarding the general order. 
   We want to offer a few observations with respect to what I understand is a proposal to remove Federal Judges and Justices 
   from the prohibition on honoraria, a proposal that would also remove the honoraria from the limitation on outside earned income. I strongly oppose that effort. 
   This seems manifestly a very wrong approach to what may be a very real problem. The alternative offered in this proposal of having the Nation's most esteemed jurists turn to the lecture circuit to supplement their salary, I believe, is simply unacceptable. The cost, it seems to me, would be too high. It would be measured in the further loss of confidence in the integrity of this Government's officials. Congress took an important step in trying to restore public confidence in the institutions of Government when it enacted  the honoraria ban as part of the ethics reform package way back in 1989. I remember the discussion of it and the debate well in the House of Representatives, as I served in the House at that time. We should not backtrack on that effort. If our Federal Judges and Justices need a pay raise, then by all means let's provide for one, but let's not retreat to the discredited practices of the past.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, my good friend, for his very kind remarks in reference to my service on the Ethics Committee. I repeat the same basic substance of what he said on his behalf as well. It is a thankless and tireless but a very important job. I thank him for his comments. 
   As chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, we obviously and naturally have discussed this. So I know the strength of his views on this matter as well. Not only do I think this would be a very dramatic step backwards for us in terms of the public's perception of integrity of its Government, but I think it would be terribly unfair to the most conscientious Judges and Justices. Because a Judge's income from honoraria would depend on how often appearances and speeches were made, those who dedicate the most time and attention to their job as a judge would end up benefiting the least. 
   As I have indicated before, if we have a problem--and I think we do--regarding salaries for Judges, we ought to address the problem in that way. 
   I yield to my friend.

<DOCNO>106-roberts-ks-2-20000921</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBERTS. First off, I thank the Senator so much for taking this time to draw attention to a very serious problem. I know the Senator from Maine is experiencing the same thing I am experiencing in Kansas and all Senators are experiencing when they go back home. Every hospital board--beleagured hospital boards--every hospital administrator, all of the rural health care delivery system--it is not only applicable to rural areas but all over--have been questioning me and our colleagues about when are we going to do something with regard to the Medicare reimbursement. 
   The Senator has indicated--I underlined it in the Senator's remarks:  
   It is also critical that Congress take action this year to address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.......  
   We should have done it this spring. The Senator from Maine and I talked about it. We should have done it last year. We did certainly provide that assistance. I wish we could have done that earlier. We are going to do that. 
   Then the Senator also said:  
   ......[and also some problems] which have been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration--  
   And the folks at HCFA.  
   That is a marvelous acronym, HCFA. I will tell you what, if that is not a four-letter word in the minds and eyes of people who have to provide health care services throughout our country, I do not know what is. Asking HCFA for help, if you are a hospital board or a hospital administrator, is like asking the Boston strangler for a neck massage. It just does not work. 
   My question is this: as I recall, there was strong bipartisan support for these provisions, but haven't they produced cuts in home health care spending far beyond what Congress ever intended? It is my understanding--and I want people to understand this--home health care spending dropped $9.7 billion in fiscal year 1999, just about half of the 1997 amount; is that correct?

   Mr. ROBERTS. The same complaints are made in Kansas. The same complaints are made throughout the country. The home health care agencies in my State--in fact, since January of about 2 years ago, 68 Medicare-certified agencies in Kansas have closed their doors, more than a 25-percent drop, more than a quarter drop. 
   These were not the ``fly-by-night'' agencies that some in the Federal Government and others in regards to various inspections--and you have talked about that we have heard about so much--many of these agencies had been in existence for 20 years. 
   The latest numbers from HCFA show that the total home health care visits are down by over 45 percent--almost half. The losers of this situation are not just numbers. It is just not accounting in regards to, say, HCFA. These are our Nation's seniors; in particular, those who are really sick. We are talking about the Medicare patients who are suffering through complex and chronic care needs who are already experiencing a lot of difficulty in the home care services they need. 
   So the same thing is true in Kansas as the Senator has pointed out in Maine. I, obviously, think it is true in every State.

   Mr. ROBERTS. The home health care agencies in my State, as I have indicated, also complain about their exacerbating financial problems. That is a very fancy word to say it has been made a whole lot worse by a host of the new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including the implementation of another marvelous acronym called OASIS. The thought occurs to me, if there is an ``oasis'' that is proposed by HCFA--we all remember the ``Survivor'' show that was so popular--there would be no survivors in regards to this OASIS, I can tell you. 
   OASIS stands for the new outcome and assessment information data set--new outcome and assessment information data set--new requirements for surety bonds, new requirements for sequential billing, new requirements for overpayment recoupment, new requirements on a 15-minute reporting requirement. And all of this adds up. 
   I just concluded a 40-county tour in my State. I will go on another 65-county tour. At every stop was a hospital administrator. They said: I don't know who reads this stuff. I think they must weigh it somewhere in Kansas City--which is the regional center. 
   I am not trying to deprive from the purpose and the intent and responsibility that HHS and HCFA and OASIS have here, but it just seems to me that just about the time you have one requirement promulgated--there is another fancy word--then it is changed, and it is changed overnight. This is the kind of thing that a small rural hospital, or any hospital, just cannot put up with, with that very tight margin. We are down to the morrow of the bone. 
   Naturally, we are going to put in some money in regards to Medicare reimbursement, but this regulatory overkill is 
   something that just has to stop.

   Mr. ROBERTS. This OASIS business, in regard to all the complaints we have heard, as I have indicated--I think I ought to go into that a little bit more than explaining what the acronym is. OASIS is a system of records containing data on the physical, mental, and functional status of Medicare and Medicaid patients receiving care from home health agencies. 
   HCFA tried to implement OASIS as a tool to help the agency improve the quality of care and form the basis for a new home health care prospective payment system. The problem is--and my colleague chaired the subcommittee and asked all the very pertinent questions--the collection of data is so burdensome and expensive for agencies, it invades the personal privacy of the patients. It must be collected for non-Medicare patients as well as those served by Medicare. 
   Just yesterday, I learned that the whole OASIS information system in Kansas is not working; the computer system has failed. Agencies across the State are having a lot of difficulty in transmitting any kind of data. This burden is being felt by agencies all over the country. The question I have for the Senator is, Does she have any idea how long it takes? She has already spoken about this to some degree. Can we put a timeframe on it? Can we get more specific as to how long it takes for nurses to collect this information for HCFA? What does it cost in terms of nurse time?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBERTS. The OASIS document includes an 18-page initial assessment that must be completed by a registered nurse and a 13-page followup assessment that is required every 60 days. This reminds me of a situation quite a few years ago, when the Department came out with a requirement that all Medicare patients would have to be reviewed by a doctor every 24 hours. At the time I said I was for that, stunning all of the health care folks in my district. I was in the House of Representatives then. I said: Surely, if they are going to require a 24-hour reporting requirement by a doctor, they will furnish us the doctor. There was sort of a method to the madness. 
   At any rate, as I have indicated, there is an 18-page initial assessment that must be completed by a registered nurse. A 13-page followup assessment is required every 60 days. This is on top of assessments already required by the State. That is very important. It isn't as if there is no regulatory function to safeguard the interests of the patients and the taxpayer. The paperwork burden is immense. I am curious about what is included in this assessment. Is the Senator aware of the nature of the questions?

   Mr. ROBERTS. Emotional status? I see that patients must answer questions about their feelings. Have they ever been depressed? Have they ever had trouble sleeping? Have they ever attempted suicide? In some cases, that might be necessary, but do we really think we need a nurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so that he or she can send the 
   answers over computer to someplace in Baltimore--hopefully Kansas City, but probably in Baltimore? 
   Does the Senator from Maine have any idea how patients have reacted to this survey? Talk about emotional distress, if somebody were to ask me in a hospital what I felt or how would I feel, do I feel depressed, I think they would learn pretty doggone quick.

   The point I was trying to make--I know that the same is true with regard to Texas--the Senator from Texas is here--and also Minnesota and Maine--is the time to travel great distances, many miles. Our health care providers spend an awful lot of time traveling from one patient's home to another. What happens is that the first patient may be located many miles away from the next patient. It requires the home health care nurse to work virtually nonstop to meet the deadlines required for the submission of the data to HCFA, which interferes with the personal care and the travel time. This is like 24-hour duty that is exacerbated by all of the data requirements.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I tell my distinguished friend that unfortunately that is correct. Any Medicare-approved home health agency must comply with all Medicare conditions of participation, including the collection of  OASIS. This means that patients who do not participate in Medicare are still subject to the Medicare assessment. That is exactly correct. 
   Last year, HCFA amended this regulation to say that these agencies don't have to transmit the data on non-Medicare patients for the time being. However, the agency still must spend the time making the assessment. So it is sort of a Catch-22. I am certainly sympathetic to the concerns raised by my constituents that these new regulations and spending cuts will harm, again, the senior. But aren't these policy changes necessary to achieve the Medicare saving goals established by the Balanced Budget Act, I ask my colleague?

   Mr. ROBERTS. My colleague referred to--and I referred to it in my opening comments--the additional 15-percent cut across the board in these payments to go into effect on October 1, 2001. With regard to what she has just related to the Senate, given the savings that have already been achieved, the question is obvious, is this additional cut necessary? 
   I tell my colleagues and all those interested in this particular issue that last year we had to come up with an emergency bill. Nobody likes to do that. 
   We would prefer it to go through authorization and appropriations. Nobody likes to be faced with an emergency bill. This year is the same way. We are wrestling with that in terms of the budget caps we should live with. We are trying to figure that out. Here we are willing to provide more emergency money and we turn around and go through another 15-percent cut. It seems to me that is not conducive to what we are about with regard to consistency. What effect would that have with regard to home health care agencies?

   Mr. ROBERTS. I have one final question. First, I thank the Senator from Maine for all her leadership and her hard work in this effort, for tapping not so gently on the shoulders of the leadership and, in a bipartisan way, attracting all sorts of support for this bill. I believe it is possible for Congress to bring this much needed relief to the home health care industry, as well as to the small rural hospitals and the teaching hospitals that are feeling the pinch of all these regulatory and legislative changes made in the last few years--with every good intent. 
   But this is the law of unintended consequences personified. We must work quickly. Time is of the essence for many of our 
   home health agencies and hospitals, especially the small rural providers. I don't want to have to go out again on a 105-county listening tour in Kansas and have people come and say; Senator ROBERTS, thank you so much for your past help on a whole litany of things we have gone through regarding the home health care delivery system, only to find out that their doors may close. 
   I will continue to work with my colleague from Maine to pass legislation before Congress adjourns this year. We have a good team and we have good support. We cannot go home without providing help. I thank the distinguished Senator for her leadership in heading up a home health care posse for fairness and justice.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am going to be speaking on the PNTR issue. From the time allotted, I yield myself 15 minutes. 
   The pending business is the Byrd amendment, but I was intensely interested in the comments and remarks by my good friend and colleague, Senator THOMPSON. 
   I thought now would be an appropriate time to urge my colleagues to oppose the China nonproliferation act--that is how the act is described--offered as an amendment to the legislation. But, again, I want to point out to my good friend and distinguished colleague from Tennessee that as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and as chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, I speak with at least some understanding on this very serious subject of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The fact is the distinguished majority leader has appointed Senator BOB BENNETT to be on the task force, as well as Senator THOMPSON, myself, Senator KYL, and Senator GREGG on this very issue. 
   More especially, in regard to the threat of terrorism, which is a very serious threat, among its many duties the Emerging Threat Subcommittee is responsible for congressional oversight of programs called the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction programs. They annually authorize the use of Defense Department funds--the fact is we are right in the middle of the defense authorization bill--to assist with the safe and secure transportation, storage, and dismantlement of nuclear, chemical, and other weapons of the former Soviet Union. We would hope we could do similar activities with the other nations concerned more specifically mentioned by my distinguished colleague. 
   In that enterprise, I have spent countless hours in committee methodically and hopefully meticulously debating these issues. This is a very important issue to me. 
   As the Senator pointed out, our first obligation is our national security. Our first obligation as Senators is to do what we can to safeguard our national security. There is no question about that. 
   As the distinguished Senator and, I guess, all of my colleagues, I have very serious concerns about China. I have no illusions about China. They are spreading, as he has indicated, weapons of mass destruction technology all around the world, more specifically to nations of concern. But I don't think this is the reason to erect what we call trade barriers, which is exactly what I think this amendment will do. Quite the opposite. It seems to me we should really reject this amendment because trade, on the other hand, has a stabilizing effect on international relations. The more that two nations trade and invest in regard to the economics of both countries and each other, the less likely it is that they will engage in any kind of military conflict. 
   Let me spend a few moments explaining to my colleagues why I think this amendment, which requires the President to once again impose sanctions on China, would be counterproductive. 
   First, again, I don't know how many times we have to say this on the floor. I have had the privilege of being in public service in the other body since 1980, and, as a matter of fact, I was working as a staff member 10 or 12 years prior to that time. In speech after speech after speech, primarily involved with agriculture, we have tried to point out that unilateral sanctions simply don't work as a foreign policy tool. Study after study by respected foreign policy experts and economists, academics, not to mention the farmer who has gone through this I don't know how many times, all agree that unilateral sanctions are overused; that they are ineffective and counterproductive. I know that they send a message. 
   I know from the intervention standpoint the sanctions we 
   have on approximately 71 countries around the world send a very strong perception. We have them on almost virtually everything that we are worried about. But unilateral sanctions do little to change the behavior of the offending country. Yet they put American businesses and American workers and farmers at a huge competitive disadvantage. 
   I remember so well the 1980 embargo by President Carter. The Russians had invaded Afghanistan--something we all disagreed with without question and viewed as a great tragedy. I remember that the United States canceled the Olympics. At that time, President Carter said no more grain sales to Russia. Not one Russian troop left Afghanistan. And, yet, in terms of contract sanctity and our trade policy, our export policy was like shattered glass. I tell you who paid the price. It wasn't Russia. The fact is they were becoming more dependent on our food supply,  and the Russian people were demanding more in that regard because of a higher protein diet. 
   It was the Kansas wheat farmer and farmers all over this country. Our export policy suffered for years afterwards. It took us 2 years after that to get any contract sanctity. The price of wheat at the country elevator in Dodge City, KS, went from $5 down to about $2. Boy, did we feel good, except that Vietnam veteran who went out there to harvest his field and who had a good crop all of a sudden found it diminished in value and price. He was wondering and scratching his head: Wait a minute, these sanctions are not helping quite the way I thought they would. 
   I am saying again that sanctions simply don't work as a foreign policy tool. Unilateral sanctions are often used as an easy substitute for the harder work of finding more effective and long-term responses to foreign policy problems. They create the false impression that these problems have been solved. We need to take, it seems to me, a harder look at alternatives such as multilateral pressure and more effective U.S. diplomacy. 
   The Senator from Tennessee indicated what time we had in regard to multilateral pressure in regard to China. He makes one excellent point: We have not been successful to the degree that we should have been. 
   More effective U.S. diplomacy. Let's see, 18 months ago, or 2 years ago, we were going ahead with this trade agreement. We worked on it for years. All of a sudden, it was pulled back. Then we got into a conflict in regard to Kosovo. We had the unfortunate incident of the Belgrade bombing. I am going to be very frank. This is after about six times of drawing lines in the sand in regard to Bosnia and Kosovo, the Balkans, and the former Yugoslavia. 
   It seems to me that our word in regard to standing firm with what we would do in reference to foreign policy objectives would go a long way in convincing the Chinese, more especially the hard liners and the Communists in that country, that we mean what we say. It seems to me that a clear and rational and defined foreign policy of the United States where we define precisely what our U.S. vital national security interests are and make that very clear to the Chinese would go a long way to helping this matter rather than sanctions. 
   Let me point out that unilateral economic sanctions almost never help the people we want to help and almost always fail to bring about the actions that we seek to promote. By acting alone, America only ensures that its responses are ineffective since the target country can always circumvent a U.S. unilateral sanction by working with one of our competitors. That certainly will be the case and would be the case with regard to China. Unilateral sanctions should be one of the last tools out of America's foreign policy toolbox--not the first. 
   Second, the China nonproliferation act requires the mandatory--I have it in caps, in a higher type case here, to underline it--imposition of sanctions rather than allowing the President the discretion in determining whether sanctions or some other response will promote our U.S. goal. 
   The measure requires the imposition of the full complement of U.S. sanctions for even minor infractions instead of mandating a predetermined one-size-fits-all response. It seems to me that history and prudence tells us that the President's hands should not be tied. Flexibility is a must when dealing with sensitive foreign policy issues. 
   The thought occurs to me that if we are unhappy about the President not using all the venues, all of the opportunities, and all of the various means at his disposal to send strong messages to China in regard to this specific issue, we might want to quarrel with the policies and the recommendations and the actions of the President--not impose more unilateral mandatory sanctions that, quite frankly, might be followed up by more wrong-headed policy decisions, say, by the Executive. 
   First, this amendment is redundant. A substantial body of law already exists in regard to governing the real proliferation of weapons. The President already has authority to adequately respond and report to the Congress on this issue, on this concern, which is real, about China and other nations. Examples include the Arms Export Control Act. I know the criticism will be; we haven't done that. Let's get back to the people who are implementing the policy. It is certainly not the alternative that is there. 
   Second, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. 
   Third, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. All those are on the books. 
   Fourth, the Export Administration Act. 
   Fifth, the Export-Import Bank Act. 
   And many others too numerous to list. You can go on and on. 
   Let's utilize and enforce the laws already on the books instead of hastily creating new statutes without properly studying the issue in the committee process, although, the Senator from Tennessee has spent many long hours on this subject area. I truly appreciate that. 
   Finally, it seems to me we must defeat this amendment because of the obvious: Its success will kill the effort to achieve trade concessions with China. It will kill the PNTR. My former House colleagues have assured me. I know it is easy to say let's pass it and see. In my view, in talking with people on both sides of the aisle on this issue, from the Speaker to the rank-and-file Members of the House, this is a killer amendment. 
   I also know the Senator from Tennessee has tried for a free-standing amendment. I understand that. That is a different matter. But tied to this particular effort, it represents the death of I don't know how many years of work in regard to PNTR. I think Senators must understand a vote for this amendment, or any amendment, serves ultimately as a vote against PNTR. 
   It will be a tough vote for many of my colleagues simply because, as the Senator has pointed out, that is our first obligation. That is why we are here. It is such a serious issue. 
   I am much more discouraged by the thought of explaining to the American people why we failed to rise to the occasion and remain economically and diplomatically engaged with one-fifth of the world's population. I think that course of action would help us in regard to our national security. 
   I took some notes while I had the privilege of being the acting Presiding Officer, and perhaps this will be a little redundant. Hopefully, it will be helpful. Senator THOMPSON said the reason he has introduced the amendment, he has told all of us--especially those privileged to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, bipartisan commission, and virtually all Members of the intelligence community--that we have a problem here in regard to the real, certain spread of weapons of mass destruction and selling these weapons to rogue nations. We don't call them rogue nations anymore; we call them nations of concern. I am not too sure what the difference is. We all know who they are. 
   The Senator from Tennessee is exactly right. He says the problem is getting worse. He refers to Pakistan and says, What do we do about it? Then he says the Chinese have violated 
   virtually all the agreements we have entered into with them prior to this date. I am not sure they have violated each and every one, but obviously we have not reached the progress we would like to reach with the Chinese. 
   He says, How on Earth can we claim the need for a national missile defense when these adversaries are causing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? 
   Excellent point. 
   Then he indicated that he could read a considerable amount of the intelligence reports--the itemized situation there in regard to the nations of concern and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
   That is true. But my question is, How can killing trade answer that challenge? How can killing this bill answer that challenge from a practical standpoint? With our competitors all over the world and the concessions we have arranged for in this trade bill, how can taking those sales away from American businesses, American farmers, and American ranchers help this situation? I don't understand that. I understand the means, but I don't understand the end. 
   If nothing else happens, China will become a member of the WTO and one-  fifth of the world's population will be a market to all the rest of the population, except the United States, and our competitors will take those markets. Kansas sales will not go to China; they will go to our competitors. I don't understand how that affects the Chinese decision in regard to these matters of grave national concern. 
   Will the Chinese change their military policy? I doubt it. I have no illusions. I share the Senator's concerns about Taiwan. I have been to Taiwan several times. I share the concern in regard to human rights. I share the concern, as I have indicated, about the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I sit on those subcommittees. I am worried about the espionage. 
   I worried a great deal 2 years ago when the distinguished Senator from Tennessee led the effort to have a little transparency, to shine the light of truth into darkness in regard to the campaign contribution violations involving China. He was stymied in that effort--we won't go into that--and tried very hard to reach a logical conclusion. 
   The Senator mentioned it is our primary obligation in regard to national security. I agree. But it seems to me, again, a partial answer is a clear foreign policy. 
   I am very hopeful with a change of administration we can achieve that, so that the Chinese fully understand what is acceptable and what isn't in regard to our national interests. It is not only China; it is all nations of concern. As a matter of fact, this administration has already announced we have exempted food and medicine sanctions in reference to all these nations of concern. They have not gone ahead and said that we can compete with our competitors and use our export credit programs, which is another step. Right now, with Iran we are trying to work this out as best we can. Obviously, we have a lot of concerns about the nation of Iran. 
   So it involves all of the nations. The same thing with Cuba. You can make the same argument with Cuba, except obviously Cuba today does not pose a national security threat. We hear the same arguments with regard to sanctions. 
   Trade is not a productive way to achieve foreign and military policy goals. I mentioned the Carter embargo. I will not go back over that. The issue is in regard to all of the 
   reports. Send strong signals. We should be willing to take a strong stand. We should be able to draw a line in the sand and have reasonable policy discussions with the Chinese. 
   If we don't have that kind of engagement with the current leadership in regard to trade, to whom does it turn over the decisionmaking? Who gains ascendancy if we kill PNTR? I will tell you who it is: It is the two generals who wrote the book on how they can gain supremacy with the United States by the year 2020. I haven't read all the book, but I read a portion of it. It is a chilling book. Equal superpower status with the United States. I think they probably wrote the last chapter after we were involved in the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade because they worry about NATO going outside of its boundaries and taking action like this. I think that crosses the T's and dots the I's. I am not saying that was a one-for-one cause, but I think that certainly was the case. If we don't remain engaged with trade, it will turn that decisionmaking over to those very people. 
   Let's say we pass the Thompson amendment, the House doesn't take the bill up, and PNTR is dead. We sure showed them. We showed them. Basically, the Chinese hardliners will gain ascendancy, the Chinese will buy some Ericsson cell phones, and the Chinese will buy French wheat and the Airbus aircraft. The President will still have the options he should be using right now to convince the Chinese we ought to be making progress on this, but we won't be trading with Chinese. It seems to me that is the question. 
   I thank Senator THOMPSON for making this such an issue of concern and having what I think has been excellent dialog and debate. I share his concern about the national security risk this poses. I do think this is the wrong way to get it done. I think this is a killer amendment. It is as simple as that. 
   We have come far too far in our efforts to engage the Chinese with trade and, yes, with a serious national policy dialog with regard to our national security, to go down this road. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume debate on the China PNTR legislation. Under the order, Senator BYRD will debate his amendment in regard to subsidies for 1 hour. Following the debate on the BYRD amendment, Senator THOMPSON will be recognized to offer his China nonproliferation amendment. Further amendments may be offered during today's session, however, any votes during today's session ordered with respect to those amendments will be scheduled to occur at 9:30 in the morning on Tuesday. It is hoped that the Senate can complete action on this important trade bill as early as possible so that the Senate may begin consideration of those appropriations bills still available for action. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. President, I understand the pending amendment is that of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. My remarks are not to that amendment, or at least the first part of my remarks, but more general in nature on the entire debate in reference to PNTR. 
   I believe that the issue before us--whether or not to improve what is called the permanent normal trade relations with China--is the Senate's first critical--very critical--foreign policy test of the 21st century. 
   It seems to me that we are poised at a crossroads. Our future depends on the right decision.  
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for a very comprehensive review of the issues that will affect our daily lives and pocketbooks, both in China and the United States--more particularly the United States. I associate myself with his remarks. 
   Do we approve PNTR and demonstrate to China, and just as importantly, if not more, to the world, that diplomacy through commerce is a formula for stability and progress or do we vote PNTR down and miss the opportunity to become linked with one-fifth of the world's population? 
   I, for one, hope we summon the wisdom and the courage to remain engaged by appropriately approving the legislation that is before us without amendments. To do otherwise would be a very serious mistake. 
   I strongly support this legislation. However, some of my colleagues have argued, and will continue to argue, that America should refuse to do business with China. They cite the possibility of job loss, trade deficits, international disputes, and human rights, not to mention national security concerns, as reasons to isolate and to ostracize China. 
   On the contrary, it seems to me that approving PNTR and validating the trade agreement--which requires China to drastically reduce its tariffs, eliminate trade barriers, and remove restrictions on foreign investment and trading and distribution rights--will benefit American workers and farmers and businesses. 
   These new market opportunities will support U.S. jobs and U.S. economic expansion into the new century, not to mention assisting the Chinese to become more familiar with and ascribe to the rule of law. This issue cuts across all areas of America. 
   To illustrate the broad importance of China trade, let me use some examples from my home State of Kansas. Boeing is the world's largest aircraft exporter. It employs 18,000 people in Kansas, with a payroll of $1 billion, where 80 percent of that production--80 percent of that $1 billion that accrues to Kansas--is export related. 
   In 1994, Boeing exported 25 percent of all Kansas production to China. In the future, China plans to buy large numbers of regional aircraft which are made at the Boeing plant in Wichita. But if the Senate should fail to approve this bill--amendment free--Boeing will suffer a huge competitive disadvantage in the huge Chinese market, and these valuable contracts will go to a European competitor, not to mention the loss of jobs in Wichita. 
   Likewise, PNTR will have a similar impact on agriculture, an industry where one-third of all goods are bound for export markets. 
   In 1998, Kansas farms exported $58 million worth of goods to China. This agreement increases the market access and grants distribution rights for corn, beans, wheat, beef, pork, and fertilizer--all of the agricultural products so vital to us in regards to our balance of payments as well. 
   China soon may be able to purchase the entire annual wheat crop of Kansas. I certainly hope that would be the case, more especially with the price today at the country elevator. 
   My good friend and Kansas native, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, estimates that passing PNTR will mean an additional $2 billion per year in total U.S. farm exports to China in just several years. 
   Engaging China will benefit our other Kansas businesses. 
   Let me go back and reflect a minute before I get into the other jobs that are directly affected in other industries. 
   We had quite a discussion, it seems to me, before we broke for the August recess about the appropriations and the authorization for agriculture. I think it was reflective of the $5.5 billion in emergency lost income payments, $7.5 billion, as I recall, for the new crop insurance reform, some emergency assistance because of hard-hit areas of the United States, where farmers and ranchers are going through a difficult time. 
   People totaled up last year's expenditures and this year's expenditures. The difference this time around is that we budgeted this money. It does not come out of emergency funds. There was a real concern expressed by many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle and that side of the aisle about these expenditures, and saying: My goodness, we are spending a record amount for agriculture. 
   I didn't hear too much debate in that arena as to the cause, as to why we are going through a world price decline, not only the United States but farmers everywhere, all around the world. There have been 3 record years of crops worldwide, sanctions on 71 countries, not using all the export programs, the value of the dollar hindering our exports, the Asian market in real decline, and the same thing for South America. The list goes on and on. Not too much debate with regard to the cause, what is happening to worldwide agriculture prices, and why this outflow of expenditures, yes, to subsidize American agriculture at record levels, and a lot of concern about, wait a minute, we are not going to have one more nickel go to agriculture that is first not authorized and appropriated. I agree with that; I think that is the way it ought to be. 
   We have done some very good things in this session in behalf of agriculture. My point is, if we do not pass this trade bill, if we do not have an aggressive and consistent agricultural policy with regard to exports, we really should not be hearing too much criticism about one nickel more going to agriculture--if we shut down these markets and say we are not going to trade with one-fifth of the world's population. That is one of the things we should consider as the law of unintended effects. If in fact this bill does not pass, it is going to cause a trade disruption such that one could hardly imagine. We will be going into the next century with our trade policy in real tatters. 
   Engaging China will benefit our other Kansas businesses--I am trying to point out the effect of this bill in a macro way in Kansas, micro in terms of the Nation--large and small businesses. Let's try Payless Shoe Source, Inc., 2,000 Kansas employees; Black & Veatch production is export related, a major international engineering firm with offices in the Kansas City area; a business called Superior Boiler Works of Hutchinson, KS, which provides industrial boilers for building projects in China--you might not think Hutchinson, KS, is where we are providing most of the boiler projects for that huge nation, but that is the case--several ventures in China by Koch Industries of Wichita. Clearly, the stakes are high, thousands of jobs. One out of four jobs in Kansas depends on trade. I use the Kansas example only for illustration. All 50 States will certainly benefit as well. 
   I don't think we need to be misled by charges that a vote against PNTR is a vote to protect American jobs. I just don't think that is correct. There are winners and losers in regard to all trade agreements. As a matter of fact, I think in some ways, when we talk about this issue or any trade pact, they are sometimes oversold. They are not a panacea. There are winners and there are some losers. A trade agreement is nothing more than, nothing less than, a working agreement to try to settle the differences you are going to have with your trading partners and competitors anyway. At least you have some structure there and a rule of law where you can reach a logical conclusion and strike an agreement to have much better trade relations. I know they are overcriticized. If I say they are oversold, they probably are. They are certainly overcriticized. 
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently pointed out:  
   It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has impacted the level of total employment over the long run. Indeed we are currently experiencing the widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment close to record lows.  
   Trade-related jobs pay Americans 15 percent more than the average national wage. Free trade with China will provide unrestricted access to a wider variety of goods and services at lower prices and better quality. The distinguished Senator from Texas certainly gave that example in his remarks. In short, international trade raises real wages with virtually no downside risk to job security. 
   As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, I have very serious concerns about China emerging as a more significant military threat, especially in the area of thermonuclear weapons and the proliferation of that  weaponry. I know it is a problem. It is a very serious problem. It is a national security concern. However, it seems to me that is not a reason to erect a trade barrier, nor is it an excuse to add what I would consider to be an amendment conceived with good intentions but a counterproductive and redundant amendment. 
   I know the distinguished Senator from Tennessee should be on the floor shortly to offer an amendment or a freestanding bill, or whatever he so chooses, to address the proliferation issue. I share his concern. I share his sense of frustration. Secretary Albright, Secretary of Defense Cohen, and a panel of experts went to China over the break and did not achieve the progress we all wanted to see with regard to their talks with the Chinese, more especially with the Chinese concern over national missile defense. That is a real challenge. That is a problem. That is a national security challenge. It seems to me we don't solve it by putting an amendment on a trade bill. Quite the opposite. Trade has a stabilizing effect on international relations. The more the two nations trade and invest economically in each other, the less likely they are to engage in military conflict. 
   If we don't trade, if we isolate China, it isn't a question of whether or not they will join the WTO. We will turn a lot of the decisionmaking over to the two military general authors who say by 2020 they hope China will be a superpower equal to that of the United States. I know that is where they want to go. If we are able to establish a better trading relationship and engagement, all those decisions will not then be turned over to the nationalists, the hardliners, and all of the military generals. 
   Since the Thompson amendment seems to enjoy more than nominal support--and why shouldn't it? The Senator has worked very hard on this particular issue; he is modifying it almost each day to try get more support. I understand the concern and frustration on the part of many Members who want to send a signal to the Chinese. At that point, it seems to me there is some growing support for the amendment. But I would like to highlight the importance of passing H.R. 4444 without amendments. 
   No matter how politically tempting or national security tempting a particular amendment may be, a vote for an amendment serves ultimately as a vote against PNTR. We have other avenues by which we can safeguard our national security interests. They are well known to all Members of the Senate. I will not go into that. To attach an amendment to this bill would be a grave mistake. I think Senators should consider that accordingly. 
   My former House colleagues have assured me they will not take another vote on PNTR. I know that assurance or that talk is not taken seriously by some in this body. I can't tell the Senate how serious it really is, but it seems to me when they look me in the eye and say: Senator ROBERTS, if we do this, there will not be a vote in the House, then we will have a trade disaster on our hands. That will be our responsibility. In short, it is now or never for PNTR. And never is not an alternative. 
   In addition to the proliferation concerns, I also find China's record on human rights and its religious oppression unacceptable. However, history proves the best manner to inspire change is through engagement and trade, not isolation, turning the decisionmaking, again, over to those who are now in favor of the oppression. When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, 2 years after Mao's death, he opened China to trade and foreign investment. 
   And the change in the economy and the human condition in China was dramatic--outstandingly dramatic. China's gross domestic product grew at an average of 9.7 percent a year for almost two decades. That is an incredible growth. Its share of world GDP rose from 5 percent in 1978 to 11.8 percent by 1998, only 2 years ago. Its income per person rose six times as fast as the world average when they opened it up to trade. So you can see what kind of economic opportunity, what kind of economic wherewithal, and what kind of improvement there was in the daily lives and the pocketbooks of each Chinese individual. You can see what happened. 
   More importantly, 20 percent of the population--200 million people--were lifted above the subsistence line. The most dramatic increase in the standard of living in the history of the world gave the Chinese people the ability to purchase televisions, washing machines and, increasingly, computers and mobile phones with Internet access, to become members of a modern global society, in terms of information and transparency in regard to freedom and economic opportunity. 
   Above all, the economic changes are quickly and dramatically improving personal freedom for the average Chinese citizen. Despite the Communist Government, millions of Chinese now have access to foreign magazines and newspapers, copiers, satellite TV dishes, and the Internet, where they can learn about capitalism, freedom, and democracy, and it is catching. Internet access, which American companies are quite willing to provide, will only accelerate this process. 
   Finally, it should be stressed that congressional approval of PNTR for China is not a decision on whether China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization. That is not the case. That is not the issue. China will become a member of that world trade group, hopefully, later this year, regardless of our decision. It means we will be locked out of the trade benefits, the agreements that have been so long pursued. It means the PNTR vote will determine how the United States deals with this huge nation as it becomes a WTO member. That is exceedingly important. 
   Approval gives Americans entry to Chinese markets and provides an avenue for influence. Disapproval ensures we are shut out while China does business with the rest of the world. 
   With that in mind, I strongly urge my Senate colleagues to lead America down the engagement path toward prosperity and peace by promptly approving the PNTR legislation, amendment free. 
   I will repeat the one thing I underscored when I started my remarks. It is basically a test to demonstrate to the rest of the world and to China that diplomacy through commerce is a formula for stability. I believe that. That is what this vote is all about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health Care in the 21st Century Act of 2000. This legislation will improve access to technology necessary to improve rural health care and expand access to quality health care in rural areas. 
   The future of health care in this country is being challenged by a variety of factors. The growing pains associated with managed care, an increasing elderly population and the drive to ensure the solvency of the federal Medicare Trust Fund are just a few of the factors placing pressure on health care facilities and health care providers across the country. Small, rural hospitals that provide services to a relatively low volume of patients are faced with even greater challenges in this environment. 
   The bill I am introducing today takes critical steps to improve access to high technology in rural areas and establishes a new high technology acquisition grant and loan program to improve patient safety and outcomes. At the same time hospitals need to update equipment, comply with new regulatory requirements and join the effort to reduce medical errors, many hospitals are finding it difficult to access the financial backing necessary to acquire the telecommunications equipment necessary to develop innovative solutions. This bill establishes a 5-year grant program through the Office of Rural Health Policy that allows hospitals, health care centers and related organizations to apply for matching grants or loans up to $100,000 to purchase the advanced technologies necessary to improve patient safety and keep pace with the changing records management requirements of the 21st Century. 
   This bill also increases Disproportionate Share Hospitals payments to rural hospitals. The Medicare DSH adjustment is based on a complex formula and the hospital's percentage of low-income patients. This percentage of low-income patients is different for each hospital, depending on where the hospital is located and the number of beds in the hospital. This bill establishes one formula to distribute payments to all hospitals covered by the inpatient PPS. This will give rural hospitals an equal opportunity to qualify for the DSH adjustment. 
   Twenty-five percent of our nation's senior citizens live in rural areas where access to modern health care services is often lacking. Telehealth technologies have evolved significantly and can serve to connect rural patients to the health care providers that they need. This bill includes provisions of S. 2505, a telehealth bill introduced by my colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS. These provisions address eight areas of Medicare reimbursement policy that need improvement. It eliminates requirements for fee-sharing between providers and provides a standard professional fee to the health care provider who delivers the care. The site where the patient is presented is made eligible for a standard facility fee. The requirement for a telepresenter is  eliminated and the codes that can be billed for are expanded to reflect current practice. All rural counties and urban HPSAs are covered by this legislation and demonstration projects are established to access reimbursement for store and forward activities. Also, the law is 
   clarified to allow for home health agencies to incorporate telehomecare into their care plans where appropriate. 
   The Health Care Financing Administration is currently administering five telemedicine demonstration projects. This provision extends these projects an additional two years to give the projects adequate time to produce useful data. 
   The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allows rural hospitals to be reclassified as limited service facilities, known as Critical Access Hospitals. Critical Access Hospitals are important components of the rural health care infrastructure. They are working to provide quality health care services in sparsely populated areas of the country. However, they are restricted by burdensome regulations and inadequate Medicare payments. In addition to reduced staffing requirements, Congress intended to reimburse CAH inpatient and outpatient hospital services on the basis of reasonable costs. This legislation exempts Medicare swing beds in CAHs for the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System (PPS) and reimburses based on reasonable costs, and provides reasonable cost payment for ambulance services and home health services in CAHs. 
   In addition, this legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a procedure to ensure that a single FI will provide services to all CAHs and allows CAHs to choose between two options for payment for outpatient services: (1) reasonable costs for facility services, or (2) an all-inclusive rate which combines facility and professional services. 
   This bill permanently guarantees pre-Balanced Budget Act payment levels for outpatient services provided by rural hospitals with under 100 beds, modifies the 50 bed exemption language and for Rural Health Clinics allows RHCs to qualify as long as their average daily patient census does not exceed 50, allows Physician Assistant-owned RHCs that lose their clinic status to maintain Medicare Part B payments, and clarifies that when services already excluded from the PPS system are delivered to Skilled Nursing Facility patients by practitioners employed by the RHCs, those visits are also excluded from the PPS payment system. In addition, this bill increases payments under the Medicare home health PPS for beneficiaries who reside in rural areas by increasing the standardized payment per 60-day episode by 10 percent. 
   Current law allows states the option to reimburse hospitals for Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) services attributable to deductibles and coinsurance amounts. However, many state Medicaid programs have chosen not to pay these costs, leaving rural hospitals with a significant portion of unpaid bad debt expenses. This is especially burdensome since federal law prohibits hospitals from seeking payment for the cost-sharing amounts from QMB patients. This legislation provides additional relief to rural hospitals by restoring 100% Medicare bad debt reimbursement for QMBs. 
   Although, as a general rule, scholarships are excluded from income, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that National Health Service Corp scholarships are included in income. Imposing taxes on the scholarships could have disastrous effects on a program that for over 20 years has helped funnel doctors, nurse-practitioners, physician assistants, and other health professionals into medically underserved communities. This provision excludes from gross income of certain scholarships any amounts received under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. 
   Finally, this bill includes important technical corrections to the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This bill extends the option to rebase target amounts to all Sole Community Hospitals and allows Critical Access Hospitals to receive reimbursement for lab services on a reasonable cost basis. 
   Exciting changes are taking place in rural America. This legislation will enable small rural hospitals to take advantage of the latest technology and improve health care for rural residents across the country. Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this endeavor. I am unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4461, the FY2001 Agriculture appropriations bill. I commend Senator COCHRAN for bringing forward what I believe is a solid bill to fund those programs of greatest importance to production agriculture and rural America. The task to complete this legislation is never easy, but the Senator from Mississippi has again worked to craft a bill that serves the states of all members of the Senate. 
   In this era of tight budget caps, crafting this legislation becomes more difficult each year. Despite these difficulties, the chairman has still found a way to provide increases in funding for several vital programs, including: 
   Farm Service Agency Staffing +$20 million from FY00; Conservation Programs +$63.4 million; Food Safety Inspection Service +$29 million; and Agricultural Research +60.4 million. 
   Mr. President, I know that many Senators and our constituents are often upset to see increases in funding for federal staffing. But, I must tell you that this increase in funding for FSA staffing is essential. 
   The Farm Service Agency is responsible for distributing all AMTA, LDP, and market loss payments and programs to our producers. With the low prices of the past two years, these staff have faced a tremendous workload. These programs are essential to our producers and without proper staffing the delivery of these programs will be delayed. This is funding that will benefit our producers. 
   The productivity of today's U.S. agricultural machine is a modern day miracle that is a model for the rest of the world. We grow more food, for more people, on less land each year. Much of this productivity is a direct result of the commitment Congress has provided to agricultural research in the past. Additional research and productivity  will be essential, as the world's population continues to grow in the next fifty years. The U.S. must be a leader in this area, and I thank the chairman for his commitment to research funding in this legislation. 
   In addition, I want to thank the chairman for the additional funding provided for the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). Kansas is the largest beef packing state in the country and beef accounts for nearly 1/2 the farm income in my state each year. We have many small plants and lockers located throughout the state, and we have the ``Big 4'' packers located within a 100-mile radius of each other in the southwestern part of the state. These plants have experienced inspector shortages at several points during the past year. These shortages result in reduced production chain speeds, which results in lost income for the processors, and fewer cattle being slaughtered which directly affects the pocketbooks of my 
   cowboys and cattle ranchers, I am hopeful FSIS will use this money to hire inspectors and locate them in those areas where they are most needed. 
   I think it is also important to point out the significantly larger amount of funding for USDA agricultural export programs in the Senate bill compared to the House Agricultural Appropriations bill. We need full funding of these programs if our producers are to continue gaining additional world market shares, and I am hopeful the Senate position will prevail in conference with the House. 
   Finally, I thank the chairman for the funding he has provided for continued wheat and grain sorghum research in the State of Kansas through the Agricultural Research Service and Kansas State University. Kansas is the No. 1 producer of both wheat and grain sorghum in the U.S. Thus, the two crops play a vital role in our state's agricultural economy. This funding will allow us to continue research that allows us to combat emerging diseases in these crops and to find better ways to market them as well. 
   Again, I thank the Chairman for his efforts on this legislation. As always, he and staff--Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, Les Spivey, and Hunt Shipman--have taken very difficult budget numbers and have gone out of their way to address the needs of the constituents of all members of the Senate. They should be applauded for their work, and I urge my colleagues to support quick passage of this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bond second-degree amendment to the amendment offered by my colleague from California. 
   I agree with the intentions of the amendment offered by the Senator from California. All of us want to protect the health of our children. However, I do not believe her amendment does this. In fact, I believe it could actually harm the health of children. 
   In 1996, Congress approved, nearly unanimously, the Food Quality and Protection Act. The FQPA was intended to reform pesticide tolerance and review processes dating from as far back as the 1950s. Quite simply, prior to the passage of the FQPA the standards being used to evaluate pesticides and chemicals was not in step with today's science. 
   Under the FQPA we tightened the review standards. Their are specific guidelines for pesticide and tolerance review by EPA. And, EPA has tightened the requirements regarding the effects of the pesticides on children. If EPA believes a chemical or pesticide could be harmful to children, it can pull, or request that a product, be pulled from the market. In fact, this has happened in several instances. 
   EPA should and will pull a chemical when children's and the public's health are at risk. At the same time, I want my colleagues to understand that without these pesticides we may be submitting our children to health risks associated with roaches, brown recluse spiders, ticks, mosquitoes, and other pests. 
   By passing the Senator from California's amendment, we may actually be tying the hands of our federal officials and keep them from protecting children from these pests. 
   The Bond amendment recognizes that we already have a review and approval process in place. It says that if a chemical has not been deemed safe to use around children it cannot be used by the federal agencies funded under this act. Congress has put a product review process in place. It should be followed. The Bond amendment stays the course and I urge my colleagues to support his amendment.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Baucus-Roberts amendment to engage China on the important issue of rapid industrialization and the environment. The amendment would permit appropriated funds for the US-Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP)--an initiative of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)--to be used for environmental projects in the People's Republic of China (PRC). In other words, the U.S. government would finally be able to, for example, help U.S. businesses connect with provincial and municipal governments in China to initiate badly needed environmental engineering projects. This work is necessary to attempt to prevent a possible long-term environmental catastrophe resulting from intense industrialization and development in the PRC and Asia in general. 
   Why should one care whether Chinese or Asian people breath clean air or drink clean water? Besides the obvious humanitarian concern, a ruined environment throughout Asia will--at some point--effect us here in the United States and our interests. This is common sense. 
   The Baucus-Roberts amendment also sends a strong pro-engagement message to the PRC since the U.S. excluded de jure or de facto the PRC from U.S. foreign aid programs with passage and signing of the FY 90-FY 91 State Department Authorization, specifically section 902 of H.R. 3792. 
   Our government purports to be concerned about global environmental issues, Mr. President, about avoiding contamination of the world's water, air, and soil. Yet, we prohibit ourselves from consulting and cooperating on a government to government basis with the one nation with the greatest potential to impact the world's environment over the next 50 to 100 years. That makes no sense. 
   What is the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership? It is a public-private initiative implemented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Its aim is to encourage environmentally sustainable development in Asia as that region industrializes at a phenomenal rate. By ``environmentally sustainable development,'' we mean industrial and urban development that does not irreparably damage the air, water, and soil necessary for life. It's really that simple. US-AEP currently works with governments and industries in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. In creating US-AEP, the U.S. government recognized the long-term environmental hazards of Asia's rapid industrialization and the need for the U.S. government to engage on the issue. 
   The program provides grants to U.S. companies for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of environmentally sound and energy-efficient technologies to the Asia/Pacific region. Again, the objective is to address the pollution and health challenges of rapid industrialization while stimulating demand for U.S. technologies. In cooperation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, US-AEP has placed Environmental Technology Representatives in 11 Asian countries to identify trade opportunities for U.S. companies and coordinate meetings between potential Asian and U.S. business partners. 
   Mr. President, on the basic issue of the global environmental impact of Asian industrialization, specifically Chinese modernization, the Senate has the responsibility to authorize at least some cooperation between Beijing and Washington. I ask for my colleague's support for this common sense amendment.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. The way I understand the amendment, as crafted by the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the distinguished Senator from California, it is that they would strike the appropriations process to lease UC-35 aircraft. We are not talking about--I took some notes--either Gulfstreams or Boeing 727s or Learjets and, as a matter of fact, I do not think, with all due respect to my colleagues, we are talking about pampering or mollycoddling or glasses of champagne in regard to this aircraft. 
   We are talking about basically the operational support airlift aircraft, and the capability and the importance that these aircraft have in performing the missions as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Navy, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Army, all three of which have put these particular aircraft--nine UC-35s--on their unfunded list. 
   So if we are going to go to ``gulfstream.com''--I don't know if the Commandant of the Marine Corps has a dot com or the Secretary of the Navy or the Secretary of the Army, but they certainly had these aircraft on the unfunded list. 
   Now, let me talk a minute about the GAO report. The Senator from California was exactly right when she stated the response from the Department of Defense to the GAO and all the criticism of the GAO. As a matter of fact, let me say something about the GAO. It is a lot like an economist. I hope someday to find an expert witness from the General Accounting Office with one arm so he can't say ``on the other hand.'' I don't know how many times, when I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee in the other body, we would have GAO reports that were highly critical of many of the programs that we had under our jurisdiction. 
   I am finding out in the Intelligence Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and, yes, the Agriculture Committee--we ought to have it before the Ethics Committee--but, at any rate, in these three committees, we still have expertise in the GAO. Sometimes it is very helpful and other times I think a little myopic. 
   But at any rate, this is what the Department of Defense says in regards to the GAO report. They agree.  
   The Department agrees with many of the findings in the GAO report. Accordingly, it will take the GAO's findings into consideration in future determinations of operational support airlift requirements.  
   So they agree that this inventory should be based solely on joint wartime readiness requirements of the commands as opposed to any kind of personal use, as described in great detail by my two friends and colleagues.  
   The Department appreciates the opportunity to comment on the GAO draft report.  
   I do not think that is the issue. The issue is whether or not we will lease nine. And they would go three to the Army, three to the Navy, and certainly three to the U.S. Marine Corps. They are on the unfunded list. 
   Now, if this amendment is successful, they will not be leased and they will not replace, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out, aging aircraft, C-12s. I think, over the long term, this will provide a greater test to see, under a cost-benefit standard, as to whether or not this is in the best interests of the taxpayer, as we provide this aircraft.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I don't have time. I will see at the end, if I can ask for more time, and I would be delighted to yield to my good friend. 
   In war, this fleet--I am talking about operational support airlift aircraft--is maintained and ready to provide the commander quick transportation and to remote locations. 
   The distinguished Senator from Iowa said--if I can find my notes--that we are not at war. Well, we are not at war. Some people in Kosovo might challenge that. But we are involved in 141 nations. We have U.S. troops--men and women in uniform--in 141 nations. Fifty-five percent of all the nations in the world have U.S. troops stationed in those countries. The operational airlift capacity that is provided by these nine UC-35 aircraft is absolutely vital on those missions. 
   What am I talking about? Joe Ralston is the new Supreme Allied Commander. He took the place of Wesley Clark. The first obligation, as he told me in a courtesy call, is to pay as many courtesy visits as he can to his counterparts in Russia. How is he going to get there? 
   What happens if something breaks out in Kosovo? How does he get there? No, we are not at war, but in terms of our obligations and in terms of our military being stretched and stressed and hollow, it seems to me we ought to be very careful when we talk about operational support airlift aircraft. 
   Let me give you another example. 
   I have a congressional fellow in my office. He is an F-15 pilot. I know one case where his aircraft, in support of Operation Southern Watch--that is to prevent drugs from coming into this country--had to divert due to a massive fuel leak. Again, in regards to this operational support airlift aircraft, basically what happened, it was dispatched with maintenance crews and the very critical parts to fix the aircraft very quickly and return it to mission ready status. 
   That is what these aircraft are used for. As a matter of fact, I have here a statement that only 5 percent of these aircraft, in terms of missions, were ever even used by generals. 
   Here it is: In fiscal year 1999, less than 5 percent of the operational support missions were for generals or admirals. What does the 95 percent do?  The operational support airlift 
   mission does provide--as determined by the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Army, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps--efficient and effective transportation of commanders, key staff personnel, couriers, critical spare parts, and equipment in support of both peacetime and wartime operations. 
   These missions, according to the people who fly them, are typically unpredictable, high priority, and require very short notice in regards to the airlift of the people, the cargo, and the mail. These lifts are normally in support of contingency deployments--goodness knows, we have those today in 141 nations --not compatible with commercial transportation or larger aircraft. 
   The critical delays in the transportation of senior leaders, key staff personnel, urgently needed parts, supplies, and software could ultimately impact unit effectiveness and combat readiness. 
   I want to say, in closing, that my distinguished friend from Iowa referred to a so-called--I know he was not being specific in regards to the Marine Corps--``General Smith'' in the Marine Corps who would look around to other generals who might have a Gulfstream or a 727 or a Learjet, or whatever, and say: Gee whiz, I would like to have that perk. 
   I just want to set the record straight. I asked the Marine Corps, I asked the Commandant: What about this statement, Mr. Commandant? I am talking about ``General Jim Jones.'' And this is the statement that worried me because it is very similar to the statements that have been made on the floor by the proponents of this amendment. The response was:  
   The Pentagon already has enough aircraft to taxi Generals and Admirals around the world. In fact, they have more than 300 executive aircraft, including more than 100 jets suitable to transport high-ranking officers.  
   I asked the Commandant, I said: Will you please comment about this statement. And the response was:  
   The 3 UC-35s are for Active Marine Corps forces, not the Navy. 
   The Marine Corps does not provide executive airlift.  
   Let me repeat that: The United States Marine Corps, according to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, does not provide executive airlift.  
   [The Marine Corps has] a small fleet (24) of Operational Support Airlift aircraft that are tied directly to a Joint Staff validated wartime requirement...... 
   These aircraft support Marine Forces deployed [around the world]. 
   The need to replace----  
   And this is what the chairman of the committee was trying to point out--  
   aging/obsolete CT-39G aircraft has been accelerated by the transfer of 2 of the Marine Corps 3 remaining CT-39s to the Navy.....  
   We do not even have the obsolete aircraft. That is nothing new for the Marine Corps. We do not even have that. 
   I continue with the answer in regards to that statement that has been stated by the Commandant:  
   The increased performance and short field capability of the UC-35 will ensure OSA support to forward deployed Marine Corps forces remains viable well into the 21st century.  
   Again, I am quoting from the Commandant:  
   The Marine Corps has placed 3 UC-35s on the Commandant's FY00 APN Unfunded Priority List in order to accelerate delivery to the West Coast and Okinawa to support Marine forces. 
   [These] Missions are typically unpredictable, high priority, and require short notice airlift of people, cargo, and mail. These lifts are normally in support of contingency deployments not compatible with commercial transportation, common user airlift, or other organic airlift.  
   That is a long way from being mollycoddled or thinking that you must have a perk aircraft because some other admiral or general might have a perk aircraft. 
   I agree with the Senators from Iowa and California, we must make sure that the Department of Defense, as is indicated by their response, adheres to the GAO report, without question. 
   Nobody wants to soak the taxpayer for any kind of generals' special fleet. That is not what this does. This amendment would strike nine unfunded priority requests by the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. I will put that dot com at the end of my remarks and hope people will pay attention to the people who have that responsibility. 
   I hope my colleagues will oppose the amendment.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the current primary instructional facility, Bell Hall, at the Command & General Staff College, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, is becoming incapable of performing its mission of preparing officers for positions of increased complexity and responsibility within the United States Army and other services. Bell Hall is the central academic and instructional facility of the C&GSC but the building's deteriorating physical plant and patchwork communication infrastructure can no longer support the instructional requirements contained in current and evolving Army curriculum. I am concerned that if a replacement facility is not constructed as soon as possible maintenance costs will continue to increase while Army Operation and Maintenance resources decline and student access to state-of-the-art technology required to teach advanced warfighting skills will remain limited.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my intention to speak for about 10 minutes in reference to the National Defense Authorization Act. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for his outstanding leadership in the past year. I also thank the distinguished ranking member, Senator LEVIN, for his leadership as well. 
   This is a good, solid, and positive effort in behalf of our national defense. As a subcommittee chairman, I am particularly proud of the work we were able to accomplish in the subcommittee that we call the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I would like to review the key provisions contained in this act that fell under the jurisdiction of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee. 
   As the chairman has pointed out, as well as the distinguished Senator from Michigan, in the last year, what we call information warfare, and what some call cyberthreats--and the American public is certainly becoming much more aware of that situation--to the United States, including the Department of Defense, have increased very dramatically. The Department of Defense reported that these attacks on Defense Department systems increased from under 6,000 in 1998, only 2 years ago, to over 22,000 in 1999. That figure is doing nothing but dramatically increasing and there is every indication that this trend is going to continue. 
   From a national economic standpoint in regard to private industry, we are very susceptible and we are very vulnerable. In regard to our national security, we are very vulnerable. I remain concerned that many important, what we call information assurance programs, designed to protect against such 
   cyberattacks, basically remain underfunded by the Department of Defense. For example, at the hearing before the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, as of this spring witnesses from the Department once again confirmed that such funding shortfalls remain significant and presented a list of almost $500 million in unfunded requirements in this area. Obviously that is a considerable amount of money. When you compare it to the ever-increasing threats and vuneralabilities, you can see just how important this is. 
   For these reasons, we have included $76.8 million in this bill not only for today's underfunded requirements but also to really try to initiate programs such as training and education. Let me really underscore the word, in regard to education, in something called ``cybersecurity,'' that will continue to provide meaningful solutions far into the future. Senator WARNER's initiative--what I refer to as the Roberts-Warner initiative, and the distinguished chairman refers to it as the Warner-Roberts initiative--he has embarked through his leadership and through his research on a whole series of scholarships in information security to attract our young people, the best and brightest; not to rely on those who come to us from foreign countries with ever-increasing higher immigration quotas. We must bring the next generation on to have this expertise. So these Warner scholarships in regard to information security for the Department of Defense will have far-reaching and, most important, positive effects in this situation. 
   Second, I want to talk about the terrorist threats to our citizens and our service members. It shows no sign of diminishing. Especially in regard to the weeks that led up to the millennium celebration, numerous individuals who were suspected of planning terrorist attacks directed at U.S. citizens were arrested in the United States and abroad. 
   This is a threat from state actors and nonstate actors all over the world; and with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the threat of a terrorist attack with a chemical, biological, or nuclear weapon is increasing at an alarming rate. 
   We asked the experts who came before the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, the experts whose job it is to determine what represents a vital national security risk: What keeps you up at night? What makes you really worry in regard to a vital national security threat? 
   Their response was largely along two lines of concern: one, in regard to the cyberattacks which we are already experiencing in private industry and the Pentagon experiences every day, and the other one was biological attacks. It is so easy to use, whether it be a state actor or a nonstate actor or anybody connected with organized crime or any individual who wants to cause a great deal of trouble. 
   We, as a nation, must continue to detect and try to deter such attacks, but if such an attack happens, we must be prepared to deal with the consequences. We call this consequence management. We in Kansas, just to the north of Oklahoma City, full well know what kind of a tragedy can occur in regard to consequence management. Stop and think a minute about a terrorist threat and what could happen in our urban areas or, for that matter, anywhere in the country, and my colleagues can understand the seriousness of this problem.  
   Our subcommittee will continue to play a leading role in ensuring the Department of Defense is adequately funded and structured to perform its critical role in the overall U.S. Government effort to, again, deter, detect, and combat terrorism. The bill contains an additional $35 million for these efforts. 
   This year we continue a comprehensive review, initiated last year, of the activities of the Department of Defense to combat terrorism. Obviously, our goal is to make the Department efforts in this critical area more visible and certainly better organized. In fact, at a subcommittee hearing, leading Department of Defense witnesses testified to, No. 1, what their jurisdiction is; No. 2, what they have been doing; No. 3, what they plan to do and what their budget requirements are; and if, in fact, they could ask us for their priority concerns, what would they be. 
   Before this hearing, I asked them to sit in the order of their chain of command to figure out who was in charge and is this effort being properly coordinated and shared, and what about communication. They looked at one another. There were four witnesses and nobody knew who was at the top of the chain of command. Hello, we have a big problem in that respect. 
   We included in the markup a provision to address this. When I say ``we,'' I include the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator BINGAMAN, and the distinguished Senator whose efforts, in part, led to the creation of the subcommittee, Senator LIEBERMAN. 
   We have also worked to increase the capabilities of the Department of Defense to assist in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil involving the use of a weapon of mass destruction. 
   This bill also authorizes over $1 billion, again to support the Russian threat reduction and nonproliferation efforts. During the post-cold-war decade, the U.S. Government has 
   spent--I do not think too many of my colleagues recognize this; I know not too many of our American citizens understand this, but during the post-cold-war decade, the U.S. Government has spent over $4.7 billion in the former Soviet Union to reduce the threat posed by the possible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and weapons-usable nuclear materials and scientific expertise. After nearly a decade of working in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union, committing ourselves to future efforts, we thought it was important for us to review what these programs have achieved. 
   Senator LEVIN has spoken eloquently of the need for the continuation of this effort and the intent of the effort. I share his commitment, but I am concerned that for all the good intentions and all the significant investment that has been made, the return of reducing the threat has been too small relative to the $4.7 billion. We can do better. 
   For example, the General Accounting Office found that $481.2 million has been spent since fiscal year 1993 on a program designed to secure the weapons-usable nuclear material in Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union, but only 7 percent of the total nuclear material identified as being at risk has been secured. I am troubled by this progress achieved in light of this significant investment. We are not going to scrap the program, but we must do better. 
   In March, the GAO testified that the costs associated with achieving the threat reduction will continue to increase due primarily to the following facts: Russia's inability to pay its share of the costs of these programs, and we are certainly working in that regard with our Russian counterparts; Russia's basic reluctance to provide the United States with needed access to its sensitive facilities. I was in Russia last August attempting to gain greater access. We will continue those efforts. 
   To help solve those problems, this mark contains several initiatives to obtain greater Russian commitment and necessary access to ensure these programs will have a greater chance of attaining their stated objectives, and if we do that, these programs will attain even further widespread support and they can be a success. 
   I call the attention of my colleagues to a modest, but extremely important, initiative in this bill with widespread bipartisan interest that will lead to a major joint field experiment in 2002. I do not know of any commitment that will be undertaken in the future by any of our military services that will not be joint. 
   This experiment will evaluate visions of our military services for future combat forces and ensure they can be brought together effectively for joint military operations to deter and counter the emerging threats to our national security. I am talking about the fact that we lack interoperability. I know the services and the service chiefs say we have this interoperability. With all due respect to the service chiefs and others, we do not have that ability to the degree we need it. That is why we feel we must press ahead with a major joint field experiment if we possibly can. It is absolutely essential. 
   Finally, my colleagues will find in this recommendation an affirmation of the subcommittee's strong support of the Defense Science and Technology Program. This bill includes an increase--I emphasize, an increase--of $446 million to science and technology. That is a 9-percent increase over the President's budget request. It is this investment that will provide for future capabilities to deal with emerging threats to our national security. 
   This is a solid effort; it is a positive effort. It will meet the objective within the constraints of the defense budget for the work assigned to the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I urge approval of this legislation. 
   I join our able chairman in thanking the majority and minority committee staff, my subcommittee staff, and my personal staff for a job well done. I specifically mention Pam Farrell. If one puts charming and tenacious together, it might be considered an oxymoron. It is not the case with Ms. Farrell. Without her leadership and expertise and being just as tenacious as she can be, we would never have increased the science and technology budget by more than 9 percent over the President's budget. She does an amazing job. 
   I would also like to thank Ed Edens and Joe Sixeas, who is affectionately called Andy, for their work in regard to the counterterrorism efforts we are conducting, more especially with the RAID teams that we now say are CST teams; Chuck Alsup in regard to the joint experimentation initiative; Cord Sterling, who has been in Central America, South America, virtually every country where we have a threat in regard to drugs, working overtime. In regard to cyberattacks, Eric Thoemmes, does an outstanding job. He really has to keep up with that and has done a super job. Then on the cooperative threat reduction programs, Mary Alice Hayward. 
   All of these folks have done an outstanding job. Their minority counterparts have done likewise. We are only as good as our staff. In this regard, I want to pay personal thanks to the staff. 
   I urge the adoption of this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia, Senator CLELAND, for his role in our ongoing, bipartisan foreign policy dialog. As we approach Memorial Day, I also thank him for his personal sacrifice and example for our great country. 
   This is our fourth foreign policy dialog. It is called the employment of U.S. military forces or what could be better described as the use of force. It couldn't come at a better time, the week prior to the Memorial Day celebration, a day of solemn celebration and reflection, a day to remember our fallen family members, our friends, and our fellow Americans, a day that always makes me very proud of our country and humbled by the self-sacrifice of our men and women who paid the ultimate price so that we may live free. 
   As my good friend from Georgia has seen with his own eyes, it is not the U.S. Constitution that really keeps us free, for it is merely a piece of paper. The marble headstones at Arlington National Cemetery and cemeteries all across America and throughout the world mark what truly has kept us free. And our freedoms will continue to be secured by the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   Samuel P. Huntington, the renowned author and historian in the 1950s, articulated in his book ``The Soldier and the State'' two important military characteristics. The first is expertise to prevail at the art of war; the second is the responsibility for protecting our freedoms, similar to the responsibility that lawyers have to protect American justice and the rule of law and that doctors have to save lives and protect the health of their patients. Quite simply: The role of our Armed Forces is to fight and to win the Nation's wars. 
   Eleven times in our history the United States has formally declared war against foreign adversaries. There have been hundreds of instances, however, in which the United States has utilized military forces abroad in situations of military conflict or potential conflict to protect our U.S. citizens or to promote our U.S. interests. Of those hundreds of uses of military force where the U.S. did not declare war, some have obviously been successful and some obviously have not. 
   Today, I am not going to discuss the use of military force for the purpose of protecting our vital national interests. Those uses of force in our history have occurred rarely and usually without much opposition due to the future of the Nation. Our forces are equipped and train every day to carry out this task. Those types of conflicts of national survival have easily been defined in terms of the political objectives, clear military strategies to achieve those objectives, and the definition of victory or success is the capitulation of the enemy.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2559, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000. 
   As has been indicated by my colleagues, this legislation provides what we believe are very dramatic reforms to the Crop Insurance Program. It also marks the final product of a legislative initiative Senator BOB KERREY and I began working on nearly 2 years ago. Senator KERREY and I decided to undertake this task at the same time Congress was passing the first of several large agriculture assistance packages in 1998. The problems we experienced in 1998 and again in 1999 exposed many of the holes in the current Crop Insurance Program. We agreed that changes needed to be made and that we must work together in a bipartisan manner to achieve program improvements. In fact, this is one of the reforms that was promised as an integral part of the 1996 farm bill. Obviously, those reforms did not take place, but here we are, finally, in an effort to achieve those reforms. 
   Senator KERREY and I did not just set out to write a bill based upon what we thought needed to be done. Rather, we wanted input from those who were most directly affected by this program. We asked virtually every producer, every farm organization, every commodity group, every crop insurance company, every insurance agent group in the country for input on this legislation. We traveled throughout the country. We held, literally, hundreds of hours of listening sessions here in Washington to get the input both from the organizations and the producers. 
   The responses were overwhelmingly clear: Major changes were needed in regard to the Crop Insurance Program. These groups recommended more affordable crop insurance policies at 
   higher levels of coverage, equalization of the subsidy on something called revenue insurance, provisions to deal with multiple years of disaster, a better program for new and beginning farmers, changes in the product approval process, and, finally, the removal of the regulatory roadblocks that had stifled new product development. 
   Senator KERREY and I took these recommendations very seriously, and this legislation achieves each of these goals. The process has not been easy. We began our meetings on this issue in September of 1998. We introduced our first legislation, S. 529, the Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act, last February. We then introduced a second bill, S. 1580, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, in September. In March, the Agriculture Committee and the Senate approved the crop insurance legislation that was based largely upon our original bill. Since passage of the Senate bill, we have spent nearly 7 full weeks in conference with the House. There have been many surprises, many bumps in the road, to say the least, sometimes arising at the last minute. I believe those unexpected bumps, however, were appropriate because they helped remind us of the often unexpected, unpredictable risks that our farmers and ranchers face on a daily basis, the same risks that this legislation works to help them manage. 
   The task was difficult and the hours were often long, but in the end we achieved a bipartisan bill that was supported by all 18 members of the conference committee between the House and the Senate. That is no small achievement. 
   Exactly what does this bill do? It makes it easier for producers to purchase the higher levels of coverage by increasing the premium write-downs and reducing the farmer's out-of-pocket expenses. By allowing the producer to produce these higher levels of coverage, I believe we will reduce the need for future disaster bills, those disaster bills that are always a disaster to pass, a disaster to implement, and always seem to come during even-numbered years. The legislation makes the revenue insurance policies that have become enormously popular for producers more affordable as well. This is risk management. These are risk management tools that, hopefully, will lessen the reliance on disaster bills and all of the expenditures that those entail, usually under emergency legislation. 
   The legislation also provides adjustments to something called the average production history, the APH, for those farmers who have experienced a year or years of significant crop losses and disaster. It provides for a new assigned yield system that will benefit new and beginning farmers. 
   The legislation also restructures the board of directors to provide more producer and insurance expertise. The product approval and the research development processes are greatly improved. This will result in the development of new and improved products that will provide our producers with the additional risk management tools they need. 
   We have also strengthened the fraud and abuse penalties in the program. Farmers and ranchers should pay attention to this; critics of the farm program should pay attention to this. Under this legislation, the producers and insurance representatives who would abuse the program face fines of up to $10,000 and possible disbarment from all USDA programs for up to 5 years. Those who would try to destroy the integrity of the program are going to be punished, and they are going to be punished big time. 
   I also comment on several provisions that do not necessarily affect my State and producers but which I know are very important to other Members in this body. 
   In recent years, there have been many complaints that specialty crop producers and certain areas of the country have been ``underserved'' by the Crop Insurance Program. This legislation takes major steps to address these concerns. 
   First, it provides nearly $500 million over 5 years for changes to make something called the Noninsured Assistance Program, or NAP. NAP will work better for these producers. It requires the RMA to undertake studies and report to Congress on ways to better serve these areas. And more than $200 million is provided for expanded research and education to develop new and better risk management products for these producers. 
   Mr. President, in addition to the important crop insurance reforms included in this package, we have also provided $7.1 billion in agriculture assistance for farmers and ranchers who have not enjoyed the booming economic times experienced by the rest of the U.S. economy. Approximately $5.5 billion of this amount will go out as market loss payments, through the AMTA payment mechanism established in the 1996 farm bill. 
   Now, while I understand some of my colleagues believe this is not the best way to distribute these funds, it is the quickest guaranteed manner by which the USDA can make these payments. I remind my colleagues who wanted to develop a new payment formula that in the past 2 years it has taken the Department of Agriculture at least 9 months to make these payments through the disaster and assistance programs that were not paid to producers through the AMTA payment mechanism. 
   I also point out that after a lot of real criticism regarding the AMTA process, the department or the administration came forward with a plan, only to be roundly criticized by virtually every farm organization and commodity group. So I think this is the way to do it. These are emergency payments. 
   As long as we don't have our export markets back, as long as farmers are not experiencing the kind of farm income at the country elevator, and market prices are depressed, I think this is appropriate, and doubtless this will help. We are doing it early. We are doing it early in the spring. It is in the budget. No Social Security money. No emergency money. The farmers, ranchers, and the lenders can sit down, and  under consistency and predictability, know what they are getting this fall. 
   I am also pleased that $15 million is included for carbon sequestration research. The preliminary research indicates that agriculture can and will play an important and positive role in the debate regarding global climate change, and this funding is an important downpayment on this research. Senator KERREY and I worked hard to include this research money. It will enable farmers, again, to play a positive role in taking carbon out of the atmosphere and to mitigate the global climate change problems we have. 
   I could continue to discuss the merits of this legislation, but I will cease and desist. However, I do have a few closing comments. 
   First, this legislation has been a personal priority of mine for many years. It was nearly 20 years ago that my predecessor in the House of Representatives, Congressman Keith Sebelius, cast the deciding vote to create the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Since that time, I have been committed to strengthening this program and making it work for our producers. We promised this in the 1996 farm bill. In addition, an improved Crop Insurance Program has been an underlying promise 
   ever since that bill has been passed. It was a promise I personally made, and today I consider it a promise, hopefully, fulfilled. 
   It has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Nebraska on this issue. Senator KERREY is retiring from the Senate when this session ends, and I know passage of this bill before leaving the Senate has been one of his top priorities. We could not have done the job, the committee could not have done the job, the staff could not have done the job, we would not have had this bill without the support, leadership, advice, counsel, and hard work of Senator KERREY. Furthermore, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator LUGAR, for his assistance in working with us to get a strong bill out of the conference between the House and Senate. Without his leadership as well, obviously, we would not have this package. 
   Finally, I thank the staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee. The Senate legislative counsel and the Congressional Budget Office spent considerable time on this legislation. As a matter of fact, maybe even too much time. It has been a Herculean effort, and all Members and staff involved deserve to be commended. I would be remiss if I did not mention specifically Bev Paul, who works for Senator KERREY; Mike Seifert, who works for me; and Keith Luse, the distinguished and able staff director of the Senate Agriculture Committee. They basically did the work and reported to us, and we reported to them to go back to work and they finally produced a bill. They persevered. 
   I close by stating that this is a good and fair bill. For the first time, it is a truly national crop insurance bill that serves all regions of the country. I remind my colleagues that it is a bipartisan bill, supported by all 18 members of the conference committee. It represents a real investment in our farmers and ranchers and the agriculture sector of our economy. I am proud of our efforts on this legislation. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support. I urge its quick passage. It is my understanding that it passed by unanimous consent in the other body, which has a lot of difficulty deciding when to adjourn, let alone passing things by unanimous consent. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce sweeping legislation to reform and improve math, science, engineering and technology education in American schools. 
   The fields of science, math, engineering and technology are critical to U.S. economic success. Unfortunately, there is growing concern that we do not measure up as evidenced by studies that show our students cannot compete internationally. In fact, over half of students in our esteemed graduate schools are from other countries. Our economic future depends on science and we must ensure that our schools are preparing students for the technological jobs that await them. 
   So many aspects of our national success depends on our technological savvy. For instance, our strong economy has certainly prospered because of technology advances. The economic boom, witnessed by average consumers and Wall Street analysts alike, has high stakes in our continued technology success. Meanwhile, our workforce is increasingly staffed by people from other countries. Later this year, Congress will be asked to again raise  the quota of H-1B visas. While these workers are key to our economic success, we must address this problem and grow our own high-tech labor force. Moreover, we cannot forget how adversely our national security could fare if our country were to fall behind in technological pursuits. A key piece of our national security is at stake--the strength of our military is built upon our technological superiority. 
   There is a fundamental need for this legislation. I have introduced the following three bills to help improve the quality of science and technology teachers and curriculum through incentives and better training: 
   The National Science Education Act. These provisions, utilizing the National Science Foundation, set up Science Master Teachers and offer grants to place one in every elementary school. 
   The National Science Education Enhancement Act. Recognizing that we must keep good teachers and help them grow in their career, this bill uses the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to set up Science Teacher Mentors and Summer Professional Development Institutes. It also expands the Eisenhower National clearinghouse to provide that this information be available on the Internet. 
   The National Science Education Incentive Act. This bill provides tax credits to help teachers with up to $10,000 of tuition and encourage the private sector education contributions such as computers, technology service, teacher training and teacher externships. 
   My legislation is mirrored in the House of Representatives with bills by Representative VERNON EHLERS, the vice chairman of the House Science Committee and author of ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New National Science Policy.'' Furthermore, I am pleased to have the support and able assistance of the Senior Senator from Maine, Senator OLYMPIA J. SNOWE in joining me to introduce this bill.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support to the proposed legislation by my colleagues, Senator BYRD and Senator WARNER, in reference to U.S. obligations and involvement in Kosovo and, in a larger sense, in NATO as well, and in opposition to the amendment to strike that has been offered by the distinguished Senator from Michigan. 
   In this regard, I am a cosponsor of the language introduced several weeks ago by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER. I had the privilege of being in the Presiding Officer's chair when he introduced his legislation. Senator WARNER, after many trips to Kosovo and firsthand experience, became convinced that our united efforts in the Balkans would have no chance of success unless promises made by our allies were kept--obligations for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction so crucial to any positive outcome. 
   Senator WARNER, in effect, issued a strong warning to our valued allies, and I believe his legislation has become a catalyst for action. Almost every contributing NATO ally and the officials within the administration, has assured the chairman, that they have been, are, or will step up to the plate and fulfill their financial obligations. 
   I feel with certainty that President Clinton can and will certify the Warner requirements have been met, so essential to achieving peace and stability in Kosovo. Regardless of how Members feel about this legislation or U.S. involvement in Kosovo, we owe Senator WARNER a debt of gratitude. 
   The second part of this legislation has been authored by Senator ROBERT BYRD. His knowledge of the U.S. Constitution has no equal in this body and his tireless efforts in defending and protecting the constitutional prerogatives of this institution will be among the many legacies he will leave us. 
   Senator BYRD has a not-so-unique conviction. He believes, and I believe, that we should balance the need for Presidential flexibility in foreign affairs and our constitutional power of the purse. 
   His legislation signals the end to open-ended--and I emphasize the word ``open-ended''--U.S. peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and by periodic reporting promote actual consultation with the Congress and enable us to abide by the Constitution's directives on the separation of powers. 
   I certainly identify with Senator BYRD's purpose, as I authored a somewhat similar reporting requirement in 1998 during consideration of the Defense appropriations bill, as did Senators CLELAND and SNOWE. This is not new ground we are plowing. The reporting requirement was a little different. It was after the fact, and it was a foregone conclusion in terms of our involvement. We were trying to better determine the mission, the cost, the timing, et cetera. Again, this is not new ground we are plowing. 
   Notwithstanding the actual content of the Byrd-Warner amendment, it certainly has caused quite a fuss, so much of a fuss that the Senate of the United States is actually in the midst of a foreign policy debate, some $15 billion and 6 or 7 years into intervention in the Balkans. 
   We actually have Senators in both the Republican conference and the Democratic caucus involved in some very spirited debate about the U.S. policy in the Balkans, so emblematic of the so-called Clinton doctrine. Imagine that, foreign policy actually getting  some attention in the middle of an election year and a Presidential campaign. That is good. That is not bad; that is good. We need this debate. 
   In fact, I know of two Senators, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. CLELAND, and this Senator from Kansas who have braved the morning business hours, always held in the late afternoons, to launch what we call a foreign policy dialog and discuss at length our vital national security interests, the direction of our foreign policy, and the use of force and related topics. 
   A few Senators have joined us, particularly Senators HUTCHINSON, HAGEL, LUGAR, and LEVIN. It was a good dialog. We will have more. But this debate is about an actual amendment calling for the Senate to meet our obligations and responsibilities to be an equal partner with the executive in determining where and why our American men and women in uniform are put in harm's way, and for what purpose, and commensurate with our commitments in regard to our allies. 
   This is almost beyond the hopes of Senator CLELAND and myself, who have been trying to attract attention to this topic for the better part of this session. 
   My colleagues, this legislation does us, our military, and the American people a big favor, it seems to me. It places the Congress into a process, a process where we already have a constitutional obligation. Simply put, if we, as a body, believe our continued presence in Kosovo is justified, then we do so by voting to stay. 
   Second, the provision asks the United States to provide a plan to return the peacekeeping responsibility--I emphasize that, the peacekeeping responsibility--to our allies in Europe by the first of October of next year--18 months away. 
   Last, it asks the President to certify that the E.U. and the European members of NATO meet the obligations for the humanitarian assistance and the reconstruction they have promised. 
   This legislation has created quite a fuss. Supporters have been labeled--and I am quoting here--as ``isolationists,'' ``Cassandras,'' and ``blind to the facts.'' 
   The critics of this legislation say, if this amendment is adopted, Europe will be plunged into darkness, NATO will resemble Humpty-Dumpty, and 50 years of U.S.-Europe cooperation will be in danger, not to mention the peace and stability in the Balkans. Really? 
   My colleagues, to suggest that if we ask to bring our combat troops home after an orderly turnover to European peacekeepers, to ask the Congress to vote on their approval or their disapproval of continued U.S. participation in Kosovo, and to ask that the President certify that the Europeans will meet their funding obligations they promised--if that represents a lessening of our commitment to Europe, this, to me, is histrionics of amazing proportions. 
   Let the critics, let all of my colleagues who oppose this legislation, answer the following questions: 
   First: Are the Europeans capable of maintaining the peace in Kosovo? That is a very important question. 
   Second: Are the Europeans solvent enough to meet their promised fiscal responsibility? I think we all know the answer to that. 
   Does the Congress have any responsibility for foreign policy? 
   Have we asked the President, time and time again, with numerous reporting requirements--as I have indicated, as Senator CLELAND, Senator SNOWE, and I have over 2 years ago--to better inform and include Congress in foreign policy decisions? 
   Would the United States respond militarily if a conflict erupted in Europe following the passage of this legislation? 
   Does an ill-defined, poorly executed, and ineffective policy in the Balkans have a direct negative effect on our military and our remaining military obligations around the world? 
   I think the answers, my colleagues and critics, is yes to all of those questions. 
   In fact, I think it is a bit condescending or paternalistic, if not outright arrogant, to suggest, as some have stated, that without direct U.S. participation--we are talking about ground troops now, not logistics, not airlift, not intelligence--that the European military would be unable to maintain the peace and war will spread to neighboring nations. 
   Those of us who are privileged to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee have met repeatedly with our foreign counterparts to learn repeatedly that the European Union members are developing a rapid deployment force with defensive capability--they call it the ESDI--that they say will be, or is right now, capable of maintaining the peace in the Balkans. Are they wrong? We have 17 months to really try to figure that out. 
   As an aside, would our peacekeepers assume a combat role? Do I recall press accounts where Americans are no longer permitted to come to the assistance of other peacekeepers in other sectors, in certain situations, following a skirmish in the German sector? 
   So let me get this right. We are peacekeepers, but we cannot withdraw because of a possible problem that could break out; but we are not allowed to go to other sectors to assist if a problem breaks out? Something is wrong here. 
   Do the opponents of this legislation actually think that because of this provision, the United States will in fact become isolationists? Do opponents think by passing this provision, it signals an end to our participation in NATO or in Europe? That argument is absurd. I think the opponents know it. That is not the issue. 
   Aside from fulfilling our constitutional obligations, the issue is this: The U.S. military is being deployed all over the world by this administration at rates far above that seen in regard to the cold war. We must ensure that we have the forces to be able to respond to threats to our vital national security interests. 
   The point is not to debate whether we should have gone to war in Kosovo--those 20-20 hindsight lessons learned are still in progress, and they should be--but rather to decide how long we will keep draining limited U.S. resources when we still cannot define what our long-term objectives in Kosovo are, or when the Europeans are fully capable of performing the peacekeeping mission again, and they have committed to providing the reconstruction resources and the resources for humanitarian relief. 
   This legislation is, in fact, in concert with the new Combined Joint Task Force mechanism adopted by NATO during the Washington summit. That is the summit that was held last spring. In this regard, we all left town and the NATO ambassadors stayed here. They adopted a new Strategic Concept. I doubt if many Senators have read the new Strategic Concept. I did. 
   I am a little concerned about our mission in that regard. I even had an amendment, that was adopted, that asked the President to certify whether we had obligations and 
   responsibilities on all these new missions in regard to the Strategic Concept. 
   In that Strategic Concept, passed last fall, largely at the request of our European allies, the task force allows NATO members to utilize--listen up, my colleagues--the task force allows NATO members to utilize noncombat NATO resources in support of an operation that is conducted by a coalition of willing nations without requiring all alliance members to participate in it. 
   That is the concept. That is what this legislation does. 
   There is no reason this CJTF plan would not allow the United States to continue to provide--as the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee said over and over again in this debate--airlift, logistics, intelligence, and, yes, peacekeeping support. 
   What is the end game here? Not only are there no clear objectives that would end our involvement in Kosovo, but there is no understanding, at least from this Senator's standpoint, of what constitutes ``winning the peace.'' I would like somebody to tell me. 
   I would like somebody to tell me, after years of discussion and hearings, especially in the Intelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee, the President, Secretary Albright or National Security Adviser Berger or Gen. Wesley Clark, who is back in Washington after a very tough duty assignment that he conducted so well, or my colleagues who are so critical of this amendment: What is it that winning the peace in Kosovo means? 
   Is it harmonious coexistence of the Serb and the Albanian population in  some yet to be defined autonomous or semiautonomous region called Kosovo? Is it when the level of violence, Serb on Albanian, Albanian on Serb, Albanian on Albanian or Serb on Serb or any combination of those, has been reduced to a point that CNN no longer covers it? Or is it when the western nations have kept the peace long enough for generations to pass and the great grandchildren of the combatants no longer remember the atrocities they inflicted on one another? 
   I am all for winning a peace. I don't know of anybody who is not. But I am concerned, and I am afraid the reality is that the U.S. cannot afford to wait. We are not talking about now. We are talking about October from October, 18 months. I say this not out of a lack of compassion for the inflicted innocents of Kosovo--those who I met and whose pleas I have heard and the memories of which I will carry forever--but because our U.S. military is stretched and strained and growing hollow once again, and our world commitments are too great to allow us to stay in Kosovo indefinitely. 
   Some time ago, June 19, 1998, Senator CLELAND and Senator SNOWE passed an amendment calling for a report from the Executive, what clear and distinct objectives guide the 
   activities of the United States in the Balkans, what the President has identified on the basis of those objectives as the date or set of conditions that define the end point of the operation. That was 2 years ago. 
   There are findings here that pretty well underscore the concern and the frustration we have had, all of us, in a bipartisan way. We have a May 3, 1994, Presidential Decision Directive 25 declaring that American participation in the United Nations and other peace operations will depend in part--this was before Kosovo; this is Bosnia--on whether the role of the U.S. forces is tied to clear objectives and an end point for U.S. participation can be identified. 
   I think the distinguished chairman's amendment and that of Senator BYRD is commensurate with the Presidential directive. I had an amendment, as I indicated, to the Defense appropriations bill, saying: None of the funds appropriated on or otherwise made available, et cetera, could be obligated or expended for any additional deployment of forces--this is before Kosovo and the bombing, all of that--until the following questions were answered: The reasons why the deployment is in the national security interests of the United States; the number of U.S. military personnel; the mission and objectives, et cetera; the exit strategy. 
   About 6 months to a year later, we finally got a response. I can tell you that the mission has changed dramatically. Then we all wanted to safeguard the return of the refugees and provide a safe haven and end the fighting. Today, I am not sure if we can define ``winning the peace.''

   Mr. ROBERTS. I asked the colonel what he was proud of, what kind of progress he had made. That was the trip that we had in February to Kosovo. He indicated that finally they had found somebody who agreed to serve as a schoolbus driver for the Serb children. Unfortunately, there were no Serb schoolchildren in Urisivic, and they would not have been allowed to attend the Kosovar school had they been there. In addition, there would have had to have been a separate curriculum and separate teachers. But they found a schoolbus driver who was willing to drive the schoolbus if, in fact, there was schoolchildren. 
   These troops were guarding six Serb families in what was called Serb Alley. They were escorted by armored vehicles to shop and get groceries once a week. These families are staying with the hope that their youngsters would return some day, if they are, in fact, still part of Serbia, and so they could continue their businesses. 
   I could go on with example after example. Basically, we asked him what he spent most of his time on. He said, Albanian violence on Albanian. The basic question is, within the next 18 months that we figure out if, in fact, Europe has the capability to conduct the peacekeeping operations. This is not a pullout. This is not an automatic retreat. All this is, is for the Congress of the United States to assume its constitutional responsibility at the end of 18 months, if the President requests it and says it is in our vital national interests, that we vote to stay. I, for one, would vote to stay if, in fact, the President looked me in the eye and said that was the case. I think under the circumstances I have made my point. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me again thank my good friend and a distinguished American hero and statesman, the Senator from Georgia, for setting in motion our bipartisan foreign policy dialog. His common sense approach and his insightfulness to our country's national security obligations, I think, have been most helpful and most educational. 
   I say to the Senator, I believe and I hope that our endeavor is accomplishing the original goals we outlined in our first dialog. Our dialog has attracted attention from the media, and some academics. We have been invited to participate in various academic panel discussions and foreign policy dialogs. 
   I hope both our colleagues and the American public have been paying attention in our effort to come to grips with America's role in an environment so different that we cannot even name it, other than calling it the post-Cold War period. 
   When I have the opportunity to go back to Kansas and address the issue of what our vital national security interests are; I realize foreign policy is not a very bright return on the public radar screen which is unfortunate. 
   Robert Kagan recently stated that the campaign for the Presidency should focus more on foreign policy. I certainly think that is the case. He asked a simple question, ``Is the world a safer place than it was 8 years ago?'' His article took us on a world tour of uncertainties, specifically identifying Iraq, the Balkans, China, Taiwan, and weapons of mass destruction proliferation, Haiti, Colombia and Russia. 
   A realistic evaluation of emerging patterns in the world lead us to the fact that the world is dangerously close to coming apart at the seams. It is time for a serious debate about foreign policy, and this dialog we have started is a small step in that direction. 
   In our last dialog Senator CLELAND and I discussed the importance of identifying and establishing levels of priority to our U.S. vital national interests. Many other think tanks and foreign policy organizations have recommended a similar priority ranking. I noticed the other day in an article that Vice President GORE has recently articulated, a new kind of foreign policy suggestion--a new agenda--adding the destruction of the natural environment and the AIDS pandemic overseas as ``a threat to U.S. national security interests.'' These unique and unprecedented issues are important issues, however, they have never made the cut in any other U.S. national interest lists. They definitely did not make the cut in the last bipartisan dialog that I had with my friend and colleague from Georgia. Nonetheless, it is a healthy debate, and I think it is a very proper debate for our country and the Presidential candidates. 
   What did make the cut is the fact that the United States does not want a hostile regional hegemon to develop in Europe or Asia. And then, in the meantime, what happened in the Balkans post-Bosnia and post-Kosovo is the fact that we have a paradox of enormous irony. The irony is the United States continues in the role of being a world hegemon, or superpower--the only one. Some critics say we have developed into a humanitarian world global cop and our actions and means are viewed by them as contrary to their own national interests. 
   Mr. President, the consequence of the U.S. role is the rest of the world is responding as any sovereign nation would respond to a hegemon. 
   Former Ambassador Bob Ellsworth, a former Member of the House of Representatives, and Dr. Michael May, wrote in the Los Angeles Times that U.S. military forces are so large, so advanced technologically, and so active all over the world, that a climate of ``hegemony envy'' has developed in key strategic areas in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. 
   Ambassador Ellsworth explains, the U.S. post-Cold War, change in posture from defense and deterrence to enlargement and offense, and the Clinton doctrine proclaiming and executing intervention around the world in regard to a rather questionable definition of U.S. vital national interests is creating antihegemonic coalitions against the United States. 
   This current trend of both allies and nonallies asserting themselves against the U.S. is a very troubling digression. 
   The Nobel Prize novelist and diplomat, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, observed that ``President Clinton has found the political legacy he wants to leave behind: The Imperial American Model.'' Obviously, that depiction of American foreign policy is counter to the goal of multilateral cooperation in the world today. 
   As Senator CLELAND stated, our third dialog today will focus on the role of multilateral organizations in foreign policy. 
   What are we talking about? Well, currently the United States is a member of a staggering 90 multilateral organizations and 
   numerous other bilateral agreements. It took a great deal of effort by staff and by research specialists to determine the number of multilateral organizations where the U.S. is obligated. I venture to guess, I say to my colleague, that the State Department, the Department of Defense, the Congress, and most foreign policy experts really don't have any idea individually or collectively of the responsibilities, commitments, or obligations or the money that these organizations require of the U.S. all throughout the world. 
   Richard Haass of the Brookings Institution tried to tackle the issue of how much the U.S. should try to do, largely or entirely on its own--unilaterally--depending on the policy priorities or the level of U.S. national interests versus how much the U.S. should do in cooperation with others. He articulated that the choice is very complicated, as the multilateral options subsume multiple approaches of multiple organizations, including using the U.N. and other international institutions, alliances, and other regional organizations, and coalitions of those able and willing to act. 
   The fact is, the U.S. almost never acts unilaterally, and it probably should not. The U.S. has fought five major wars during the 20th century, and in each of these conflicts the U.S. operated as part of an alliance or a coalition. The recent U.S. actions all were conducted in conjunction with forces from other nations, even as our military superiority has reached a level unmatched in history. 
   Therefore, if the U.S. is going to operate within the constraints of multilateral organizations--and that appears to be the case--the U.S. must structure alliances in such a way that promotes our national interests and ensures that U.S. power is not undermined. 
   The following list of multilateral organizations associated with countries that the U.S. has current, ongoing operations is staggering: Iraq, 23; East Timor, 5; Korea, 42; Kosovo, 6; Yugoslavia, 30; Colombia, 15. 
   We don't have enough time in the rest of the session of Congress to examine all of the multilateral organizations where the U.S. has obligations. Obviously, that is going to be an effort that should take place as we change administrations, whether it be the Vice President or whether it be the Governor from Texas. Today, like my colleague, I want to focus on NATO a bit and offer some possible suggestions for the future of America's alliances. 
   During the Cold War, containment of Soviet power provided a simple and easily definable job of deterrence from Warsaw Pact aggression. The new Strategic Concept that was adopted over a year ago during the 50th anniversary of  NATO is a far different concept from the collective defense organization originally developed from the ashes of World War II. 
   If you read the Strategic Concept, you will find that the new commitments outlined have evolved, as I have indicated, NATO from a collective security organization concerned with self-defense to an international crisis management and humanitarian relief operation and organization. 
   Alexander Vershbow, U.S. Permanent Representative on the North Atlantic Council, recently said:  
   Unbeknownst to many is the fact that the Strategic Concept's most important function is to instruct Alliance military authorities how to configure NATO defense forces so that they are equipped for the full range of Alliance missions, from collective defense to peacekeeping.  
   He also said:

    Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to increase the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation from the current $61 million to $81 million. I am pleased to have the support and able assistance of the Senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator J. ROBERT KERREY in joining me to introduce this bill. This increase allows the Foundation to add another 100 young people to the 300 that they now support. This substantial increase will augment the influence the Foundation already has on American higher education. 
   Goldwater scholarships are awarded to college juniors and seniors in math and science. The increased funding in this legislation is set aside for information technology students. Channeling these funds through the existing Goldwater framework will maximize the amount of money directly available to students. These students are selected on the basis of academic merit from a field of approximately 1,200 mathematics, science and engineering students nominated by the faculties of colleges and universities from the fifty states and Puerto Rico. Since 1988, 2,711 scholarships have been awarded, providing about $28 million to outstanding scholars from colleges and universities throughout the United States. 
   Goldwater Scholars are top notch. As evidence, I cite the large number of Goldwater Scholars who have been awarded prestigious graduate scholarships. Goldwater Scholars have won a total of 25 Rhodes Scholarships over the years. Last year alone, almost 20 percent of the awards--six out of 32--were Goldwater Scholars. Goldwater Scholars also populate the ranks of other distinguished fellowships. In the last eleven years, the scholars have won 19 Marshall, six Churchill, nine Fulbright, 23 Hughes, and 65 National Science Foundation fellowships. 
   These are the students we need in our economy. For the U.S. to continue to be competitive and support our growing economy, we must encourage our young men and women to enter the high technology industry. America's explosive demand for highly skilled workers is creating a new labor shortage. Under current conditions, we do not have enough U.S. workers trained in high technology fields. This forces our local businesses to resort to immigration to make up for this shortfall. Highly skilled immigrants enter the country under the H1-B visa waiver program. To help meet the growing demand, Congress raised the cap on H1-B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 in FY 1999 and 2000, and 107,500 in 2001. Unfortunately, even this increase is not enough. A tight labor market, increasing globalization and burgeoning economic growth continue to increase U.S. demands for highly skilled workers. The 1999 cap on H-1B visas was reached in June of last year and it is projected we will reach the cap even earlier this year. Later this month, we expect the Senate to consider another increase of H1-B visas to raise the cap to 195,000 a year for FY 2000, 2001 and 2002. 
   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I firmly believe that we have the responsibility to adequately train our own labor force to meet the business and industry demands of today and tomorrow. We simply cannot rely on workers from other countries to do our sensitive technology work. As we saw in the Y2K reprogram with our great dependence on foreign security workers, we are sorely in need of a domestic technology workforce.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am going to begin my remarks. We had originally intended for Senator CLELAND to begin this dialog. But I am going to go ahead since he has been detained. Then he can follow me. I do not think that is going to upset the order at all. 
   I thank my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, for this continued initiative and for his leadership in continuing our bipartisan foreign policy dialog. 
   As I said back in February during our first discussion, our objective is to try to achieve greater attention, focus, and  mutual understanding--not to mention a healthy dose of responsibility--in this body in regard to America's global role and our vital national security interests. Our goal was to begin a process of building a bipartisan coalition, a consensus on what America's role should be in today's ever-changing, unsafe, and very unpredictable world. 
   This is our second dialog. We will focus today on how we can better define our vital national interests. 
   In doing our homework, both Senator CLELAND and I have been doing a lot of reading and pouring over quite a few books and articles and commentaries and reports and legislation and speeches and position papers and the like. If it was printed, we read it. 
   We have also been seeking the advice and counsel of everybody involved--in my case, the marine lance corporal about to deploy to Kosovo, to the very serious and hollow-faced old gentleman I visited at a Macedonian refugee camp, as well as foreign dignitaries and the military brass we admire and listen to as members of the Armed Services Committee, and all of the current and former advisors and experts and think tank dwellers and foreign policy gurus and intelligence experts. Needless to say, our foreign policy and national security homework universe is ever expanding and apparently without end. I hope I didn't leave anybody out. 
   We both now have impressive bibliographies that we can wave around and put in the RECORD and we can recommend to our colleagues to prove that our bibliography tank, as it were, is pretty full. We have very little or no excuse if we are not informed. 
   There was another book I wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues. Its title is ``Going for the Max.'' It involves 12 principles for living life to the fullest, written by our colleague and my dear friend, with a most appropriate and moving foreword from the Senate Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie. This is a very easy and enjoyable read with a very inspirational message. 
   Chapter 10 of MAX's book states--and this is important--that success is a team effort, that coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, and working together is a success. 
   That is a pretty good model for our efforts today and a recipe for us to keep in mind in this body as we try to better fulfill our national security obligations and to protect our individual freedoms. 
   Thank you and well done, to my distinguished friend. 
   Senator CLELAND, in his remarks, will quote Owen Harries, editor of the publication, the National Interest. He will point out the need for restraint in regard to exercising our national power. Editor Harris warned--and this is what Senator CLELAND will say--  
   It is not what Americans think of the United States but what others think of it that will decide the matter.  
   When we are talking about ``matter,'' the ``matter'' in this case is stability and successful foreign and national security policy. I could not agree more. Senator CLELAND will go on to quote numerous statements from foreign leaders and editorials from leading international publications and commentaries from respected observers around the globe, from our allies and from the fence sitters and our would-be adversaries. 
   Sadly, I have to tell my colleagues that all were very critical of U.S. foreign policy. The basic thrust of the criticism, as described by Senator CLELAND--and he will be saying this. Again, I apologize that I started first. In the order of things, we are sort of reversing this. I am giving him a promo, if that is okay. At any rate, Senator CLELAND will state:  
   The United States has made a conscious decision to use our current position of predominance to pursue unilateralist foreign and national security policies.  
   Senator CLELAND is right. Dean Joseph S. Nye of the Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs warns about the CNN effect in the formulation and conduct of our foreign policy; the free flow of information and the shortened news cycles that have a huge impact on public opinion, and placing some items at the top of the public agenda that might otherwise warrant a lower priority; diverting attention from the A list of strategic issues of vital national security. What am I talking about? What does this criticism 
   really suggest? 
   We need to take the spin off. We need to take off our rose-colored, hegemonic glasses and take a hard look at the world and what the world thinks of us. I have a suggestion. It would only take Senators 10 minutes a day. Every Member of the Senate can and should receive what are called ``Issue Focus Reports.'' These are reports on foreign media reaction to the world issues of the day. They are put out by the State Department. We at least should be aware of what others think of us and our foreign policy. Unfortunately and sadly, it is not flattering. 
   For instance, the February 24 Issue Focus detailed foreign commentary from publications within our NATO allies, those who comprised Operation Allied Force in Kosovo, headlines of 39 reports from 10 countries. If my colleagues will bear with me a moment, these are some of the headlines. This is the Issue Focus I am talking about. It is a very short read. Senators could have that or could have this report at their disposal every week. Again, these are leading publications--some liberal, some conservative, some supportive of the United States and some not. Just as a catch-as-catch-can summary, listen to the headlines:  
   Kosovo Unrest--A Domino Effect; Another War?; Wither Kosovo?; Holding Back The Tide Of Ethnic Cleansing; Losing The Peace; By The Waters of Mitrovica; West Won The War, But Now Faces Losing The Peace; Holding Fast In The Kosovar Trap; Speculation On U.S. Domination In The Balkans; Whoever Believed In Multi-Ethnic Kosovo; Kosovo Calculations; The U.S. Is Playing With Fire; The West Is Helpless In Kosovo; Mitrovica, The Shadow Of The Wall Is Back; Military Intervention Against Serbia A Mistake; U.S. and Europe Are Also Clashing In Mitrovica; Kosovo Chaos Is A Trap For NATO; A Failure That Burns; The Difficult Peace.  
   It goes on and on. 
   This kind of reading would help us a great deal in understanding how others really think of us. The March 24 Issue Focus, based on 49 reports from leading newspapers and publications in 24 countries, assessed the U.S. and NATO policy 1 year after Operation Allied Force in the bombing of Kosovo. Summed up, the articles conclude it is time to ask some hard questions. Some unsettling headlines--again, this is a wide variety of publications from all ideologies and the whole political spectrum:

   Mr. ROBERTS. Charles Krauthammer points out in the article--and I will read a little of it--that, basically, what the Russians thought was the path from Kosovo to Putin is not that difficult to trace. It goes through Chechnya. 
   Americans may not see the connection, but the Russians do. The Russians have been operating under the assumption that to be a good international citizen, they could not engage in the unilateral use of force without the general approval of the international community. Well, Kosovo certainly cured them of that illusion. Finally, Russia acquiesced in the expansion of NATO under the expectation and assurance that it would remain always a defensive alliance. I am not arguing the pros and cons of that, but simply the reaction in Russia. Russians were doubly humiliated because the Balkans had long been in their sphere of influence, with Serbia as their traditional ally. The result was an intense anti-American, anti-NATO feeling engendered in Russia, and NATO expansion had really agitated the Russian elites, and Kosovo inflamed the Russian public. 
   So Kosovo created what has been called a national security consensus. The demand for a strong leader to do what it takes to restore Russia's standing and status made the confrontation with the United States a badge of honor. I will tell you, in going to Moscow and talking with Russian leaders regarding the very important cooperative threat reduction programs that happened to come under the jurisdiction of my subcommittee, you get a lecture on Kosovo for a half hour even before you have a cup of coffee. So this article has some merit. 
   In regard to Mr. Krauthammer's article:  
   The first Russian beneficiary of Kosovo was then-Prime Minister Primakov. But it was Prime Minister Putin who understood how to fully exploit it. Applying the lessons of Kosovo, he seized upon the Chechen provocations into neighboring Dagestan to launch his merciless war on Chechnya. It earned him enormous popularity and ultimately the presidency. 
   We are now saddled with him for four years, probably longer, much longer.  
   We hope the man without a face--which is how some describe Putin--we hope we can work with him and build a positive relationship. I think under the law of unintended effects, this is a good example. 
   In China, obviously, the political wounds fester in the wake of the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade; the Taiwan issue, charges of espionage, and the criticism of human rights; and continued controversy over whether or not Congress will approve a trading status that will result in the U.S. simply taking advantage of trade concessions that the Chinese have made to us. 
   In Latin America, the lack of a so-called fast-track authority and U.S. trade policy is muddled. You can drive south into Central America and into trade relations with our competitors in the European Union. My friend from  Nebraska, Senator HAGEL, who will join us in about an hour, put it this way:  
   It worries me, first, because most of us are not really picking this up on our radar--this sense that we don't care about what our trading partners or allies think. It is going to come back and snap us in some ways. It will be very bad for this country.  
   Well, the criticism from the Marshall and Mann article becomes very harsh when they cite why the U.S. has become so aloof. I am quoting here:  
   *.*.*.a President who engages only episodically on international issues and too often has failed to use either the personal prestige or the power of his office to pursue key foreign policy goals..*.*.*.a Congress that cares little about foreign affairs in the wake of the Cold War and seems to understand even less..*.*.*.a poisonous relationship between the two branches of our Government putting partisanship over national interests *.*.* an American public inattentive to world affairs and confused by all of the partisan backbiting now that the principal reference point--the evil of communism--has all but vanished as a major threat.  
   Indeed, that is a pretty harsh assessment. Aside from all the criticism and 20/20 hindsight--and it is easy to do that, trying to chart a well-defined foreign policy course is more complicated and difficult today than ever before. Both Senator CLELAND and I understand that. As chairman of the newly created Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it seems as if we have a new emerging threat at our doorstep almost every day. I am talking about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, rogue nations, ethnic wars, drugs, and terrorism. 
   Concluding our second hearing on the subcommittee this session, and again asking the experts, ``What keeps you up at night?'' the answer came back: ``Cyber attacks and biological attacks'' from virtually any kind of source, and the bottom line was not if, but when. 
   So it is not easy, but if we are worried about proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we should also be worried about the proliferation of overall foreign policy roles, not to mention the role the U.S. should play in the world today. 
   Some may say events of the day will determine our strategy on a case-by-case basis. That seems to be the case. But I say that is a dangerous path, as evidenced by adversaries that did not or will not believe we have the will to respond. 
   Former National Security Adviser, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, put it this way in a speech at the Brookings Institution National Forum, and he said this in response to some questions:  
   The nature of our approach to foreign policy also changed from, I would say, from foreign policy as a continuing focus of the United States, which it had been for the 50 years of the Cold War, to an episodic attention on the part of the United States, and thus without much of a theme, and further to that, a foreign policy whose decisions were heavily influenced by polls, by what was popular back home or what was assumed to be popular.  
   General Scowcroft went on to say:  
   So at a period when we should have been focusing on structures to improve the possibility that we could actually make some changes in the way the world operated, and some improvements, we have frittered away the time. I think never has history left us such a clean slate as we had in 1991. And we have not taken advantage of it. 
   One point on looking ahead from here. I think we have begun engaging on a fundamental transformation of the international system with insufficient thought. 
   We, NATO, President Clinton, the U.N. Secretary General, are moving to replace the Treaty of Westphalia, replacing the notion of the sovereignty of the nation-state with what I would call the sovereignty of the individual and humanitarianism. That is a profound change in the way the world operates. And we're doing it with very little analysis of what it is we're about and how we want this to turn out.  
   Evidenced by the Charles Krauthammer article. 
   Again I quote from the general:  
   In Kosovo, just for example, we conducted a devastating bombing of a country in an attempt to protect a minority within that country. And, as a result, we're now presiding over reverse ethnic cleansing. What's the difference between Kosovo and Chechnya?  
   That is a question not many of us want to ponder.  
   How many people must be placed in jeopardy to warrant an invasion of sovereignty? Where? By whom? How does one set priorities among these kind of crises?  
   And, events of the day, again dominated by the so-called CNN effect, ignore the same kind of core questions posed by General Scowcroft and reflected again in an article by Doyle McManus the Washington Bureau Chief of the Los Angeles Times: When should the United States use military power? 
   President Clinton has argued in the Clinton Doctrine that Americans should intervene wherever U.S. power can protect ethnic minorities from genocide. I would add a later UN speech seemed to indicate a backing off from that position. 
   How will the United States deal with China and Russia, the two great potentially hostile powers? 
   What is the biggest threat to our nation's security and how should the U.S. respond? Weapons of mass destruction head the list of course, but the President has added in terrorism, disease, poverty, disorder to the list. 
   I know about the Strategic Concept of NATO, when that was passed during the 50-year anniversary last spring in Washington. Those of us who read the Strategic Concept and all of the missions that entailed--moving away from a collective defense--we were concerned about that. We asked for a report as to whether that obligated the United States to all of these missions. 
   Finally, we received a report from the administration of about three pages. The report said we are not obligated and not responsible. If we are not responsible for the Strategic Concept of NATO, what are we doing adopting it? 
   When the U.S. acts, should it wait for the approval of the United Nations, seek the approval of our allies, or strike out on its own? 
   However, my colleagues, the biggest question remains and it was defined well by retired Air Force Brigadier General David Herrelko who wrote in the Dayton Daily News recently: 
   ``The United States needs to get a grip on what our national interests are, what we stand for and what we can reasonably do in the world before we can size our military forces and before we send them in harms way. We must hammer out, in a public forum, just what our national priorities are.'' He says, and I agree, we cannot continue adrift. Consider this retired military man's following points:  
   More Americans have died in peacekeeping operations (Lebanon, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia) than in military actions (Iraq, Panama, Grenada and Yugoslavia). 
   We have a president seeking United Nations approval for military intervention but skipping the dialogue with Congress.  
   I might add, the Congress skips the dialog with the President.  
   We commit our military forces before we clearly state our objectives. 
   We gradually escalate hostilities and we leave standing forces behind. 
   Some 7,000 now in Kosovo, and the peacekeepers. When there was no peace, they became the target.  
   General Herrelko ends his article with a plea: ``We are starved for meaningful dialogue between the White House and the Congress.'' 
   I agree Mr. President and would add we are starved for dialogue here in the Senate as well and that is why we are here. 
   And, as Senator CLELAND has pointed out, our goal is not to achieve unanimity on each and every issue but to at least contribute to an effort to focus attention on our challenges instead of reacting piecemeal as events of the day take place. 
   And, goodness knows even if the foreign policy stadium is not full of interested spectators, we do have quite an array of players. LA Times Bureau Chief McManus has his own program:  
   Humanitarian interventionists, mostly Democrats and President Clinton with Kosovo being the prime example. Nationalist interventionists, mostly Republicans who would intervene in defense of democracy, trade and military security. 
   Realists, both Republicans and Democrats  
   I think Senator CLELAND would be in that category.  
   skeptical about intervention but wanting the United States to block any concert of hostile powers.
   Minimalists, those who think the United States should stay out of foreign entanglements and quarrels and save its strengths for major conflicts.  
   Richard Haass, former foreign policy advisor in the Bush administration and now with the Brookings Institution, has defined the players in the foreign  policy program much along the same lines as Senator CLELAND did in his opening remarks during our first forum last month:  
   Wilsonians who wish to assist other countries achieve democracy; 
   Economists, who wish to promote trade, prosperity and free markets; 
   Realists, who wish to preserve an orderly balance of power without worrying too much what kind of states are doing the balancing; 
   Hegemonists who want to make sure the United States keeps its status as the only superpower; 
   Humanitarians, who wish to address oppression, poverty, hunger and environmental damage; 
   And, Minimalists, who wish to avoid spending time or tax dollars on any of these matters.  
   I'm not sure of any of my colleagues would want to be identified or characterized in any one of these categories but again the key question is whether or not the members of this foreign policy posse can ride in one direction and better define our vital national interests and from that definition establish priorities and a national strategy to achieve them. 
   Fortunately, as Senator CLELAND has pointed out, some very distinguished and experienced national security and foreign policy leaders have already provided several road maps that make a great deal of sense. What does not make a great deal of sense is that few are paying attention. 
   Lawrence Korb, Director of Studies of the Council on Foreign Relations, in a military analysis published in a publication called ``Great Decisions'' has focused on the Powell Doctrine named after retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell, citing the dangers of military engagement and the need to limit commitments to absolutely vital national interests. On the other hand, the sweeping Clinton Doctrine emphasizes a global policing role for the United States. 
   How do we reconcile these two approaches? 
   I am not sure there is only one yellow brick foreign policy road but there are several good alternatives that have been suggested: 
   First, I am going to refer to what I call the ``Old Testament'' on foreign policy in terms of vital national interests. This is the Commission on America's National Interests, 1996. 
   Second, a national security strategy for a new century put out by the White House this past December. If you are being critical, or suggesting, or if you have a different approach than the current policy, as I have been during my remarks, you have an obligation to read this. The White House put this out as of December of 1999. 
   Third, adapting U.S. Defense to Future Needs by Ashton Carter former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security in the first Clinton administration and currently professor of science and international affairs at Harvard. 
   We had him testify to this before the Emerging Threats Subcommittee just a month ago. 
   Fourth, defining U.S. National Strategy by Kim Holmes and Jon Hillen of the Heritage Foundation, a detailed summary of threats confronting us today with appropriate commentary about their priorities. 
   Fifth, transforming American Alliances by Andrew Krepinevvitch of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. 
   He has been of real help to us in regard to the Emerging Threats subcommittee, and also the full Committee on Armed Services. 
   Sixth, a highly recommended article ``Back to Basics: U.S. Foreign Policy for the Coming Decade,'' by James E. Goodby, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Ambassador to Finland and Kenneth Wisebrode, Director of the International Security Program at the Atlantic Council of the United States. 
   In this regard, Messrs. Goodby and Weisbrode have summarized the concerns of Senator CLELAND and myself very well when they said:  
   The most common error of policymakers is to fail to distinguish among our levels of interest, leading to an over commitment to higher level interests. In other words, strategic or second tier interests, if mishandled, can threaten vital interests. But, strategic interests, if well understood and acted upon, can support vital interests.  
   Goodby and Weisbrode do us a favor by following the example of others in prioritizing our vital national security interests: 
   First and vital, homeland defense from threats to well being and way of life of the American people. 
   I can't imagine anyone would have any quarrel with that. 
   Second and strategic, I am talking about peace and stability in Europe and northeast Asia and open access to our energy supplies. 
   Third, and of lesser interest, although it is of interest, stability in South Asia, Latin America, Africa, and open markets favorable to the United States and to world prosperity. 
   The authors suggest how to accomplish these goals with what they call three essential pieces of foreign policy balance: 
   First, stability and cohesion in Europe and between the European Union and the United States; second, mature and effective relations among China, Russia, and the West to include first among all others, a regular forum to oversee the reduction of the risk of nuclear weapons; and third, systematic patterns of consultation and policy coordination of the States benefiting from the global economy and positive relations between those States and the developing world. 
   The authors also suggest the means to their ends by looking ahead and stressing the need for eventual NATO and Russian cooperation and stability, the need for a similar organization and effort between the United States and China, Japan, Russia, and Korea, and lastly, American support for the United Nations. 
   In a self-acknowledged understatement, they state this is going to be a hard and tedious task. This is not easy. But it is absolutely necessary. 
   Now, Mr. Goodby and Mr. Weisbrode are not critical per se, but they issue a warning and this is what we are trying to bring to the attention of the Senate. It is central to what Senator CLELAND and I are trying to accomplish with these foreign policy and national security dialogs.  
   The public perception and the private reality suggest worrisome disorganization and a certain degree of impatience with a foggy conceptual foreign policy framework. It is time to return to the basic elements of the American role in the world and to raise the public understanding of them. 
   American strategic planners and policymakers cannot afford to be arbitrarily selective about where and when to engage U.S. power. This would make our foreign policy aimless and lose the support of the American people.  
   They continue:  
   We should set out each of America's interests and how they best may be achieved with the cooperation of other powers. However, this cannot take place until the executive and legislative branches of government resurrect the workable partnership in foreign affairs that once existed but exists no more.  
   And Senator CLELAND, my colleagues, that is why we are here today and that is why we are involved in this forum. In my personal view, we are starved for meaningful foreign policy and national security dialog between the White House and the Congress and within the Congress. The stakes are high. 
   I recall well the meeting in Senator CLELAND's office between Senator CLELAND, myself, and Senator SNOWE, worried about our involvement in the Balkans. I had an amendment, we had an amendment; we passed both amendments, setting out guidelines that the administration would respond, saying that before we spend money in regard to the defense appropriations or in the authorization bill, hopefully we can establish a better dialog, trying to figure out what our role was in regard to our constitutional responsibilities, I say to my good friend, without having to come to the floor with appropriations bills and have an amendment and say you can't spend the money for this until you explain this. That is no way to operate. 
   It seems to me we can do a much better job. The stakes are high. 
   As Carl Sandberg wrote of Americans: Always there arose enough reserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry the Nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality. 
   I hope this dialog and these discussions, all of the priority recommendations we have had from experts in the field, will help us begin that fresh start. We cannot afford to do otherwise.

   Mr. ROBERTS. First, again, I thank my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, for this continued initiative and his leadership in what we think is a bipartisan foreign policy dialog. I hope it is successful. 
   We said back in February during our first discussion that our objective was to try to achieve greater attention, focus, and mutual understanding--not to mention a healthy dose of responsibility--in this body in regard to our global role. 
   I repeat again, in chapter 10 of the Senator's book that he has provided to every Senator, with a marvelous introduction by our Chaplain, the Senator stated that success is a team effort, that coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, and working together is success. That is a pretty good motto for our efforts today, as well as a recipe for our foreign policy goals. 
   I am very privileged to yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL. He is a recognized expert in the field of international affairs, and more especially, a strong backer of free trade. I seek his advice and counsel often on the very matters that we are talking about. 
   I am delighted he has joined us. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator and my friend.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I will soon yield to the Senator from Texas. She has been a champion on behalf of our men and women in uniform. She is a former member of the Armed Services Committee, now a very valued and influential member of the Appropriations Committee. These are the folks who have the obligation and responsibility to pay for a military that I believe today is stressed, strained, and somewhat hollow, unfortunately. 
   I think Senator HUTCHISON, probably more than any other Senator, has been very diligent expressing concern and alerting the Senate and the Congress and the American people as to our commitments abroad, what is in our vital national security interests, and the problems we have talked about regarding an overcommitment. 
   The Senator has come to me on repeated occasions when proposing amendments. Sometimes she has withdrawn them, and other times she has proceeded but always prompting a debate on the Senate floor where there literally has been none in regard to our military policy and when we commit the use of force. She has pointed out, I think in excellent fashion, the paradox of the enormous irony that we have in Bosnia where we are supporting a partitioned kind of society among three ethnic groups, or nationalities; whereas, just to the south, in Kosovo, our goal is to somehow promote a multiethnic society where the divisions are at least equal to that in Bosnia. 
   Senator HUTCHISON not only comes to the floor and expresses her opinion, but her opinion is based on facts and on actually being present in the area with which we are concerned. She has been a repeat visitor to Bosnia, Kosovo, and every troubled spot I can imagine, including Brussels and Russia. She does more than talk to officials. Senator HUTCHISON, when she goes on a co-del, not only talks to the briefing folks, but she actually goes out to the people involved and talks about their daily lives, their individual freedoms, their pocketbooks. She talks to these folks individually and gives us a healthy dose of common sense and reality when she is reporting on it. We are glad to welcome her to this debate. I yield the Senator 15 minutes.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, as has been indicated by my colleagues, the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, we have before us--we do not have before us, but we would like to have before us S. 2251, entitled the ``Risk Management for the 21st Century Act.'' It has been certainly aptly described by the distinguished chairman and Senator HARKIN. 
   This legislation is a slightly modified version of a bill by the same name; that is, S. 1580 which was introduced by Senator KERREY and myself last fall. It was supported by a large number of our colleagues. 
   Our farmers and ranchers have to deal with multiple threats of weather and pests and disease that few, if any, businesses must experience on a daily basis. As we all know, it can often be a very brutal up-and-down cycle, a real price roller coaster that our farmers and ranchers must face. To get through these cycles, our producers must have crop insurance and risk management tools at work. 
   This bill represents a real personal effort on my part and that of my staff, as well as Senator KERREY and other colleagues. 
   But it was about 20 years ago that my predecessor in the House of Representatives, the Honorable Keith Sebelius, cast the deciding vote to create the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Since that time, it has been almost 20 years now we have gone through numerous reforms to get this right. This has been a personal commitment of mine for some time. 
   If you sit on the wagon and listen to farmers, regardless 
   of which region they come from, or what commodity they are involved in, time and time again they have come to us and said it is time for major reforms in the program. 
   Two years ago, Senator KERREY and I agreed to work together on this issue. I said: BOB, do you think we can do this? 
   He said: Well, we don't have any other alternative but to try. 
   Tackling the national and comprehensive Crop Insurance Program has been--I don't know--sort of like pushing a rope. But we certainly agreed on the issue. We have been working on this legislation with able staff and with the help of the chairman and the distinguished ranking member. We have been working on this for nearly 18 months nonstop. 
   We began the effort in earnest when we gave every farm, commodity, lending, and insurance group the opportunity to provide their suggestions for improvements in the Crop Insurance Program. We asked everybody--we cast a wide net: How do you want to improve this? 
   The response to this call for comments was overwhelming. The comments we received certainly gave us a clear and common direction in which we needed to go in regard to this legislation. 
   Who am I talking about? If I could find the list here because we have a letter dated just a couple of days ago:  
   As organizations representing farm, lending, and insurance industries, we are writing to strongly urge that the Senate pass the recently reported Senate Agriculture Committee crop insurance risk management bill.  
   We have the American Association of Crop Insurers, the American Bankers Association. Don't forget, this is a lender's issue as well. This is an issue that affects the lending institutions. Many of them simply will not continue to go down the road on behalf of our producers without what they believe is reasonable crop insurance. 
   We have the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Feed Industry Association, the American Nursery and Landscape Association--let me repeat that--the American Nursery and Landscape Association. Why am I saying that? Because that particular group represents, in many of the Northeastern States, the No. 1 major agriculture interest. I understand there is some concern on the part of those from the Northeastern part of our country that perhaps their needs have not been addressed to the extent that they believe would be commensurate with proper reform. 
   We have the American Soybean Association, the Crop Insurance Research Bureau, the Farm Credit Council, the Independent Community Bankers Association, the Independent Insurance Agents of America. 
   I do not mean to get too tedious, but this is a long list of everybody involved in agriculture who has come to the conclusion that this bill is a good bill and we should pass it. 
   We have the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Barley Growers Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Farmers Union, the National Grain Sorghum Producers, the National Pork Producers Council, the National Sunflower Association, the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, the Rural Community Insurance Services, the Society of the American Florists. If Members will vote for this, they will get a floral bouquet, as well as bouquets of credits from all these organizations. 
   We have the U.S. Canola Association. I could go on with other lists, but I think I have made my point. 
   These groups told us to do the following. This also represents all the producers from all regions of the country, every commodity group, that told us, No. 1, to make higher levels of coverage more affordable. We want to encourage our farmers and ranchers to buy up more crop insurance, certainly not less. 
   Second, to provide an equal subsidy for both yield and revenue insurance products. It is the revenue insurance product that may well be the foundation for the next farm bill. I am not saying that will be the case, but certainly that is an option. So to improve those products, it seems to me, is very important. 
   The chairman has gone over this in his remarks. 
   Third, to develop steps to address the problems associated with a lack of production history for a farmer that is just beginning and concerns that an adequate policy does not exist to address multiple years of disasters. How many times have we had a farmer come and testify before the committee and say: Look. I can't get any crop insurance. I have been hit. The Good Lord was not willing, and the creeks did rise or they didn't rise, and we got into all sorts of multiple disasters and I could not get the crop insurance. 
   Fourth, the creation of new and expanded crop insurance policies for specialty crops and improvement in what is called the Noninsured Assistance Program, which covers many specialty crops. 
   I am going to come back to that because when we put together this bill, Senator KERREY and I knew we had to reach out to every region of the country. We knew there was a lot of consternation and frustration on the part of Members who represented farmers from the Northeast and producers also from the South that the current Crop Insurance Program was not favorable to their interests, that it was discriminatory. 
   So we sat down with staff. I remember in one of the first meetings we had, why, Senator KERREY told me: PAT, we have to reach out to these groups. We have to cover the specialty crop producers, more especially, since the Northeast and the Eastern part of the country went through such tough times in regards to last year and the drought. 
   We have tried to do that. It seems to me to be a paradox of enormous irony that the very region of the country we are reaching out to, now we have distinguished Senators who are privileged to represent the farmers and the ranchers and the producers, the specialty crop folks from that part of the country, saying: Well, wait a minute. We're worried that this bill does not address our concerns. 
   Address them? We reached out to them. This is the most favorable crop insurance reform, I won't say that could be imagined, but these are the very folks to whom we reached out.  
   Next the farmers told us: We want some increased emphasis in specialty crop policy research and development; use the good offices and the expertise and skill of the Department of Agriculture for pilot projects with regard to research and development for specialty crops, not only the program crops, the wheat, barley, corn, and feed grains, all of that, cotton and rice, but the specialty crop folks; they deserve that. And that is in the bill. 
   They asked for major changes in the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's board of directors, more farmer input, if you will. That has certainly taken place. 
   They asked to streamline and remove the roadblocks in the product approval process. Somebody could come up with a new pilot project and it would lay around 6 months, 8 months, a year, and we couldn't get any approval. We have deadlines now to be approved. 
   We take some significant steps to address the fraud and abuse of the program. The chairman has pointed out that we don't want a situation where if you are going to reform crop insurance, you simply encourage people from challenged lands, if that is the proper term for it, to farm the program, if you will. We have very strong language in regard to fraud and abuse. I cannot imagine any producer who, once they take a look at the penalties, would ever go down that road. 
   It is my hope the bill does all the things I have said and more. I have the rest of my statement here. I will not ask that it be put in the RECORD at this point because I would rather simply go into the details when we have the bill before us and have a time agreement. I hope we can get the time agreement. 
   Again, I think it is a paradox of enormous irony that when you reach out to certain sections of the country, you find yourself in a real quandary. You scratch your head and have a lot of frustration. You have some degree of concern that Senators from the very part of the country you have included in the major crop insurance reform--and by ``included,'' I mean asking those Senators and their staff to come to us and to provide some answers; they have done so, and we have put it in the bill. Now it seems that this is where the concern is coming from, and we are holding up the bill. 
   I can go into all of the provisions we have for specialty crops; i.e., the matter of concern with regard to folks in the Northeast. I will not do that. I am going to save that until we have some of the Senators on the floor to point out to them just what we have done. But there are four big ticket items, and additional items of interest, about 15 of them. I think it is very salutary to the concerns of producers in that area. 
   Both Senator HARKIN and the chairman of the committee, Senator LUGAR, indicated that this bill should be on the unanimous consent calendar. We had the debate in the committee. The chairman had a different approach in regard to a risk management approach. It was a very legitimate option. We have committed some funds to see if we can go forward with that kind of option step by step. But the majority of the bill pretty much mirrors what they have done in the House. 
   Now, how did the House do this? Did they have a big debate? Did regions of the country have some problems with 
   this? No, the House of Representatives, in their infinite wisdom, passed this by unanimous consent. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues in the other body, a body in which I was privileged to serve, they have a lot of trouble deciding when to adjourn, let alone doing anything by unanimous consent. I hope they take that in the spirit in which I say those comments. 
   They passed it by unanimous consent. That means any one Member out of 435 could have stood up and objected. Nobody did that because they knew that this was on the agenda. We promised this 4 years ago, the editorial ``we,'' both Democrats and Republicans, when the new farm bill was passed. Despite all of the criticisms we have heard in regard to the new farm bill--and this is not the time to get in to that discussion or debate--both Senator LUGAR and I held up the chart--certainly Senator LUGAR referred to it--which said, if you go to a more market oriented farm policy, these are the things you have to have with it to give the farmer the risk management tools to compete. It was supposed to be done 4 years ago after the 1994 reform. 
   We did not do that, ``we'' meaning the administration and leadership on both the Democrat and Republican side. We all bear part of that responsibility. There were honest differences of opinion. Sometimes things take a little longer. But if the House of Representatives can pass this by unanimous consent without one objection, what are we doing here holding up this bill, especially when we are reaching out to the very people who are raising the objections. 
   If Senators have some problems with this, please come down and talk to Senator KERREY and me and the distinguished chairman and Senator HARKIN. We think we have some very good answers for you. We think we have done what you want us to do. I don't know when enough is not enough, but it seems to me we ought to do that. 
   One of the biggest reasons why we should do this, you never know what the weather is going to do. You never know when a section of the country could be hard hit. We provide that assistance under disaster bills. Ours is not a disaster bill. It addresses some of the concerns farmers have in regard to going through disasters in that it gives them a risk management tool. They control that, along with their lender and their insurance company. They can better guard against the natural disasters that can happen. But everybody here knows what has happened when we have a disaster, more especially in the even-numbered years. When we have a disaster, it is a disaster to try to devise a disaster program that is fair and is equitable. That was a concern on the part of the Senators from the Northeast during the last disaster bill that was passed in the last year to provide assistance to hard-pressed farmers. They believe they were discriminated against. I think they have a point. But the proper way to address that is not on the crop insurance reform we have constructed to be in their best interest. That is a separate issue. 
   If we passed the crop insurance reform and the money is in the budget through the efforts of the good Senators mentioned by the distinguished chairman, we have $6 billion there. It is not over budget. But if we have add-ons with different amendments, obviously we will be over budget. That is not the answer to this. 
   In addition, if you have the crop insurance risk management 
   tools in place, in my personal view, you are not going to have the tremendous need or the tremendous support for annual disaster bills. We got along for 2 years, I think, after passage of the farm bill, where we didn't have to spend $1 for disasters. Obviously, we have a lot of folks who would predict that it doesn't happen every year. But if the farmer has the proper risk management tools, yes, it is going to cost some money, but it will save the taxpayer much more money in the long run rather than treating this on an annual basis in terms of disaster bills. This is in the best interest of the taxpayer. 
   I think I have pretty well made my point. I will save the rest of my statement when we do get agreement. I will say again that I hope we do get the agreement soon. 
   I wish to pay special credit to Senator KERREY and to his assistant, Bev Paul, along with a young man who assisted me in this effort, Mike Seyfert. They have worked day after day, hour after hour, back and forth between every commodity group, every farm organization, every Senator, every region. It has been tedious work. How many Senators will get a blind phone call from somebody trying to sell you insurance? I think probably insurance is not the most favorable topic about which to be talking. Crop insurance does tend to be a high glazer, as we can see by the lack of colleagues on the floor. So they have taken this rather tedious subject, this detailed and complex subject and have worked out a major reform. 
   Senator KERREY has done a splendid job. We have both, as I said before, tried to truly listen to our producers to come up with something we think will be the answer. 
   I think this is one of the major reforms in farm program policy. I thank Senator KERREY and the dedicated staff, both his and mine, and certainly the staff of Senator LUGAR. We have worked through a very difficult time. Well, now is the time. As I said, we  ought to do it by unanimous consent. I hope we can get this thing done and we can work out the agreement. I know people are working overtime to get this done, but tempus and the weather fugit. That means we can't dilly-dally around with this. 
   I must say, given the considerations that it is an even numbered year and the amount of angst and frustration on the part of our farmers and ranchers, this has been promised for years. So the people who hold up this bill should know there is a groundswell of support for the bill, and there will also be, I suspect, a tad bit of criticism for the people who are holding it up. That is just a thought. 
   At this point, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first I thank my good friend and colleague for his very kind comments, and I associate myself with his remarks, most especially with regard to the editorial that appeared in the Washington Post. I think he set the record straight. 
   I indicated in my earlier remarks there were some provisions of this bill I would like to outline, and I would like to do so at present as a coauthor of the legislation. I said at that particular time we spent a great deal of time--by ``we,'' I mean Senator KERREY, I, and our staff--sitting down with producers and our farmers and ranchers and virtually every interest group that has a remote interest in this bill. 
   They told us to do the following things: 
   One, to make a higher level of coverage more affordable; 
   Two, to provide an equal subsidy for both yield and revenue insurance products; 
   Three, to develop steps to address the problems associated with a lack of production history for beginning farmers and concerns that an adequate policy does not exist to address the multiple years of disasters. 
   They also told us to try to create new and expanded crop insurance policies for specialty crops and improvements in the Noninsured Assistance Program which covers many of the specialty crops. 
   They warned of some increased emphasis in specialty crop policy research and development; 
   Major changes in the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation board of directors, certainly with more farmer input; 
   To streamline and to remove the roadblocks and the product approval process; 
   And to take significant steps to address fraud and abuse in the program. 
   As I indicated earlier when I went through this list, I think we have done that. I believe, and it is my hope, that the bill now before the Senate does accomplish those goals. 
   Let me go over specifically what is included in this bill. We made higher levels of coverage more affordable so we will, hopefully, avoid calls for disaster assistance in the future. In my earlier remarks, I tried to emphasize to Senators that once we have national comprehensive risk management available to producers, hopefully we will not get into the expenditures we have had in the past with annual disaster bills. 
   We made the adjustments to the APH to address multiple years of disaster. 
   We made significant changes to the Noninsured Assistance Program, including the elimination of the area trigger. Now that is a rather complex description of a problem that is of tremendous concern to the specialty crop producer. That was the No. 1 complaint we heard from producers who use this program. 
   We provided $150 million in pilot program funding to create pilots to develop new policies, especially for specialty crops. 
   We provided $20 million per year in new funding to provide research grants to develop new risk management strategies for specialty crops. 
   We changed the membership at the corporation's board of directors to include, as I mentioned before: Four farmers from geographic regions to be selected by the Secretary of Agriculture, one member active in the crop insurance industry, one member with reinsurance expertise, and then the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign  Agricultural Services, the Under Secretary for Rural Development, and the chief economist at the Department of Agriculture. 
   We have streamlined the product approval process and set deadlines by which decisions must be made on new policies that are 
   submitted for approval. We allow companies to charge minimal fees to other companies selling their products in order to allow the recovery of research and development costs. This should also encourage expanded policy development which is a very important goal of the bill.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this legislation also establishes monetary penalties. If we are worried about fraud and abuse, we have penalties up to $10,000 and potential disbarment from the program and all USDA programs for any producer, any agent, any loss adjuster, or approved insurance provider who is found to have defrauded the program. 
   These provisions in terms of fraud and abuse are strong; they are clear. Those who attempt to defraud the program and taxpayers will be punished. 
   Every year, our producers put the seed in the ground and they believe if the good Lord is willing and the creeks don't rise or we don't have a drought, they will produce a crop. When the events do occur, they must have the tools to manage these risks.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Our lending organizations and all of the groups and commodity organizations have spoken loudly. They have all continually expressed the need to improve the risk management tools available to our producers. I believe this legislation does accomplish this goal. I am proud of this bill. It is a strong bill. It is a fair bill. It improves the program for both the taxpayers and our farmers and ranchers. It shows us that despite all of the differences we sometimes have on both sides of the aisle, as some of my colleagues have already said, we can listen to our constituents; we can take their ideas; we can work in a bipartisan manner to improve the programs available to America's farmers and ranchers. 
   After hundreds of hours of discussion and deliberations, I believe we have achieved the strongest bill possible. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in behalf of their constituents. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise to acknowledge the accomplishments of the Kansas Air National Guard, specifically, the 190th Air Refueling Wing. The enormous sacrifice and dedication of the 190th personnel reflects great credit upon themselves, the 190th Air Refueling Wing and the Kansas Air National Guard. These dedicated Americans participated in two consecutive deployments from February 24 to April 9, 1999 in support of Operation Northern Watch and Operation Allied Force. The 190th Air Refueling Wing deployed again from July 11 to August 20, 1999 in support of Operation Northern Watch. The 190th flew 209 combat support sorties and off loaded over 10 million pounds of fuel to coalition aircraft during the three deployments. Their service directly impacted the success of Operation Northern Watch in Iraq and Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the 190th Air Refueling Wing and their remarkable dedication to duty and service to our great country.

   Mr. ROBERTS. First, Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, for the opportunity to join together in what we both hope will be a successful endeavor. 
   As Senator CLELAND stated, our objective is to try to achieve greater attention, focus, and mutual understanding in this body on America's global role and our vital national security interests and, if possible, begin a process of building a bipartisan consensus on what America's role should be in today's ever-changing, unsafe, and very unpredictable world. 
   At the outset, I share Senator CLELAND's sense of personal limitation in addressing this topic. As he has said, even the finest minds and most expert American foreign policymakers have had considerable difficulty in defining both what role the United States should play in the so-called ``New World Disorder'' or reaching a consensus on what criteria to use in defining our vital national interests. 
   Now having said that, I do not know of another Senator better suited to this effort than MAX CLELAND. He brings to this exchange of ideas an outstanding record of public service, of personal sacrifice, and of courage and commitment. On the Senate Armed Services Committee, he has demonstrated expertise and a whole lot of common sense in addressing the quality of life issues so important to our men and women in uniform and, in turn, to our national security. 
   As members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we both share a keen interest in foreign policy and national security. In my own case, I was privileged to serve as a member of the 1996 Commission on America's National Interests. It was chaired by Ambassador Robert Ellsworth, Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, and Rita Hauser, and was sponsored by the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, and the RAND Corporation. The Commission was composed of 15 members, including Senators John MCCAIN, BOB GRAHAM, and Sam Nunn. In brief, our Commission focused on one core issue: What are U.S. national interests in today's world? 
   The conclusion in 1996, 4 years ago--and the Senator, I think, will see some real similarities to some of our concerns as of today--in the wake of the cold war, the American public's interest in foreign policy declined sharply, and our political leaders have focused on domestic concerns. America's foreign policy was adrift. 
   The defining feature of American engagement in the world since the cold war has been confusion, leading to missed opportunities and emerging threats. 
   The Commission went on to say there must be a regrounding of American foreign policy on the foundation of solid national interests. They went on to conclude that there must be greater clarity regarding the hierarchy of American national interests and, with limited resources, a better understanding of what national interests are and, just as important, are not. 
   Then the Commission prioritized what we felt represented vital national interests. It is interesting to note that the conflicts such as Bosnia and Kosovo did not make the priority cut at that time. That was 4 years ago. 
   However, the real genesis for this forum that Senator CLELAND and I have tried to initiate resulted from frustrations over continued and increasing U.S. military involvement and intervention both in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf and all around the world. Absent was what we consider to be clear policy goals, not only from the executive, but also from the Congress. 
   We found ourselves on the floor of the Senate, and in committee, coming to the same conclusion reached by the esteemed and beloved longtime chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
   Committee, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, who said this, following the war in Vietnam:  
   I shall never again knowingly support a policy of sending American men in uniform overseas to fight in a war where military victory has been ruled out and when they do not have the full support of the American people.  
   Yet we continue to see our military becoming involved and taking part in peacekeeping missions, and other missions, where incremental escalation has led to wars of gradualism, where our vital national interests are questionable, and where the unintended effects of our involvement have been counterproductive to national security.  
   We met in Senator CLELAND's office and discussed at length the proper role of the Senate in regard to the use of American troops. We talked about the War Powers Act. We talked about the future of NATO. We talked about our policy in the Persian Gulf. We noted, with considerable frustration, that Senators seemed to be faced with votes, but votes that were already foregone conclusions. 
   Few were willing to oppose funding for U.S. troops--not many in the Senate or the House will do that--yet many Senators had strong reservations and questions about U.S. policy, our military tactics, and the lack of what some called the end game. 
   We instructed our staffs to research the War Powers Act and any other possible alternatives that would provide an outlet for future policy decisions. 
   Senator CLELAND persevered, and along with Senator SNOWE of Maine, authored and won passage of an amendment mandating that the administration report to the Congress on any operation involving 500 or more troops, and that report would include clear and distinct objectives, as well as the end point of the operation. 
   In my own case, I authored and won approval of an amendment stating no funds could be used for deployment of troops in the Balkans until the President reported to Congress detailing the reasons for the deployment, number of military troops to be used, the mission and objectives of the forces, the schedule and exit strategy, and the estimated costs involved. Again, these amendments were after the fact, but they at least represented a bipartisan effort on the part of Senators who realized then and realize now that we simply must do a better job of working with the executive and searching for greater mutual understanding in the Senate in regard to foreign policy and our national security interests. 
   In saying this, let me stress that this body and our country are fortunate to have the benefit of Senators with both expertise and experience with regard to foreign relations and national security. That certainly doesn't reside only with the two Senators here involved. When they speak, we listen. But the problem is, they do not speak enough, and when they do, many do not listen. 
   The unfortunate conclusion I have reached is that too many Americans are not only uninterested in world events but uninformed as well. More and more today in the Congress, it seems to me that foreign policy, trade, and national security issues are driven by ideology, insular and parochial interests, protectionism, and isolationist views. Both the administration and the Congress seem to be lacking a foreign policy focus, purpose, and constructive agenda. 
   The one notable exception has been the hearings held by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, who has held extensive hearings on ``Lessons Learned'' with regard to Kosovo. It is a paradox of enormous irony that the vision of knitting a multiethnic society and democracy out of century-old hatreds in Kosovo is in deep trouble. The danger of Kosovo is the fact that it may become another Somalia. These hearings have attracted little more than a blip on the public radar screen and little, if any, commentary or debate in the Senate. 
   So as Senator CLELAND has pointed out, over the course of the coming year he and I will engage in a series of floor dialogues relating to the general direction of U.S. foreign and national security policy in the 21st century. We begin today by discussing the framework for the U.S. global role. In the following months, as the Senator has said, we will discuss the defining national interests, deployment of U.S. forces, the role of multilateral organizations, the role of the Executive, Congress and the public, and the role of trade, economics, and arms control. As Senator CLELAND has stressed, this is just an outline. 
   We invite all Senators to engage in this series. The concept is one of a forum, a dialogue, that will and should include a wide variety of viewpoints. For instance, given the flashpoint situation today in Kosovo, with about 5,000 to 6,000 American troops at risk--and we may be calling in the Marines. I believe that topic certainly demands attention and discussion, however, in a different and separate forum. There should be some discussion and consideration in the Senate in that regard. 
   As Senator CLELAND has pointed out, we all know that foreign policy and national security are legitimate concerns that should be addressed in the Presidential and congressional campaigns; at least I hope they are addressed. But beyond this election year, the Senate will again be faced with our constitutional responsibilities in shaping this Nation's role in global affairs, national security, international stability, and peace. Simply put: Our national interest depends on reaching a bipartisan consensus. My colleague and I both hope this forum will contribute to achieving that goal and, in doing so, also contribute to greater public support and understanding. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding and understand he has some additional remarks, as I do following his remarks.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   Mr. President, Senator CLELAND has very effectively outlined the evolution of our nation's foreign policy, from Washington and Adams (chary of foreign involvement and alliances) to the Monroe Doctrine to Wilson's idealism and all of the so called ``ism's''--economism, realism, humanitarianism, minimalism, unilateralism, regionalism, isolationism with intervention and non intervention tossed in. Now, that is quite a foreign policy tossed salad. 
   But, the point is, discussion and definition must preface clarity, purpose and consensus and Senator CLELAND has done just that along with a Clelandism, a new concept he will define in his closing remarks, ``Realistic Restraint.'' 
   In setting the framework for discussion on the global role our nation will play in the 21st century, the benchmark used by virtually all observers is the post-cold-war period. 
   Ashton Carter, professor of science and international affairs at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy in the first Clinton administration, put it very well when he recently wrote:  
   The kindest thing that might be said of American behavior ten years into the post-Cold War world is that it is A-STRATEGIC, responding dutifully to the (crisis du jour) with little sense of priority or consistency. 
   A less charitable characterization would be that the United States has its priorities but they are backwards, too often placing immediate intervention in minor conflicts over a ``preventive-defense strategy focused on basic, long term threats to security. 
   This formula has become awkward, even embarrassing, as the years go by. It is an admission that we do not know where we are going strategically, only whence we have come. It is time to declare an end to the end.  
   In his recent article, ``Adapting U.S. Defense to Future Needs,'' Professor Carter has recommended identifying an ``A-list'' of security priorities to fill the current strategic vacuum. I was struck by the similarity between Professor Carter's A, B, and C lists determining threats to our national security and the recommendations by the Commission on America's National Interests four years previous that I mentioned in my opening remarks. 
   And, Professor Carter did us another favor in his article by quoting George Marshall at the time of America's previous great strategic transition following the Second World War. In 1947 at Princeton University, General Marshall said:  
   Now that an immediate peril is not plainly visible, there is a natural tendency to relax and to return to business as usual. But, I feel that we are seriously failing in our attitude toward the international problems whose solution will largely determine our future.  
   The report by the Commission on America's National Interests in 1996 expressed a similar view:  
   The confusion, crosscurrents, and cacophony about America's role in the world today is strikingly reminiscent of two earlier experiences in this century: the years after 1918 and those after 1945. We are experiencing today the third post-war transition of the twentieth century. In the twenty years after 1918, American isolationists forced withdrawal from the world. America's withdrawal undermined the World War I peace settlement in Europe and contributed mightily to the Great Depression, the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy, and the resumption of war in Europe after what proved to be but a two-decade intermission. After 1945, American leaders were determined to learn and apply those lessons of the interwar period. Individuals who are known now as the ``wise men,'' including Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, Secretaries of State George Marshall and Dean Acheson, and Senator Arthur Vandenberg, fashioned a strategy of thoughtful, deep American engagement in the world in ways they judged vital to America's well-being. As a result, two generations of Americans have enjoyed five decades without world war, in which America experienced the most rapid economic growth in history, and won a great victory in the Cold War.  
   To address this historical challenge and responsibility, what did the Commission recommend? We recommended the following:  
   Challenges to American national interests in the decade ahead. Developments around the world pose threats to U.S. interests and present opportunities for advancing Americans' well-being. Because America's resources are limited, U.S. foreign policy must be selective in choosing which issues to address. The proper basis for making such judgments is a lean, hierarchical conception of what U.S. national interests are and are not. Media attention to foreign affairs tends to fixate on issues according to the vividness of a threat, without pausing to ask whether the U.S. interest threatened is really important. Thus second- and third-order issues like Bosnia or Haiti become a consuming focus of U.S. foreign policy to the neglect of issues of higher priority, like China's international role or the unprecedented risks of nuclear proliferation. 
   Based on its assessment of specific threats to and opportunities for U.S. national interests in the final years of the century, the Commission has identified five cardinal challenges for the next U.S. president: To cope with China's entry onto the world stage; to prevent loss of control of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons-usable materials, and to contain biological and chemical weapons proliferation; to maintain sound strategic partnerships with Japan and the European allies; to avoid Russia's collapse into civil war or reversion to authoritarianism; and to maintain singular U.S. leadership, military capabilities, and international credibility.  
   Note the similarity in agreement in regard to Professor Carter's recent article in which he says, 4 years later:  
   The public imagination, reflected in the press, abhors the post-Cold War's conceptual vacuum. Under CNN's relentless gaze, and in the absence of any widely accepted strategic principles, the accumulation of a decade's worth of telegenic events has begun to furnish the public with a conception of strategic priorities that differs from an A-list as defined here. Citizens watching the news (and even those few who still read it) can be forgiven if they have begun to get the impression that the security challenges of the new era (the post-Post-Cold War era) arise in such places as Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia. These are the issues that have dominated the security headlines in the 1990s. Indeed, there is even talk of the post-Cold War's first presidential doctrine, the so-called ``Clinton Doctrine'', dealing with precisely this issue. According to President Bill Clinton: ``Whether you live in Africa or Central Europe or any other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians and tries to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic background or their religion, and it is within our power to stop it, we will stop it.'' 
   The Kosovos and their ilk are undoubtedly important problems: they represent not only atrocities that offend the human conscience,  but if allowed to fester can undermine the foundations of regional and international stability. However, it is also true that such problems, while serious, do not threaten America's vital security interests.  
   Carter went on to say there are four dangers that he puts on the A list, the top priority concerns in regard to vital national security interests: No. 1, the danger that Russia might descend into chaos, isolation and aggression as Germany did after the First World War; No. 2, the danger that Russia and other Soviet successor States might lose control of the nuclear and chemical and biological weapons legacy of the former Soviet Union; No. 3, the danger that, as China emerges, it could spawn hostility rather than becoming engaged in the international system; the danger that the weapons of mass destruction will proliferate and present a direct military threat to U.S. forces and territory; and finally, the danger that catastrophic terrorism of unprecedented scope and intensity might occur on U.S. territory. 
   Professor Carter indicated these A-list problems do not take the form of traditional military threats and they have not, as a general rule, made headlines or driven our defense programs during the decade-old post-cold-war era. While neither imminent nor certain, the A-list problems will, to quote Marshall again, ``largely determine our future.'' 
   Both Professor Carter and the commission report go on to stress many additional policy recommendations. I commend both the report and the article to my colleagues. 
   In trying to better prioritize our national security obligations, I think we are faced with two clear policy alternatives: The first I call the so-called Powell doctrine, named after retired Joint Chiefs Chairman, General Colin Powell, who focused on the dangers of military engagement and recommended limiting commitments that put America's men and women in uniform in harm's way to absolutely vital national interests; the second being the so-called Clinton doctrine, which emphasizes more of a global policing role for the United States. 
   This debate does recall others. It was 40 years ago that President Eisenhower's emphasis on strategic deterrence was challenged by President John Kennedy's advocacy of something called ``flexible response.'' However, the difference is that once in office, the Kennedy administration increased defense spending, while in the last 10 years after engagement and sending more American service men and women overseas than any other President took place in tandem with cutting our military by one-third. 
   Our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton summed up the situation very well when he told the John F. Kennedy School of Government recently:  
   The military makes a great hammer in America's foreign policy tool box, but not every problem we face is a nail.  
   He went on to say:  
   As a world superpower, can we dare to admit that force cannot solve every problem we face. I think that the decision to use force is probably the most important decision our nation's leaders can make. The fundamental purpose of our military forces is to fight and win the nation's wars.  
   General Shelton went on to echo what both the commission on America's interests and Professor Carter have said: Military intervention should be used for vital national interests, important national interests, and they have been used for humanitarian efforts. But the general cautioned that such efforts should be limited in duration and clearly defined. 
   The general referred to the Dover test, named after Dover Air Force Base, the point of entry of the bodies of service members that are killed in action overseas. The general said: The question is, Is the American public prepared for the sight of our most precious resources coming home in flagged-draped caskets into Dover? 
   He said this should be among the first things raised by 
   Washington decisionmakers. Both Senator CLELAND and I agree very strongly. 
   The historical analogies aside, there is one clear difference in today's global world and what faced our political and military leaders of yesterday. That is what I call the information age of the CNN effect. Joseph S. Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, said in a recent article:  
   Today the free flow of information and shortened news cycles have a huge impact on public opinion, placing some items at the top of the public agenda that might otherwise warrant a lower priority. Our political leaders are finding it harder than ever to maintain a coherent set of priorities on foreign policy issues that determine what is in the national interest. 
   The so-called ``CNN effect'' makes it harder to keep some items off the top of the public agenda that might otherwise warrant a lower priority. Now, with the added interactivity of activist groups on the Internet, it will be harder than ever for leaders in democracies to maintain a consistent agenda of priorities.  
   In closing, let me say that while this forum is intended to focus on debate and discussion, events of the day have a way of forcing the agenda. 
   I paraphrase from the distinguished admiral who heads up the Defense Intelligence Agency when he said before a recent hearing: We must pay attention to uncertainties in regard to Russia, China, Europe, the Middle East, and Korea. They must be addressed. We must deal with rogue states and individuals who do not share our vision of the future and are willing to engage in violence. Rapid technology development and the proliferation in information technology, biotechnology, and communications, tactical weapons, weapons of mass destruction, pose a significant threat. A 50-percent reduction in global defense spending means both our adversaries and allies have not kept pace with the United States, but as we see after the war in Kosovo, it will result in asymmetric threats from our adversaries and reduced help from our allies. Demographic developments will stress the infrastructure and leadership in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Disparities in global weather and resource distribution will get worse. The reaction to the United States and western dominance will spur anti-U.S. sentiments now more pronounced since Kosovo, the law of unintended effects. International drug cultivation and production and transport and use will remain a major source of crime and instability. And lastly, ethnic and religious and cultural divisions will remain a prime motivation for conflict. 
   To be sure, the Senate of the United States cannot solve all the problems, but these problems do indeed comprise current and emerging threats to our national security, international stability, and to peace. The question is, Can we reach consensus in this body to address them in a rational fashion as the leader in the free world? 
   I think my colleague has some closing remarks, as I do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in closing, I again thank my colleague for undertaking this effort. As usual, his remarks have been on point. They have provided focus. They have been very thought provoking. 
   I would like to recount a personal experience. Last spring, Senator STEVENS led a Senate delegation to the Balkans, to Macedonia. Obviously, we didn't go into Kosovo at that particular time. Along with other Senators, we visited the Albanian refugees and the various refugee camps. This one was Brazda. 
   Standing in the cold and in the mud amidst a circle of refugees, there came an old man with a stocking cap. It was pulled over his head. He was recounting, through his interpreter, his tale of human misery. He had refused to join his wife and family in fleeing their home. He didn't want to leave home. He urged them to leave the home because of his worry about their safety. 
   Two sons had fled to the mountains. He did not know, since he fled at the last moment, where his family was. He was wearing the shoes of a long-time friend who was killed in the violence. His home was burned. His savings and life's wherewithal were destroyed. And with tears in his eyes he grabbed me by the lapels and he said: ``I believe in God, I believe in America, and I believe in you.'' 
   That face will always be with me. 
   Yet today, we see the continuing ethnic violence so prevalent in that part of the world. The Senator from Georgia mentioned Samuel P. Huntington's book, ``The Clash of Civilizations: The Remaking of the World Order.'' The central theme of that book is that culture and cultural identities, which we see so prevalent in the Balkans and in other places around the globe, which at the broadest level are civilization identities, are shaping the patterns of cohesion, disintegration, and conflicts in the post-cold-war world. 
   We should focus on that. I recommend his book to every Senator. It should be required reading. He has five corollaries to his main point which will help us shape our future foreign and defense policy: 
   One, in the post-cold war world, for the first time in history, global politics has become multipolar, multi-civilizational; Westernization is not producing a universal civilization--a shock, perhaps, to many who call themselves decisionmakers in regard to Western civilization. 
   Two, the balance of power among civilizations is shifting. The West is declining in relative influence. Asian civilizations are expanding their economic, military, and political strength. The Nations of Islam are exploding demographically, with destabilizing consequences for Muslim countries and their neighbors, and nonwestern civilizations generally are reaffirming the value of their own cultures. 
   Three, a civilization-based world order is emerging. Societies sharing  cultural affinities tend to really cooperate with each other. Efforts to shift societies from one civilization to another are unsuccessful. And countries group themselves around the lead or core states of their civilization. The West's universalist pretensions increasingly bring it into conflict with other civilizations. 
   Finally, the survival of the West depends on Americans reaffirming their Western identity and westerners accepting their civilization as unique but not universal, and uniting to renew and preserve it against challenges from nonwestern societies. Avoidance of global war of civilizations depends on world leaders accepting and cooperating to maintain the multi-civilizational character of global politics. 
   Simply put, Samuel Huntington says, leaders in Western nations, Members of the Senate, the President of the United States and his Cabinet, maybe we ought to concentrate on strengthening and preserving our values where they are cherished, they have been nourished, and they work well, instead of trying to impose them on countries where they are not welcome. If we do that, we will take a giant step in trying to set appropriate priorities in regard to our vital national security interests. 
   I thank the Senator from Georgia. We have concluded our remarks. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Environment and Public Works Committee legislation to name the Old Executive Office Building after one of Kansas' sons, former President Dwight David Eisenhower. 
   Although Congress is portrayed in the press as mired in gridlock over budget caps and campaign finance reform, the Senate does rise above the daily political battles and pass commonsense bipartisan legislation that the American public is often unaware of because it lacks the sizzle for front page headlines or evening news sound bites. 
   The Senate passage of S. 1652 formally recognizes former President Eisenhower's dedication and faithfulness to the United States. This Kansan rose from his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry at West Point to Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, where he directed one of the most ambitious invasions in military history. 
   At the end of his military career, Eisenhower embarked on his successful candidacy for President of the United States. Eisenhower's biographer, Stephen Ambrose, wrote in his introduction to ``Eisenhower The President'' that ``Dwight Eisenhower is one of only two Republicans (the other was Grant) to serve two full terms as President. Along with the two Roosevelts, he is the only twentieth-century President who, when he left office, still enjoyed wide and deep popularity. And he is the only President in this century who managed to preside over eight years of peace and prosperity.'' 
   America liked Ike. 
   We in Kansas are always honored when we can share our admiration for Dwight David Eisenhower with the rest of the Nation including the Dwight David Eisenhower National Highway System and the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene, Kansas. 
   My own family has strong ties to Ike and the Eisenhower years. My father, Wes, played a key role in Eisenhower's presidential nomination and his election. He served as Republican national chairman for Ike. 
   Naming the Old Executive Office Building after former President Eisenhower is fitting because this building is almost as historic as the White House. Former Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Taft, Johnson, Ford, and Bush, and Eisenhower himself, all had offices in this building before becoming President. This ornate building is one of the most impressive buildings in Washington and some believe its style epitomizes the optimism and exuberance of the post-Civil War period when it was constructed. Throughout his government career, Ike also conveyed these feelings to his troops and the American people therefore this recognition is well-deserved. 
   I am glad that my Senate colleagues agreed to expedite the passage of this bill and hope the other body takes quick action. It builds on last week's celebration in Kansas of former President Eisenhower where the State of Kansas made his birthday Dwight D. Eisenhower Day in Kansas. More importantly, our state leaders provided schools with curricula on Eisenhower  to teach and remind children of this great leader.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1593, the campaign finance reform bill. As a reminder to Members, two cloture motions were filed on the second pending amendment on Friday. Therefore, pursuant to rule XXII, those votes will occur on Tuesday, 1 hour after the Senate convenes, unless a consent agreement is reached to set those votes for a time certain. The majority leader has announced that the first vote today will occur at 5:30 p.m. It is hoped that the 5:30 vote, or votes, will be in relation to the amendments to the pending legislation. However, if votes regarding the campaign finance reform bill are not possible, the Senate will vote on any legislative or executive items available for action. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROBERTS. For all of those who are listening and watching this debate, I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine for her--I wrote it down--untiring, persevering, never-give-up  leadership with regard to this effort to resolve our problems with HCFA. What an acronym. We have all heard of Peter and the dike. This is Susan at the dam, the HCFA dam. In fact, we could probably turn that around in regard to what is happening. 
   I want to ask a question. Do you mean this new interim payment system--and we will go through this in some detail. I want folks to remember interim payment system, IPS. That is the acronym. Everything has to be an acronym in Washington. I don't call it IPS. I call it the ``IPS mess''. It not only rewards but actually penalizes the home health care agencies for their past, not bad behavior but good behavior; is that right?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBERTS. I heard similar complaints--I have them written down--on the interim payment system, the IPS system, from the same agencies in my State. In fact, since January of 1998, 56 Medicare-certified agencies in Kansas have closed their doors, largely as a result of the changes in the IPS. These are not the fly-by-night home health care agencies we hear about that sometimes are in the press. Many of these agencies have been in existence for 20 years. I have visited these agencies. There was a survey conducted by the Kansas Home Care Association that shows agencies have laid off an average of 42 percent of their staff. They are subsidizing their Medicare payments to the tune of $213,000. In 1997, many agencies decreased the Medicare patient visits by 63 percent. Your chart shows 6,600 people. I have asked Kansas to come up with the numbers of people who are affected. They are trying to do that. It could be in the hundreds; it could be in the thousands. 
   But one person, just one person is a valued individual. That is everybody's mom, dad, grandmother, or granddad. So from the standpoint of numbers, it is astounding what the distinguished Senator has put up on the chart with regard to this so-called IPS system. We are going through the same kind of problem. I am going to ask you, how much longer is this IPS mess going to be in effect? It was supposed to be a transition program to the prospective payment system, but they said, well, we can't do it that fast. I understand that because it does take a lot of work, but how much longer will we have to put up with this?

   Mr. ROBERTS. The home health care agencies are worried about IPS in Kansas. I know the same is true of all around the country. They also complain that their financial problems have been exacerbated--that is a fancy word that means a whole lot worse--by a host of new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA--my favorite agency in Washington--including the implementation of something called OASIS--I have the report--that they are requiring nurses to fill out. Oasis, if you look in the dictionary, is a desert island somewhere or in the middle of the desert; you come to an oasis and you get relief. Oasis is not relief. You don't spell relief by spelling oasis: a new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds, sequential billing, overpayment recoupment, and a new 15-minute increment reporting requirement that is a doozy. What about all these reporting requirements in addition to the IPS problem? What about OASIS?

But then you don't know. Aren't they sort of in a ``HCFA purgatory'' here?

   Mr. ROBERTS. We have also heard a number of complaints from my constituents about this business called OASIS. For those who don't know, again, OASIS is a system of records containing all this data on the physical, mental, and functional status of Medicare and Medicaid patients receiving care from home health care agencies. So HCFA then implemented OASIS, as I understand it, as a tool to help the agency improve the quality of care and form the basis for a new home health prospective payment system. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. But the problem, as the Senator has pointed out, is that the collection of data is burdensome and expensive for agencies; it invades the personal privacy of patients, and it must be collected for non-Medicare patients--that is the part I don't understand--as well as those served by Medicare. 
   Why on earth would they require that? I don't understand this. You talk about an unfunded mandate. This has to be at least in the top 10. 
   The Kansas House of Representatives actually passed a resolution earlier this year that asked Congress to rescind HCFA rules requiring OASIS. I have it right here. It is not often that an entire legislature of a State passes a resolution telling some alphabet soup agency back here, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense; you are causing an awful lot of regulatory overkill and causing home health care agencies to go out of business. Let's see. The State of Kansas is very concerned about the health and well-being of the senior and disabled citizens. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ``whereases,'' translated: Whoa, HCFA, don't do this. It is an unfunded mandate. 
   This was passed by the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas and it was resolved ``that the Secretary of State be directed to provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President of the United States, Secretary of Health and Human Services, President of the United States Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Minority leaders of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives,'' saying please don't enforce these OASIS regs the way they are being enforced. It is signed by the distinguished speaker of the House in Kansas and the President of the Senate.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have 2 or 3 more questions. I have a copy of OASIS. This is not relief. I understand the time requirements. I want you to look at this. This OASIS document includes an 18-page initial assessment that must be completed by a registered nurse, and a 13-page follow-up assessment that is required every 60 days. This is perpetual reporting, a perpetual reporting machine, well-boiled by HCFA. And this is on top of assessments already required by States. The paperwork burden is immense. I am curious about what is included in this assessment. Is the Senator aware of the nature of the questions in this assessment? 
   I think I know the answer. I have read through this OASIS--the third degree, or whatever you want to call it. Will the Senator speak to the nature of the questions in the assessment?

   I tell the distinguished Presiding Officer, nurses in Colorado must ask the questions of these patients about their feelings--it sounds like a Barbara Streisand song--such as if they have ever felt depressed, had trouble sleeping, or even if they have ever attempted suicide. The thought occurs to me that Members of this distinguished body from time to time feel depressed and have trouble sleeping. I hope that would not be the case with regard to suicide. 
   I am being too sarcastic. 
   Do we really think we need to ask a nurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so that he or she can send the answers over to some computer someplace in Baltimore that will then use this information to develop a prospective payment system, and we can't find out when it is going to be proposed? Who in Baltimore reads these? I asked that in regard to HCFA, in regard to all of their requirements back when it was Health, Education, and Welfare in regard to Kansas City. I wanted to go to Kansas City and say: Who reads this stuff? What do they do with it? Maybe the Senator and I could go to Baltimore and figure that out. Why on Earth would we ask a nurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so they can send the answers? It hasn't anything to do with physical therapy patients. Why is that?

   Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to respond to the distinguished Senator. 
   Unfortunately, she is correct. Any Medicare-approved health care agency must comply with all Medicare conditions of participation. That is MCP--probably another acronym, and I will not venture to say what that sounds like--including the collection of OASIS. This means patients who do not participate in Medicare are still subject to Medicare assessment. 
   In June, HCFA amended this regulation to say that these agencies don't have to--here again, this is what we have a lot 
   of trouble with--transmit the data on non-Medicare patients for the time being, but they still must spend the time taking these assessments. Hello.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBERTS. I want to go back to my statement earlier when I said in that June HCFA responded in regard to the outcry on the part of the home health care agencies in regards to the regulation on the conditions of participation with OASIS. As I indicated before, the agency still must spend the time taking the assessment. So I asked staff. I said: Wait a minute. Why is it, if they suspended it, you still have to take the assessment? I don't know where they are storing all of this paperwork. Maybe they burn it at Christmas time That may be a good idea. But, at any rate, write the mail; don't send it. And I asked staff: Why are we still doing this if, in fact, you don't send it in? It is a privacy issue. Look at the questions that are involved. These are privacy issues, and they haven't figured that out yet. So if, in fact, there are privacy issues, it would seem to me we had better settle those first or we are going to have lawsuits, big time. Why issue the regulation and then say to people: Well, we have a bunch of privacy issues that we haven't thought through, but keep on filling them out, and when we figure out the privacy issue, why, then we will get back to you. 
   I am extremely sympathetic to the concerns raised by my constituents that these new policies will harm seniors. 
   But let's give HCFA a break. I have been pretty critical and a little sarcastic, and I have to admit that I have a bias. 
   I have been working on this ever since I have had the privilege of being in public service. Even back when I was an administrative assistant to Congressman Keith Sebelius, we used to have these HCFA directives coming out to the rural health care delivery system. I can remember one right off the bat on behalf of cost containment. 
   Give HCFA a break. They are in charge of cost containment. We are all good at passing laws and then passing a lot of regulations, and saying, OK, you have to really put up with these, and it is up to HCFA to put out the regulations. And when we find they don't work, the people come to us and complain about it. 
   I can remember one rather incredible thing when they said we are not going to pay anybody any Medicare reimbursement unless the patient admissions are reviewed by hospitals on a 24-hour basis by three doctors. We thought about that a little and said: We think we are for this--because we  didn't have any doctors. I figured, well, what the heck. If we go ahead and accept this regulation, maybe they could provide the three. 
   Then there was the other great example of the sole provider and community hospital--talking about Goodland, KS, America, out on the prairie at the top of the world, a great place to live, a great farming community miles from nowhere. We asked again--it was HHS at that particular time--can you give us this decree, or this ruling to make this hospital eligible for a little more in payments? They said: Well, no, because everybody out there--I am not making this up--has four-wheel drives, and it is pretty flat in Kansas. What? As opposed to Colorado, I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer, who serves as an outstanding Senator. Four-wheel drive, and it is flat, and because they have lizards, windstorms. Our weather out there is a little tough for some bird in, like Virginia, down here to make that assessment. 
   So I have a little bias here, but I want to give HCFA a break. 
   I want to ask the Senator, are these policy changes necessary to achieve the Medicare savings goals? Medicare is a top concern; strengthen and preserve it. We have all worked very hard to do that. Are these policies necessary to achieve the savings that we want to achieve to strengthen and preserve Medicare?

   Mr. ROBERTS. If I could ask the Senator one final question, I know I have been hard on HCFA. Each Member has some very special experiences, and these are experiences that come to our attention when a constituent is having a big-time problem or a hospital or home health care agency. All of the folks that work down at HHS certainly don't fall under the category that I have been talking about. So what about our responsibility? What about our leadership? What should we do to fix the problem? How can we provide more relief to the beleaguered home health care agency?

   Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield one more time, I thank the Senator for all of her leadership and all of her hard work in this effort. I believe it is absolutely mandatory for Congress to bring much needed relief to the home health care industry in the timeframe she has emphasized, as well as to the small rural hospitals and teaching hospitals that also are feeling the pinch of all the legislative and regulatory changes made in the last few years. 
   The Senator is exactly right. We will have to move quickly. We must do it this year. There has been talk if we can't agree on a single proposal, we might have to put it off until next year. Time is of the essence in regard to our hospitals, especially the small rural providers. They operate on a shoestring budget. The same is true for the home health care agencies. 
   I will continue to work with the distinguished Senator to pass legislation before Congress adjourns for the year. We cannot go home before we straighten this out and provide some help. 
   I thank the Senator for her leadership. I think we have had a very good colloquy.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank Chairman STEVENS for his outstanding leadership during the long hours of debate leading to passage of the FY 2000 Defense appropriations bill. I especially thank the chairman for supporting Title IX of the act which permanently grants the President waiver authority over sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan. American business, workers, and farmers appreciate your efforts on this important economic and foreign policy provision.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, there are few responsibilities of the Senate more important than the constitutional duty to offer our advise and consent on treaties. 
   After long deliberation and after a series of classified and unclassified hearings, I have determined that I cannot support ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. There are serious flaws in this document that could endanger our national security in the future. 
   Make no mistake, the world is a dangerous place. We must deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it were. And we must approach ratification of this treaty with only one view; does it advance the cause of world peace without jeopardizing our own security. 
   The treaty fails on both counts. 
   First, this treaty is not verifiable. I cannot vote for a treaty that will bind the United States, but which will be ignored by other nuclear nations. 
   There are differing opinions concerning the ability to detect nuclear testing. But the issue is more complex than just detecting a detonation of a nuclear device with a yield greater than allowed by the treaty. If, for example, if a detonation occurred and we decided that we should inspect the site, how would we do the inspection? 
   First, 31 nations have to agree that a violation has occurred before site inspections would be authorized. The chances of 31 nations agreeing a violation has occurred are remote. But why do proponents of the treaty think a nation that has just violated the treaty will allow an inspection? You need to look no further than Iraq to appreciate the difficulty in inspecting a nation that wants to obfuscate such testing. 
   Just a quick review of the significant events that escaped our intelligence community in the recent past do not give confidence that they will uncover violations of this treaty. Our intelligence officers missed the development of the advanced missile development by North Korea, they failed to recognize the signs that both India and Pakistan were going to test nuclear weapons, they provided incorrect information resulting in our bombing the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, and they failed to provide sufficient information to prevent us from conducting a missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum. 
   Additionally, there was confusion over the exact number of nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. 
   Secondly, ratification of this treaty will not reduce development or proliferation of nuclear weapons. A basic truth for any nation is that it will act in a manner that best suits its national interests. The downside of our military dominance compared to the rest of the world is that it forces weaker nations to rely on weapons of mass destructions as a counter to our conventional strength. Russia and China have both publicly stated that a new reliance on nuclear weapons is necessary to ``balance'' our dominance. Rogue nations cannot possibly challenge us with conventional weapons and therefore feel compelled to acquire or develop non-conventional weapons. 
   This treaty will not stop or slow down the development of nuclear weapons if a nation deems these weapons as vital to their national interests. Russia and China will not be deterred from enhancing their nuclear weapon performance simply because they have signed this treaty. 
   Yet, our own nuclear defense program would be limited under the treaty. 
   Third, the Stock Pile Stewardship program as outlined will not guarantee safe and reliable nuclear weapons. This is a technical area. But there is considerable differences of opinion between impressive scientists about whether we can maintain our stock pile as safe and reliable without nuclear testing. Without such assurance of safety and reliability and with the knowledge that the United States will maintain a nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future, I cannot support such a treaty that would potentially put our stockpile at risk. 
   Treaty proponents will argue that any time the appropriate leaders of defense, energy and the scientific community say we must test to insure reliability and safety, we can withdraw from the treaty. I have little confidence that once this treaty is approved, ``pulling the sword Excaliber from the stone'' would seem a trivial task compared to withdrawal from a nuclear test ban treaty. 
   The point is that once the treaty is signed, we need to be confident that we can maintain a safe, reliable nuclear stockpile. We have no such confidence today--perhaps the technology will be in place in 5-15 years--and therefore we should not jeopardize our nuclear deterrent by agreeing to this treaty. 
   Because we cannot verify whether other nations are following the treaty, because the treaty does not halt or prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and because the treaty could lead to reduced reliability and safety of our nuclear stockpile, I cannot support its ratification.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate are also privileged to become associated with a great many people who also serve our Nation's Capitol and, in turn, better enable us to meet our responsibilities. 
   They also serve the true ``owners'' of this Capitol Building, the many men, women, and children who visit this very historic place to see firsthand ``their'' Capitol, their symbol of America, and the freedoms that we all enjoy. 
   Despite the fact they do a good job, they are mostly unsung. I am talking about the 1,600 employees of the Senate. If you count our fine U.S. Capitol Police force, that number goes over 2,000. 
   Today, I rise to pay tribute to one such employee, former Hill staffer, James Thomas ``Tony'' Anderson, who passed away this past August.  
   For the past 5 years, the Senate's appointment desk, just one floor from this Chamber, was where Tony always greeted people with a smile and made them feel very special. In this tribute to him, I also speak for his coworkers and friends, Joy Ogdon, Christine Catucci, and Laura Williams. 
   Mr. President, I first met Tony Anderson when I worked for Kansas Senator Frank Carlson and was a good friend with his mother, Margaret, who was a long-time and valued member of the Carlson staff. 
   Like many of our dedicated employees, Mr. Anderson was never far from Capitol Hill. He was born in the old Providence Hospital at Third and E Streets N.E., and Tony got his training early and from some of the best. While still in high school, and later in college, he worked in various capacities for many Senators; the list reads similar to a Who's Who of the Senate during those years. I am talking about Senator Russell Long, Senator Leverett Saltonstall, Senator John Kennedy, Senator George Murphy, and Senator Frank Carlson. 
   He graduated from Anacostia High School and later attended Federal City College, Montgomery College, and later the University of the District of Columbia. 
   James Thomas Anderson was also Brother Bernard, junior Profess member of the Order of St. Francis, a Holy Order within the Episcopal Church, located at Little Portion Monastery in New York. His chosen service within the Order of St. Francis was commensurate with his strong support of human and animal rights. Upon his return from the monastery, he worked for the Architect of the National Cathedral. 
   Mr. Anderson's life took a turn from Washington as a result of being a waiter at the old Carroll Arms Hotel Restaurant, where his interest in wines led him to a successful career that took him to the vineyards of Italy, France, Germany, and Spain. With his knowledge of wine and cheeses, he helped to open the Capitol Hill Wine and Cheese Shop, one of the first business successes that led to the revitalization of Capitol Hill. 
   He later became the sommelier at the Watergate Terrace, the Four Seasons, Jean Louis at the Watergate, and then to the Hay Adams Hotel. Mr. Anderson was instrumental in getting the Four Seasons' wine and beverage program started. 
   Tony Anderson then returned to the Capitol, working in the Senate Restaurant and Banquet Department. He could tell many accounts of serving First Ladies, visiting dignitaries, and even a luncheon for the Queen of England. No one did it better or with more elegance and propriety than Tony. 
   Mr. Anderson left the Senate Restaurant, and for the past 5 years served on the Senate Appointments Desk. In that capacity, he was a natural. Tony Anderson was born in the city, grew up in the city. He loved the city and the Senate dearly. He truly enjoyed people, made them feel welcome, and if they had a moment, he made their visit to our Capitol special with all of his stories and experiences. 
   I am not sure when he told me who he was. As I indicated, we were friends when I worked for Senator Frank Carlson a long time ago. For me and for most who have worked here as pages, interns, employees, and staffers--and, yes, also as Members of Congress--each experience, each person and, yes, even the places, are like a special collage etched in your memory. 
   I can't remember exactly when it was, but I know I was coming from the Hart Building; I decided not to take the elevator to get to the first floor but to take the old stairs that I used when I was an intern for Senator Frank Carlson; they lead to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee room. Well, I turned right and was hurrying on my way, glancing at those ever-present appointment cards, when I heard Tony:  
   Hey, Pat, remember me? I'm Tony Anderson, Margaret Anderson's son.  
   And there he was, with a bow tie and a smile, the same smile and always pleasant demeanor that made him special to his family, coworkers, and friends--not to mention everyone he ever served and helped, from the Queen of England to John Q. Public, visitor to our Nation's Capitol. 
   Mr. Anderson died at the age of 57. He is survived by his sister, Karen Anderson Cramer of Ocean Pines, MD. He was preceded in death by his parents, James and Margaret Anderson, and Edward Brodniak, his life partner of 32 years. 
   Tony, thanks and godspeed. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to read a statement I am sending to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman regarding USDA's approach to emergency farm legislation. The letter goes like this: 
   ``Dear Mr. Secretary''--Dear Dan, we are personal friends--  
   We all agree that we need to get the emergency agriculture bill out of conference, passed and get the assistance to our farmers as fast as possible. In this regard, I am concerned with recent comments you have made regarding how these payments should be funded and made available to farmers. Instead of using the current Agriculture Marketing Transition Act--[and the acronym for that is AMTA--instead of using that] payment system that farmers and their lenders were promised and banked on several months ago, you and others within the Administration have recommended alternative payment plans.
   In your September 15 testimony before the House Agriculture Committee, you said: 
   ``There is an immediate need to provide cash assistance to mitigate low prices, falling incomes, and in some areas, falling land values.'' 
   But then you said: 
   ``Congress should enact a new program to target assistance to farmers of 1999 crops suffering from low prices. The Administration believes the income assistance must address the shortcomings of the farm bill by providing counter-cyclical assistance. The income assistance should compensate for today's low prices and therefore they should be paid according to this year's actual production of the major field crops, including oilseeds.'' 
   [Mr. Secretary--] Dan, I know the Administration, the Farmer's Union and some Democrats in the Congress want to change the farm bill in the emergency legislation. And I know some of the budget [folks, I call them] ``wonks'' in the Office of Management and Budget--[I do not mean to perjure their intent, what they do, but they are] sending mixed signals and I know the politics of the issue. [There has been a lot of that.] Nevertheless, I urge you to reconsider for the following reasons: 
   First: The very farmers who need the assistance [and who would receive the assistance] oppose this plan. 
   The commodity organizations representing producers of soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, sunflowers, canola and rice and the American Farm Bureau--the very farmers you stressed in your statement--strongly disagree with your philosophy and proposal. In a letter to the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Ted Stevens, they said and I quote: 
   ``We strongly disagree with that [and I am saying] (your) philosophy. The current economic distress is party a result of the unfulfilled promises of expanded export markets, reduced regulations and tax reform that were part of the promises made during deliberation of the 1996 farm bill. The costs of these unfulfilled promises fall upon those people who were participating in farm programs at that time. 
   [They go on to say, and I am quoting: 
   ``The current AMTA payment process is in place and can deliver payments quickly. The administration costs of developing an alternative method of payments would be very high and eat into funds that should go to farmers. Given the 7 1/2 months it took the Department to issue weather disaster aid last year, we are unwilling to risk that producers might have to wait that long for development and implementation of a new farm program and disaster aid formula. Time is also critical for suppliers of goods and services to producers. They need payments for supplies now to stay in business, not just promises that something will happen in the future. 
   ``Supplemental AMTA payments provide income to producers of corn, wheat, cotton, rice, barley and grain sorghum.''  
   Again, these are the very organizations, the commodity groups that represent the producers, that would receive the assistance. They go on to say:  
   ``Soybean producers will receive separate payments under the Senate language. Crop cash receipts for these producers in 1999 will be down over 20 percent from the 1995-97 yearly average. Producers who have smaller than normal crops due to weather problems will receive normal payment levels. This is better than using the loan deficiency payment program which are directly tied to this year's production.''  
   Finally they say:  
   ``We urge you to retain the $5.5 billion in supplemental AMTA payments as the method of distribution for farm economy aid in the agriculture appropriations conference agreement. Any alternative would certainly take additional time to provide assistance to producers--time which we cannot afford.''  
   My second reason for opposing these alternative plans:  
   Changing the payment plan will mean farmers will not receive their payments until next year. 
   The term you used, Mr. Secretary, in your statement regarding the emergency payments was ``immediate.'' The difference between using the AMTA payment system--  
   That is the current one--  
   and the several alternative methods you have suggested is: Three weeks or 3 months. Or this year or next. 
   Last week, Farm Service Agency official Parks Shackelford said: ``All the king's horses and all the king's men could not get the payments made as quickly as Congress desires.'' 
   Well, Dan, last year the USDA was able to distribute payments through the AMTA system in less than 3 weeks after passage of the legislation by Congress. They began on November 3, the date of the election, by the way, and farmers received their payments before Thanksgiving. 
   Last year, in delivering disaster assistance, through a formula developed by the Department, it took 7 1/2 months to receive these payments.  
   I say to the Secretary with no disrespect:  
   Dan, you are the ``king'' and you have the horses, just do it. 
   Third: No specific or formal plan has been presented and in terms of the actual farming practices, the criticism, in my view, just doesn't add up. 
   Staff on both the authorizing and the appropriations committees tell me no formal plan for an alternative distribution plan has been developed or submitted. What has been developed and submitted, however, is repeated criticism of current policy.  
   That has been ongoing for sometime, not only at the Department, not only by one major farm organization, but certainly on the floor of the Senate and the House, for that matter.  
   However, these comments show either naivete from people who do not understand the current legislation or worse, that the Department is breaking the law. 
   In recent weeks, the USDA and Office of Management and Budget officials have criticized plans to distribute income assistance through the AMTA system. 
   Their first complaint was, ``Payments actually go to people who planted no crops.'' 
   I respectfully ask are producers who lost their crops due to hail, disease, drought, or flooding in better financial condition than  those producers who had crops to harvest in 1999? Yes, our farmers can receive AMTA payments without planting a crop. That is part of the flexibility of the farm bill. But you and I know, Mr. Secretary, they must plant a cover crop for conservation requirements, and you and I also know that farmers have shifted the crops they plant and the current price crisis affects all crops. I know of no farmers who have quit planting altogether.  
   Farmers don't do that.  
   Last Friday, you said these payments are being made on many acres that are no longer planted to crops but rather have been switched over to pasture and to grassland. If that is the case, certainly hard hit livestock producers will also benefit from the AMTA payments. But more to the point, you, some in the Department and many of our friends across the aisle have urged production and/or acreage controls because farmers have allegedly planted ``fence row to fence row'' under the 1996 farm bill. The dramatic changes in production figures on major crops you cited arguing the administration's new payment distribution proposal clearly shows the large grain surpluses did not come from U.S. farmers. However, the current AMTA payment plan is, in fact, a paid diversion if the farmer wishes to make that decision. 
   Those who propose acreage or production controls should embrace AMTA payments in that it affords farmers the opportunity to be paid for shifting to other crops or putting the ground into good conservation practices. They won't, of course, because the controls are not mandatory and did not simply come out of Washington. 
   The second complaint we have heard is, ``Payments are being made to those who share no risk in farm production,'' or the landlords. 
   Dan, if they are, both the USDA and the recipient are simply breaking the law. The 1996 farm bill clearly states that payments can be made only to those who ``assume part or all of the risk of producing a crop.'' If payments are indeed being made to those who share no risk in production, it is a clear violation of the law and disciplinary action should be taken for any official approving payments in an illegal manner. 
   The third complaint was, ``The income assistance component must address the shortcomings of the farm bill by providing countercyclical assistance.'' 
   I am not going to go into a detailed description of a portion of the farm bill that we call the Loan Deficiency Payment Program--  
   And the acronym for that is LDPs--  
   but what on Earth is the loan deficiency payment if it is not countercyclical? As a matter of fact, your own Department estimated last week that at least $5.6 billion in loan deficiency payments will be going out to farmers this year because prices are low and the lower prices are, the higher the LDP payments--  
   i.e., they are countercyclical--  
   even to the point of exempting them from payment limitations.  
   That is how much money is going out under the LDP Program.  
   How can you get more safety net countercyclical than that? 
   Fourth: The alternative plans that you have proposed--  
   And there have been several of them--  
   have problems in regard to how they would work. 
   While no formal alternative plan has been submitted--  
   And I emphasize the word ``formal'' and specific--  
   you have indicated such a plan would base payments off of a State average yield or off of a 5-year production average that farmers would have to prove. 
   On one hand, you are telling farmers their payment will be based on ``actual production yields'' while on the other you state you intend to use the 1999 State averages or 5-year average yields. We both know that widespread discrepancies can occur in yields from one region of a State to another. We do not need western Kansas versus eastern Kansas arguments in regard to equity or similar arguments with any State or region throughout the country. 
   Fifth: Our farmers, and their lenders, will not know the amount of payment not to mention when they will receive it. 
   Any change in the AMTA distribution payments also changes what farmers and their lenders are promised and they banked on several months ago when we passed the bill in the Senate. We should use the current AMTA system where the producers and the lenders know exactly what their payments will be. 
   Finally, Dan, as we have discussed, no farm bill is set in stone and none is perfect by any means.  
   Certainly the current bill fits that description.  
   That debate is and should be taking place but not on an emergency bill. It has been 6 months now since you requested an emergency bill. To date, I still don't know the administration's budget position, and I have not seen a specific plan. Some within OMB tell the appropriators they want less lost income payments and more disaster and others just the opposite. 
   Summing up, with all due respect, Mr. Secretary, your proposal: 
   1. Is opposed by the very farmers who will receive emergency assistance. 
   2. Will delay the payments until next year. 
   3. Is based upon comments from those who apparently do not understand the legislation (and, I might add, not to mention farming) or if their comments are true, mean the USDA is breaking the law. 
   4. Has yet to be formally presented to staff and involves serious distribution and equity problems. 
   5. Breaks the commitment made to farmers and lenders when the Senate passed the emergency bill months ago. 
   With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, I don't think we should be in the business of changing horses after the stage left.  
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I rise to add my voice to the support of the Defense authorization bill that we soon vote on. 
   It has been my honor this year to serve as the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's new subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. The chairman wisely established this subcommittee to provide a focus on the Department of Defense's efforts to counter new and emerging threats to vital national security interests. 
   This subcommittee has oversight over such threats as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism directed at U.S. targets both at home and abroad, information warfare, and narco-trafficking. In addition, the subcommittee has budgetary oversight of the defense science and technology program--which will provide for the development of the technology necessary for the U.S. military to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
   A key element of the subcommittee's responsibilities is the changing role of the U.S. military in the new threat environment, with an examination of emerging operational concepts and non-traditional military operations. In this connection, the subcommittee has oversight of the procurement and R&D programs of the Special Operations Command. 
   I would like to briefly highlight the initiatives included in this bill to address emerging threats and the future capabilities of our armed forces: 
   Protection of our homeland and our critical information infrastructure are two of the most serious challenges facing our Nation today. In the area of Counter-Terrorism, the bill includes full funding for the five Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) teams requested by the administration, and an increase of $107 million to provide a total of 17 additional RAID teams in fiscal year 2000. We required the Department to establish specific budget reporting procedures for its combating terrorism program. This will give the program the focus and visibility it deserves while providing Congress with the information it requires to conduct thorough oversight over the Department's efforts to combat the threat of terrorism attack both inside and outside the U.S. 
   The bill includes a $150 million Information Assurance Initiative to strengthen the defense information assurance program, enhance oversight and improve organizational structure. This initiative will also provide a testbed to plan and conduct simulations, exercises and experiments against information warfare threats, and allow the Department to interact with civil and commercial organizations. The provision encourages the Secretary of Defense to strike an appropriate balance in addressing threats to the defense information infrastructure while at the same time recognizing that DOD has a role to play in protecting critical infrastructures outside the DOD. 
   In the area of nonproliferation, we have authorized full funding for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to accelerate the dismantlement of the former Soviet Union strategic offensive arms that threaten the U.S. And for the DoE programs--Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and the Nuclear Cities Initiative--we have authorized an increase of $5.0 million over the FY99 funding levels and have recommended several initiatives to enhance the overall management of these programs. 
   We have included in the bill a legislative package to strengthen the defense science and technology program. This legislation will ensure that the science and technology program is threat-based and that investments are tied to future warfighting needs. The legislation is also aimed at promoting innovation in laboratories and improving the efficiency of these RDT&E operations. 
   Other budgetary highlights include: a $271 million increase to the defense science and technology budget request; an additional $10.0 million for Joint Experimentation exercises; $14.0 million in targeted increases in the Chemical and Biological Defense Program to advance research in chemical and biological agent detector technologies and procurement; and an additional $164.7 million to meet unfunded requirements of the Special Operations Forces. 
   Although I have highlighted some of the key successes of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, I am very proud of the total package we are voting on today. I think we have done an excellent first step in helping the men and women in the military receive fair compensation for their sacrifice for this nation. 
   I thank the Chairman for his vital and impressive leadership this year, along with the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, and the majority staff. I urge my colleagues to support the Defense authorization bill.

   Mr. ROBERTS. The final version of S. 1059 also contains a provision, sponsored by the distinguished chairman and myself, requiring the President to certify whether the new Strategic Concept of NATO--the latest alliance blueprint for future operations adopted at the recent NATO summit here in Washington--contains new commitments and obligations for the United States. This body's experience with U.S. deployments to the Balkans bears out the fact that you better force the administration to be candid when it comes to the potential and actual use of American troops, particularly in regards to objectives, strategy, and timetable. It follows, therefore, you better formally require this administration to be candid about the defense planning and defense budget implications of the new Strategic Concept of NATO. I think the chairman and I have tried to do that with our provision and I look forward to the President's certification, due thirty days from the date S. 1059 becomes law.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on behalf of myself, Senator KERREY of Nebraska, and a bipartisan group of 17 of our colleagues--including a majority of the members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, the ``Risk Management for the 21st Century Act.'' 
   This legislation represents a significant step in improving the risk management tools available to producers throughout the United States. 
   In early March, Senator KERREY and I joined to introduce S. 529, the ``Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act.'' At the time, we stated that we did not necessarily believe it was ``the bill,'' but that we hoped it would serve as the starting point for a discussion that would lead to the introduction of a comprehensive piece of legislation to improve the risk management tools available to producers throughout the U.S. and which could be supported by a majority of our colleagues. 
   I believe this is that bill. Going back to last fall and through this spring and summer, we have been involved in literally hundreds of hours of discussions with producers, commodity and farm organizations, insuranceproviders, insurance agents, and Members of the House and Senate regarding what needs to be done to improve the risk management tools available to our farmers and ranchers. 
   The bill we introduce today is the product of these many discussions. 
   This bill includes many of the provisions included in the original Roberts/Kerrey legislation, but it also includes many new provisions recommended during our discussions with Members and agricultural organizations. These include: 
   An inverted subsidy structure. 
   An equal level of subsidy for revenue insurance products. 
   APH adjustments for producers suffering multiple years of crop losses. 
   APH adjustments for new and beginning farmers, those farming new land, and those rotating crops. 
   Instructions to undertake alternative rating methodologies for low risk producers and regions and crops with low participation percentages and to then implement this new rating system. This at the request of many of our southern colleagues. 
   Changes in prevented planting and incentives to encourage producers to take additional risk management measures. Similar to car insurance, if you take drivers education classes you get an additional discount on your premium. Under our legislation, producers who take additional risk management steps will also receive a bonus discount on their premiums. 
   Authority for several pilot programs, placing special emphasis on polices to explore coverage for livestock and to expand the quality and levels of coverage available to specialty crops. 
   Mr. President, in addition to the many changes mentioned above, our legislation also provides for major changes in the Risk Management Agency (RMA) and the regulatory process governing the crop insurance program.  
   We change the members of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's Board of Directors to include: 
   Four Farmers from geographic regions to be determined by the Secretary.  
   One member active in the crop insurance industry. 
   One member with reinsurance expertise. 
   The Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign 
   Agricultural Services, the Undersecretary for Rural Development, and the USDA Chief Economist. 
   Make the FCIC the overseer of RMA. 
   Create an Office of Private Sector Partnership to serve as a liaison between private sector companies and the FCIC Board of Directors. 
   Allow companies to charge minimal fees to other companies selling their products, in order to allow the recovery of research and development costs.  
   Mr. President, our legislation also focuses on several areas that I want to place special emphasis on because they are areas that I know are of interest to many of my colleagues and which some often think those of us in the Midwest and Plains States tend to ignore. 
   The first deals with program compliance. We have heard complaints from some of our colleagues and specific commodity groups that fraud exists in several areas of the country. Let me make clear, Senator KERREY and I oppose any attempts to defraud the crop insurance program. 
   To prevent this fraud, the legislation calls for penalties of up to $10,000 for producers, agents, loss adjusters, and approved insurance providers that attempt to defraud the program. It also allows for USDA to remove producers from eligibility for all USDA programs if they have defrauded the program. Furthermore, agents, loss adjusters, and approved companies that do business in the program could be banned from participation for up to five years if they have committed fraud. 
   Mr. President, these provisions are strong and they are clear--those who attempt to defraud the program and taxpayers will be punished. 
   Mr. President, another concern that Senator KERREY and I have heard repeatedly is the lack of emphasis and prioritization for specialty crops and development of new crop insurance and risk management tools for these crops. We have included many provisions in our legislation to address these concerns. 
   These specialty crop provisions include: 
   Changes in the Noninsured Assistance Program that we believe will make it easier to obtain assistance and funding through changes in which commodities can be covered and by allowing payments in some instances irregardless of an area trigger occurring. 
   Several pilot projects geared specifically towards looking at the feasibility of Gross Revenue and Whole Farm Revenue polices that include coverage for specialty crops. 
   Requiring the newly created Office of Private Sector Partnership to include staff with specialty crop expertise. 
   Allow RMA to spend up to $20 million per year to create partnerships with Land Grant Universities, the Agricultural Research Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other qualified entities to develop and implement new specialty crop risk management options. 
   Requires 50 percent of RMA's research and development funds to go to specialty crop products development. Additionally, 50 percent of these R&D funds must be contracted out to organizations and entities outside RMA. 
   Reaffirms the authority of the Specialty Crops Coordinator in RMA. The bill also allows the Specialty Crops Coordinator to make competitive grants for research and development of new products in the specialty crops area. 
   Contains provisions regarding sales closing dates and the issuance of new polices. 
   Orders the Specialty Crops coordinator and the FCIC to study the feasibility of offering cost-of production, Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), quality-based policies, and an intermediate coverage level (higher than current CAT coverage) for specialty crops. 
   Requires the Board to annually review and certify that speciality crops are adequately covered. If insufficient coverage is available for a commodity, the Board can require RMA to undertake R&D activities. 
   Provides mechanisms whereby the Secretary must take steps to improve participation in the program when total participation for a crop in an individual state falls below 75 percent of the national participation average. 
   Mr. President, these changes for specialty crops are significant and we believe they give important attention to a group of producers that has often felt neglected in U.S. agricultural policy. I hope that 
   our colleagues will agree and that they will join us in supporting this legislation. 
   Mr. President, let me also state that I realize some will argue that specific provisions should have been included in this legislation that currently are not. I understand these concerns, but as we developed this bill, we had to determine the priorities of each agricultural region and commodity groups. There is something from this bill that all of us would like to see included, including Senator KERREY and myself, but as a whole it is I believe the best package available. 
   I also realize that some in this body claim that crop insurance is not necessary and that we do not need to act on this legislation this year. I could not disagree more. 
   Mr. President, every year our producers put the seed in the ground and believe that with a little faith and luck they will produce a crop. But, sometimes the creeks do rise and the multiple perils of drought, flood, fire, hail, blizzard, pests, and disease get the better or our producers. They must have the tools to manage these risks. 
   The agricultural and lending communities have spoken loudly, and they all have continually expressed the need to improve the risk management tools available to producers throughout the U.S. It is time for us to move towards action on this issue. The House Agriculture Committee approved legislation prior to the August recess. It is time for the Senate Agriculture Committee to do the same. A majority of the Committee has said as much by supporting our legislation. 
   Mr. President, we know there are many disagreements within members of the Senate in regards to specific agricultural policy. In fact, Senator KERREY and I have disagreements of our own on the underlying Farm Bill. However, we all agree that our producers today cannot be successful without access to new, improved, and adequate risk management tools. This legislation accomplishes these needs, and I urge my colleagues to join us in working towards an improved crop insurance program and risk management tools.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I would like to engage the Senators from Wisconsin in this colloquy. Yesterday, when the Senate considered the Agriculture Appropriations Bill, I had offered three amendments regarding the Conservation Reserve Program. It is my understanding that at least one of these amendments had been cleared for approval until just prior to final passage of the bill, and that the Ranking Member and Chairman had been giving consideration to the remaining two amendments. However, the Department of Agriculture had expressed concerns and objections were raised.

   Mr. ROBERTS. The first amendment regarding CRP cross compliance is to address a problem we have had in Kansas. In many areas of the state, we have old homesteads that have long been abandoned. As time has passed these old homes have become dilapidated, rundown, and liability risks. Many producers want to remove these old homesteads and incorporate the land into their CRP land, conservation practices, or cropping rotations. But they are unable to do so due to CRP cross compliance rules. Under these rules, producers lose eligibility for CRP payments if they break Highly Erodible land (HEL) into production. Much of the land is considered HEL. Thus most of these homesteads sit on HEL land, and if they are removed, producers have violated the rules and lose payments. This does not seem to make sense and USDA agrees. USDA informed me that they planned to recommend to the Congress the elimination of this program in the next Farm Bill. 
   The other two amendments involve notices regarding CRP Notices 327 and 338 issued by the Farm Service agency last fall and this spring.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we have had a great deal of discussion in regard to the kind of emergency assistance we would all like to see happen in the Senate. We have heard quite a bit of debate as to what is appropriate. 
   I have a package that has been endorsed by about six or seven Senators--Senator BURNS and Senator SANTORUM, more especially, who have been especially helpful--Senator CRAIG, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator GRAMS, Senator HAGEL, all of the cosponsors, to try to reach some accommodation. I am not sure, but perhaps we could conclude this debate and simply have a vote within, I would say, a half hour. I do not know what my friends and colleagues on the other side would say about that, but I make a recommendation and seek unanimous consent that debate on this amendment be for 30 minutes, with 15 minutes divided equally. 
   Could there be an agreement on that? I see the distinguished Democratic leader nodding his head.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Basically, the amendment is the same as I have discussed with my friend and colleague, with the addition of $400 million for disaster assistance, after talking to the Secretary of Agriculture as of this morning. But we have a summary of the amendment, and we will endeavor to make as many copies as we can during the debate. 
   I think most of my colleagues on that side--and we have been trying to work together--understand what is in the amendment. But without question we will make the copies available to you.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. 
   I say to the distinguished Democratic leader, I would have hoped that he could have described my amendment as perhaps acceptable as opposed to the completely unacceptable amendment by the Senator from Arizona, and I would hope that would be the case. 
   It is my understanding now we have 30 minutes of time and 15 minutes on a side. I am going to yield time to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania who has been a real help to us in trying to put together an amendment that will be acceptable to all parties. 
   I do also thank my friends across the aisle, more particularly Senator DORGAN and Senator CONRAD and Senator HARKIN. We had a discussion yesterday. I know this amendment does not cross every ``t'' or dot every ``i'' in their eyes, but I would say to them that we on our side have tried to move at least to a compromise bill that could be worked out. 
   I had a telephone conversation with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman about 45 minutes ago. I want to point out that the Secretary of Agriculture, and many on the other side, and many on this side, have had the opportunity to work on many farm bills together. 
   There have been 13 emergency or supplemental bills in the last 10 years in regard to agriculture. That shows you the tremendous change that occurs in global agriculture. We have worked together on many of these bills. Secretary Glickman and I are very good friends. We have very strong differences of opinion from time to time; there is no question about that, but we have tried to work together as a team on behalf of agriculture. 
   In regard to this debate, I suggest to everybody that today is the day for compromise and teamwork on behalf of our hard-pressed farmers and ranchers. I do not think they want us debating over and over again the philosophy or the ideology in regard to farm bills. What they want is emergency assistance, and we can then address the problems that we have all talked about in regard to a long-term agenda on behalf of agriculture. 
   Today is not the day to express strong opinions about the current farm bill or assess blame or make the political rhetoric. We have had those days. 
   Today is the day to pass an emergency bill. Senators BURNS and GORTON and SANTORUM and GRASSLEY and GRAMS and HAGEL and I have offered an amendment, now endorsed by the National Association of Wheat Growers, the American Soybean Association, and the American Farm Bureau. Obviously, we have not had enough time to contact all of the commodity organizations, all the farm groups. 
   But I think, without question, most of the farm groups, if not all, certainly support this approach. 
   What does it do? The purpose of this amendment is to provide direct income assistance to farmers and ranchers in the fastest way possible. I know my colleagues across the aisle would prefer a different way, or at least a portion of this assistance to come in a different way, in what is called the LDP program. That is an acronym for the Loan Deficiency Payment. 
   This amendment does provide the assistance through the transition payment, which will provide assistance to farmers in 10 days. We went the LDP route during the last emergency assistance--or to be more accurate, there was emergency assistance granted in the last emergency bill. 
   It took the Secretary of Agriculture 6 to 8 months to get assistance to farmers. We do not need to do that. So it is the fastest way possible. As I have indicated, it is through the structure called the additional transition payments that are contained in the farm bill. It does it with additional payments of 100 percent. 
   Let me say something about the 100 percent for those farms that are in program crops. It means not only do you get a transition payment; you get another transition payment 100 percent  equal to that. I will venture to say, with that payment most farmers in America, in terms of wheat and corn and your basic crops--and, yes, in regard to cotton and step 2, which is another program--that extra income assistance will move those prices at least to the cost of production and maybe even more. 
   As opposed to other amendments, this approach that has been offered does not change current farm program policy. You do not need to rewrite the farm bill during the appropriations process or during an emergency bill. 
   You may have very strong beliefs about this farm bill. I do. But now is not the time to rewrite the farm program in regard to this emergency bill. We can do that next year. I hope we do not in the middle of an election year, but obviously people have strong beliefs. I do not believe this is the appropriate place. 
   The bill also provides assistance to soybean and oil seed producers. 
   It provides assistance to livestock producers, to cotton producers, with regard to the step 2 program that has been so eloquently described by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator COCHRAN, and to specialty crop producers and others who do not receive program crops. 
   I say to Senators paying attention--I hope they are, either in their officers or wherever they are--all of you who represent farmers who do not have program crops not covered by the farm bill, this amendment provides the most assistance to those who are in specialty crops and others. We do not go down every commodity and raise amendments such as the one that is going to be introduced by the Senator from Arizona. Some of these commodities, some of these programs raise a lot of objections. We have had historic debates in that regard. Let's not go down that path. We give money to the Secretary of Agriculture for specialty crops. Only the USDA can determine which of those crops, which of those regions really need the assistance. I think that approach is best. 
   Most important, it contains funds for crop insurance reform to keep the crop insurance premiums at current levels. We reduced them last year. They will spike up again. So we have money to keep those at that level. 
   I tell my colleagues, finally, those of us who have tried to keep this bill under $7 billion for budgetary concerns, we have also provided another $400 million for disaster assistance as a result of talking to the Secretary of Agriculture, who was in West Virginia with Senator BYRD yesterday. We have all seen on television the effects of drought. Anybody who comes from farm country understands the effects of drought. Secretary Glickman said: I need money immediately. So we provided $400 million. Will it be enough? I don't know. But at least in terms of that request, I think it is appropriate. As I say, Secretary Glickman was in West Virginia with Senator BYRD, and the need is very crucial. That brings the total of the package to $7.5 billion, but we have a drought on hand and we have an emergency. 
   All this assistance is provided without each commodity or specialty crop coming to the table in a bidding war. We have already had that, reopening, as I have indicated, the historic and unneeded debates of the past. Instead we have emergency assistance that will provide farmers needed assistance down the road. If you want to look at farm program policy in future debates with hearings, perhaps that is appropriate.

   Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, what we tried to do with the approach, rather than specifically mentioning some of the crops that have been in controversy on the floor from time to time--and I am talking about sugar and peanuts and tobacco--we have simply provided a fund for the Secretary of $300 million for specialty crops and others not specifically mentioned elsewhere in the amendment. 
   In talking to Secretary Glickman as of this morning and going over specified funding for these crops, which may or may not need assistance in regard to weather problems or lost income problems, he indicated he would rather have that at his 
   discretion. After all, it is the USDA, in the end result, that would be able to determine at the end of the crop years, after harvest, specifically what the situation is. 
   When I mention specific numbers for these particular programs, I am not going to indicate that the Secretary is endorsing this bill in total by any means, but I think his preference would be that he would have the discretion to address these as needed, as opposed to saying we are getting X number of dollars for this particular program. Then we get into a bidding war, and the Senator knows that is what has happened in the past.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Cochran amendment had--I apologize to my friend and colleague because I don't have the specifics of the Cochran amendment here, and I should. Staff has informed me that there was $350 million for livestock payments at the discretion of the Secretary, and we provided $250 million. I am making an assumption, but most of the problems we are experiencing now are in the Senator's area in regard to hog producers. 
   In talking with Secretary Glickman today, I don't think we can make a determination yet as to where most of that money would go--the extra $100 million, if in fact we can call it extra. Well, it goes from $350 million to $250 million. It went to crop insurance, and it went to adding $100 million more on the disaster side. It was a matter of priorities.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I will make it brief. We have $400 million for the disaster program. That is a commitment to agriculture to know that the Secretary can begin to work on the problem in the Atlantic States. That doesn't mean if down the road we have continued droughts--it is the worst in a hundred years in the Atlantic region--that we will not be committed to doing what we have to do. But to do it here, we have no way of knowing what that crop damage will be. So I urge the Senator to say here is $400 million in regard to all of the problems we are experiencing in terms of national disasters, and it doesn't mean that down the road that could not be addressed; we just don't  know at this particular time. I don't think it would be responsible to add a whole bunch more money when we don't even know. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I may go step 1 instead of step 2. 
   Mr. President, on the definition of ``bipartisan,'' bipartisan is where you accept our view and not your view, and different Senators can define that depending on their strong opinion. 
   Let me point out that when this started, the amount of funding was somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion, and many thought that was too much. It is now $7.5 billion. If that isn't compromise, and some would think in the wrong direction, I don't know what compromise is. 
   Let me point out that Senators came to me from both sides of the aisle. This  has not been exclusively a Republican initiative by any means. They worried that too many of these programs were not specified, and they had a lot of problems with those individual programs. 
   Let me point out that when I met with my good friends and colleagues in that Cloakroom and discussed this issue for about 20 minutes, if that isn't bipartisan, colleagues, I must have been in the wrong Cloakroom. 
   Now we are into a discussion as to whether or not there is enough disaster assistance when the Secretary of Agriculture indicated that $400 million was at least a first step for him to take a look at it. Then we are into these acronyms of LDP and AMTA. That is why people's eyes glaze over when we have any debate on farm program policy. We ought to give the money out. Under AMTA, you get it in 10 days. Under LDP, it takes months. We are arguing about acronyms and we are arguing about numbers. 
   Let's get the assistance to farmers and end this debate and don't change the farm program policy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my colleagues. 
   Mr. President, I rise to discuss the need to provide emergency financial relief to our country's farmers and ranchers and to rural America in what will hopefully be short-term assistance that will allow our producers to meet their cash flow needs while Congress also pursues the long-term objectives needed to provide a profitable agriculture sector into the 21st century. 
   As one Kansas farmer told me recently: ``Pat, in farm country today we are just not in very good shape for the shape we are in.'' 
   Farmers today, as many of my colleagues are pointing out, are struggling with depressed prices and cash flow difficulties, especially farmers who do not receive program payments under the current farm bill. 
   We can and should provide relief to enable our producers to get through these very difficult times, and the choice between the relief package that has been offered by Senator COCHRAN and that offered by Senator HARKIN will determine the kind and amount of assistance that will be forthcoming--or some other substitute. 
   In this regard, I have been urging Congress to act on a program of limited but effective assistance before this August break to send a strong signal to farmers, ranchers, and most important, the agriculture lending community. Land values have not tailed off, but the continuing stress certainly could lead to that. We need to nip that in the bud. 
   On the other hand, I do not believe it is in the interest of American agriculture to rewrite the current farm bill or to enact policy that will be market interfering, market disruptive, and lead us back down the road to command and control farm policy from Washington. Unfortunately, I believe both of the proposals that are before us today, or at least some aspects of those proposals, do fall into that category, especially the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Mr. DASCHLE. 
   I will discuss the shortcomings of these proposals later, but first let me point out, this emergency assistance debate is only part of the story. The rest of the story involves the drumbeat of rhetoric we have heard from our Democrat colleagues and friends across the aisle, and the Clinton administration, who, month after month, week after week, day after day, have blamed the 1996 farm bill, called Freedom to Farm, for the collapse of commodity prices, if not the end of production agriculture and family farms in the United States. 
   Reading the press releases, the resulting headlines, and listening to my colleagues, you would think the current farm bill was the result of some sinister plot concocted in the dead of night. 
   Apparently, they would like farmers and ranchers to believe our current farm policy is responsible for record worldwide production; increasing and record yield production and productivity; the worst international economic crisis since the early 1980s decimating our largest markets; record subsidies by the European Union, some $60 billion; weather--too much rain, too little rain, the obvious drought in the Atlantic States, La Nin 6a and El Nin 6o; persistent plant diseases in the northern plains, and crop infestation in all other regions; 
   new technology and precision agriculture; currency changes and the value of the dollar that have reduced American exports--that would be some farm bill. But those are the causes that have actually led to the low commodity prices. 
   In fact, the current farm bill came after 38 full committee and subcommittee hearings in the House Agriculture Committee during my tenure as Chairman, 21 of which were held in farm country--every region, every commodity--all open-microphone listening sessions. Extensive hearings were also held here in Washington on this side of the Capitol in the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
   Literally thousands of farmers and ranchers voiced their opinion. They overwhelmingly stated they wanted the Government to get out of their planting decisions, to quit interfering in the marketplace, so they could make their own marketing decisions based on what was best for their farms, their ranches, according to the market. 
   The bottom line, farmers told us there was too much in command and control that came from Washington. They were tired of standing in line outside the Farm Service Agency so that Washington could tell them what to plant in exchange for a Government subsidy. 
   As one 89-year-old Kansas farmer told us in Dodge City--and I quote:  
   I farmed for nearly 60 years and I never planted a crop that the government had not told me I could plant.  
   The single most important goal and rationale behind the 1996 farm bill was to restore decision making back to the individual producer, i.e., the freedom to farm. 
   It is true--almost all of the speeches that have been made on the floor of the Senate, and all of the press conferences that we have heard all throughout farm country--it is true our commodity prices are depressed. Markets are depressed worldwide. Everyone involved in agriculture certainly knows and is dealing with that firsthand. 
   But as the saying goes in farm country: Comin' as close to the truth as a man can come without gettin' there is comin' pretty close but it still ain't the truth. 
   Or put another way, no matter who says what, don't believe it if it doesn't make sense. With all due respect to my colleagues who apparently believe the 1996 Farm Act is the root cause of problems in farm country, I do not believe that is simply the case. 
   I understand the politics of the issue. As scarce as the truth is, the supply seems greater than demand. And with Freedom to Farm, there is no demand amongst some of my Democrat friends. 
   But politics aside, I must admit I am both puzzled and amazed by the rhetoric we have heard over and over and over and over again. How can a farm bill that has provided on average more income assistance during difficult times over the past 3 years than occurred during the five-year average under the old farm bill be bad for farmers? 
   Let me point out that the market situation for all raw commodities is under stress. In addition to low crop prices, we have also been suffering through low farm prices for cattle, for hogs, for oil, for gold, for gas, and all raw commodities. None of these commodities has been covered by a farm bill--any farm bill. Is the current farm bill responsible for the market collapse in these commodities? Obviously not. But the causes that caused those low prices are the same ones that caused the problem with regard to farm country. 
   There was an interesting press report about a week ago. It was on the front page of a newspaper about the severity of the agriculture situation--and it is severe. The lead of the story said:  
   In the wake of dismal prairie farm income projections, agriculture officials emphasized the need for an improved long term safety net. If something is not done we are going to lose a lot of farmers.  
   But you know, that story was not about the United States; it was about Canada and their farm crisis. Canadian farmers are facing bleak prospects; and the same is true in Great Britain; and the same is true in Europe; and the same is true all over this world, in Latin America and South America, as well. 
   I do not think that Freedom to Farm caused their problems. This is a worldwide market decline, and as such is unprecedented. 
   What has caused the low commodity prices?  
   First, farmers worldwide have had good growing weather and produced record crops for 3 years in a row--unprecedented. That is what my good friend and colleague, the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, said a few weeks ago when we attended a joint meeting--unprecedented record crops. 
   Second, we have experienced a world depression in regard to our export markets, both in Asia and Latin America and South America. 
   Third, the European Union is now spending a record $60 billion--85 percent of the world's ag subsidies--on their subsidies. 
   Fourth, the currency exchange rates reduced the level of farm exports and farm prices. A 16-percent appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar has been responsible for 17 to 25 percentage points of the decline in corn and wheat prices. 
   Fifth, a market-oriented farm program depends on an aggressive trade policy. In regard to trade, although it is very controversial, we did not do fast track. We had a very historic agreement with China, with bipartisan work on it, and then it was pulled back; and then it was followed by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy. That was not the intent, but that is what has happened. And we are about to put agriculture last--certainly not first--in the coming WTO trade talks in Seattle. We continue to employ counterproductive sanctions that punish U.S. farmers and reward our competitors with market share and have no effect on our foreign policy. 
   The administration has moved in this regard. We have bipartisan support for sanctions reform, but we still cannot use the USDA export programs in regard to making those sales. 
   Again, the cause for these low prices is not the 1996 farm bill. Quite the contrary, under Freedom to Farm--and I want everybody to listen to this--farmers in each State represented by most of the critics of the 1996 act have and are receiving more income assistance on average than they did under the old bill. 
   Under Freedom to Farm, farmers themselves--not Washington--have set aside their crop production and switched to other higher value crops. Nevertheless, we hear the mantra that we do not have a safety net. 
   Let me point out, for the past 3 years of the current farm bill we have provided transition payments--somehow or other in this debate the reality of transition payments over the 6-year life of the farm bill has been ignored. It is almost like they do not exist in the minds of the critics, but we have provided them. They are direct income support, and that amounts to approximately $23 billion to our farmers and ranchers for the past 3 years of the bill. 
   On the downside, we have also provided nearly $3 billion in what is called loan deficiency payments. That means the price goes below the loan rate. The loan rate was pretty low. We would never have imagined we would have to use the LDP program, but we had to--$3 billion. Recent estimates by the USDA are projecting possible LDPs totaling $8 billion this year. 
   These numbers total to nearly $34.5 billion by the end of 1999, and they do not include the $6 billion in lost market payments and disaster relief that were paid to farmers in 1998. 
   If you add in the $6 billion emergency package of last year, and the proposed assistance now being debated, the total is unprecedented--unprecedented--but even before these disaster payments you still had more income under the current farm bill than 
   farmers would have received under the old one, under the 5-year average. So from that standpoint, I do think we have a safety net. 
   In the past 3 years in Minnesota, for the benefit of my dear friend and colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm averaged $136 million more in total payments compared to the state average under the old bill. 
   In South Dakota, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm averaged for the past 3 years was $58 million more than the state average under the old bill. 
   In North Dakota--Senator DORGAN and Senator CONRAD are two Members who fight for their farmers and believe very passionately that we must address this problem--$15 million more; in Nebraska, $109 million more; and in Iowa, the safety net for farmers under Freedom to Farm in the last 3 years provided $162 million more than the previous bill. 
   Is it enough in regard to the problems we face that are unprecedented? Is it enough for the northern prairie States with border problems and wheat scab and weather you can't believe? I do not know. That is for those Senators and those farmers to determine. But there has been a significant increase in that direct income assistance to those producers. 
   Finally, for those who like roosters at the dawn and coyotes at dusk, crow and howl that we have ripped the rug out from underneath our farmers and the safety net, let me point out that during the first 3 years of Freedom to Farm, the average amount of income assistance to hard-pressed farmers was higher in every one of the 50 States than the 5-year average for each State during the previous farm bill. Again, these higher 3-year averages do not include emergency assistance that producers received through the structure of the Freedom to Farm Act that farmers received last year and they will receive this year when we finally get to the determination of whatever emergency package we should pass. 
   In making these statements, let me urge my colleagues to do their homework. Take time to read an assessment of the 1996 Farm Act by the Coalition for Competitive Food in the Agriculture System, published this June. In brief, the summary concluded the act did not cause the low commodity prices--I mentioned the two causes--supported the underlying health of the farm economy, and has provided a strong safety net--yes, buttressed by the emergency legislation--and, one of the biggest conclusions, forces U.S. competitors to adjust to the world market.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, most of the critics of the current act have recommended that we rewrite the farm bill, and I think most, at least--and I don't want to be too specific here because I am not sure--have indicated they would like a return to set-aside programs and higher loan rates and farmer-owned reserves, basically a return to the old farm bill. They say we need to do it so we can control production and increase the price of our commodities. Lord knows, I would like to try anything, almost, to increase the price of our commodities. 
   My question is this: How do we convince our competitors to follow suit? Past history shows us that when we reduce our acreages, our competitors do not follow suit. World stocks are not reduced. They increase their production by more than we reduce ours. There is no clearer example than during the 5-year period from 1982 to 1988 when the United States harvested 12 million fewer acres of soybeans and, during the same period, Argentina and Brazil increased their production by 14 million acres. Guess which countries are now the largest competitors of the United States in the soybean market. 
   Critics will also claim that plantings and stocks have increased and prices have plummeted because our farmers were allowed to plant fence row to fence row. That is not true either. The United States was not the cause of increased world production. In 1996, farmers in the United States planted about 75 million acres of wheat. Under Freedom to Farm, that fell to 70 million in 1997, 65 million acres in 1998. That is almost a 14-percent drop in wheat acreage. The farmer made that decision, not somebody in Washington, a voluntary set-aside. It was a paid diversion because he got the AMTA payment. USDA projections are an additional decrease this year of another 9 percent. That is a voluntary farmer set-aside, not a government mandated set-aside. 
   If U.S. wheat farmers planted less wheat, where did the record crops come from? We have been blessed with near perfect growing conditions in most of wheat country. The average farmer's yield went from 36 bushels an acre to 43 last year, 47 this year. Once again, the American farmer's record of productivity is simply amazing. I don't know of any farm bill that has ever been able to control production in other countries, or the weather, or growing conditions. I don't think even our friends across the aisle who are most critical would propose trying to limit the farmer's yield. 
   Still despite these facts, the naysayers say we must control production and raise loan rates. Raising loan rates will only increase or prolong the excess levels of crops in storage and on the market and actually result in lower prices down the road. Excess stocks will depress prices. Do we then extend the loan rate or raise it, leading to an endless cycle, leading to a return to planting requirements and Washington telling farmers to set aside ground to control production and limit the budgetary costs? 
   How do higher loan rates help producers who have suffered crop failures and have no crop underneath the loan? We had low prices in the mid-1980s. As a matter of fact, in 1985, and, it seems to me, in 1986, we spent almost $25.9 billion. We tried PIK and Roll; we tried certificates; we tried set-asides. We tried everything under the sun. We passed the 1985 act dealing with unprecedented world conditions. So we tried that. We had the higher loan rates. 
   It is one thing to propose a new farm program, albeit we haven't seen anything too specific. But how do you pay for the budget cost, notwithstanding the emergency declaration of this legislation, which I think is appropriate? There was no request from the President, after 3 years of complaining, no request from Secretary Glickman for additional funding. It seems to me it is one thing to propose changes in the farm bill in the form of increased loan rates, however you want to change it--or, as the President says, we just need a better farm bill--and another to 
   propose how we pay for it. 
   The reason I am bringing this up is, I think we need a little truth in budgeting, aside from the proposed emergency legislation that we need. Do the advocates of change pay for the new program, set-asides, and increased loan rates or whatever it is in regards to the new farm program by taking away the transition payments now provided to farmers under Freedom to Farm? Will farmers willingly give up the transition payments, direct income assistance, and go back to the days of standing in line at the Farm Service Agency, filling out the forms and the paperwork, and set aside 20 percent or more of their acreage? 
   What do we tell farmers who have on their own made historic planting changes from primary crops in the past to crops of higher value--oil seeds, sorghum, dry peas, navy beans, soybeans, and, yes, cotton? Under Freedom to Farm, I tell my distinguished friend and colleague from Mississippi, in the heart of cotton country, we have 40,000 acres in Kansas that are now in cotton production. When Steve Foster wrote the song ``Those Old Cotton Fields Back Home,'' he was talking about Kansas. We have the most cost-efficient cotton in the world because the temperatures are so low, you don't have to use pesticides on the insects. None of that would have happened  without the flexibility in regards to the new farm bill. 
   The reduction in wheat acreage going to other crops has been dramatic in 1997 to 1998: 15 percent down in North Dakota, 15.5 percent in South Dakota; 18 percent in Kansas; 18 percent in Minnesota; 15 percent in Texas. These are farmer-made decisions, and the changes in American agriculture have exceeded all expectations. Farmers have switched because it made economic sense. 
   The plain and simple and sometimes painful truth is that all U.S. producers are no longer the most efficient producers of certain crops, now wheat, in the world. That is true of other crops. But if you give the farmer the proper research and the proper export tools and the proper precision agriculture tools and the proverbial so-called level and fair trading field--which does not exist right now--he can be. 
   But we must also have the flexibility and the freedom to respond to market signals. So instead of looking back to the failed policies of the past, I think we must look to a long-term agenda for the future that allows our farmers and ranchers to be successful. That agenda includes most of what was promised during the passage of the Freedom to Farm Act--promises, promises, promises. I held up this ledger. I had two of them. On one side it said, if we go to a market-oriented farm program, these are the things we will have to do to complement it in order that it may work. And we listed them. That was the other side of the ledger. 
   Unfortunately, I am sad to say that those promises have not been kept by either side of the aisle. If I get a little thin skinned in regards to all the criticism in regards to the act that we put together, I am more than a little unhappy in regards to the Republican and Democrat leadership and the lack of progress on things we promised that would complement Freedom to Farm, things that attract bipartisan support from all of us who are privileged to represent agriculture. 
   I am talking about an aggressive and consistent trade policy, fast track legislation, sanctions reform with authority to use USDA export programs, a strategy for WTO negotiations that puts agriculture first, a renewed effort to complete the trade breakthrough we had with China. I am talking about tax legislation. Some of it is in the tax bill. Unfortunately, we have a political fussing and feuding exercise, and some of these will not actually take place--100-percent self-employed health insurance deductibility, farm savings accounts. If we had farm savings accounts, this situation would be tough but it wouldn't be grim. 
   Capital gains and estate tax reform. I am talking about crop insurance reform. Senator KERREY and I have what I think is a very good crop insurance bill. I am talking about regulatory reform and about commonsense management of the Food Quality Protection Act. And, yes, I am talking about reasonable emergency assistance to provide income assistance due to the unprecedented record crops, EU subsidies, world depression of the export markets. And that brings us to the two proposals we have before us today. 
   Let me point out that, given the dynamic change in agriculture and world markets, no farm bill has ever been perfect or set in stone. That has been the case with the seven farm bills I have been directly involved with since I have had the privilege--seven of them. That statement is buttressed by the fact that, in the last 10 years, there have been no less than 13 emergency supplementals or disaster bills. Given the current drought in the Atlantic States and our price and cash flow problems due to the unprecedented developments I have already discussed, there are going to be 14. It is just what form it will take. But it seems to me we should not be in the business of spending more than is necessary, or making changes in farm program policy that will be market disruptive, or that will lead us back down the road to command and control agriculture in Washington. That, of course, depends on your definition. 
   There are several questions, or concerns, I have in regard to the emergency assistance package introduced by my friend, Senator HARKIN, and my friend from Mississippi, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee. The income loss assistance that has been proposed by Senator HARKIN, as I understand it, has a fixed amount of $6.4 billion made available. But it sets up a parallel supplemental loan deficiency payment system with a separate $40,000 payment. It provides that payments be made to producers with failed acreage, or acreage prevented from plantings, based on actual production history, and provides for advance payments to producers as soon as possible. And we want that. 
   I think we are headed toward a train wreck in regard to the payment limitation. One of the major concerns among farmers is the $75,000 payment limitation on an existing $7 billion to $8 billion worth of loan deficiency payments. Now we are trying to cram an additional $6.4 billion through a payment limitation half that size, and it seems to me we are going to have some real problems. Per unit payments will go up, and a smaller and smaller percentage of production will be covered. 
   Now, if this new payment form is supposed to go to those who produce, it is ironic that we are going to see 85 percent of the producers who produce the field crops shortchanged to bulk up payments to those that really create 15 percent of the crops. This isn't the big producer/small producer argument. I think the penalty will reach down to the medium-size commercial farmer, while the part-timer with a job in town may reap a windfall. 
   Discretion to the Secretary. Last year's disaster program was predicated on giving the Secretary maximum discretion to use his expertise to create a fair and speedy program. The delivery of disaster payments was delayed for 8 months. This program relies even more heavily on the Secretary. I hope that Secretary Glickman has magic in the way he can get the payments out. 
   The Secretary must take a fixed amount of money and fairly divide it among producers; guess in August the total production of a variety of crops for the year; determine which producers will have failed acres and determine their actual production history; calculate how a $40,000 payment limit will affect the division of the funds; create a per bushel, pound, or hundredweight payment for crops not yet harvested; determine how to make advanced payments; and he must prorate payments when and if all the guesses happen to turn out to be wrong. 
   Last year, with a far simpler task, the Secretary gave up and waited until June to make the payments. Let me point out that 
   transition payments under the AMTA supplemental plan went out in 10 days. They were delivered to producers in 10 days. Direct income assistance: A farmer could take the check and show it to his banker and say: I can make it through the next year. 
   WTO limits. Almost unnoticed in the farm crisis is the rapid increase in payments made to producers. The United States is rapidly approaching the limit allowed in the treaty for payments defined in something called the amber box as trade distorting. All payments associated with commodity loans, including LDPs, are counted in the amber box. They are not counted in the AMTA box if you provide farmers direct assistance due to unprecedented things. That will nearly double LDPs in 2000 and may very well put us over the limit, making it very difficult for the President to sign a bill that would violate the Uruguay Round agreement. 
   My question is: What is the White House position on the Harkin amendment as it applies to payments to farmers through the loan deficiency payment program, as opposed to the AMTA payments? I have other questions, too. 
   I have indicated to my colleague from Minnesota that I would not take too long, and I have already done that. I apologize to him. Again, we know the money can be distributed through the AMTA system in as little as 10 days.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, the most important thing is to get this emergency assistance out to farmers as fast as we can and keep it within a realm that is at least reasonable in regard to the budget and in a way the farmer can get the  assistance. We can do that in 10 days by the system that is proposed by the Senator from Mississippi. 
   I have already mentioned the payment limitation concern. I must say, if you look at the Harkin amendment, it not only deals with emergency assistance--and Senator HARKIN truly believes we ought to rewrite the farm bill, and he is doing that in regard to his amendment. 
   We have peanuts, dairy payments, and livestock payments; and I am assuming most of it would go to the hog producers, but we means test that again. We have set-aside authority and we have disaster funding, where we set aside another $600 million. We backfill the 1998 disaster assistance. Then we have money to establish a permanent program for land that has been flooded for continuous years. With all due respect to my colleagues from the Northern Plains, we have a name for a land in Kansas that has been covered with water for 3 years; it is called a lake. 
   We have millions for tobacco producers. My golly, are we going back to 1982 when we all decided in the House of Representatives--and we were all there at that time--we were going to get the Government out of subsidizing tobacco farmers? Are we back to that? Be careful what you ask for. So we have included tobacco in this bill. I am not making any aspersions on the hard-hit tobacco producers, but, folks, that is not PC. I am not sure about that one. And then we have mandatory price reporting, something I have supported in the Agriculture Committee, with some changes made by Senator KERREY. But we are approving funding for legislation and we haven't even marked it up yet. 
   Then we have mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat and vegetables. Right now, we have a tremendous problem with the European Union and all countries in Europe on GMOs, genetically modified organisms. People in white coats are descending upon the fields over in Great Britain, ripping up the GMO crops. The problem is, they made a mistake and ripped up the wrong crop. We ought to go to sound science and work out these problems, and we are trying to do that. 
   In regard to the trade problems we have--which Secretary Glickman talks about and most aggies are worried about--we are going to put this in country-of-origin labeling on top of that issue. I don't think it has really been proven that our producers will increase prices and that it will result in trade retaliations. 
   We have $200 million for a short-term set-aside. I don't want to go back to set-asides; I think that would be counterproductive. Some of these provisions I have mentioned are also in the provision introduced by my dear friend and colleague, the Senator from Mississippi. 
   I think, again, we ought to be providing emergency assistance to farmers and not be writing the farm bill but proceeding to work together in a bipartisan way, if we possibly can, to address the real reasons as to why we have these low commodity prices. 
   When this comes up this afternoon, I urge Members to pay attention. A lot of this gets very convoluted and very technical, I know, in regard to farm program policy. But it would be my desire that Members look very closely at this in regard to the budget implications and things that can go bump in the night--the law of unattended effects--down the road that I don't think we want to experience in farm country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. A week ago yesterday, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL and I took the opportunity to travel about 5 miles from Skopje, Macedonia, to a scrub pine-covered hill that was overlooking the Skopje Airport and the valley that leads to Kosovo. 
   On the way, we saw the U.S. troops, primarily the Army, and then the British, Germans, and the French, all part of the NATO command we now call KFOR, making the preparations for ground entry into Kosovo. 
   Beyond those encampments, the dusty road led to some high ground. As we topped the hill, about 100 yards into the scrub pine were the members of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Force led by Col. Kenneth Glueck and his XO Lt. Col. Bob Taylor. 
   Some 1,900 marines and 186 vehicles were deploying into Kosovo. Just a few days earlier, these men and women were aboard ship in an Italian port as members of the Marine Expeditionary Unit. Despite all of the delay in regard to the bureaucratic problems--road and transportation snafus and unfriendly but rather benign protests by some demonstrators in Greece--the marines were deployed and the command post was up and running when the advance units were reporting in. 
   With great respect for our allies, while their units were conducting maintenance and they were relaxing prior to moving out, the marines had already conducted 2 days of training. 
   In recent weeks, there has been much discussion and criticism about the use of ground troops in the Balkans. The point has always been made that, simply given the opposition by NATO countries and the administration to the use of ground troops and the lack of contingency planning, it would take months to put together any contingency plans, the necessary unified command and control, supply lines and battle plans--it would take months. 
   No need to worry. When the order was given, your Navy-Marine Corps team, a true force in readiness, was there. They were deployed in days--not weeks or months. 
   I asked Col. Glueck and Lt. Col. Taylor why the marines chose the high ground miles away from the U.S. and allied forces. He responded:  
   Well, sir, we arrived at 2300, set up our command post and staging base, secured the area, and were ready to go by morning. We just didn't want to lose our edge.  
   And they haven't. Today those marines are keeping a difficult peace. They are serving as protectors, as police, as judge, as jury, as peacekeepers, and as possible targets. Along with the 82nd Airborne, they are doing an outstanding job. They were doing their best in the Balkan briar patch. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I had the privilege of visiting with individual marines and found their dedication and morale was second to none. It was a real ``battery charger'' for me. As a result, we both stood taller that day. 
   In a day and age when our military is stressed and strained and hollow in parts, with recruiting and retention reaching alarming levels--so serious, by the way, that the President had to mandate a stop loss order, meaning those on active duty who are scheduled to leave active duty cannot--and with serious problems all throughout our military, asking a military that has been cut by one-third to do more in 93 nations around the world, not to mention the problems in health care, in the quality of life, personnel tempo and operations tempo, readiness, modernization and procurement, mission quality, and all the rest, how on Earth can the U.S. Marine Corps meet its recruiting and retention goals and perform so well in the field? 
   I will tell you how. It is called leadership, and it is called standards. Those standards, those values, are set by the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps: Honor, courage, and commitment. They have not changed, and they will not change. 
   Let me state why, with the following quote: 
   To Marines, Honor, Courage and Commitment are not simply words or a bumper sticker slogan. They reflect our deepest convictions and dramatically shape everything that we do. We imbue Marines with our core values from their first moments in the Corps because we know that Marines, not weapons, win battles. 
   As an institution, we have had to fight hard to maintain our standards. To some, they may seem old-fashioned, out of step with society, or perhaps even extremist, but we know that our high standards are the lifeblood of the Corps, so we have held the line!  
   In this regard, what individual Marines are doing everyday counts far more than anything that is done in Washington. The standards of our Corps are not simply maintained by generals, colonels, and sergeants major, but, far more importantly, by leaders throughout the Corps, at every level. The Marine conviction that Semper Fidelis is a way of life, not just a motto, speaks powerfully and unites us.  
   In typical fashion, the Marine who spoke those words, gave credit to all Marines for the accomplishments achieved by the Marine Corps these past few years while at the same time providing the leadership that made those accomplishments possible. I am speaking of the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps who is retiring after four years of outstanding service, General Charles C. Krukak, a Marine's Marine. 
   It is both an honor and a personal privilege to join Majority Leader LOTT, Senator BURNS of Montana, and other senators as we pay tribute and say thanks and well done to Chuck Krulak. 
   My colleagues have already spoken to General Krulak's outstanding record, his personal sacrifice, bravery, combat record, accomplishments. A modest, self effacing man, the last thing Chuck Krulak would want is personal tribute, no matter how well deserved. Simply put, the biography of achievement of one Charles C. Krulak is synonymous with honor, courage, and commitment. 
   A few personal observations however, for the Record. The latest buzz word in military tactics is called ``asymmetrical warfare''. 
   Quoting from retired army colonel Ralph Peters, the provocative author of the book, ``Fighting for the Future, Will America Triumph'':  
   Around the world, American soldiers, American interests and American citizens face violent men who do not play by the time-honored rules of warfare. These new enemies are warlords, terrorists, charismatic demagogues, international criminals--and the militaries of rogue states. Driven by hatred, greed, and rage, the weapons they use range from knives and bombs to computers and weapons of mass destruction. They fight in urban landscapes and information jungles--not on the neatly contained battlefields of yesterday.  
   Simply put, Mr. President, as Kosovo will prove--in my personal opinion--all too often the United States is fighting today's wars with yesterday's tactics. 
   The service chief who has seen this emerging threat with foresight, clarity, and resolve has been General Krulak. A student of history and military tactics and strategy, a veteran of a limited, political war of gradualism where specific mission was difficult to define, Chuck Krulak has literally shaped the U.S. Marine Corps to meet these future challenges. In this regard, the Commandant has provided members of the Armed Service Committees and those within our military schools and think tanks valuable insight and leadership. His 45 minute presentation, starting with the mistakes the Romans made in 9 AD and ending with modern day threats should be required reading for all who care about out national security and individual freedom. 
   General Krulak has also enabled the Marine Corps to be on the cutting edge of consequence management regarding weapons of mass destruction--especially in regard to the very real dangers of biological contamination whether the situation be on the battlefield or resulting from a terrorist attack. 
   Majority Leader LOTT stressed in his remarks how much he valued General Krulak's candor and honesty. In my own case, coming from the House to the Senate, my tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee has been synonymous with General Krulak's service as Commandant of the Marine Corps. 
   Throughout this time, despite budget restrictions, difficult policy debates and quite frankly a time when the administration and the Congress have asked our military to do more with less, the one thing Chuck Krulak provided our committee and our Marines was honesty. No hedging, no fence straddling, no saluting one way and hunkering down in the weeds when the going got tough the other. No Sir! General Krulak told it just exactly like it is. The Congress, the President, our country and especially our Marines are owed that. And, we owe Chuck Krulak as we work to restore and strengthen our nation's fighting forces. 
   My father, Wes Roberts, was privileged to serve in the Marine Corps and saw action on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. As it turned out, one of men he has honored to know on a personal basis was the historic and legendary Commandant of that time, ``Lem'' Shepherd. 
   When I joined the Corps and was a ``shave-tail'' lieutenant serving in the Marine Education Center in Quantico, it was my good fortune to serve with General Oscar Peatross, the hero of the Makin Island Raid and then Lt. Col. and later Commandant Robert ``Bob'' Barrow as the Marines published what I believe to be the first modern-day anti-guerrilla warfare manual in 1959. 
   The commanding general at Marine Corp Schools and the driving force behind the change in tactics and strategy within the Corps at that time was General Victor ``Brute'' Krulak, our current Commandant's father. 
   I am always amazed and humbled at the good fortune that life can bring us. I can assure you that, never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined I would have the privilege of serving in this body as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and having the honor of working with our Commandant, the son of the man I served under some 40 years ago--and on the very same challenges. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have two speeches by General Krulak, his ``Farewell to the Corp'' within the Marine Corps Gazette, and remarks he made for the Pepperdine University Convocation Series last October, printed in the the RECORD.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, in those remarks, Chuck Krulak talked about character and individual responsibility as it applies to today's America and all of the obligations and challenges that we face today. Character; character--as usual, General Charles C. Krulak simply told the truth. We will be a better nation if we but heed his advice. 
   Semper Fidelis Commandant Krulak and thank you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1233, the fiscal year 2000 agriculture appropriations bill. I commend Senator COCHRAN  and Senator KOHL for bringing forward what I believe is a solid bill to fund our most important programs in agriculture and provide continued benefits to rural America. This has been no easy task. With the tight budget caps that are in place, preparing this bill was a very difficult task, and I applaud the Senator for his hard work in this area. 
   Let me just say a word about the Senator from Mississippi in this regard. There is a routine procedure in this body and that is to thank the hard-working chairmen of our Senate committees, and, of course, their ranking members, for their hard work in bringing important legislation to the floor. That practice is certainly appropriate in regard to the Senators who have worked to bring this bill to our consideration, including the chairman, as I have indicated, and the distinguished ranking member from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL. But I would like to offer three cheers and a ``well done'' to Senator COCHRAN. 
   If there is a Senator who I think everyone would agree is the epitome of a Southern gentleman and a Senator who goes about his work with dignity and decorum and truly still gets things done, that Senator is Senator COCHRAN. Here we are in the midst of all sorts of problems and challenges in agriculture today, unprecedented situations, really, what with the world depression that is still hindering our markets, unfair trading practices by our competitors, record world production that has caused market declines in virtually every commodity, trade policy that is hampered by all sorts of challenges, the need for sanctions reform, crop insurance reform, and tax policy changes and reform. The list goes on, as has been mentioned by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, including the need for emergency assistance under the current farm bill. We are going to be debating all this and the answers individual Senators will bring to this debate and to this legislation. But through it all we will have the steady hand of Senator COCHRAN and his calm and reasoned and experienced leadership. I thank the Senator for the job he has done for our farmers and ranchers, the men and women of rural America who work so hard to feed our Nation and a troubled and hungry world. 
   Chairman COCHRAN has presented a bill that really freezes the discretionary spending at the fiscal 1999 level, while still managing to provide increased funding in several areas, including agriculture research, the staffing for the farm service agencies, and the Food Safety Inspection Service. I mention the freeze in particular because what we would like to do, as we consider the 13 major appropriations bills, as we are going through that process, is stick to the budget as best as we possibly can. Obviously, if we do that, interest rates will remain low. Hopefully, we will control inflation, because interest rates are of tremendous importance to the farmer and rancher, and, for that matter, every business person in America. 
   Investing in agriculture research, as Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL have done, is perhaps one of the most important investments we can make as a nation. Today our farmers and ranchers actually produce more food to feed more people on less land--on less land--than ever before. 
   That is a modern day miracle, and it is a miracle in no short part because of agriculture research. 
   Ag research has played a major role in increasing the productivity of our Nation's farms in the past century. The projections indicate that as the world's population continues to grow in the next 50 years, the world understandably will have to dramatically increase its agriculture production and its food output. The United States will be the leader in this quest to feed, as I have indicated before, a troubled and hungry world with a growing population, but we are not going to be successful without this continued commitment to agriculture research funding. The Senators have done that in regard to their subcommittee work, and it is now before the Senate for our consideration. 
   I also thank Senator COCHRAN for his efforts to increase funding for the Farm Service Agency staff. I know any increased funding for any Government program or Government agency staff is not very popular in Washington. I have often had my own concerns with such increases. I assure my colleagues that this increased funding is desperately needed. 
   Many county farm service agencies--that is the old ASCS--have been swamped by the number of loan deficiency payment and USDA lending requests they have had to address. As a matter of fact, when we considered the farm bill of 1996, I do not think any of us would have imagined the vulnerability of the Farm Service Agency or the demands on the Farm Service Agency as a result of the LDP payments that came into play. Despite the best efforts of our county offices to serve our producers in a timely and efficient manner, the staffing necessary to accomplish this goal simply has not been up to the level needed to provide the quality of service that our producers expect. 
   I also thank the chairman and the ranking member for increases in the FSIS budget. That is an acronym which stands for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. A safe food supply is essential, and our consumers demand it. As my colleagues know, my State of Kansas is one of the largest beef producers in the world, with a large number of packing operations as well. With a continued shortage of inspectors in the Topeka district, I am concerned, and I hope and expect the Secretary of Agriculture to address these deficiencies--I know he will--through this increased funding. I also ask him to contact the Congress and inform us of any continued shortfalls that may be occurring. 
   Before I close, I want to address what I know is also a very critical concern of many of my colleagues, and that is the tough times we are experiencing throughout rural America. Every farm organization, every commodity group, every producer one visits with obviously tells the same story. I thank Senator COCHRAN for making it very clear we are going to work with the President and we are going to work in a bipartisan fashion--we have already had several meetings since the first of the year--to try to address this. 
   When the President does inform the Congress, along with the help of Secretary Glickman and others, on what kind of an additional package is necessary and some of the specifics as the crops are harvested, we will be more than willing to take a hard look at this need as harvest season moves along. We did last year. The process, as the Senator has pointed out, was a little backward in regard to how we approached that. Let's do the right thing in regard to the President making his recommendation 
   and working with us and we will work with him. 
   I agree with Senator COCHRAN; prior to the President's request, we can do a lot of talking about it, and we have for the last several years, but I believe that would be premature. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, my good friend and colleague from Kansas, was quoted in the press last week as saying it would be preferable to go in that direction and it was too early to determine the size of any package that may be needed. 
   In the meantime, I am committed, as a member of the authorizing committee, the Senate Agriculture Committee, to pursuing the long-term goals needed to ensure the long-term financial viability of our farmers and ranchers. Senator COCHRAN and others have talked at length in this Chamber about these, about the crucial needs--expanded export markets, sanctions reform, embargo policies, tax reform, regulatory relief, crop insurance reform--all of the things we talked about, by the way, when we were trying to put together the 1996 farm bill. 
   There was a list. There was a ledger, as a matter of fact. In those days, I had the privilege of being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee as we put that together. We said: Look, if we go to a more market-oriented farm policy--we all wanted that and we wanted producer flexibility to meet the producer's individual needs, to restore the decisionmaking back to the farm level as opposed to Washington--we can do that but only in a component package of other things we need to do. 
   Quite frankly, I must tell my colleagues that we, and I am using the editorial we--Democrats, Republicans, the administration, the Senate and the House--we have not done that. We have not gone down that list that I and others put on the ledger. There is no pride  of authorship here. We need to do it now. Had we done it then and 2 years ago, I do not think the situation would be nearly as grave throughout our rural areas. Let's get cracking on these challenges, as well as meeting the crucial spending needs or the appropriation needs in regard to U.S. agriculture. 
   I mentioned expanded export markets, sanctions reform, tax reform, regulatory relief--all of that. We need to pass this legislation and move to a very quick conference with the House. The programs funded in this legislation are too important to be delayed. We need action on them. 
   I commend, again, Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for their fine efforts on this legislation under very difficult funding circumstances. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation to quick passage and then working with my colleagues on the other policy changes I have mentioned, and, yes, I know at the end of harvest, we will work with the President, we will work with everybody on that side of the aisle to put together a reasonable program of relief because we have yet to see the relief in our markets. This has been going on now for 2 years. 
   Again, I thank Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for their efforts. I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of the Senate the retirement of Dr. John F. McCarthy, Vice President, Global Scientific and Regulatory Affairs, for the American Crop Protection Association. He is retiring after 13 years of service with ACPA where he served as the chief advisor on scientific and technical matters. He was named Vice President in 1988. 
   Prior to joining the American Crop Protection Association, Dr. McCarthy spent 23 years with the Agricultural Chemicals Group of FMC Corporation. At FMC he was involved in all aspects of agricultural chemicals research and development, starting as a synthesis chemist and rising to the position of Director of Product Development and Registrations. 
   John testified many times before the House Agriculture Committee when I served as chairman. He was always available to provide technical expertise when our Committee was considering amendments to FIFRA. He also testified in the Senate answering endless questions about difficult scientific and policy issues. John was always able to put the issues in perspective and kept the protection of public health at the forefront of his presentation. His retirement will leave a void in the agricultural crop protection community which can not be easily filled. 
   He received his B.S. degree in Pharmacy from the Albany College of Pharmacy in 1958 and his Ph.D in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin in 1962. Previous to joining FMC, he did research at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. 
   John is very family oriented and his wife, Ann, should also be recognized for her willingness to loan John to us for all these years. Without her commitment and understanding, those long hours and late evenings would not have been possible. Please join me in wishing John the best for a well deserved and fulfilling retirement.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, housed at Fort Leavenworth's Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL), the Digital Information Technology Test Bed (DITT) established the pilot test bed and core capabilities for the Army's University After Next (UAN) and the Joint and Army Virtual Research Library (VRL). In May 1997, the Office of Secretary of Defense designated the DITT as the DoD functional prototype to conduct concept exploration, operational prototyping, and full requirements definition for multimedia research libraries (multimedia national and tactical imagery) in support of technology-assisted learning, intelligence analysis, C2, and operational decision making. DITT systems can further support warfighting capabilities by fielding innovative systems and methods to store, retrieve, declassify, and destroy DoD-held data. In FY 1999, Congress authorized and appropriate $3.5 million for the DITT program. However, continued funding is needed in FY 2000 and I ask colleagues' support for adding $3 million to the Army FY 2000 budget specifically for the DITT program.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator. The NCI was intended to be a joint program with the Russian government. At one point the Russians said that they would provide $30 million to the NCI. Due to the current economic crisis in Russia, any Russian assistance to the NCI program will be in the form of in-kind contributions, such as labor and buildings. The NCI has the potential to provide the Russian government with significant economic benefit. According to the Department of Energy, the benefit to the United States is to have the Russian government close or dismantle the nuclear weapons complexes in those ten cities. However, the Russian government has not agreed to close or dismantle weapons-related facilities in these cities in exchange for United States' assistance. In the absence of such a Russian agreement, this initiative could result in great financial benefit for the Russians without any reduction in Russian weapons capability. The provision in question requires that, as a prerequisite for U.S. funding for the Nuclear Cities Initiative, the Russian government agree to close facilities engaged in work on weapons of mass destruction. 
   I assure the Senator from New Mexico that it is not the intention behind this provision to result in the termination of this program. Rather, it is to secure a commitment from the Russian government to do more to support the nonproliferation goals of the NCI effort. It is important to ensure that the Russians participate in the implementation of this program in an equitable way. I believe that the requirement for an agreement will ensure that the Russians participate equitably through in-kind contributions and through the closure of weapons of mass destruction facilities. I believe the provision contained in this bill will afford benefits to the U.S. national security and will assure that the program is on firm footing in the foreseeable future. I look forward to working with Senator BINGAMAN in overseeing the implementation of the Nuclear Cities Initiative.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman, and I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer for taking my place while I make these comments. 
   Mr. President, I rise to again state my opposition to the BRAC amendment as it is proposed. Let's get it clear. I understand that my colleagues who are offering this amendment are very sincere in their efforts to address the problem of an excess infrastructure, certainly within the Department of Defense. 
   Let me be absolutely clear that I agree with the assertion that there is  excess infrastructure. I have no quarrel with that. But let me be equally clear that until I am confident we can focus the BRAC where there is excess infrastructure and until we can ensure that any savings from such a BRAC--a lot has been said about the savings--will go toward modernization, or readiness, or procurement, as opposed to funding the numerous expeditions this administration continues to assign our military, such as Bosnia and Kosovo, I can't support any additional rounds of BRAC at this time. 
   Let me explain in a little bit more detail. ``They'' all understand that there is too much infrastructure for the current force strength. ``They'' know they need to act to reduce it. But the political costs are too high, and ``they'' know the blame for not having another BRAC can be easily passed off to others. We heard a lot of talk about ``they'' from the proponents of BRAC. Unfortunately, the readiness of our Armed Forces suffers because ``they'' are unwilling to act. I would like to get to the definition of who ``they'' are. 
   Most people who follow the excess military infrastructure issue--the BRAC issue, if you will--would say that ``they'' are the U.S. Congress. Senator after Senator has come to the floor with not really arms waving, but with some pretty tough commentary, pointing the finger at the Congress as being ``they.'' However, let me also point out that a strong case can be made that ``they'' are also the civilian and uniformed leadership of the Department of Defense. 
   I am not trying to pick on anybody. I just want to share the responsibility in a fair way. Of course the Congress must approve the additional funds of BRAC, and therefore the responsibility is clearly on the shoulders of the Senate and the House. I accept that responsibility. The distinguished Presiding Officer does as well. Every Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the comparable committee in the House does as well. But the leadership of DOD has not shouldered the responsibility, in my personal opinion, to adequately prepare for future BRAC rounds. They could, by requiring each service to develop a prioritized listing of bases and facilities that are in excess, or the generic description of same, more especially in regards to the mission of the base. 
   I know what they are going to say. Their defense is such as, that would be impossible because of the politics of it; it would bias any future BRAC rounds, and therefore they should not be done until a BRAC is authorized. 
   By ``they'' I am talking about the DOD. ``They'' in this particular instance further state that it would be impractical to categorize the facilities by mission since most facilities are multifunctional, and therefore any future BRAC should, as in theory they have in the past, include all military facilities regarding the BRAC criteria. 
   If we are talking about BRAC, everybody is going to be on the same criteria. Everybody is on the table. 
   Of course, most bases and facilities are multifunctional. After all, they all train, they all have administrative functions, they all have public works tasks, but they all have a clear, primary mission. 
   Additionally, it is a bit disingenuous for the Department of Defense to say that all bases would be included, all are on the chopping block for consideration in any future BRAC round. That is rather disingenuous it seems to me, even if, for example, the service academies would be on the table, or the Norfolk Naval Base, or Andrews Air Force Base, or Fort Hood, or Camp Pendleton were on the table for BRAC consideration. That is not reasonable. That is not going to happen. It is not reasonable to expect that those, or other key facilities where we must have a primary mission, would be seriously considered for closure or for realignment. 
   It is not unreasonable to expect that a similar listing of definable excess capacity could and should be developed and be the focus of future reductions of infrastructure rather than, as I have said, before the ``everything is on the table'' approach in regard to BRAC. 
   Many of my colleagues have heard me voice my concern over what I call ``BRAC purgatory.'' That is, quite simply, what every city in America with a military facility goes through every time a BRAC round is mentioned. What that means in real terms is that the city or the community involved spends a lot of money from their very limited budget to hire so-called ``experts'' or ``consultants'' to help to really protect their base from any future BRAC round. 
   If we can focus BRAC on the primary mission of bases and generically define what we need, and what we don't need, we will spare many communities from ``BRAC purgatory.'' We will let them off the BRAC hook if their facility is not on the excess infrastructure list. We are going to save a lot of communities from ``BRAC purgatory,'' and we are going to save a lot of headaches and a lot of money. 
   I am equally concerned that the Department has failed to develop a strategy for the next round of BRAC. Let me emphasize ``strategy.'' You just can't go to a BRAC and put bases on the chopping block. A specific infrastructure strategy is required for at least three reasons. 
   First, as the military approaches the optimum infrastructure, great care is going to have to be made. It will be required to prevent the cutting of the essential infrastructures. 
   Second, since the military missions and roles are changing --and, boy, are they changing; for example, the Air Force sees itself becoming an expeditionary force rather than a garrison force, and that is happening; the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps are all searching for a new mission and a new role--I think the Department of Defense-wide assessment of the types and the number and the location of the military facilities needed to support the national strategy must be developed. There must be a strategy there. 
   Third, both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel strongly recommended consolidation and joint basing for the military to optimize their capability in an atmosphere of reduced budgets and reduced force structure military environment. 
   In isolation, each of those three requirements represents a difficult, a complex, and a contentious undertaking within the military and the Department of Defense. However, when taken as a collective mandate to shape the future infrastructure needs of the military, such an important imperative cannot possibly be accomplished within the guidelines of just a simple BRAC. It seems to me that the Department of Defense has to have the courage and will to oversee the services and direct actions be taken that would set the correct approach to reducing our excessive infrastructure to match our future military strategy. They should do that--not a BRAC commission. 
   The third action that DOD must find the will to take is defining the savings associated with BRAC and establishing a way to funnel those moneys into readiness, modernization, or the procurement or quality-of-life programs. In the April 1998 Department of Defense report on BRAC, they admitted that, ``by their very nature, estimates of savings are subject to some uncertainty.'' That is probably the understatement of this debate. The Department further stated that, ``No audit trail, single document, or budget account exists for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC.'' 
   Let me repeat that. Senator after Senator has come to the floor and said: Look at the money we are going to save in regard to BRAC. Then they look at the problems with modernization, and procurement, and readiness. Yet no audit trail, no single document, no budget account exists for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC. However, they assured Congress that, ``The Department is committed to improve its estimates of costs and savings in future rounds of BRAC.'' ``Oh, we are going to get it right next time.'' 
   It seems to me it takes courage to solve that problem, and it takes a dedicated effort to set up the processes to track and direct the BRAC savings into the promised accounts. And it will take more than a ``trust me, it will be much better next time'' assurance before many Members of Congress will let the reported savings, the estimated savings, the reported savings of another round of BRAC simply remain unaccounted for, be lost in the 
   bookkeeping of the Department of Defense, or, in fact, if there are savings, if we can account for savings, they end up in such  missions as Kosovo or Bosnia--which have to be funded, by the way, and which we addressed in regard to emergency funding. 
   That is the proper way to fund the final act of courage on the part of the uniformed and civilian leadership of DOD--I use the word ``courage'' in quotes here--that directly impacts the future rounds of BRAC politics of the last round. 
   A lot has been said about this. I understand it. I am not going to rehash that today. But based on a recent memorandum from the Department of the Air Force, it seems to me there is some acquiescence to such pressure to not really carry out the BRAC action directed in the last round. BRAC is a hard sell in Congress under normal times and under the purest of motives. But when actions are taken that clearly disadvantage others and violate the BRAC process for political gain, BRAC is a ``no sell'' in Congress. 
   For the Department of Defense to simply say that all we need is for Congress to authorize additional rounds of BRAC is an easy way to avoid the responsibilities for actions that must be taken by the Department of Defense well in advance of any congressional action. 
   It seems to me the Department of Defense can go a long way to helping us in regard to the BRAC process if they simply develop the fortitude and the decisionmaking to start the process now to correctly and accurately shape and define the infrastructure--not to simply put everything on the table to save money but be required to support the military of the 21st century even if they risk pressure from the White House or Capitol Hill. Without such a strategy, I cannot support another BRAC round that has a poorly prepared and inadequately staffed approach to reducing the excess infrastructure. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote from my colleagues on this matter.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have had the privilege this year to serve as the first chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. I would like to recognize Senator WARNER, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for his vision and foresight in creating this subcommittee to deal with the nontraditional threats to U.S. national security. 
   The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities was established to provide oversight for the Department of Defense's efforts to counter new and emerging challenges to vital United States interests. Through a series of hearings and detailed oversight of budget accounts, the subcommittee highlighted: the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; terrorism directed at U.S. targets both at home and abroad; information warfare and the protection of our defense information infrastructure; and trafficking of illegal drugs. The subcommittee sought to identify the technology, operational concepts and capabilities we need to deter--and, if necessary--combat these perils. 
   I would like to briefly highlight the initiatives included in this bill to address the emerging threats to our national security: 
   Protection of our homeland and our critical information infrastructure are two of the most serious challenges facing our Nation today. In the area of counterterrorism, the bill before the Senate includes full funding for the five Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) teams requested by the administration, and an increase of $107 million to provide a total of 17 additional RAID teams in fiscal year 2000. We have further required the Department to establish a central transfer account for the Department's programs to combat terrorism to provide better visibility and accounting for this important effort. 
   We have included an Information Assurance Initiative to strengthen the Department's critical information infrastructure, enhance oversight and improve organizational structure. As a part of this initiative, we added $120 million above the President's budget request for programs to enhance our ability to combat cyber-attacks. In addition, this initiative will provide for a test to plan and conduct simulations, exercises and experiments against information warfare threats, and allow the Department to interact with civil and commmercial organizations in this important effort. The provision encourages the Secretary of Defense to strike an appropriate balance in addressing threats to the defense information infrastructure while at the same time recognizing that Department of Defense has a role to play in helping to protect critical infrastructure outside the DOD. 
   We have included a legislative package to strengthen the science and technology program. This legislation will ensure that since the science and technology program is threat-based and that investments are tied to future warfighting needs. The legislation is also aimed at promoting innovation in laboratories and improving the efficiency of RDT&E operations. The bill also includes a $170 million increase to the science and technology budget request. 
   And finally, in the area of nonproliferation, we have authorized over $718 million for programs to assist Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union destroy or control their weapons of mass destruction. However, it is important to note, this is an increase of $29.6 million over the fiscal year 1999 funding level. I would like to take a moment to share my thoughts on this issue. 
   I am very concerned about the findings of the recently released GAO report that the U.S. cost of funding the nuclear material storage facility in Mayak, Russia has increased from an original estimate of $275 million to $413 million. This Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) project may eventually have a price tag of $1 billion. These increased costs to the U.S. have occurred because Russia has failed to fund its share of the costs of this project. I also understand that the chemical weapons destruction facility will not be open until 2006, in part due to Russia's failure to provide the needed information about the chemical weapons to be destroyed.  
   The CTR program is becoming more and more one-sided. This program is also in the interest of the Russians. Matter of fact, much of the destruction of the Russian inventory, funded by the CTR program, enables Russia to meet its obligations under existing arms control treaties. 
   In addition, I am concerned with the daily press reports that the Russians are enhancing their military capabilities. For example: 
   Earlier this month, President Yeltsin reportedly ordered the Russian military to draw up plans for the development and use of tactical nuclear forces. 
   On May 4, The Russian Defense Minister threatened to reconsider Russian support for the revision of the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. 
   On April 16, the Duma unanimously adopted a resolution calling for increased defense budgets. 
   Although I have serious concerns about this program, we included an authorization for CTR at the budget request of $475.5 million, an increase of $35 million over the FY 99 level. However, before FY 2000 funds may be obligated we require the President to recertify that the Russians are foregoing any military modernization that exceeds legitimate defense requirements and are complying with relevant arms control agreements. The most recent certification by the Administration was completed before these numerous statements by Yeltsi and other Russian officials. 
   I am also concerned with the deficiencies in the management and oversight of the DOE programs in Russia--in particular, the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) and the Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI). If these programs are to succeed, we need to get past the implementation problems pointed out in the GAO report, in press reports, by our House colleagues, and by the Russians. In addition, the Russian economic crisis and lack of infrastructure are making these programs more difficult to manage. I am afraid if we do not exercise strong oversight now we are in danger of losing these programs. 
   I have proposed a number of initiatives that I believe will go a long way towards correcting the deficiencies in the management of the IPP program, establishing a framework for effective implementation and oversight of both programs, and ensuring that sufficient accountability exists. Further, I believe the U.S. nonproliferation goals and U.S. national security will be better served by these improvements. 
   Finally, I believe DoE should spend FY 2000 tightening up the implementation of IPP and NCI rather than broadening the program. Therefore, the committee authorized the IPP and NCI below the administration's request of $30 million for each program. The bill includes an authorization of $15 million for NCI and an authorization of $25 million for IPP, an increase of $2.5 million for each program over FY 99 levels. These are the only programs in the entire DoE nonproliferation budget that the committee authorized below the budget request. Overall, we authorized $266.8 million for DoE nonproliferation programs in the former Soviet Union countries--an increase of $13.4 million over FY 99. 
   I believe the bill before you takes significant steps to focus the Department of Defense's efforts to counter new and emerging threats to vital national security interests. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Once again, Mr. President, I am asking the support of my colleagues for a simple sense of the Senate that calls also for complete transparency on the part of the President and Senate consideration regarding the de facto editing of the original North Atlantic Treaty. 
   My sense of the Senate asks the President to certify whether the new Strategic Concept of NATO, the one adopted at the 50th anniversary of NATO in Washington about a month ago--this formalization of new and complicated United States responsibilities in Europe, as evidenced by the war in Kosovo and the possibility of future Kosovos around the world--is in fact a document that obligates the United States in any way, shape, or form. 
   If so, my sense of the Senate affirms that this body be given the opportunity to debate, to accept or to reject, the new blueprint for future NATO operations, these actions which will undoubtedly include substantial components of our own Armed Forces engaged completely outside the province of the original treaty. 
   Yesterday the distinguished Senator from Michigan, my colleague and my friend, Senator LEVIN, asked where the Congress was in 1990, in regard to the last Strategic Concept adoption. The Senator has rightly pointed out there were changes made in the Concept at that particular time. Without question, that should have been an alarm bell of things to come. But there are key differences, I tell my friend, in the world today as opposed to the world in 1990. 
   Second, and just as important, there are significant differences regarding the Strategic Concept adopted in April of 1999, just a month ago, which is the document that I hope is still on the desk of all Senators, and the Concept that was adopted in 1990 as referenced by the Senator. 
   First of all, Bosnia had not occurred and, more especially, Kosovo was not the proof of the direction that NATO intended to go. That direction is an offensive direction. That is not meant to be a pun. 
   The crafting of language in the new Strategic Concept was carefully done. Look, my colleagues, if you will, at the removal of the following wording of paragraph 35 of the 1991 Concept. I will repeat it:  
   The alliance is purely defensive in purpose. None of its weapons will ever be used except in self defense.  
   That was removed. That removal was not an oversight. The current Strategic Concept sets in motion a new NATO that is inconsistent with article 1 of the 1990 treaty or concept. The North Atlantic Treaty, article 1:  
   The parties undertake as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations to settle any international dispute which they may be involved in by peaceful means, in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.  
   That was in 1990, the reference to the United Nations, to settle any international dispute by peaceful means, not by military means. 
   The original wording and intent of article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty is straightforward. The North Atlantic Treaty, article 4:  
   The parties will consult together when in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity--  
   All the debate about whether we are conducting a military campaign and crossing borders of a sovereign state, I say it again:  
   The parties will consult together when in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity or political independence or the security of any of the parties is threatened.  
   However, paragraph 24 of the new Concept significantly alters article 4 of the NATO treaty in the following way:  
   Arrangements exist within the alliance for consultation among the allies under article 4 of the Washington Treaty--  
   My colleagues, pay attention to this--  
   and, where appropriate, the coordination of their efforts including the responses to such risks.  
   The portion that includes ``the coordination of their efforts including their responses to such risk,'' it is new, and strongly suggests offensive action, i.e., Kosovo. It is a possible response to a threat, and that is a radical shift for NATO--not from 1949 but also from 1990. 
   The new Concept has significantly expanded the global coverage of NATO. For example, paragraphs 20, 21, and 22 clearly indicate a global reach for NATO. 
   Paragraph 20 states:  
   The resulting tensions could lead to crises affecting Euro-Atlantic stability, to human suffering and to armed conflicts. Such conflicts could affect the security of the conference by spilling over to neighboring countries including NATO countries or in other ways, and could also affect the security of neighboring states.  
   The point is that NATO justifies action well beyond the original boundaries of NATO and now includes threats to member states anywhere in the world. Is that what we want the NATO of the future to be? 
   I say to my friend from Michigan, he is right that Congress was asleep at the switch when the Strategic Concept of 1990 was adopted. But there is no reason for Congress to remain asleep in  1999. In fairness to my colleagues, no one envisioned that in less than 9 years the purely defensive alliance of NATO would have conducted offensive action out of area, against a sovereign nation, albeit a terribly oppressive nation, in an action that was not in our vital national interests. 
   Let me share some comments I have gleaned from the Foreign Media Reaction Daily Digest which all Members receive from the U.S. Information Agency. This is from the leading press around the world, as they view, in terms of their commentary, what this Strategic Concept means to them. 
   I know some critics, myself included, will say their views, some of the views, are unimportant or biased or that they are from state-run presses. I know that. But I think they are a valuable tool to understand how we and NATO are being perceived by non-NATO members--and some NATO members as well. Here is the summary--early May:  
   The Alliance's adoption of a ``new strategic concept''..... has swung to the negative [in regard to the comments by the foreign press]. Criticism of the Alliance's vision of a ``new world order''. ..... many underscored the problems with NATO's expanded purview and questioned the feasibility of trying to promote and impose--beyond European borders and ``by force if necessary''--a ``consistent'' standard on human rights. The vast majority of media outside of Europe remained harshly critical of NATO's [read the U.S.'s] new blueprint, with most reiterating their concerns that NATO is ``transforming itself into a global police force, ignoring the role of the U.N.'' ..... NATO is being enlarged--both spatially and doctrinally--in order to ensure U.S. military and political dominance over Europe, Russia and the rest of the world.  
   I don't buy that, but it is important to understand that other countries certainly think that. 
   It goes on to say:  
   The idea that a part of the world, formed by the most ``civilized'' nations, can be responsible for the respect of human rights in the whole world--resorting, if necessary, to the use of force ..... is neither viable nor fair.  
   They are asking:  
   ..... whether Kosovo is an exception or a rule in NATO's new strategy, and whether the Allies will be equally firm, but also consistent, when its comes to the Kurds ..... Tibetans, Palestinians, Tutsis, Hutus [or] Native Americans. Ethnic cleansing in Chechnya, Turkey, Colombia, Indonesia show that NATO is now punishing randomly, that is only enemies and only those countries that don't have any nuclear weapons.  
   Mr. President, several headlines--and I do not agree with all of these headlines--in May should be brought to the attention of my colleagues. 
   The newspaper Reforma in Mexico:  
   What is the reason for the desire to impose a solution in defense of the Albanians in Yugoslavia while at the same time three ethnic groups that hate each other are forced to co-exist in Bosnia? What could happen in Mexico in the future? Within several months, NATO members [have now agreed] to intervene anywhere they see fit without the need to consult with the U.N. and to run the risk of a veto from Russia or China. This will be a two century jump backwards.  
   That is from Mexico. I am not saying it speaks for the entire country of Mexico, although President Zedillo said much the same thing. 
   Ethnos, a paper in Greece:  
   What occurred in Washington was the U.N.'s complete weakening. It is now a mere onlooker of NATO's decisions and initiatives. What has taken place is the complete overthrow of the legal system.  
   A newspaper called Folha de S. Paulo in Brazil:  
   NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary and in practice formalizes the end of the U.N. As it has become clear this past month, the world's power is, in fact, in NATO, meaning in the hands of the United States. And, almost no Government dares to protest against it.  
   The Economist in Great Britain, a respected newspaper:  
   Limping home from Kosovo would certainly oblige NATO to rethink its post-Cold War aims of intervention, not just for member's defense, but also for broader interest in humanitarian and international order. NATO might go into terminal decline. The Alliance needs to persist in explaining to other countries the principles that guided NATO's decision to intervene in Kosovo. This necessity is not so much to prove that this was a just cause but to reassure a suspicious world that NATO has not given itself the right to attack sovereign nations at whim.  
   Il Sole 24-Ore. of Italy:  
   We cannot say what emerged from the weird birthday-summit war council in Washington is a strategic concept. Indeed, NATO should have been more precise about its future. The war in Kosovo forces us to revise international law as we have known it.  
   This is from a newspaper in a country that is a NATO ally:  
   The concept suggests laying the foundation of an ``ethical foreign policy.'' A democratic West which tolerates ethnic and religious diversities, which is stable and economically free, can even fight to give these values to other people. It is a very nice picture, but to impose freedom is a contradiction in terms.  
   Another headline: Al-Dustur in Jordan, the new King of which just paid a visit to this country:  
   The Anglo-American alliance imposed on NATO during the summit in Washington is a new orientation marked by imperialist arrogance and disregard for the rest of the world.  
   Those are pretty strong words.  
   This is a serious danger that faces the world, and to overcome it all non-NATO countries should cooperate and seek to develop weapons of mass destruction.  
   Is that what the new Strategic Concept is leading to in the minds of some of the critics in foreign countries? 
   Al Watan in Kuwait, the country we freed in regard to Desert Storm:  
   NATO does not have a strategy for the next 50 years, except America will remain the master, Europe the subordinate, Russia a marginalized state and the rest of the world secondary actors.  
   That is pretty tough criticism. 
   Asahi newspaper in Japan:  
   One such lesson is that members of an alliance often resort to their own military activities, paying scant attention to the trend of the U.N. Security Council, or international opinion. Another lesson is that the United States, the only superpower, often acts in accordance with its own logic or interests rather than acting as supporter for its allies.  
   This newspaper sums it up:  
   This has relevance to the U.S.-Japanese military alliance.  
   The newspaper Hankyoreh Shinmun of South Korea, an ally:  
   The summit decision to give the Alliance an enlarged role in the future is a dangerous one in that it may serve in the long term to merely prop up America's hegemonic endeavors. The talk of NATO's expanded role confuses everyone and even threatens global peace. NATO's new role could unify countries like Russia and China that oppose U.S. dominance, provoking a new global conflagration between them and the West.  
   In Taiwan, The China Times:  
   NATO's new order requires different agents to act on the U.S.'s behalf in different regions and to share the peace-keeping responsibility for the peace of greater America. In the Kosovo crisis, NATO on one hand tries to stop the Yugoslav government's slaughter. On the other hand, to show respect for Yugoslav sovereignty it also opposes Kosovar independence. This means that a country cannot justify human rights violations by claiming national sovereignty. By the same token, calls for independence in a high tension area are forbidden since they would naturally lead to war. These two principles have now become the pillars of the NATO strategic concept. Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have also repeatedly received similar signals: Beijing should not use force against Taiwan, and Taiwan should not declare independence.  
   There is a parallel. 
   Finally, in India, the newspaper Telegraph:  
   NATO will definitely try to make things difficult for nations like India which are planning to join the nuclear league. Though Russia, and now China, are seeking India's cooperation and active participation to build a multi-polar world order against the United States, Deli appears to be reluctant to play. This reluctance stems from the fear that the West, with help from Pakistan, might turn Kashmir into another Kosovo, highlighting human rights violations in the valley and Kashmir then might become a fit case for NATO intervention.  
   I do not buy that. I do not think we are going to do that. Some of the warnings, some of the descriptions that I have just read to my colleagues, I do not buy, but it shows you the attitude, it shows you how other people feel about the new Strategic Concept. 
   We have the same kind of commentaries from Argentina, from Canada, from Mexico again. 
   La Jornada, a newspaper in Mexico:  
   The decision by NATO leaders to turn that organization from a defensive into an offensive entity and to carry out military actions regardless of the U.N. is a defeat of civilized mechanisms that were so painfully put in place after World War II. If the Alliance really wanted to impose democratic values by force, it should start by attacking some of its own members, like Turkey, which carries out systematic ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Kurds.  
   Tough words. 
   My point remains that this new Strategic Concept, a concept that radically alters the focus and direction of NATO, has been adopted without the consultation of the Senate. Are we willing, as  Senators, to stand by and not debate, discuss, or give consent to a document that fundamentally alters the most successful alliance in history? What we discussed, what we ratified in regard to expansion is totally different than the new Strategic Concept. It has had no debate, it has had no discussion and, yet, it is a blueprint for our involvement in the future of NATO. 
   It is a document that fundamentally alters the most successful alliance in history and one that may cost the blood of our men and women and billions of dollars from our Treasury. We should at least debate it. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I say to the Senator, I am not sure. I had thought we had an agreement that there would not be an objection to the amendment by unanimous consent. That obviously is not the case. We are going to have to consider this. Let us work on this. 
   I will be happy to visit here on the floor with the Senator from Delaware and my good friend from Michigan. I am not entirely clear, after listening to the Senator, that his description of this amendment is the one that I have. Let us work it out, and if push comes to shove, although I think it is entirely reasonable for a Senator to be allowed to amend his own amendment, if this has caused some concern on the part of both Senators, we can always bring this up as a separate amendment, which may be the best case. If, in fact, you say ``legal,'' you put the word ``legal'' in there, obviously I do not think the President is going to have any obligation to report on anything. In terms of obligation, if I might say so, if the Senator will continue to yield, if Kosovo is not an obligation, I am not standing here on the floor of the Senate. That is my response. 
   Why don't we visit about this if we can, and then, if necessary, we will just introduce an amendment at a later time as a separate amendment.

   Mr. ROBERTS. With the debate we have had on the floor, although there is support--and the better part of judgment would be for me to simply yield the floor--we will try to split the shingle one more time. The debate is centered around whether or not the new Strategic Concept adopted at the 50th anniversary of NATO is legally binding, a treaty, or different from the 1991 Concept, let alone the 1949 Concept. 
   Let me just say that the 1991 document really stressed that--as a matter of fact, it assured--no NATO weaponry will ever be used offensively. We are sure doing that now in regard to Kosovo. 
   In addition, in terms of the 19 parties who met in Washington, I am sure that each one of them certainly thought it was binding. And if the men and women in the uniform of all our allies do not think it is binding, I think they had better look for a new definition. 
   I believe any document that contains even tacit commitment by the United States and other nations to engage in new types of NATO missions--and let me simply say that these missions are now described as problems with drugs, problems with social progress, with reform, with ethnic strife; about the only thing that is not in there is don't put gum in the water fountain--outside the domain of the original treaty, as well as a commitment to structure military forces accordingly, can be considered an international agreement. 
   I refer again to the U.S. Department of State Circular 175, the Procedure on Treaties, that sets forth eight considerations available for determining whether or not an agreement or an accord should be submitted to the Senate for ratification. Four of them I will repeat again: The extent to which the agreement involves commitments or risks affecting the Nation as a whole--if Kosovo is not a risk, I do not know what is--whether the agreement can be given effect without the enactment of subsequent legislation by the Congress; past U.S. practices as to similar agreements; the preference of Congress as to a particular type of agreement. 
   It seems to me, if I recall the debate and the two copies of the original 1949 document, and then the Strategic Concept document, No. 1, they said no offensive weapons. No. 2, they said we are going to stay within our borders and we will meet with you before we go outside the borders and go wandering in the territory of a sovereign nation. Then lastly, we are going to consult with the U.N. It is going to be in cooperation with the U.N. All that is different. 
   I think to say that it is not different in regard to 1991 is simply not accurate. 
   I don't know. I suppose per se, legally--I am not a lawyer--that this Strategic Concept is not a treaty. But it sure walks like a treaty duck and it quacks like a treaty duck and it is wandering into different areas like a treaty duck. In the quacking and the walking, it is causing a lot of problems. 
   I simply say, in closing, I do respect the Senator from Michigan and his support and the Senator from Delaware for his accommodating my amendment. It is true that the Senator from Delaware said that I was in the House of Representatives, the other body, what Senator BYRD refers to as the lower body. In 1990 we were not asleep. We were not asleep at all. We admired the Senator from Delaware from afar. We were spellbound, as a matter of fact, by his oratorical skills, his sartorial splendor, and his ability to be heard above all in the Senate, regardless of whether the acoustical system was working or not. So I thank the Senator from Delaware for his comments. 
   I urge Senators to support this amendment and send a strong message that we are adhering to our constitutional right when we change an agreement that in effect directly affects the lives of our American men and women and our national security, that the Senate stepped up to the plate. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, before I make remarks on behalf of the amendment, which pretty well dovetails the second-degree amendment introduced by the distinguished chairman of the committee, I would like to pay a deserved tribute to our distinguished chairman, the Senator from Virginia, for his leadership in forging a defense bill during a time of great, great challenge. 
   During a time when our military is stressed, strained, and some of us believe hollow, our Nation needs those who will take a stand--a stand, if you will--to really try to fulfill the first obligation of our Federal Government, and that is to safeguard our national security. 
   Our new chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in the tradition of Senator THURMOND, has been the right man at the right time for the right job. He has, without question, reaffirmed the standing of the influence of the committee. He has actually given the committee--in this case, the creation of a new Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee--a chance to take a look at really what our Nation faces in terms of our national security threat in the post-cold-war period. I want to thank him publicly for discussing with me the possibility of being the chairman of that committee and for that appointment. 
   I think the thing I want to mention the most in regard to the chairman's leadership and also that of Senator LEVIN is the pay raise and retirement reform contained in this bill. After hearing from the Joint Chiefs and knowing that we have a crisis in regard to retention of our men and women in uniform, the chairman, actually during the impeachment process, sat us down to work and really hit the ground running. 
   Despite the criticism of those who wanted a much larger bill, a more comprehensive bill, to address all of the problems that we face in the military--and, by the way, I mention that these challenges include the quality of life issues, the health care issues, the issue of the operations tempo, the issue of the personnel tempo, and then that of mission quality. There are those who said, we are not quite sure that this pay raise or this retirement reform will really address the retention problem. There are others who said they wanted to study it further. I suggest to them that if we studied it actually further, we would be in such a problem with retention we would be past the marrow of the bone.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I have a statement here by a member of the Parliament. Menzies Campbell says:  
   .....''It is a matter of considerable regret that the House of Commons has never debated properly the issues surrounding the NATO Strategic Concept.'' He argued that, ``Parliament should have had the opportunity to consider matters such as NATO's right of independent action without Security Council authority and further expansion of the alliance and its consequences.''  
   He said that:  
   Foreign and security policy is the responsibility of the government, but the legislature is surely entitled to express its views.  
   This was also true in regards to the statement by Lord Wallace of Great Britain in the House of Lords.  
   .....''no intelligent debate''.....it is ``quite astonishing that we allow British defence strategy to be structured by an international organisation without any form of input and debate by our Parliament.''  
   Then he went on to say, in drawing the example here in the Senate:  
   Both Republicans and Democrats.....argue that the..... [overemphasis on] the enlargement issue in the run-up to NATO's 50th anniversary celebration.....came at the expense of any meaningful debate over the evolution of NATO and the role that the.....Alliance will play in the 21st century.  
   If I could ask my distinguished chairman, would he recall the many times that we have had briefings in regards to the situation in Kosovo and the question over and over again that was posed prior to the bombing: Would this be in our vital national security interest? 
   I know the Senator asked that question many times. I know that the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. BENNETT, who made a very eloquent speech in this Chamber this morning, asked that question. I tried to ask the question in regards to an amendment to the defense appropriations bill last year. I said: Before we would actually commit any troops under this ever-changing concept in that part of the world, would the administration please answer eight questions--as to cost, purpose, exit strategy, end game, and et cetera, et cetera? 
   That public law requirement was not addressed for 6 months. 
   I am worried about the future of NATO, I would say to my distinguished friend. I know the chairman is. I think that Kosovo is a rock that has hit the NATO windshield, and it has been like shattered glass. It does not matter if you feel that involvement is a fine mess we have gotten into or whether or not we think that this policy is the right policy. 
   I am sure the distinguished chairman--I have talked with him about it--will have the full committee or perhaps my subcommittee look at the tactics that have been used, the stress and strain on others, on other services in other parts of the world. 
   I am sure we have talked about the ethics of conducting a war above 15,000 feet; immaculate coercion, where no allied NATO soldier has suffered any casualty as opposed to the people we are trying to help. 
   I know that we have talked, Mr. Chairman, about the law of unintended effects; what is happening today in regard to Russia, China, India, Pakistan, South America, and Central America. President Zedillo of Mexico wondered aloud in the international press: Will NATO now come to enforce human rights within the sovereign territory of Mexico in regards to the Chippewa Indian situation? How about East Timor, Chechnya, Turkey, and the Kurds, et cetera, et cetera? Rwanda, that situation is far more difficult. 
   I don't know, Mr. Chairman. I just think there are a lot of real questions that Members have. If you go back to the basic genesis as to why we are there, it comes right back to the President's speech at the Hague over 2 years ago, reflected in the Strategic Concept of NATO. 
   I thank the distinguished chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBERTS. I am worried about the future of NATO. If in 
   fact our involvement in Kosovo was at one time not in our vital national interest, there is, I think, a good argument that can be made--has been made by the national security team and the President--that since NATO's credibility or the future of NATO is now on the line, it is in our vital national security interest. 
   Having said that, and having looked at the war in Kosovo and the tactics used, and the result, and all six of the goals, as outlined by the distinguished Secretary of State in our briefings, being turned on their head as a result of the tactics that have been used in the military strategy, and the law of unintended effects, can you imagine a situation under this Strategic Concept that all 19 nations will ever agree to ever bomb anybody again? On a proactive basis? Where we are going outside of the NATO territory, ignoring the U.N.? I doubt it. 
   Eight nations, right now as I speak, more especially three, want the bombing ended. Many others in this Chamber--not this Senator, for reasons that I could go into, but I will not--did not want to start the bombing campaign. Others wanted to start it. Others wanted to use the ground forces. That debate is going on right now. 
   We are negotiating within the NATO--within the NATO--alliance as opposed to trying to negotiate, as we are trying to do, with Mr. Milosevic, who, by the way, is a thug and an international terrorist and all the things people say about him. That does not enter into this. But can you imagine, Mr. Chairman, under what circumstance, after Kosovo, that NATO would bomb again, or for that matter ever use ground troops? 
   What kind of message does that send to the bad guys and the hard targets and the real people that we should be worrying about all around the world? I think we have decimated--well, there is a stronger word for it, but I will not use it--in regards to NATO. I think under this Strategic Concept we have wandered so far afield and into a dangerous pasture that we are endangering the true mission of NATO, which is collective security, not to mention all the rest of these things that are in this concept. 
   That is what worries me.

   Mr. ROBERTS. If I may ask my distinguished friend, the chairman, one other question; that is, I do not think there is any question in the minds of many that to state that you are not going to use grounds forces before you decide to use force was a mistake. There is no question about that. 
   I am not sure I could still support or still support--I never did support--the use of ground troops, unless I know what their specific mission is: What do we expect them to do. And then, if you ``win,'' if we could ever define ``winning,'' what is it that we have won. 
   So from the standpoint of tactics, I say again to the chairman, I am very hopeful, once this war is over, we hope and pray that all of this talk that has been rather critical will be secondary, and, if Milosevic would agree to some of the negotiating principles that have been offered, we shall see. I see where one NATO general indicated it is going to take another 2 months. I hope that is not the case. 
   I hope the Senate Armed Services Committee--and I ask the chairman, would it be his intent to take a hard look. I have a subcommittee that looks at low-intensity conflicts--this became a high-intensity conflict--and military tactics and 
   strategy. I hope we can take a look at this, especially with the asymmetrical threat that Mr. Milosevic has used so well against us. He basically took one look at our tactics and acted accordingly and played rope-a-dope. He has achieved most of his objectives. That seems to me to be a real problem here. I hope we have those hearings. 
   Again, I go back to the genesis of this whole business, and that is a Strategic Concept that puts us in far different pastures. I know there will be some of my colleagues who say this is not a treaty. The fact that we are having this debate today, I think, is encouraging. We had a debate on ratification of NATO expansion last year. To my knowledge, we have not had any debate, or very little discussion, of this Strategic Concept and what it means. 
   So the Senator's cosponsorship of this amendment is much appreciated. If, in fact it is not a treaty, it has the effect of a treaty.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I rise today to introduce an important component to further the scientific understanding of the earth's role as it relates to the environment, specifically the carbon cycle. What sparked my interest in introducing a carbon cycle research bill was a 1998 finding by academic and federal researchers that the North American continent from 1988 to 1992 absorbed an equivalent amount of the carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel emissions during the same time. Scientists know it happened, but cannot pinpoint the mechanisms of the process. Although you cannot watch carbon dioxide move into soil, you can see soil with high levels of carbon like river bottomland that has rich dark soil. Naturally, the question arises of how agriculture supplements this natural process. 
   By introducing this bill, it is my intention to follow through on the advice of climate scientists that there is a need for more research because the carbon cycle issue is complex. The bill makes sure that USDA is researching voluntary agricultural best practices such as conservation tillage, buffer strips, the Conservation Reserve Program, and new technology like precision sprayers that have multiple environmental benefits. 
   These voluntary agricultural best practices increase soil carbon levels also tend to reduce soil erosion, reduce fuel costs for producers, improve soil fertility, and increase production. It's a win win win. Nonetheless, there are agencies and individuals with agendas that believe agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas emissions and do not care about the multitude of benefits accruing from production agriculture. Therefore, we must arm agriculture with sound science on the carbon cycle. 
   This bill is intended to give producers and policymakers better understanding of the link between the carbon cycle and voluntary best practices. It authorizes USDA to conduct basic research on the mechanics of carbon being stored in soil and applied research to fine tune voluntary agricultural practices to increase the storage of carbon in soils. Furthermore, research will be helpful in finding out if agriculture can be a tool to solve the challenge of climate change. 
   I also want to make clear that this is a research bill. It has nothing to do with trading carbon credits or setting up a scheme for early action rewards if the Protocol becomes effective. The whole point of this bill is that there needs to be an understanding of the science and examining methods to meet the challenge of climate change without an international treaty. This bill compliments other legislation, such as Mr. MURKOWSKI'S bill, that calls for increased energy efficiency research. 
   The bill taps into USDA's broad research capabilities as it relates to production techniques and soil databases, but I have also incorporated state-of-the-art research tools including satellite-based technology. Satellite based  remote sensing is becoming more useful as an agricultural production component. Right now, satellites measure the greening up of wheat during spring months, making more precise estimates of wheat harvests. In discussions with remote sensing leaders at the University of Kansas, remote sensing has a role in providing the ``big picture'' as it relates to what agriculture is doing as it relates to the carbon cycle, such as mapping vegetation and estimating the amount of carbon it can store in soil. 
   Because of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's initial research that shows the North American Continent is a net carbon sink, I have included bill language to use air monitors to study the regional interaction of carbon dioxide. For instance, measure the movement of air from Denver to Kansas City. If the carbon dioxide level is lower in Kansas City than Denver, Kansas agriculture and land is absorbing carbon. With this data, scientists can start looking at specific ag practices. 
   It is my hope that the Senate can enact this legislation to be proactive in meeting the climate challenge, encouraging voluntary agricultural best practices and technology that have multiple benefits. This is a strategy that is based on commonsense, not suggestions made by the International Panel on Climate Change that would halt production agriculture as we know it. Producers can use technology to feed a troubled and hungry world, plus absorb carbon dioxide.

    Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate National Hospital Week. During this week when we pay tribute to our nation's hospitals and health systems. I would like to recognize one particular facility in Kansas that has gone above and beyond the call of duty in order to meet the needs of the community--the Mount Carmel Medical Center in Pittsburg, Kansas. 
   Mount Carmel Medical Center is located in the southeast corner of Kansas. The community has 20,000 residents. About 25 percent of the town's children are from families who live at or below the federal poverty level. More than half of the families in Pittsburg are headed by single parents who often work two jobs. 
   As one of the largest employers in the community, Mount Carmel Medical Center recognized that the entire community was suffering from the lack of quality child care. Teachers noticed that children were unready to learn, they needed immunizations and hearing tests. After a confirmation by the hospital's employee assistance program and a staff-initiated community health assessment, Mount Carmel decided to take action. They formed a partnership with the Pittsburg schools and Pittsburg State University to establish the Family Resource Center to meet many of the community's needs. The Family Resource Center now provides child care to more than 200 children and offers a wide range of social services. It also serves as the site of a free clinic staffed with local physicians for those without health insurance coverage. 
   The Mount Carmel Medical Center has been nationally recognized for its achievements. The American Hospital  Association recently awarded the Mount Carmel Medical Center the 1999 NOVA award. NOVA awards recognize innovative community partnerships that address communities' needs. 
   The collaborative outreach efforts of Mount Carmel Medical Center demonstrates true dedication to the community. I am pleased and proud to recognize Mount Carmel Medical Center for its leadership, vision, and achievements. Mount Carmel is an excellent example of a hospital that has made a difference.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999. 
   Health care today is at a crossroads. Rural communities face significant challenges in their efforts to recruit and retain health care providers. Hospitals and other health care facilities are facing increasing pressure from Medicare reductions. In 1997, Congress passed significant changes to the Medicare program in an effort to preserve the program for future generations. A new Congressional Budget Report says we are exceeding our expectations. In fact, since the beginning of the fiscal year in October, Medicare spending was $2.6 billion less than the amount spent in the similar period last year. 
   While this is good news for the fiscal integrity of the Medicare program, I am concerned about the unintended effects these reductions are having on the beneficiaries who depend on Medicare for health care services. It doesn't do much good to ``save'' the program if providers can no longer afford to deliver the services and beneficiaries are no longer able to access these services. 
   A new review by Ernst & Young reports that total hospital Medicare margins are expected to decline from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1997 to only 0.1 percent in this fiscal year and remain below three percent through 2002. 
   Even more shocking is that total hospital margins for small, rural hospitals are expected to fall from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1998 to negative 5.6 percent by fiscal year 2002, an amazing decline of 233 percent. Kansas hospitals are expected to lose over $530 million. I simply don't think our rural health system can survive any more reductions. 
   The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 will help to improve access, increase choice, and improve the quality of care provided in rural America. 
   Health care providers in rural areas generally serve a large number of Medicare patients. However, Medicare reimbursement to rural providers is not adequate to cover the costs of these services. This measure takes steps to ensure fair Medicare and Medicaid payments to rural providers by targeting those hospitals with special designations in rural areas. Provisions are included to increase payments and improve the Sole Community Hospital, Medicare Dependent Hospital, and Critical Access Hospital programs. In addition, these special facilities are exempt from a new outpatient reimbursement system that is being developed by the Health Care Financing Administration. 
   The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 also strengthens health professional recruitment programs and gives communities a chance to begin recruitment efforts before a crisis hits. Under current law, a community must effectively lose a physician before they qualify for recruitment assistance as a shortage area. 
   This measure also takes steps to encourage the use of telehealth, a critical piece of the rural health infrastructure. Under current law, HCFA limits reimbursement to four groups of services. This bill will expand reimbursement to include any services currently covered by Medicare in a rural area. In addition, the bill authorizes a new grant/loan program for telemedicine activities in rural areas. 
   Compromise is a way of life for rural Americans. Rural residents have fewer choices of physicians or hospitals. Rural providers must settle for fewer medical colleagues to rely on for consultation and support. 
   However, rural communities can no longer compromise. The regulatory burden is too much. Payments are too low. There simply isn't any more ``fat'' in the system. 
   Mr. President, I fear this is only the tip of the iceberg. As payment changes continue to be implemented and HCFA continues to issue new regulations and paperwork burdens, rural communities are going to suffer the most. In fact, many may not survive. We are already losing home health agencies at an alarming rate. Are hospitals the next to go? 
   I am committed to efforts to preserve access to health care services for all Kansans. We can do this if we simply focus on practical reforms that take  into account the realities of practicing medicine in rural states like Kansas. We can guarantee access to quality health care services if we make changes now. We can't afford to wait. I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting this legislation and look forward to working together to enact common sense solutions--before it's too late.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the American people should realize and understand that in his press conference just 2 days ago, President Clinton talked about the justification for United States-led airstrikes against Serbian troops in Kosovo and that today we are apparently within hours--within hours--of going to war. He acknowledged that our U.S. pilots would be put at risk. And last week, the Pentagon's top military commanders also warned those of us on the Senate Armed Services Committee that there could be U.S. casualties if NATO launches airstrikes in an effort to pressure President Milosevic to accept the peace agreement that has been drafted by the U.S. and its allies and apparently signed by the Kosovar Albanians. 
   General Michael Ryan, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said this:  
   There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in trying to penetrate those defenses.  
   Our Marine Corps Commandant Charles Krulak said:  
   It is going to be tremendously dangerous. Serbian air defenses are mobile, the terrain is very tough and the weather cannot be underestimated.  
   General Krulak also said there were some bottom-line questions that still need to be answered: What is the end game? What happens if the Serbs do not come to the table after the first airstrike? How long will the strikes go on? Will our allies stay with us? 
   General Dennis Reimer, the Army Chief of Staff, also discussed the probability--and I emphasize the word ``probability''--of sending 4,000 U.S. troops as part of the NATO peacekeeping force. He said:  
   The current commitment on the ground remains a still-elusive peacekeeping argument. However, our troops earmarked for that are prepared.  
   General Reimer agreed with the chairman of the committee, Senator JOHN WARNER, who warned of the massing of Serbian troops on the border of Kosovo preparing for extensive ground operations. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues and the American public should understand, notwithstanding yet another round of last-minute diplomatic efforts by the administration's special envoy and the architect of U.S. policy in the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke, who is meeting with Mr. Milosevic as of today, the United States is preparing to go to war against the sovereign country of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and this air attack is very likely to be followed by U.S. ground troops. 
   As former Senator Bob Dole said on ``Meet the Press'' yesterday, it is time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait in the Balkans. 
   Compounding the situation is the fact that the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Primakov, a staunch opponent of airstrikes and an ally of Milosevic, will be in Washington tomorrow, and I think his visit really presents a unique problem. An attack during Primakov's visit would certainly not help repair frayed U.S. and Russian relations. However, he is not due to leave until Friday. In a real paradox, by meeting with Mr. Primakov this week and delaying the attack, the administration may well give Mr. Milosevic additional time to launch an offensive, an offensive, by the way, which is also happening now. 
   General Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, has warned time and again that if no accord is reached, the Serb forces will resume fighting on a very large scale, and that is happening. 
   As the debate showed in the House of Representatives several 
   weeks ago, and as the debate also continues in this body as of today and tomorrow, many in the Congress are concerned and frustrated and torn. Some support airstrikes and some do not. Some support ground troops; more do not. But we all agree, I think, that the Congress and the American people certainly deserve a better explanation of the administration's policy in the Balkans. 
   It is not that we have not asked the administration for clarification. Last July, I offered an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that required the President to come before the American people and the Congress before he committed the U.S. to a military involvement in Kosovo. The amendment was not prejudicial. It simply required the President to make the case as to why intervention in Kosovo was in our vital national security interest. 
   The language contained in section 8115 of Public Law 105-262--and it is the law of the land--unambiguously states that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under the act may be obligated or expended for any additional deployment of the Armed Forces of the United States unless and until the President, in consultation with the leadership of the Congress, transmits to Congress a report that includes the following: 
   No. 1: certification that the presence of those forces to be deployed is necessary to the national security interests of the United States; 
   No. 2: the reasons why the deployment is in the national security interest; 
   No. 3: the number of military personnel to be deployed; 
   No. 4: the mission and objectives of forces to be deployed; 
   No. 5: the expected time schedule for accomplishing the objectives of the deployment; 
   No. 6: the exit strategy; 
   No. 7: the costs; 
   And lastly, 
   No. 8: the anticipated effects on the morale, the retention and the effectiveness of United States forces. 
   Mr. President, although our United States pilots are about to take part in an air attack that will put them in harm's way, to be followed by some 4,000 ground troops, that report--that report--required by law--has not been submitted to the Congress. 
   Last week, in the briefing that was conducted by Secretary of State Albright, National Security Council Chairman Berger, and Secretary of Defense Cohen, I again asked if the report would be forthcoming. I asked if the latest briefing--requested, by the way, by our Majority Leader LOTT--served in lieu of the report. The response of Mr. Berger was unclear to me, but in past conversations in previous briefings he said the administration should and could answer all the questions involved, and that the report would be made ``at the appropriate time.'' 
   With the attack imminent, it would seem now is the appropriate time. As a matter of fact, with all due respect to the administration, submitting such a report would not be difficult and it would be helpful. If the administration thinks--and they apparently think--that this is the case, that threats of military action may alter the behavior of the Serbs, of Milosevic, what clearer signal of intent to forcibly stop the violence against the Albanians than the President of the United States laying out the issues to Congress and the American people? 
   Perhaps we can do the administration a favor today. In answering these questions, required by public law, let us simply take public statements from the President and his Cabinet officers, as well as statements made in briefings to the Congress that have been reported in the public press. 
   As a Member of both the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, I want to emphasize there should not and cannot be any disclosure of military details of any proposed action, the timing of the action or the types or selection of various weapon platforms. 
   Let's take the reporting requirements--1, 2, and then 4. They ask the President to describe why deploying to Kosovo is in the national security interest of the United States as well as  what specific objectives our forces will have once on the ground in the province. 
   They are of particular importance because it will be these goals for which our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines will be risking their lives. Let me put it another way. Should a father, a mother, a husband or a wife--or any family member--have to ask, ``For what did my son or daughter, husband or wife, mom or dad die for?'' the answers to these questions will have to suffice. 
   Questions Nos. 1 and 2: 
   Certify the presence of forces to be deployed is necessary to the national security interests of the United States and the reasons why the deployment is in the national security interest. 
   Here is the answer that I am suggesting to the Clinton administration. President Clinton, taken from President Clinton's press conference last Friday: It could be in the report. I am quoting the President:  
   A part of my responsibility is to try to leave to my successors, and to our country in the 21st century, an environment in Europe that is stable, humane and secure. It will be a big part of America's future.  
   The President went on to say:  
   As we prepare to act, we need to remember the lessons learned in the Balkans. We should remember the horror of the war in Bosnia, the sounds of sniper fire aimed at children, the faces of young men behind barbed wire, the despairing voices of those who thought nothing could be done. It took precious time to achieve allied unity there, but when we did, our firmness ended all that. Bosnia is now at peace.  
   I continue to quote the President:  
   Make no mistake, if we and our allies do not have the will to act, there will be more massacres. In dealing with aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill. But, action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.  
   And then the President goes on to specifically talk about why he thinks this is in our national interest. And it should be made part of the report, if he would simply submit it to the congressional leadership. He said:  
   We must also understand our stake in peace in the Balkans and in Kosovo. This is a humanitarian crisis, but it is much more. This is a conflict with no boundaries. It threatens our national interests. If it continues, it will push refugees across borders, and draw in neighboring countries. It will undermine the credibility of NATO, on which stability in Europe and our own credibility depend. It will likely reignite the historical animosities, including those that can embrace Albania, Macedonia, Greece, even Turkey. These divisions still have the potential to make the next century a truly violent one for that part of the world that straddles Europe, Asia and the Middle East. 
   Unquestionably, there are risks in military action, if that becomes necessary. U.S. and other NATO pilots will be put in harm's way. The Serbs have a strong air defense system. But, we must weigh those risks against the risks of inaction. If we don't act, the war will spread. If it spreads, we will not be able to contain it without far greater risk and cost. I believe the real challenge of our foreign policy today is to deal with problems before they do permanent harm to our vital interests. That is what we must do in Kosovo.  
   Finally, the President said this:  
   One of the things that I wanted to do when I became president is to take advantage of this moment in history to build an alliance with Europe for the 21st century, with a European undivided, strong, secure, prosperous and at peace. That is why I have supported the unification of Europe financially, politically, economically. That is why I've supported the expansion of NATO and a redefinition of its missions.  
   Here is another answer that the administration could include in the report to the Congress as justification for an attack on Serbia and whether or not this is in our vital national interest. 
   Secretary of State Albright: This is taken from press accounts of congressional briefings. Six reasons: 
   No. 1: the Balkans represent a bridge between Europe and the Middle East and therefore are of strategic interest. 
   No. 2: unless we stop this conflict, it will spin into Albania, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey. The First World War started there. Another could again. 
   No. 3: we have a humanitarian obligation to stop massacres and refugee flight. 
   No. 4: what we do in Kosovo has a direct bearing on what has been achieved in Bosnia. 
   No. 5: what we do in Kosovo represents our leadership role in NATO, the credibility of NATO; both relevant to the future of NATO into the next century. 
   And lastly, No. 6: it is in our national interest to oppose Serb aggression. 
   One more answer: Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, February 25, 1999:  
   First, we have a clear interest in protecting stability in a key part of Europe and our investment in Bosnia. If we don't stop the conflict in Kosovo, it could draw in Albania and Macedonia, potentially threaten our NATO allies in Greece and Turkey and thereby divide the alliance. 
   Second, We have an important interest in averting another humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo. Continued conflict also would create new opportunities for international terrorists, drug smugglers and criminals. 
   Third, America has a clear interest in ending years of Serb repression by strengthening democracy, upholding the rule of law including the valuable contribution of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and protecting human rights. 
   Finally, persisting conflict in Kosovo would undermine NATO's credibility as the guarantor of peace and stability in the Balkans and U.S. credibility as one of the leaders of NATO.  
   Now, there, I have submitted the administration's report as to why this is in our national interest, a report that has not been forthcoming, by simply quoting the President, the Secretary of State, and the Undersecretary of State. 
   Whether or not you think that adds up to a rationale as to why we should be going to war is another question, but at least it is there. 
   Question No. 3 that is required by public law: Please provide the number of military personnel to be deployed. 
   Answer: In numerous press reports, President Clinton and various defense officials have stated the United States will commit up to 4,000 troops for deployment to enforce a peace agreement. However, the number of U.S. personnel who provide intelligence, logistical support, extraction capability, and offshore platforms is not available. 
   Question No. 4: What are the mission and objectives of the forces to be deployed? 
   Answer: In regard to the airstrike, the press reports as of today state:  
   NATO plans call first for a short, sharp demonstration airstrike consisting mainly of cruise missiles. [Casualty avoidance--those are my words not the press commentary.] If Mr. Milosevic does not submit, NATO, after additional consultation, [with our allies] plans to launch a sustained and rigorous bombing campaign that could last as long as a week.  
   The report went on to say:  
   A combination of U.S. cruise missiles and up to 400 American and European fighter jets would attempt to take out Serbia's command and control structures and its air defense system and also to strip Serbia's military in Kosovo of its ability to attack Kosovo fighters.  
   Just for the record again, the same press reports stress senior U.S. military officers have warned the Congress the air mission over Serbia would be tremendously dangerous with a high risk of NATO casualties. 
   Question No. 5, as required in the report: The expected schedule for accomplishing the objectives of the deployment. 
   Answer: It is not available--or at least it is not available on all the press reports, the briefings, and the information I have been able to obtain in regard to this weekend and in many previous months. 
   Question No. 6: The exit strategy for the United States forces engaged in the deployment. 
   I want all of my colleagues to pay attention to this response; this is the exit strategy. 
   Answer: American negotiator Christopher Hill, in discussing the negotiated peace agreement, has stated in the press that under the agreement, Serbia would remain sovereign over Kosovo for the next 3 years. Under the NATO peacekeeping force, including the 4,000 Americans, the Kosovo Liberation Army would disband and the Serbs would withdraw all but security forces. 
   That is certainly not the case as of today. However, Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, again, in a very cogent and a very comprehensive briefing in response said before the committee February 25:  
   With respect to our exit strategy, we have learned from our experience in Bosnia that we should not set artificial deadlines. Rather, we should seek to create the conditions for self-sustaining peace so that the timing and circumstances for the reduction and ending of the presence of an international military force is well defined. There are a series of core conditions--apparently what will  have to take place in regard to Kosovo before the 4,000 troops--or how many would be deployed there as peacekeepers--could exit:  
   One, military stability including the swift and orderly departure of all Serb forces except those required for border security; two, replacement of Serb security forces with a functioning, local, representative police force; elections that meet international standards; and establishment of legitimate political institutions that would provide for substantial and sustained Kosovar autonomy. 
   That is a pretty tall order. That is a pretty tall order. We have seen the situation in Bosnia where we were to be there for 1 year; we have been there for 4 so far. It is now $10 to $12 billion. As we learned in the Balkans, time limits don't mean too much. 
   Question No. 7, as required by the amendment in the defense appropriations bill in regard to a report that has not been forthcoming: The costs associated with the deployment and the funding sources for paying these costs. 
   Answer: Assistant Secretary of Defense Kenneth Bacon on February 29: We have calculated or estimated the cost of what it would be to send the U.S. portion of a peacekeeping force into Kosovo. That would be about $1.5 to $2 billion a year but no decision will be made on sending peacekeepers in until there is a peace agreement. 
   Again, the Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, who has been very candid before the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``An additional important element''--now, just stop here for a minute. It will be $2 billion a year at least for 3 years and perhaps more. 
   Then, Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering in a very candid statement said:  
   An additional important element in ensuring an effective and sustainable agreement will be international assistance for Kosovo. The U.S. plans to make a substantial contribution to bolster European Union efforts. We have requested $50 million as part of the 2000 fiscal year budget request. We anticipate identifying additional funds needed to support the civilian implementation aspects of the agreement including funds to: 
   Repair damaged infrastructure--  
   The thought has just occurred to me, if we have airstrikes in Kosovo and Serbia and we destroy the infrastructure, we are now making the promise to send funds to repair the damaged infrastructure--  
   Stimulate economic growth in Kosovo through microlending; 
   Support free elections; 
   Assist in the establishment both of communal police units and an independent Judiciary system.  
   It seems to me, Mr. President, that will add up to a great deal more money than the $2 billion a year. I can find no statement by the administration as to how they will request these funds. I assume they would come under an emergency supplemental, very similar to the one we are discussing on the floor today. 
   Finally, question No. 8: The anticipated effects of the deployment on the morale, retention, and effectiveness of the United States forces. 
   While I think this is certainly needed, there is no answer that is available. 
   So that is it. Albeit, with very limited time and access to information over this weekend, and probably with some degree 
   a lack of expertise, I have tried to piece together the response that the administration could make within a consultation requirement--a requirement again stated in public law--that would certainly help in the debate we are having today in regard to U.S. policy in the Balkans.

   Mr. ROBERTS. In part he stated:  
   Among foes such as Milosevic, Clinton's credibility diminishes with each unbacked threat, each inflated claim of success for pinprick bombings, each recall of military force even once dispatched. Diminished credibility means, in the long run, a greater likelihood that force will have to be used. 
   Now all these chickens--the diminished credibility abroad, the skepticism at home, above all the unwillingness to fashion a strategy--are coming [home] to roost in Kosovo. Clinton has threatened to bomb Milosevic yet again. Maybe this time he  means it. [I think he does.] But then what? Clinton also has promised that U.S. troops will not be sent into a ``non-permissive'' environment. They will enter Kosovo, in other words, only when Milosevic welcomes them in. 
   ``These are incompatible objectives.'' [He is quoting my colleague and my friend from Oregon, Senator GORDON SMITH, who said in an interview--and, by the way, Senator SMITH is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe] [he] is no isolationists; he has said he would support a dispatch of U.S. troops to Kosovo under the right circumstances. But he worries that [there is] no credible plan. 
   Perhaps a round of U.S. bombing will compel Milosevic to call off his war against Kosovo civilians, sign a peace treaty and admit NATO troops. But what if it doesn't? What if Milosevic responds, instead, with a bloody crackdown in Pristina and villages throughout the province?  
   That is happening as I speak.  
   Clinton, to assuage his fretful military commanders--who have good reason to fret--has already promised not to follow air power with troops. But air power can't solve every problem. 
   If NATO bombs, [Senator] Smith said, it should no longer pretend to be neutral. ``The problem is Milosevic,'' he said. ``If you go along that path, go to win.''  
   I certainly associate myself with the comments of Senator SMITH.  
   Is Clinton [is this Congress and are the American public] prepared to see it through? On Friday, he made a case for bombing [and the intervention] but did not explain what might come next, nor why those next steps would be worth the risk to U.S. life and treasure. Time enough tomorrow, or maybe the day after.  
   That was the conclusion of the editorial. 
   I have questions, but I am not going to take too much time to go over all the questions I have as a result of the statements that have been made. But in regard to Kosovo, what is the end state? What do we want to see in Kosovo once we are done doing whatever it is we plan to do? 
   If we don't want to support the independence and secession of the Kosovars, why are we serving as their air force? 
   How do we know we have ever attained our aims? 
   What are the measures of merit? 
   How long might it take? 
   We have talked about an exit strategy. I think we should 
   focus on strategy; that is, on what we are trying to achieve, through what means, and how do we know we are done? 
   I don't accept the argument in regard to NATO credibility, or that NATO credibility is on the line, as an answer to why we should go there. NATO's credibility is sky high. Just ask all the nations who want to get in. 
   How is bombing conducive to peaceful conflict resolution? Have we ever been able to bomb a country into submission so that they would agree with our point of view? What if initial strikes don't attain the desired effect? How far are we willing to go to compel the Serbs to bend to our will? What are the risks? Why send peacekeepers when there is no peace to be kept and neither side wants to compromise? It seems that is the case. 
   Why are we seeking to compel a sovereign nation--by the way, Yugoslavia was a founding member of the U.N.--to cede its territorial sovereignty to a guerrilla movement? What message does this send to other secessionists worldwide? 
   How do you explain supporting Yeltsin in fighting to keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation, at a cost of about 50,000 casualties--indeed, comparing the Russian action to the American Civil War and, by implication, Yeltsin to Lincoln--and bombing the Serbs for trying to keep their country together? That is a point of view. 
   Which of the many Kosovar factions are we supporting? How much top-down control and professional discipline do we expect from all sides involved? 
   The mission order for Bosnia, which has been referred to as a good case study for Kosovo, was, ``Attack across the Sava River,'' and we went in with overwhelming force, which we then scaled down as the threat receded. We are doing it the other way regarding Kosovo. Why aren't we following that model? Remember the strategic insight of an 18-year-old Marine in Beirut: ``If we are here to fight, we are too few; if we are here to die, we are too many.'' 
   All of these questions I have mentioned--some of which I share with a great deal of support from others--I think certainly should be debated, should certainly come to the floor. That has not been the case. I do hope the administration will submit their report soon. I hope they don't submit the report after the President has given the order and the troops are there, for at that time every Member of the Senate and House will certainly want to support our troops. 
   I worry about this, Mr. President. We are going to war. The President has spoken to the issue, other Cabinet officials have spoken to the issue, but many questions remain. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

    Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill of critical importance to the natural gas industry in Kansas. 
   Natural gas production is an important industry in Kansas, paying good wages to hard working Kansans and taxes to support county and state tax rolls. Kansas is a national leader in natural gas production, and we pipe our product all over the nation. It is an affordable, abundant and clean energy source. This bill will ensure that we can continue to produce this natural resource in Kansas. 
   This issue is complex, full of legalities and arcane federal policy. But I believe the crux of the matter will reverberate throughout the Congress. 
   The problem before us arises out of the system of federal price controls on natural gas. In 1974, natural gas producers were given permission to exceed the national ceiling rates for gas by the cost of any state or federal tax on production. In Kansas, one such tax was the ad valorem tax. In 1974, the Federal Power Commission issued Opinion 699-D, finding that the Kansas ad valorem tax was a production tax eligible for recovery. Kansas gas producers, like producers in other states, were allowed to exceed the national rates by the costs of a local production tax. 
   In 1978, Congress passed the Natural Gas Policy Act. That statute continued the practice of price controls on natural gas, but also codified prior practices that allowed natural gas producers to exceed price ceilings by the costs of production taxes. The newly created Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal body charged with implementing federal policies in this field, continued the practice of allowing Kansas producers to recover the costs of the Kansas ad valorem tax. Business continued as it had since 1974. 
   This practice of adding on the Kansas ad valorem tax was challenged in 1983. The FERC responded with opinions in 1986 and again in 1987, stating that it is ``clear, beyond question,'' that the Kansas ad valorem tax is a tax on production and therefore, under law, eligible for recovery. Kansas producers had clear authority to recover the costs of the ad valorem tax. 
   What happened next is inexplicable. In 1988, the prior FERC decisions on the Kansas ad valorem tax were challenged in court. The D.C. Circuit Court remanded the issue to the FERC. In 1993, five years later, the FERC did the unthinkable. They overturned all their previous rulings in this matter and required Kansas natural gas producers to refund, plus interest, all ad valorem tax monies collected above the gas price ceilings from 1988 forward. The FERC wisely chose 1988 as the collection date based on the D.C. Circuit's decision date. Unfortunately, upon challenge in 1996, the D.C. Circuit extended the refund period to 1983. The result is an estimated $340 million liability due by every producer operating between the years 1983 and 1988. 
   What has occurred is an atrocious miscarriage of justice. Kansas natural gas producers, who in their business practices relied on the rules and followed the orders of the FERC, were subsequently told they had been breaking federal law since 1974, or for 19 years. They were then retroactively found to be liable for all of the collected tax funds back to 1983. In layman's terms, these producers are being held liable for following the orders of the FERC. 
   The FERC did not carry out its duties in a vacuum. Section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act clearly stated that production taxes could be added to the price of gas, even if the add-on exceeded national price ceilings. The NGPA report language went so far as to spell out what kind of taxes are production taxes, stating ``The term ``State severance tax'' is intended to be construed broadly. It includes any tax imposed upon mineral or natural resource production including an ad valorem tax.....'' It is evident to me, and I hope to anyone reading this, that Congress included the words ``ad valorem'' tax for an explicit reason--because Congress intended that ad valorem 
   taxes were to be included in the list of taxes eligible for recovery. I have all of these documents in my possession, and would be pleased to provide any of this information to my colleagues. Mr. President, we must remedy this situation. Before us are the citizens of Kansas, the natural gas producers, who for 19 years dutifully ran their businesses in compliance with federal law, and strictly followed the edicts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They had a right, indeed a responsibility, to rely on the FERC's orders. Today, they are being punished for following these very orders. The FERC's incompetence has caused these honest citizens to be treated as criminals. However, it is the incompetence of the FERC that is criminal. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation from the last Congress. This bill would repeal the most unjust aspect of this order. Requiring producers to refund these recovered taxes is bad enough. However, assessing an interest penalty on this refund order extends beyond the bounds of decency and fairness. The interest portion represents roughly two-thirds of the estimated $340 million cost to Kansas producers. While the FERC had the  opportunity to waive the interest portion, they refused to do so. This legislation is made necessary by the FERC's refusal to take any actions to mitigate this harsh, retroactive and unjust decision. 
   Mr. President, I will do everything in my power to push this issue through to resolution. I will continue my efforts to encourage the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold hearings on this issue, so they may hear firsthand of the events that lead us where we find ourselves today. I want Congress to hear from the citizens of my state, the young and the old, those in business and those retired, those who have money, and those living on a fixed income, all of whom the FERC has ordered must pay refunds often ranging into the tens of thousands of dollars. 
   I also believe it is time for Congress to review the independence and power delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They are unaccountable for their actions, unwilling to accept responsibility and unmoved by the pleas of the stakeholders in this process. Congress entrusted oversight and administration of federal gas policy to the FERC. In this case, the FERC has failed to properly administer the law, and has exercised its authority in an egregious and inequitable manner inconsistent with congressional intent. Congress has a clear responsibility to intervene in this case.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues to reintroduce legislation to help meet the child care challenges facing families in Kansas and around the nation. 
   Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when parents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. 
   Unfortunately, just being able to afford child care is a major issue for most families. Some child care can cost as much as college tuition and consume up to 40 percent of a family's income. Finding quality care is another challenge. 
   Welfare reforms have cut Kansas welfare rolls in half since 1996. As more and more of these families come off the rolls, child care needs grow. About half of the 11,000 families that have left welfare rolls in Kansas have young children. In order to continue the successful transition from welfare to work, parents, especially single parents, must have access to affordable, quality child care. 
   Only parents can and should decide what child care arrangements work best for their children. This includes the decision to stay at home. 
   The Caring for Children Act includes provisions to allow a parent who is able to stay at home and care for a child to receive a tax credit to help cover expenses. This credit applies during the first three years of a child's life and amounts to about $900 per year. 
   The Caring for Children Act takes steps to assist small businesses that want to provide child care. I am pleased that this bill includes a short-term flexible grant program to encourage these businesses to work together to provide child care services. This program, which provides $60 million to the states, allows those closer to home to make decisions necessary to improve child care in communities. This funding provides the start-up assistance necessary to create self-sustaining child care programs. 
   I have pledged to work to improve child care. I will continue this effort. I look forward to working with my colleagues to expand child care options and protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, Mr. KERREY of Nebraska, to introduce a bill that we call the Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act. We believe this bill represents an important step in improving the Federal Crop Insurance Program, and in creating greater access to the risk management tools that our farmers and ranchers simply must have. 
   Senator KERREY and I, and many others who are privileged to represent the agriculture community, have long discussed the need to address reforms to the Crop Insurance Program. However, the necessary demands from the agriculture community and the Congress to successfully reform this program, in my personal opinion at least, did not reach a crescendo until last fall when we approved something called the omnibus appropriations bill, and that contained approximately $6 billion in disaster assistance for our farmers and ranchers. 
   I am sure, while Republicans and Democrats and individual agricultural groups were unable to agree on the necessary size and scope of the disaster package, one thing became abundantly clear to all involved--if we had a Crop Insurance Program that worked, without question, the situation would not have been so serious. 
   This has been a longstanding effort. I can remember well, back in 1978, when I was a staff member in the House of Representatives to my predecessor, that was when the Crop Insurance Program was first established. It has been 20 years, and we still have an obligation to reform the program and make sure that it works for all regions, all farmers, all commodities. 
   In response to the demands for the improved risk management tools, Senator KERREY and I committed to pursuing major crop insurance reforms in this Congress. To aid us in this task, last November we contacted all of the major farm organizations and all of the commodity groups, all of the crop insurance companies, all of the agricultural lending groups, and requested their guidance on these issues. We were listening. We wanted to find out their advice in regard to what do we need to pay attention to, what is the most serious issue that we need to address in the Crop Insurance Program. We received feedback from over 20 of these major organizations.  
   These comments we received served as a guidepost in developing this legislation. And, while the comments received were wide ranging, there was near consensus in several areas. 
   These included as follows: First, the need for increased levels of coverage at affordable prices to all producers. Second, we need expanded availability of revenue-based insurance products. Third, program changes to address the needs of producers suffering multiple crop failures. Fourth, structural changes to the Risk Management Agency--the acronym for that is RMA, and that is what I will call it from now on, but it is the Risk Management Agency--that will allow for increased access to new and improved crop insurance policies. 
   Senator KERRY and I took these comments to heart, and the legislation we are introducing today has been developed in large part by really trying to work to incorporate these comments into legislative language. 
   Our bill inverts this existing subsidy structure. Currently, many producers do not purchase the highest levels of coverage because the greatest level of Government assistance simply occurs at the lowest levels of coverage. This often makes the higher levels of coverage simply unaffordable. It causes many producers to have insufficient coverage, which eventually leads to calls for the ad hoc disaster bills that are so expensive. We cannot continue to pass a disaster package every year. 
   I tell the Presiding Officer, we were just discussing this in a previous meeting, it costs the Federal Government about $1.5 billion on average in regard to the disaster bills. They seem to occur on even numbered years. I think the Presiding Officer knows what I am talking about. We cannot afford that. 
   Therefore, under our legislation, the highest level of subsidy will occur at the 75/100 coverage levels. While the inversion of subsidies will be the most important change for many producers, we have included several changes that we believe will benefit America's farmers and ranchers. These include, first, the average production history--that is called APH in the crop insurance acronym world--APH adjustments for producers that have no production history because they are beginning farmers or they are farming new land or they are rotating crops. 
   Let me add, at this juncture, that is exceedingly important, because under the farm bill that how exists, farmers have a lot more flexibility, and when they move to a new crop, obviously, they ought to be able to simply insure that crop. 
   Second, mandating APH adjustments for producers suffering from crop losses in multiple years. Third, requiring the RMA to work to undertake a pilot project to develop new rating structures for undeserved areas of the country, and particularly the southern part of the United States, with the intention it will eventually become a permanent change in the program. 
   Here is a suggestion or a part of the bill that will be of interest to Senator THOMAS--removing the prohibition on coverages for livestock. I just indicated that we had a good visit this morning about this very subject. The livestock sector is going through a very difficult time in our country today. We need to address this problem with regard to insurance and how it would dovetail into the livestock industry and give our stockmen and our ranchers some protection. 
   In addition, the legislation provides for major changes in the structure of the RMA, the FCIC, that will allow for accelerated product approval and the development of improved crop insurance policies. Many people understand the Risk 
   Management Agency serves as a regulator over the crop insurance industry. What many do not know is that this same outfit, the RMA, also serves as a developer for products that are then sold in direct competition with privately developed products. Thus, the RMA serves as a competitor with the industry it is supposed to regulate. 
   I am aware of no other private industry that faces these same hurdles. Senator KERREY and I believe it is time to change this culture that has often served as a roadblock to producer access to new and improved products. Our legislation will, first, change the structure of the FCIC board of directors to bring reinsurance and expertise in the agriculture economy to the board. Second, make the FCIC the overseer of the RMA. Third, allow the RMA to continue to develop policies for specialty crops and underserved areas. 
   Fourth, to create an Office of Private Sector Partnership to serve as a liaison between private sector companies and the FCIC board of directors. Fifth, to leave the final approval or disapproval of all policies in the hands of the board. And, finally, allow companies to charge a minimal fee on each policy when one company decides to sell another company's product. Hopefully, Mr. President, this will allow the companies to recover the research and development costs and will encourage the creation of new policies. 
   While these steps will not be the answer to solving all of the problems in the Crop Insurance Program, we believe they will be an important step. Each year our producers put the seed in the ground with great faith and optimism and believe that, with a little faith and a little luck and the good Lord willing and the creeks not rising, they will produce a crop. But the task is not easy. Between the multiple risks of drought and flood and fire and hail and blizzard and disease and insects and also a little market interference in regard to the Federal Government, it often seems the deck is stacked against them. If producers do survive these risks, they are often still at the mercy of weakened exports, and Asian flu or the global contagion, as we call it, caused by a global financial crisis and inadequate access to foreign markets. 
   I will be the first to admit that reforming this program cannot come without budgetary costs. At the same time, I can think of no other industry that faces the number of multiple risks that must be addressed on an annual basis by those in production agriculture. 
   Congress must not and cannot be forced to pass these ad hoc disaster bills every year. We must give our producers the risk management tools that they need. I believe this legislation is an important first step, and I ask our colleagues to join Senator KERREY and myself in this difficult but absolutely vital task. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to my good friend and colleague, the Senator from Nebraska.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if I may respond to my distinguished friend, the whole goal of this is to provide the farmer and rancher with the risk management tools to enable that decisionmaking to be made by the individual producer as opposed to those of us in Washington who respond, as I indicated before, 
   it seems like almost even numbered years to the plight of those who are experiencing disasters. We think this program or this reform will certainly represent a lot more consistencies. 
   Yes, it will cost money, but if you add up the average $1.5 billion that we have paid in disaster programs, not to mention the $6 billion emergency bill as of last year, of course that is reflective of the loss of export demand we have seen because of the economic problems all over the world. But I certainly agree with my colleague and my cosponsor. 
   Mr. President, I have several unanimous consent requests, I tell my colleague, if I may offer them at this point. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators CRAIG, BURNS, HAGEL, DASCHLE, CONRAD,  and BAUCUS be added as original cosponsors on the bill just introduced by Senator KERREY and myself.

   Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I rise today to voice my strong support for this legislation that is designed to provide fair compensation, improved educational opportunities, enhanced financial saving program, and a fair retirement system for the men, women and families of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
   America is facing a serious crisis in the recruitment and retention of key members of the military. This crisis is a very complicated issue and one that has a complex answer. I am confident that the elements of this bill, S. 4, are an integral part of the solution to these problems. But I am also confident that passage alone will not correct all of the problems we face. 
   Near the end of the last Congress and after talking to soldiers in the field,  senior enlisted and officer leadership of the US military, I was struck with the myriad of problems facing our service members. These problems are contributing to the rapid decline in mid grade retention and the growing inability to recruit new members of our military. 
   I might add that I was just out to Fort Leavenworth, KS, and the Army is 40 percent short in regard to the recruiting targets they have to have to simply accomplish their mission. That is as of last week. I came to the floor and laid out what I saw as the key components of their discontent. Rather than restate my comments of last fall, let me just highlight my key points: 
   1. We have significantly increased the work load on a substantially smaller military. 
   Since the percentage of service members that are married has grown, this increased work load has amplified the negative effect of deployments on the morale of our troops and their families. The reluctance of families to continue to tolerate these separations contributes to the loss of mid-career personnel. 
   2. With a significantly increased deployment schedule on a substantially smaller force, the value and importance of today's missions impacts on the willingness of the men and women to join or commit to the military as a career. 
   Without clearly articulated mission 
   goals and objectives founded in the fundamental of the U.S. vital national interest, the ability to recruit and retain motivated men and women for our military will remain difficult. 
   3. Although the skill level required of the men and women of our military continues to grow, the pay differential between the same skilled civilian and the military continues to widen. 
   The current pay of many of our young military families is so low that it is not adequate to keep them off of welfare programs. The prospect of continued and frequent, long deployments coupled with the opportunity to get better pay on the ``outside'' for the same work contributes to the inability to attract and retain the skills needed for today's military. 
   4. We ask our military to deploy at a much higher pace than ever before, we assign missions that do not meet the ``national interest'' threshold, we pay them less than they could get for the same or similar skills as a civilian, and in many cases we ask them to live in substandard housing. 
   It goes without saying that the culmination of these problems contribute to the dissatisfaction with the military as a career and its attractiveness to potential recruits. 
   5. The members of our military are working harder, deploying more, receiving less pay than civilians are for the same job, living in inadequate housing, and now are seeing a reduction in their retirement benefits. 
   It is not difficult to understand that with this collection of negatives, the military is experiencing problems in retention and recruiting. 
   As I have stated before, S. 4 does not solve all of the problems contributing to the crisis in retention and recruiting but it does strike at the heart of many of the problems facing our military. Specifically: 
   It works to close the gap between civilian and military pay for similar skills. Just as importantly, 
   it reforms the military pay tables to better reward promotion rather than longevity. 
   It establishes a savings program by authorizing members of the military to put up to 5% of their basic pay in a thrift savings plan--a plan already available to other federal workers. Additionally, it allows service secretaries to focus some matching funds for the thrift savings plan to certain critical skills. 
   It corrects the problems of the current retirement system by giving service members a choice to stay on the current retirement plan and receive $30,000 to put in a savings plan for their future or opt to return to the pre 1986 retirement system. This $30,000 has been the subject of some discussion and perhaps some misunderstanding. I will address this issue later. 
   It works toward getting our military family off of food stamps by giving special pay to food-stamp eligible members. I find nothing more disheartening or embarrassing than to know that our military compensation is so marginal that we have families on food stamps. 
   It makes significant improvements to the Montgomery GI bill. The GI bill has long been a backbone in attracting and retaining military members.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan and my distinguished friend and colleague from Colorado for their time. 
   This is sort of a news update on Kosovo, if I could describe it that way, because several Senators have indicated a strong desire to offer amendments to this bill in regard to the United States' role in Kosovo. I hope that we won't do that. We need this bill to be expedited to send a strong message to our American men and women in uniform. This is not to say, however, that we do not need a frank discussion of ongoing discussions about the United States' role in regard to Kosovo. 
   I have, as of 3 o'clock this afternoon--we are about an hour after that--the latest report from the peace talks in Rambouillet, France. Secretary of State Albright has just indicated that:  
   After 17 days of laborious negotiations, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said today that ethnic Albanians have agreed to sign a Kosovo peace agreement within two weeks but the Serbs continue to balk at a deal.  
   I will go on with this very briefly.  
   According to senior U.S. officials, the Serbs still refuse to permit ethnic Albanians to have a president and are unwilling to cooperate with a war crimes tribunal looking into atrocities against civilians. * * * * * 
   At a news conference by the six-nation Contact Group overseeing the talks, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine announced that a new conference on the Kosovo conflict would be held in France beginning March 15.  
   So we have a lull. So the peace talks can continue. A cynic might say we drew a line in the sand. And yet, at another time we have gone beyond that line in the sand and our credibility is at stake. 
   Robin Cook, Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, called for the parties to ``use these three weeks, use them to build peace....... We have done a lot here, even if we have not done enough.'' 
   The agreement came 1 1/2 hours after the deadline for the peace conference had passed. However, in regard to the Serbs, the news is not that good, to say the least. Their Deputy Prime Minister has described the talks as a bust, blaming the United States officials, who he said ``want the blood of the Serbs.'' 
   He said, ``I am afraid the Rambouillet conference failed and we must say very clearly who is guilty for that. But peace appeared as elusive''--right during these talks, Mr. President. ``New fighting''--or continued fighting. Actually, it is old and continued and new fighting--``broke out between the Yugoslav army troops and the Serb police and the ethnic Albanian rebels.'' 
   So we still have war. 
   The reason I brought all of that up is that there was an article in Monday's Washington Post written by Dr. Henry Kissinger. I think Dr. Kissinger has pretty well summed up some of the concerns, at least, and the frustrations that many Senators have in regard to the lack of clarity in regard to the situation in Kosovo. And, of course, it affects everything we do in the Balkans, not to mention Bosnia. 
   Dr. Kissinger said this:  
   In Bosnia, the exit strategy can be described. The existing dividing lines can be made permanent. Failure to do so will require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we change our objective to self-determination and permit each ethnic group to decide its own fate.  
   But in Kosovo, Dr. Kissinger certainly pointed out that option doesn't exist. There are no ethnic dividing lines and both sides actually claim the entire territory. Our attitude, the U.S. attitude toward the Serbs attempts to insist that their claim has been made plain. It is the threat of bombing. But how do we and NATO react to Albanian transgressions? Are we prepared to fight both sides and for how long? 
   As a matter of fact, Secretary Albright indicated if the Albanians didn't get along, we could not bomb the Serbs. That seems to me to be a little bit unprecedented and unique. As a matter of fact, I think it is a little nutty. 
   But at any rate, are we prepared to fight both sides and for how long?  
   In the face of issues such as these, the unity of the contact group of powers acting on behalf of NATO is likely to dissolve. Russia surely will increasingly emerge as the supporter of the Serbian point of view.  
   And then Dr. Kissinger goes on, and I will not take the time of the Senate in regard to his entire statement, but he sums up by saying: ``Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North Korea.'' 
   You draw the line in the sand. That time expires, and it is a problem in terms of our credibility.  
   The psychological drain may be even more grave. Each time we make a peripheral deployment, the administration is constrained to insist that the danger to American forces is minimal--the Kosovo deployment is officially described as a ``peace implementation force.'' 
   Such comments have two unfortunate consequences: They increase the impression among Americans that military force can be used casualty-free,--  
   And obviously that is a big concern on the part of everyone--  
   and they send a signal of weakness to potential enemies. For in the end our forces will be judged on how adequate they are for peace imposition, not peace implementation.

   Mr. ROBERTS. The reason that I brought this up is that we have several Senators who are considering amendments on Kosovo. One I think would simply say that the Congress would have to vote before any deployment of any American pilot in any kind of a military mission and/or ground troops would set foot on Kosovo. That is the extra step, if you will, to certainly include the Congress in any decisionmaking. But I would point out to my colleagues, and I made mention of this when I spoke on behalf of this bill, i.e., the bill in regard to retirement reform and pay reform, and I pointed out that we have in the law--and let me just point out it is Public Law 105-262, October 17, 1998. It is a public law, and the President signed it. And there is section 8115(a), and we say:  
   None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act may be obligated or expended for any additional deployment of forces of the Armed Forces of the United States to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia unless and until the President, after consultation with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the minority of the Senate, transmits to Congress a report on the deployment that includes the following:  
   And I want my colleagues to understand this. This is the law of the land. And the National Security Council is aware of this. As a matter of fact, my staff just an hour ago contacted the staff at the National Security Council, and we said, ``Where is the report?'' We keep hearing about progress and incremental steps or lack of progress with the peace talks and yet we have 4,000, 5,000, maybe 7,000 American troops ready to deploy in regard to Kosovo. This requires the administration to come to the Congress and report on the following things:  
   The President's certification that the presence of those forces in each country to which the forces are to be deployed is necessary in the national security interests of the United States.  
   That is pretty basic. Does our involvement really involve our vital national security interests? Can a case be made? 
   Now, the President spoke to it in terms of his radio address. I think that is good. That is the first time he has spoken to it on national radio. But we really need to know why is our intervention in Kosovo in our vital national security interests? Is it the future of NATO? I think so to some degree. Are we talking about we don't want another Palestine in the middle of Central Europe? I know that. But vital national security interests? I don't know.

   Mr. ROBERTS. I had directed that question, sir, to the White House counsel. It was my intent to direct it to White House counsel. I do not know what the proper procedure would be at this time.
