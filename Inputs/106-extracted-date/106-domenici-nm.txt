   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut who just came off a major campaign. We welcome him back to the Senate. He has never stopped being a Senator, but he has been very busy doing other things. 
   I yield so he can speak. I will speak following his remarks. So I ask unanimous consent that Senator LIEBERMAN be permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes, and then I ask consent Senator DOMENICI be permitted to speak for 15 minutes thereafter.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when I yielded time to my good friend from Alaska, I did not think I would be hearing what I just heard. I am pleased I was here when he discussed this issue of paramount importance to his State. 
   It is most interesting that a Senator can come to the floor of the Senate and tell us all something that is very important to his State, even though the State is a small State. It is great that our Constitution gives our States representation based upon statehood and not upon population of the State. I trust the administration and others will see fit to work with Senator STEVENS so we will all be out of here before Christmas.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk about a crisis that the leadership in America does not want to tell the American people about, and certainly the leadership does not want to try to solve this basic problem which is the most serious problem confronting us now. 
   I thought it would be fair and right, since this is what I believe and this is what I understand and before we have a new President, for at least one Senator--and I hope there will be others--to remind the American people that we are in the midst of an American energy crisis. Unless and until it becomes critical to millions of Americans in their daily lives, it is very hard for Americans to think we have a crisis, but there is a growing, creeping crisis of paralysis that will occur in America because we do not have enough energy that is approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and that we can add to our inventories and resources. 
   The crisis is coming close. Californians may be asking some questions. They ought to be. The media of the United States is not asking them yet. The great State of California, if you put that State alongside countries, is either the third or fourth largest economic unit in the world. In other words, in terms of gross domestic product, California is either third or fourth in the world. 
   There are brownouts happening in California, USA, which means there is not enough distributable electricity in the power lines, in the grid of California, to permit people to continue operating day by day as if there is sufficient energy for anything and everything they choose to do. 
   I hope some people start asking: Who did this to us? Why are we in this condition? I predict this will creep across America, and I only hope we do not blame the next President for what has occurred before his watch. We do not have anyone in a leadership position at the executive branch of America, from the President on down, who is telling the American people that we have a big, big energy problem and that there are solutions, but it will mean we have to make some tough decisions. 
   I want to talk a moment about what energy means. 
   The reason the United States is powerful, the reason we can have a strong military, the reason we have the best material things in our daily lives--more houses, more cars, more refrigerators--and people can continue to aspire to be materially sound in America with our economy growing robustly, adding people to the payrolls and giving them more money per unit of time, giving them a better standard of living and a life to lead, is because we have energy. Without energy, we cannot grow, and I do not mean grow from the standpoint of adding a subdivision; I mean grow from the standpoint of putting to work for us in our daily lives the kinds of things that use energy and give us productivity, jobs, and economic growth. Without an energy supply, that cannot happen. 
   I want to talk a moment about our goals for the world. 
   We have used some really nice words--``globalization,'' for one. The way I see it, America would like poor countries to get rich. We would like poor people in the world to have more, not fewer, material things. Believe me, these poor nations are beginning to look at the world and ask: How about us? Can't we grow? Can't we have prosperity? 
   Let me give an answer as I see it. If the world is expected to grow and prosper using current 
   American restraints on energy sources, it is impossible for us to grow and the poor to grow because they need huge quantities of energy to grow. Do we want to be part of that? If we do, how can we hide our heads and not encourage that all sources of energy be looked at from the standpoint of the benefits versus the costs--the cost to a country, to the environment. 
   Because of the inability to make hard decisions, we are just about to make our country a natural gas environment. We have almost abandoned coal. We have almost abandoned cleaning up coal so we can use it. 
   People are wondering what is happening to natural gas prices. When we say to the American people that all you can use in new powerplants is natural gas, all you can use for anything now because of environmental concerns is natural gas, and then we say we cannot produce it on American lands, on American property, on American public domain--I am looking across the aisle at a Senator who is always talking about coal, coal mining. Let me tell him, there is currently a study that says the United States of America has 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. We use 20 a year. That is almost 10 years of total supply. We have it locked up in American public domain, in American real estate that we own as a people, because we are frightened to make decisions about letting people explore for it or drill for it. In fact, we have case after case where almost nonsensical restraints lock it up so we cannot use it. 
   I submit that the challenge for the new President is to be courageous and for his Secretary of Energy to be courageous. First, we had better define the problem for the American people. A Senator this morning came to the floor and spoke about our growth. I say to my friend from Colorado, we seem to be having a downward trend in our gross domestic product, and everybody wants to tell Alan Greenspan how to do his business. That is OK. That is what Senators do. Everyone claims Alan Greenspan in the last decade did the best job of steering us in the direction of sustained growth, high employment without inflation. I say to my friends, there can be no sustained growth at 2.7 per year or 3.3 per year, which gives us a lot of power in our economy, if we do not have energy to use. We cannot do that with brownouts across America. 
   That, in and of itself, and the increased price will cause America's economy to sputter and slow down, and somebody will be blamed. I submit, do not blame the new President and do not blame the new Secretary. They may have to tell us the truth. They may have to tell us we cannot as a nation get by hiding our heads from new energy sources, such as advanced new technology in the nuclear area. 
   I think we are going to have to start talking about it realistically with the American people. 
   Do you know in South Africa they are about to build a module--that means a small powerplant--with brand new nuclear technology that, number one, means the powerplant can never melt; it is passive; it will turn itself off at a certain temperature. 
   Do you know that powerplant they are trying to build will not use light water? Their gas-cooled design may be much simpler, much safer, and produce less waste (but some) than light water systems. 
   We here in America are working on nuclear research and the like related to that kind of addition, but we are doing it in such a quiet way because we are fearful that some will rise up and get angry about it. Angry they may get, but the truth is, if the American people  understand that we can move in that direction--carefully, slowly--adding some diversity to our energy supply, we can also do a better job in cleaning up our coal and using some of it for electricity. 
   We can, indeed, open up our public lands to exploration instead of hiding them, as if drilling a well that produces huge amounts of natural gas for Americans--and for whatever we need to grow and prosper--as if that is something terrible rather than something very good. It is something where we ought to hold our heads up and say: We own it. It is American. If we produce it, it is ours. We do not have to be dependent. 
   And, yes, there is no question that we ought to look at the refining capacity of America. We have not built a new refinery in 16 years, I say to the occupant of the chair. 
   What is that all about? It is because we have put environmental rules ahead of America's energy needs. We refuse to look at real cost benefits and reasonable mainstream protection rather than extraordinary protection that in many instances is meaningless but costly and many times stops the production of things such as refineries, pipelines, and the like. 
   I have much more that I will talk about from time to time on the floor of the Senate, but I come today to say, I hope we do not have to turn off our Christmas trees in New Mexico during this Christmas season, nor in the Senator's State of Colorado. I hope we can turn them back on in California. 
   Frankly, the only reason they cannot--and the only reason California suffers--is because nobody will make tough decisions. We are sitting back suggesting that things are really going well; that we will fix the American energy supply with windmills. I can deliver a specific talk on why that will not work for all our energy, but we ought to continue it. But it will never give us the kind of energy supply we need as we look to the future. 
   Do you know that the underdeveloped countries of the world, which intend to grow--and we say to them: Grow, prosper--by 2020 will use as much energy as the United States of America? Where are they going to get it? What are they going to use? What are we going to suggest they do? 
   Are we going to sit back and say America can grow but they can't? Are we going to say they can use some new kind of energy source but we won't? 
   So our leadership in the world, moving towards democratization and growth and prosperity for the poorest of nations, will come to a grinding halt if, in fact, we cannot have energy supply in the world. 
   Why should we have an agreement to preserve ambient air qualities and in that report not mention nuclear power? Why should leaders do that? I have had experts, physicists, who know what they are talking about, saying that alone is enough to put that document over here on a table and declare that it is not real. 
   If you want clean air in the future, you cannot say we will do it by using only natural gas, that we will not build any more coal burning powerplants, even though we could develop the technology to do that, that we will not consider nuclear power, even though we have a nuclear Navy that since 1954 has gone all through the waters of the seas and oceans of the world with it, with one or two powerplants right inside the hull of the boat, with never an accident. Never has anything happened, and we are so frightened we will not even talk about it. 
   I think we will talk about it. I think we will talk about opening up American public domain for production. I think we will have a real debate about ANWR, rather than an emotional debate, a real one about what we ought to do to relate our energy needs to that area of the world, not just putting our hands up and saying it cannot be touched, that you can do nothing. 
   So there is much to be talked about and much leadership needed. But the point is, energy problems in America, without major changes, will get more pronounced. We will have more crises; the prices will go higher, not lower across the board in America for gasoline and natural gas. 
   I am hopeful the new President will put somebody in the Department of Energy who will help America address this issue with its eyes open, ready to make some really tough decisions. 
   But the biggest thing I seek is to set the record straight. When that occurs, as the energy crisis creeps across America, I hope we will remember that the seeds have been sown before the swearing in of this President. They are there; the lack of doing the right thing in America is already in place. 
   This President and his Cabinet and his Secretary and his Environmental Protection Agency head are going to have to help solve a crisis they did not create. We ought to know that, and we ought to set the record straight that that is the case. 
   I want to close by saying there is plenty of blame to go around. But we will not solve this problem without some leadership that is willing to tell us the truth and suggest that there is really no need for the State of California to be running out of electricity. It is because we have been shortsighted, misled--and they have been in their State because there is the potential for plenty of energy to go around out there. We just have to decide that America needs energy for its future, and that we cannot grow more dependent, that we ought to grow less dependent. 
   So rather than proceed with details about each of the sources of energy which I had chosen to talk about today, I will do that on another day. Suffice it to say, we will not continue to grow--the Federal Reserve Board notwithstanding--if we cannot solve the problem of how much energy we need and make sure we have it. 
   Some people thought that because of Silicon Valley, because it is so clean and because it is built around new technology and computerization, we would not need new energy sources. But it turns out that if you want that kind of growth and 
   that kind of productivity increase, and if you want the future of our country to be built upon the technology that evolved with the Silicon Valley in California and other mini ``silicon valleys,'' you need a lot of energy to create the new productivity that that brings to America. 
   I want to also add that new technology, led by computerization, is part of the reason we have had the sustained growth; they added a dimension of productivity we did not even measure for many years. They added growth to technology by way of productivity increases: The more computers you had, the more you got out of your personnel per unit of work. You got more because of high technology. That has added immensely to our productivity and has permitted us to grow without inflation. That is peaking out. 
   Surely, if we do not add more energy to the mix of the base, we will have to start trading off one source of growth in America for another. I do not believe that is going to work, and somebody will be blamed, especially since it does not have to happen. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, recently the city of Cloudcroft, New Mexico was named one of the world's ``10 Overlooked and Underrated Winter Destinations,'' by the editors of Fodor's Travel Publications. 
   Cloudcroft hasn't changed much over the years. There are more summer homes than before, but the permanent population has not grown substantially, and the Village still maintains a small-town atmosphere that is so appealing to the tourists who come from every state in the Union and many foreign countries. They appreciate the attitude of the locals and the laid-back feeling of the community as contrasted to the high-speed life in the big cities. 
   Cloudcroft is located in the southeastern area of New Mexico. A small mountain village located in the heart of the Lincoln National Forest. It is a great travel location for both the outdoors and indoors visitors. For individuals who enjoy the outdoors, it offers year-round hiking, mountain biking, skiing, golfing and other activities. For the indoors visitors it offers a variety of unique shops, restaurants, and museums. 
   Cloudcroft is not commonly known for its glitzy ski resorts like other cities in New Mexico but rather as a perfect location for families learning the ropes. It offers a number of great inns and the distinction of having no stoplights. A great place for families to take their vacations. Children can play outside and adults can enjoy the quietness of the village. 
   Cloudcroft offers several festive events such as the New Year's Eve Torchlight Parade down the Cloudcroft mountain, caroling in the Clouds and Currier & Ives Candelit Christmas in December, or the full-moon ice-skating in February. 
   When visiting Cloudcroft, one must not miss the opportunity to go sledding on the dunes of White Sands National Monument or visit the Sunspot National Solar Observatory. No matter  what your preference, Cloudcroft has an activity for you. 
   Many of us share a passion for travel, but often times finding a good location is not always easy. However, Cloudcroft truly is a city often overlooked by most. With its great weather, shopping and mountains, I am proud to say Cloudcroft is a part of New Mexico.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I am very sorry to ask for that. I thought Senators on our side had control. I am very pleased Senator MURRAY yielded to me. 
   Mr. President, I come this morning to speak about my friend, SLADE GORTON, who is leaving the Senate shortly. I thought I better do it today because, as most things around here, when you can get them done you ought to because time flies and all of a sudden we find Senator GORTON is out of the Senate and we have to speak before he leaves. Today, I want to take a few minutes to share with him and his wife Sally, whom I hope will have occasion to read the RECORD, having served with him in each of his 18 years in the Senate, what he has contributed and who he is. 
   It will not take me a long time to speak about him, although to tell the truth, he probably is more noteworthy in my life in terms of being a co-Senator on many things that are very big and important to our Nation than any other single Senator here.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate all the Senators who have been working on this issue and, in particular, the chairman who is standing here, Senator GRASSLEY, and has been here many times. 
   Today, in an extended session, we will finally reform the bankruptcy laws of America. They are very important because credit in America, be it from banks, from individual lenders, wherever, is really the heartbeat of what makes us tick and permits us to give our citizens material means. Without credit, things do not work in America. 
   Every now and then, we have to fix the bankruptcy laws so they work in behalf of not only the debtors but the creditors of America. That is what we are doing here. I think it will pass overwhelmingly. 
   My thanks to those who have worked so hard on it. I cannot claim to be one of them. 
   Again, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY has great persistence, and this is a tribute to him and a good start to his chairmanship of the Finance Committee. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fissile Material Loan Guarantee Act. This Act is intended to increase the arsenal of programs that reduce proliferation threats from the Russian nuclear weapons complex. 
   This Act presents an unusual option, which I've been discussing with the leadership of some of the world's largest private banks and lending institutions and with senior officials of the Russian Federation's Ministry for Atomic Energy. I also am aware that discussions between Western lending institutions and the Russian Federation are progressing well and that discussions with the International Atomic Energy Authority or IAEA have helped to clarify their responsibilities. 
   This Act would enable the imposition of international protective safeguards on new, large stocks of Russian weapons-ready materials in a way that enables the Russian Federation to gain near-term financial resources from the same materials. The Act requires that these resources be used in support of non-proliferation or energy programs within Russia. It also requires that the materials used to collateralize these loans must remain under international IAEA safeguards forevermore. 
   This Act does not replace programs that currently are in place to ensure that weapons-grade materials can  never be used in weapons in the future. The Highly Enriched Uranium or HEU Agreement is moving toward elimination of 500 tons of Russian weapons-grade uranium. The Plutonium Disposition Agreement is similarly working on elimination of 34 tons of Russian weapons-grade plutonium. 
   The HEU agreement removes material usable in 20,000 nuclear weapons, while the plutonium disposition agreement similarly removes material for more than 4,000 nuclear weapons. Both of these agreements enable the transition of Russian materials into commercial reactor fuel, which, after use in a reactor, destroys its ``weapons-grade'' attributes. There should be no question that both these agreements remain of vital importance to both nations. 
   But estimates are that the Russian Federation has vast stocks of weapons-grade materials in addition to the amounts they've already declared as surplus to their weapons needs in these earlier agreements. If we can provide additional incentives to Russia to encourage transition of more of these materials into configurations where it is not available for diversion or re-use in weapons, we've made another significant step toward global stability. 
   By introducing this Act now, Mr. President, I'm hoping that this concept will be carefully reviewed by all interested parties--by the new Administration, by lending institutions, and by the Russian Federation. My hope is that in the next Congress, these interests can come together to enable this new approach to still further reduce the proliferation threats from surplus weapons materials in the Russian nuclear weapons complex.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the end of this session of the 106th Congress Brian Benczkowski will be leaving my staff. Brian has worked on the Hill since his third year in law school. He started as an intern while still in law school, served as the senior analyst for judiciary issues for the Senate Budget Committee, and worked closely with my general counsel to develop, and enact, over the President's veto, the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
   Brian was my counsel for the second round of Whitewater hearings and was part of the team for the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton. Brian worked on Juvenile Justice legislation and helped me take on the Mexican drug lords. 
   He learned the highway, airport and other infrastructure needs of New Mexico as well as any Highway and Transportation Secretary in any Governor's cabinet. He was knowledgeable on immigration issues and helped my caseworkers with the really tough, but worthy immigration problems that are a daily fact of life in a border state. Just to prove that Brian had a soft side, he was my staff person for Character Counts during the 106th Congress. 
   Brian was instrumental in drafting the claims process legislation for the victims of the Cerro Grande fire. From the date that the fire first started to the day that the President signed the bill, complete with the $640 million to pay the claims, was fifty days. It is a good legislative product, and it proved that the delegation and the Congress could be bipartisan and act expeditiously in an emergency. 
   Brian is a talented lawyer, a caring and hard working member of my staff. 
   For a young man raised in Virginia, taught the law in Missouri with parents now living in Connecticut, he has made many New Mexico friends, developed a taste for green chile and amassed an understanding of the border. At one point I remarked that his Spanish was as good as any other staff member in my office. 
   So what is it that such a talented young man would choose to do when leaving Capitol Hill? 
   Banking legislative assistants and counsels with backgrounds in securities often end up at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission or at one of the Wall Street firms. However, the typical career path wouldn't do for this untypically talented young lawyer. He is going to New York to work for the first, real sports stock market! 
   This new sports stock market will list the baseball and other trading cards of today's marquee athletes and major league sports rising stars. Just like any major stock exchange, the exchange is a market maker. Just like E-trade or Ameritrade people will have sports brokerage accounts. 
   Brian is a baseball fan, former baseball player and a font of knowledge when it comes to sports. As a former minor league baseball player myself, I know baseball and am a fan of most other sports. ESPN was a great invention that adds to most men's enjoyment of life, sports and the pursuit of happiness. Hopefully, this new sports stock exchange will add another dimension to the way we all follow sports. 
   Many of us share a passion for sports, but very few of us get to take that passion, and merge it with the law, get a impressive title like Assistant General Counsel, receive a pay check and stock options. However, Brian is going to do just that at thePit.com. I wish him and his new company every success.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I open by saying if I have heard it once in the last 2 months, I have heard it 40 times as the other side of the aisle tries to convince us and the American people that what really has made the American economy so strong, with its 22 million new jobs, is the fact that they voted on a tax increase bill in the year 1993 that amounted to $247 billion over 5 years, and it is called the Clinton-Gore plan, in quotation marks; sometimes referred to on the floor as ``the plan.'' 
   Before we are through this evening, we hope we can convince our colleagues that that plan had very little to do with the state of economic well-being, jobs, and confidence of the American people today. 
   However, there are several subjects I want to touch on quickly, because the other side cannot come to the floor for 15, 20, or 30 minutes without talking about them. The first one is what the plan of the Governor of Texas on Social Security is going to do to our senior citizens. They proceed as if they know, and they don't know. 
   The distinguished Governor from Texas has given us an idea. The idea is to let every senior who is on Social Security keep their check and the program remain totally intact while we let younger Americans invest a little piece of their Social Security money in a preferred or protected account in the stock market. 
   They come down here and do some arithmetic gymnastics, which is hard for any one to understand. They support their statements by citing the Secretary of the Treasury, a genius I believe they called him. We all know Secretary Summers. We all know he is rather bright. We all know he was a very young Harvard Ph.D. faculty member. But for him to take to the streets telling Americans he knows what that Bush plan is going to do to senior citizens is absolutely deplorable. I have seen Secretaries of the Treasury come and go. We had a great one before this one. Never have I seen anybody attempt to do this. 
   I want to tell the American people the truth about the Vice President's plan on Social Security. I would almost say there is no plan because, in fact, the plan he is talking about is accepted by so few in the Congress, despite the fact that it has been around since 1999, in case anybody is interested. 
   You know, we voted on it a couple times in the Budget Committee. I think perhaps that there was one time when a Democrat voted for it--one member. I think we might have forced a vote on the floor that included that and nobody voted for it. 
   So what is the Vice President's plan? I will tell you plain and simple. He wants to put some new IOUs in the trust account for senior citizens, and the IOU says we, the American people, promise to pay to the trust fund the face value of these IOUs. He says let's put about $10 billion worth in there. Guess what happens. He puts them in there a few years from now and indicates that that helps make Social Security solvent. 
   So that the American people might understand an IOU in the parlance of your checkbook, it is a postdated check. Have you ever postdated a check? It used to be illegal. It may still be if you do it with the intent to cheat. But some people postdate a check and say, I won't have the money for 2 months, so will you take my check and it will be good then. That is what an IOU is--except the Congressional Budget Office says 50 years from now, when the IOUs all come due, the total amount that the taxpayers of America will owe to that fund will be $40 trillion--not billion but trillion, $40 trillion. 
   Who will owe it? Well, of course, the Vice President is not worried about that today; right? It is our children who are going to pay it, I say to the occupant of the chair. Some day down the line, we are going to have to raise taxes generally or raise the Social Security withholding tax so high that it probably will make the program inoperative and ineffective. 
   It is amazing that the Secretary of the Treasury and the people on that side of the aisle--my friends, the Democrats of the Senate--would talk about the plan of the Governor of  Texas when their candidate has a plan before us that would eventually require that we raise taxes--and I left out an option--or dramatically cut programs. They would have to cut American programs to the tune of $40 trillion over this period, or raise new taxes. 
   Now you would think if you had a plan that was that embarrassing, you would not have the courage to get up and critique other programs that actually do try to reform Social Security. Democratic Senator PAT MOYNIHAN and Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska have both stressed the need to reform Social Security, which is just what Governor Bush is trying to do. 
   Now my Democratic colleagues also have another line of argument. They say that what we really should do is pay down the debt. They then say, why are Republicans against that? Well, they know we aren't. We have already paid down $360 billion of debt over the last three years. The greatest threat to debt reduction is the Vice President of the United States' spending proposals. He has asked for 200 new programs and has a complicated tax code proposal. Let me address this latter point briefly. My Democratic colleagues have attacked Governor Bush's tax plan tonight, however, it is based on the very sound principle that everybody who pays income tax should get a break. That's not the case under the Gore plan, where 50 million American taxpayers get no break at all. Why? Because taxpaying Americans don't get a tax break. It is Americans who are selected by the Vice President's plan. If you meet their criterion--if you're the ``right'' kind of person--you get a tax break. But that doesn't mean everybody paying income taxes gets a tax break. 
   Now let's get back to the size of the Government that Vice President GORE would fund. Let me give you an example of the charades he plays in order to say he is not spending very much money. See, I have estimated the plan, and it spends a lot of money. I ask Senator GRAMM if he knows that the Vice President's Retirement Savings Plus (RSP) plan, the one that is going to help low income Americans save money, which he talks about so much--i.e. if someone saves $500, the government will match this 
   contribution 3:1, thus giving this person an additional $1500 of taxpayer money for deposit to their savings account--do you know when that plan would be fully implemented under his proposal? Nine years from today, assuming he wins. So the centerpiece of his ``tax'' plan would not fully phase-in until after two full Presidential terms and 1 year. If you assume such an unrealistic phase-in, of course, it won't cost very much. But neither should anybody kid themselves that his budget isn't full of those timing gimmicks, in order to give the appearance that he does not spend the Social Security surplus. 
   There are all kinds of strange dates such as the RSP one. In fact, this major one he speaks about being such a good plan for low-income Americans to save money, I repeat, won't go fully phase-in until 9 years after he is elected, if he is elected. The Vice President has not provided enough information to tell when all of his 200 programs phase-in. But I can tell you that if you just look at the overall programs and add them up cumulatively in your mind, there has not been a bigger increase in American programs since Lyndon Baines Johnson invented the Great Society. 
   Now what actually happens under the plan of the Governor of Texas is very simple. Of the surplus, he says 50 percent will be saved for Social Security and debt reduction. If you want to go add that up, it looks as though he would pay off the debt entirely by the middle of the next decade. Frankly, if that could happen, what a marvelous thing it would be. If Democrats keep pushing for more spending, we might not do it that fast, although I can tell you the money is there barring that. 50 percent of the projected surpluses is for Social Security and debt reduction under the plan of the Governor of Texas, 25 percent is to be given back to the American people since it is their money to begin with, with every taxpayer getting a tax cut of some type, and 25 percent goes toward new priorities, new things such as increased defense or money we may need to add to the Medicare program to pay for prescription drugs. The ratio is 50, 25, 25. 
   The other side of the aisle likes to get up and brag about how they are paying down the debt. I submit to you that if you took the litany of Gore programs and what he wants to do in every area to increase things such as prescription drugs for everyone, as he suggests, in the manner he suggests, debt reduction will suffer. His new programs are very costly and we expect the cost estimates to rise the more that people look at them. Let's look at prescription drugs. When that program was first submitted to the Congress by President Clinton, we thought it would cost $120 billion. The last reference we have from the Congressional Budget Office says that plan would cost $430 billion. 
   So you see, there is no question that there is not going to be very much money left over if you put all those programs the Vice President has in mind into effect and give them to the American people in a reasonable period of time. If you want to delay them incessantly, obviously they won't cost much; but will the American people think they have been fooled if that is the case and he is to get elected? I believe they will wonder, what in the world were they talking about when they told us they were going to give us that? 
   I want to also say that when it comes to reducing the size of Government--I want to repeat one more time, our friends on the other side always cite the total number of reductions in employees that have occurred since Bill Clinton took office. What they don't tell you is that 96 percent--and I just put it in the RECORD 2 days ago, and it comes from the Office of Management and Budget, not Domenici's staff--OMB says 96 percent of all employee reductions, described as stripping down Government, came from civilians in the Department of Defense. In other words, we started drawing down that Department of Defense so quickly and rapidly, and continued it, so 96 percent of the employee reduction comes from the Department of Defense, and 4 percent comes from all the other civilian programs, which they would lead you to believe have been seriously restrained and many employees have been taken from their ranks. Not true. 
   I will shortly yield to my friend from Texas for about 20 minutes. However, before I do, I want to point something out. When my Democratic colleagues speak of the Clinton plan for the recovery of the United States, which caused America to have all these 22 million new jobs, new high technology, and breakthroughs in communications--and I say that facetiously--, they ignore the fact that the first plan the President sent to us was a $26 billion stimulus package for American economy, even though the economy had already begun posting strong growth before he took office. Does my friend from Texas recall that? 
   Standing right back over there was the Senator from the State of Colorado, who is now retired. He came to the floor and told us what was in that $26 billion that we were supposed to spend. He found all kinds of things that were promised to mayors during the election and to all kinds of groups in America by the Governor of Arkansas as he campaigned. I can't remember. Some of them were igloos, and all kinds of strange things--skating rinks for some communities. 
   The first thing we did was to say we aren't going to do that. The first phase of the recovery plan was a $26 billion stimulus which never occurred. That would have caused more money to be spent, not less. 
   To lead into what is being said on the other side of the aisle, and by our President and by our Vice President about this plan--the 1993 tax increase of $243 billion--, I would like to hearken back to Alan Greenspan, who coined a phrase. Perhaps my friend from Texas remembers it. He used two words, ``irrational exuberance.'' Do you recall that, Senator GRAMM? Irrational exuberance? 
   I am going to borrow that phrase today--not to describe the speculative activities in the stock market, as Dr. Greenspan did, but rather to describe my colleagues who have been attributing the 1993 Clinton/Gore tax increase budget plan as the genesis of this long boom we have been experiencing. 
   I want to talk shortly about what really caused the boom. But I understand my friend from Texas would like  to speak for 20 minutes. I yield that off my time, reserving the remainder for myself. 
   I want to say just before I yield that I have looked at some polls that somebody presented--maybe even some polls that were published. 
   I am thrilled with the American people because you know they don't believe the irrational exuberance of the other side. They do not believe it. 
   They come down here and keep on saying it, but the American people just do not believe it. 
   The primary reason for this boom has been the evenhandedness of the Federal Reserve Board in making sure we do not let inflation go rampant, and controlling interest rates where they could so that the American economy would always grow, and if it was coming down, to have a safe landing. 
   They put that No. 1. 
   In terms of who did it, Dr. Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve deserve much of the credit. 
   The American people, no matter how many times the plan is discussed about the 22 million jobs and all the other things, they do not believe it. And they shouldn't. 
   Who do they put in second position as responsible for this? I didn't think it was going to be the case because we don't do a very good job of talking about it. But they said the Republican Congress which puts some real controls on spending. 
   When we are finished tonight, we will show you that actually happened when we took over the U.S. Congress. 
   In third place, in terms of who did it, who brought it, they put the President's plan. 
   I yield to my friend from Texas.

   Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will hold up the health care plan again, I say to Senator GRAMM, I want to make a statement about it. I made a mistake. If you look at the President's FY 1995 budget and health plan, it would have increased outlays by $1.4 trillion--I said billion. Billions are gone; they are not in our vocabulary. The $1.4 trillion is the additional outlays that the President's budget and health plan would have generated if we'd adopted his plan versus the outlays that the government actually recorded over the five years covered by his budget. 
   You heard Senator GRAMM describe one of the most significant indicators of prosperity--the 30-year Treasury bond yield. Here is the chart that describes precisely what he spoke of. Here is 1993. You see shortly after that, yields drop a little bit. But then look at what happens in the middle of 1993. It goes to its highest rate on this chart. Yields only begin to fall again after 1995 and the election of a Republican Congress. After that, yields come back down on a sustained basis. 
   I want to just insert a comment, since there is so much talk about us doing nothing here. This is sort of extraneous, but I think it is terribly relevant to our discussion. This is a late-this-evening quote from the President of the United States:  
   Again, we have accomplished so much in this session of Congress in a bipartisan fashion. It has been one of the most productive sessions.  
   He goes on and asks for more. But for all those who have been listening, again, to the ``mythology,'' to borrow one of Senator GRAMM's words, that we have not had a very productive Congress, let me say the President of the United States spoke today and that is what he said. 
   Let me say to the American people, to all the investors who took risks, to all of the people who invested in new technology since 1993--we will just use that date--to all the millions of Americans who get up every day and work hard and raise their standard of living: You know that it was not ``the plan'' that caused America to achieve again and grow again. Let me suggest we have had one of the most remarkable productivity increases during the last five years of this recovery that we have had ever in American history. We had a period right after the Second World War that rivaled this in productivity. 
   Did the productivity of the investors, risk takers, American workers, the banks with new technology, the new computers--did all that happen because we had a plan to raise taxes $243 billion? Of course not. Of course not. Did that $243 billion tax increase reduce inflation and cause it to stay down? Of course not. Productivity did, and international trade did, and the Federal Reserve Board did. That is the kind of thing that made America's prosperity so significant in the past decade. 
   Did that tax increase reduce regulatory burden, which all American companies will tell you started falling under Ronald Reagan, and has continued up to the recent telecommunications deregulation? That was not a result of the ``plan,'' that $243 billion tax increase. Deregulation was part of giving American business more freedom to achieve, expand, and to do things in the most efficient way rather than the most burdensome way. 
   Did it help business become more efficient in managing its inventories? Of course not. The 1993 budget plan had nothing to do with it. Just-in-time inventory management had a lot to do with it, making firms' profits go up and their efficiency increase. 
   We could go on. Did global trade, which essentially kept inflation under control and opened new horizons to American business--was that impacted by the $243 billion ``plan'' which we hear regularly? No. It is only ``irrational exuberance'' that would cause my Democratic colleagues to claim that the 1993 tax hike generated today's marvelous economy. 
   I am not sure that ``irrational exuberance'' is even an adequate word with which to describe the day-after-day trek to the floor of the Senate Democrats to remind us that all good things came from that day, that day when a difficult vote was taken to increase taxes dramatically. I think the American people understand that the 1993 budget plan had little to do with where we are and where we are going to end up. It is because we have a free economy and we have made it freer. 
   Frankly, let the people judge whether we are more apt to keep this economy going if we have a tax reform measure that gives everybody some of their money back to spend as they see fit. I believe they will say that that gives this economy a much better chance than 200 new programs that the Government is going to run which we do not have today, and we estimate--and I think this is a modest estimate--that we could not administer with less than 20,000 new employees. 
   Americans understand their prosperity does not come from the size of our National Government. Maybe it is inverse to the size of our National Government. I believe that might be a fairer estimate of America and the world. Maybe the smaller our National Government gets, the better we will compete and that is very important in the global economy. 
   I do say the President of the United States deserves credit on trade. Had some Democrats said that votes to further free trade were an important reason behind our strong growth, I would have agreed with them on that point. Trade has been an important positive in the chain of things that have happened to make economic life better in these United States. 
   I have time remaining. If there are any Senators on our side who want to speak----

   Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my good friend from Alabama, that is absolutely true, and he probably heard me on the floor today. I mentioned enough subjects, but capital gains was also on my list because we've gotten some very unexpected returns to the Treasury from this source. Clearly, the 1997 capital gains reduction--which we accomplished and the President signed although it wasn't high on his list--has been one important factor behind this surplus that is now carrying us into this better period with a lot more flexibility on what we can do in the future.

   Mr. DOMENICI. All indications are that it did. There are several things which have combined to get these tremendous new revenue increases. One of them clearly is capital gains. Another is that real incomes have increased for all Americans in all income quintiles. They are paying a lot more taxes, and when you have more Americans paying income taxes because they are working, obviously you collect more revenue and you make Social Security more solid. All of those are positive things that occur when the American economy is flourishing, when it is booming, when more and more people are working. 
   Capital gains is very instrumental in that regard. I think there are many in this body who think in the near future  we ought to think seriously about reducing capital gains further. In my opinion, it is very helpful for the stock market, government fiscal position and the economy. Higher stock values--particularly in the Nasdaq have greatly contributed to investment in new technology, everything from computers to telecommunications, and everything in between. This is good for the economy, since it boosts productivity and keeps inflation down. The higher the productivity, even when you get less and less unemployment, you do not get inflation. Americans do not appreciate low inflation yet. Most all other things can be cured in the American economy if you keep inflation low. 
   Does the Senator have a further observation?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the end of this session of the 106th Congress Brian Benczkowski will be leaving my staff. Brian has worked on the Hill since his third year in law school. He stared as an intern while still in law school, served as the senior analyst for judiciary issues for the Senate Budget Committee, and worked closely with my general counsel to develop, and enact, over the President's veto, the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
   Brian was my counsel for the second round of Whitewater hearings and was part of the team for the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton. Brian worked on Juvenile Justice legislation, and helped me take on the Mexican drug lords. 
   He learned the highway, airport and other infrastructure needs of New Mexico as well as any Highway and Transportation Secretary in any Governor's cabinet. He was knowledgeable on immigration issues and helped my caseworkers with the really tough, but worthy immigration problems that are a daily fact of life in a border state. Just to prove that Brian had a soft side, he was my staff person for Character Counts during the 106th Congress. 
   Brian was instrumental in drafting the claims process legislation for the victims of the Cerro Grande fire. From the date that the fire first started to the day that the President signed the bill, complete with the $640 million to pay the claims, was fifty days. It is a good legislative product, and it proved that the delegation and the Congress could be bipartisan and act expeditiously in an emergency. 
   Brian is a talented lawyer, a caring and hard working member of my staff. 
   For a young man raised in Virginia, taught the law in Missouri with parents now living in Connecticut, he has made many New Mexico friends, developed a taste for green chile and amassed an understanding of the border. At one point I remarked that his Spanish was as good as any other staff member in my office. 
   So what is it that such a talented young man would choose to do when leaving Capitol Hill? 
   Banking legislative assistants and counsels with backgrounds in securities often end up at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission or at one of the Wall Street firms. However, the typical career path wouldn't do for this untypically talented young lawyer. He is going to New York to work for the first, real sports stock market. 
   This new sports stock market will list the baseball and other trading cards of today's marquee athletes and major league sports rising stars. Just like any major stock exchange, the exchange is a market maker. Just like E-trade or Ameritrade people will have sports brokerage accounts. 
   Brian is a baseball fan, former baseball player and a font of knowledge when it comes to sports. As a former minor league baseball player myself, I know baseball and am a fan of most other sports. ESPN was a great invention that adds to most men's enjoyment of life, sports and the pursuit of happiness. Hopefully, this new sports stock exchange will add another dimension to the way we all follow sports. 
   Many of us share a passion for sports, but very few of us get to take that passion, and merge it with the law, get an impressive title like assistant general counsel, receive a pay check and stock options. However, Brian is going to do just that at thePit.com. I wish him and his new company every success.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Senator MOYNIHAN, I was listening to your speech on the television set before I arrived on the floor. First, I thank you for what you said this morning. It is something we ought to hear, something that ought to be placed permanently in our RECORD. And that is what happened. 
   I personally want to say to you, over the years in my work as Budget Committee chairman and other legislation, I have found you to be a real friend. I think that is more important than talking about what you did here in terms of this Senator. I can remember, believe it or not, when we produced a most difficult budget, and it looked like a pretty good budget. I was wondering whether it would pass. I had the votes counted. All of a sudden, I won by one more vote than I thought. As he walked out, he put his hand on my shoulder and said: You did a great job. I voted for you. 
   Now, we have talked a lot about other things, including you have asked me regularly about my wonderful family and my beautiful wife Nancy. I thank you for that concern. 
   I guess in the remaining time I want to say to you, there are many ways to be a great Senator. Sometimes you become a great Senator because you get a lot of big headlines. Sometimes you become a great Senator when you promote yourself, which is permitted  around here, and there is nothing wrong with it. But I can say, I think you are a great Senator. I don't think you did either of those. I think you just worked. And when people had to hear something that was vitally important, that had some history to it, I don't think we have had anyone around here in my 28 years--maybe there are Senators who have been here longer who might have experienced it, but I don't think I have ever had a Senator who had so much impact because he knows a lot and he remembers history and he always calls matters to our attention when we ought to have them there. You have served on an important committee. Your knowledge of the world and trade and what it means to us in the world has been a tremendous asset for the Senate. I thank you for that. 
   I am certain that many are not going to have time to commend the distinguished Senator from New York because we are in some kind of a strange, 1-day-at-a-time funding resolution. We are just adding to the appropriations by 1 day at a time, which I have never heard of before. I have never had it happen to me in 28 years. I don't think it has happened. Nonetheless, we are here, and that is going to make it difficult for Senators to find the time that they want to commend you in this RECORD. But I am sure many Senators are thinking today that they would love to get down here and say thanks to you. 
   I thank Senator MOYNIHAN very much. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this bill, H. R. 2614 contains three important titles: A Medicare and health package to improve the infrastructure of our health care delivery system; a tax relief package and the small business bill. 
   The tax package is $295 billion over ten years. It includes: 
   $35 billion in small business tax relief; 
   $88 billion in health and long term care tax relief; 
   $46 billion in Pension and IRA tax relief; 
   $7 billion in school construction tax provisions and 
   $25 billion in Community Revitalization provisions. 
   The package also includes a repeal of the telephone tax which will save consumers $55 billion over ten years. 
   I am very pleased that this bill includes an IRA Pension Security package. At a time of unprecedented prosperity, it is a startling to realize that most Americans have only saved about 40 percent of what they will need for retirement. 
   Another frightening fact: Americans, in the aggregate, borrow more than they save. 
   The pathetic truth about our tax code: Our federal income tax code is down right hostile to savings and investment. Therapeutically, the bill before us today is a step toward eliminating some of that hostility. 
   Fact: The baby boom generation is aging. Americans are living longer, and yet, there has been no growth in pension coverage for the past 2 decades. 
   Half of the American work force today--70 million Americans--do not have a 401 (k) or any kind of pension plan. The problem is much worse for people who are small business persons. Only 19 percent of small businesses with 25 or fewer employees have any kind of pension. 
   To address this dire situation Chairman ROTH and the joint leadership have developed a package of IRA and pension simplification provisions that are excellent tax and pension policy. 
   The bill includes $46 billion in tax benefits for IRAs to make more people eligible and so that they can save more in their IRAs. 
   The bill increases the IRA contribution limit from $2,000 to $5,000. Contribution levels were set 20 years ago and they need to be updated. 
   This bill will increase the current law IRA contribution limitations to $5,000 over three years in $1,000 increments; 
   Increases the income limits for contributions to Roth IRAs for joint filers to twice the limit for single filers. 
   It increases the income limits for those eligible to make a rollover from a traditional IRA to a ROTH IRA to $200,000. 
   This bill strengthens our pension system. And its expands opportunities for Americans to get pension coverage especially women. As we know, women live longer than men but only 32 percent of women have pensions as compared to 55 percent of men. This bill includes pension catch-up provisions for workers over the age of 50. This is accomplished through an accelerated contribution mechanism. Older workers, especially women who return to the work force would have the opportunity to build up their retirement nest egg more quickly. Under this bill women who have left the work force, perhaps to be stay at home mothers, and then reenter the workforce later in life, can increase their pension contributions to make up for the time when they were not in the workforce. 
   This legislation modernizes our pension laws to meet the work patterns of today's more mobile workers. Defined contribution plan are made portable so workers can move their retirement nest egg from one type of pension plan to another as they move from job to job. 
   This bill allows workers to become vested in their pension plans more quickly. The vesting period is the amount of time a worker must stay at a job in order to take his employee and employer contributions with him when he changes jobs. Instead of the current law vesting period of 5 years, this bill would shorten the period to 3 years. This means that if a worker changes jobs after three years he can take his entire pension benefit contributions with him and roll it into the pension plan at his new job. 
   Small business tax relief is also provided in this bill and it is coupled with an increase in the minimum wage. This package is similar to an amendment I offered to the bankruptcy bill last year. It is a sound and balanced package. 
   Nationwide, 1.6 million workers are paid the minimum wage. In my own state of New Mexico, roughly 5 percent of all workers (or 40,000 citizens) are paid at or below the minimum wage. I think we should give these workers a raise. However, it is important that we do so in a way that generates the least amount of hardship on small business. That is why I'm pleased that this bill will increase the minimum wage by $1.00 per hour over the next two years, bringing it to $6.15 by 2002 and includes a package of small business tax cuts that will help small businesses create more and better paying jobs. 
   I would submit that a key reason for modestly raising the minimum wage is to ensure the continued success of the historic welfare reform legislation passed by Congress in 1996. I would note that nationally since the March of 1994 record high welfare caseload of almost 5.1 million families the 1996 welfare reform legislation has reduced the number of families receiving assistance by 48 percent to about 2.7 million. 
   However, as we ask more and more people to get off welfare rolls and onto employment rolls, we must have a minimum wage that reflects the reality of the marketplace. My point is simple, if these individuals are to continue as productive members of the workforce, we must ensure the minimum wage at least keeps pace with inflation. For instance, in the New Mexico the average hourly earnings of an individual working in retail has increased by one penny over the past year. 
   I would also like to take a minute and briefly discuss the impact of a minimum wage increase on New Mexico. From 1990 to 1996 the median household income actually fell almost $5,000 to about $25,000. Let me repeat that, the median household income in New Mexico has actually fallen and not surprisingly the percentage of New Mexican's  living below the poverty level has increased fro 20.9 percent to 25.5 percent. 
   Sadly, New Mexico ranks near bottom nationally in terms of personal income per capita and median household income and conversely near the top in terms of people living below the poverty level. I do not believe for one minute the minimum wage increase will solve all the ills facing New Mexico, but I do believe it is a good first start. 
   Let me briefly describe the small business provisions included in the bill. 
   Above the line deduction for health insurance expenses for families without employer-provided coverage: Under current law corporations are allowed to write off 100 percent of their health insurance costs, but workers without an 
   employer-subsidized plan get no deduction unless they itemize and have total medical costs exceeding 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. 
   Most middle class American's don't itemize, and of those who do, few can meet the 7.5 percent AGI test to get any tax relief for health insurance costs. This bill provides an above-the-line deduction (available whether you itemized or not) for health insurance costs for individuals whose employers do not pay for more than 50 percent of the costs of coverage. 
   Under the bill, workers may deduct 25 percent of costs in 2001-2003; 35 percent in 2004 ; 65 percent in 2005 and 100 percent thereafter. 
   One hundred percent Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction will help 11 million people who are self employed. 
   If a person is doing business as a corporation, health insurance is 100 percent deductible. This means that the corporation can provide health care insurance with pre-tax dollars and that makes it much less expensive to provide benefit to employees. 
   This is the way it has been for a long, long time. However, in 1995, if someone were self-employed he or she would not be allowed to deduct health insurance costs because the law lapsed. For several years now, Congress has been trying to increase the deduction for the self employed. 
   Under the tax law currently in effect 60 percent of their health insurance costs is deductible for the self-employed. There is no tax policy justification for treating corporations one way and the self-employed another. 
   The majority of all businesses in this country are self-employed. 
   These are often firms with very little cash, a good idea and talent struggling to make a success. Once they do succeed, they are the ones that create nearly two out of every three net new jobs. These small firms have sustained this job creating record for more than twenty years. Clearly, the tax code should not treat them so shabbily. 
   The need for the deduction is indisputable. Unincorporated business owners experience the worst of all possible worlds in the health insurance marketplace. Usually they can only buy an insufficient health insurance policy for a very high price and they are denied the same incentives and tax treatment enjoyed by incorporated, bigger businesses. If this legislation becomes law, the self-employed will be able to take 100 percent deduction for their health insurance costs on their 2001 taxes. I am pleased that Congress is taking this step to address the health insurance deductibility gap and to make it permanent. 
   Total deductibility has been a top priority of the various state small business throughout the country. In addition to tax policy fairness and job creation, restoring the deduction for the self-employed is important because the self-employed are one of the largest groups of uninsured citizens in America. 
   In New Mexico, there are 75,000 self-employed individuals about one-third of them take advantage of the deduction. This number does not include farmers and ranchers who are an other group that will benefit from the tax law change we are making today. 
   The self-employed do not have high level incomes. Over 75 percent of the self-employed have incomes of less than $25,000 and an additional 13 percent have incomes between $25,000 and $50,000. Twenty-three percent of self-employed do not have health insurance. 
   We have as good an economy as we're ever going to have ..... but the number of uninsured has increased,'' said Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. ``The problem has gotten worse in good times, which means people are very nervous about what would happen in an economic downturn.'' 
   This conference report increases the amount that can be expensed from $20,000 to $35,000. Under currrent law, the amount that may be deducted is $20,000 to 2000; $24,000 in 2001 and 2002; and $25,000 in 2003 and thereafter. This change means an additional $15,000 tax savings for small businesses investing in new equipment next year. Small business people will be able create more jobs because they will be able to expense up to $35,000 of investment in any one year. This will lower the cost of capital, and help with cash flow. I expect that the most likely expenditure to be expensed is computer systems. Computers are contributing significantly to the productivity of the American work force. 
   The work opportunity credit, WOTC, provides a tax credit for wages paid to employees hired from one or more of eight targeted groups, i.e. individuals receiving federal assistance. The credit is designed to encourage the hiring of hard-to-place workers. The work opportunity tax credit replaced the targeted jobs tax credit which I helped author in the 1970's. The bill extends the WOTC through June 30, 2004. 
   The bill also includes a provision that allows banks to pay interest on business checking accounts. It's about time. 
   Business meals are one of the few ordinary and necessary business expenses that are not 100 percent deductible. In 1993, the Democrats lowered the business and meal deduction from 80 percent deductible to 50 percent deductible. This bill would reverse that trend. Restoring the deduction to 70 percent will help waiters, waitresses, busboys, bartenders, bell hops, reservation clerks. 
   When the Democrats went after the deduction they said they were targeting the three-martini lunch. But experience has shown us that there have been many unintended consequences--consequences that we predicted. They meant to stop the three martini lunch, but it was the business traveler who eats his own meals, whether eaten in a hotel, coffee shop, or restaurant, or grabbed from a food cart that got the ax. Most of the people purchasing business meals are self-employed and in total, 70 percent of those who purchase business meals have incomes below $50,000 and 39 percent had incomes below $35,000. 
   The last major section of this tax package that I would like to talk about is the community renewal provisions. The bill would designate 40 renewal communities, 12 of which are in rural areas. They would receive the a 15 percent wage credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid per worker, an additional $35,000 of expensing; deduction for 
   revitalization expenditures capped at $12 million per community and a zero percent capital gains rate on qualifying assets held for more than five years. 
   The bill increases the low income housing tax credit and increases the volume cap for private activity bonds that are very useful in attracting business. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely pleased this package also contains a helping hand for our seniors. Today we are providing renewed assurances to our seniors that Congress is committed to not only the continued health of the Medicare program but, to improving the program. 
   The ``Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvements and Protection Act of 2000'' is a victory for our seniors and I commend my colleagues and especially Leader LOTT and Chairman ROTH for all of their work on this measure. The package before us addresses the critical needs of the Medicare+Choice program, skilled nursing facilities, home health care, hospitals, rural health care providers, and the Medicaid program. 
   I am especially pleased the package contains the ``Medicare Geographic Fair Payment Act of 2000'' that will create a far more equitable reimbursement system for the Medicare+Choice program. The provision will place states on more equal footing and begin to end the blatant discrimination against states, like New Mexico that deliver health care in an efficient manner. It means New Mexico seniors will  continue to have the option of sticking with their Medicare-HMO plans that often offer more options, like prescription drugs, than the basic Medicare program. 
   Specifically, the package will increase the Medicare+Choice minimum payment floor to $525 a month per beneficiary in 2001 for all Metropolitan Statistical Areas, MSA's, with populations exceeding 250,000. In New Mexico, the stakes are particularly high because without this provision 15,000 seniors will lose their Medicare+Choice coverage on January 1, 2001. 
   Under the provision health care providers in the Albuquerque MSA are currently reimbursed at $430 per beneficiary and they will now see an increase of $95 to create partial equity with other areas of the country. The result will be at least an additional $34 million for New Mexico in FY2001, and at least $170 million over the next five years. Also, the package will increase the payment floor for Rural Areas from the current $415 to $475 in 2001. 
   However, the victory for seniors in New Mexico and across the country may be very short lived because the President believes the legislation spends too much money on the Medicare+Choice program. I am utterly shocked and dismayed over the President's threat to veto this package. I would simply ask the President not to treat this hard-won compromise agreement as a political football. Too many lives will be affected on whether this increased funding is made available to ensure continued access to Medicare-HMO benefits, nursing home care or health insurance for children. 
   The Clinton-Gore Administration is actually threatening to veto a bill that would increase spending on Medicare and help millions of seniors across this country. I find it very hard to believe that the President would want to veto a bill which: increases payment for hospitals, including teaching hospitals and rural hospitals; increases payments for home health agencies; and increases payments for hospices and other health care providers. 
   I would submit that spending money to end discriminatory practices should never result in veto threats. There is simply no rationale for a discrepancy of an $814 reimbursement for Staten Island and $430 for Albuquerque. It is especially unfair given the fact that seniors pay the same Medicare premium no matter where they live. 
   I am also sure Benny Maestas of Santa Fe would disagree with the President's belief the package spends too much on the Medicare+Choice package. I say this because the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper ran a story about one of these seniors--Benny Maestas. Unfortunately, Benny will lose his prescription drug coverage next year and be forced to pay several hundred dollars a month for his medications, instead of the $50 per month he currently pays for his prescription coverage through Medicare+Choice. 
   And it is not only seniors in New Mexico that will benefit, but seniors from all over the country. Let me name just a few of the places that will get sizeable increases in their payment rates: Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Fresno, California; Albany, New York; York, Pennsylvania; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Fayetteville, Arkansas; Buffalo, New York, and many more. 
   I would simply ask the Clinton-Gore Administration, which of these cities do they not want to help? 
   I also want to state how pleased I am that we are once again addressing the need of Skilled Nursing Facilities, SNFs. Our action today will assure our senior citizens maintain continued access to quality nursing home care through the Medicare program. I believe the provisions supporting SNFs are particularly important because nationally, almost eleven percent of nursing facilities in the United States are in bankruptcy and in New Mexico the number is nothing short of alarming, nearly fifty percent of the nursing facilities are in bankruptcy. 
   I believe these provisions are especially important for rural states like New Mexico, because many of our communities are served by a single facility that is the only provider for many miles. If such a facility were to close, patients in that home would be forced to move to facilities much farther away from their families. Moreover, nursing homes in smaller, rural communities often operate on a razor thin bottom line and for them, the reductions in Medicare reimbursements have been especially devastating. 
   Additionally, not only does the package stabilize the Medicare program but, our seniors will be provided with new and improved benefits. In addition to lowering out-of-pocket outpatient hospital costs, the plan also offers new coverage for biannual pap smear screenings and pelvic exams, medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes and renal disease, and screenings for colon cancer and glaucoma. 
   I am also pleased the package addresses a critical funding problem with the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, faced by forty states, including New Mexico. The Medicare-Medicaid package will allow New Mexico and other states to retain a majority of their unspent FY 1998 and 1999 SCHIP allotments until 2002 and use a percentage of those funds to continue outreach and enrollment activities. 
   New Mexico's situation arose because the Heath Care Financing Administration strictly implemented the SCHIP program and refused repeated requests by the state to implement additional benefits. As a result, New Mexico has only been able to use about $3 million of its SCHIP allocation. However, the provision in this package will allow the state to keep about 60 percent of the $58 million it stood to lose this year under the SCHIP program. 
   Mr. President, I was here for part of the discussion by the majority leader and minority leader with reference to this bill. I think he made a few allusions to what soon-to-be-President Bush would do. First, I want to say about this tax bill, for those who think we don't know what is in this bill, let me suggest that almost all of it has passed either body, either the Senate or the House--every provision. 
   All of the small business provisions, which are wonderful for many people who work for small businesses, passed the Senate. How do I know that? It was my amendment. It was a minimum wage amendment that had on it all the small business tax measures, one of which is earth-shaking but so simple that I don't know how anybody could be against it. Those who vote against this bill are saying to those people who are employees and do not get their health insurance paid by their employer, if they have the wherewithal to buy their own insurance, they can deduct the cost of that insurance. Now most people listening would say they thought that was the law all along; why would you deny that? 
   Businesses deduct the costs of health insurance, but individuals who buy their own, who are employees and are not covered--which, I believe, is millions of Americans--will begin deducting the cost of their health insurance, just as businesses do, on their own individual returns. Right now, they are precluded, unless they take it as the big deduction, and then 7 percent of the money they earn has to be for health expenses. 
   Let me suggest that the minimum wage is raised in two pieces. It goes up one full dollar. That is what the President wanted. It is in this bill. To suggest that we would vote against this bill because there is an error in the bill regarding the effectiveness of the minimum wage is a phony argument. That will be fixed probably before we leave. That will probably be fixed in one of the appropriations bills. I could go on. 
   Let me ask one question: What does the tax law of this land need more than anything else? It needs provisions that tell Americans: You can save more money for your retirement than you do today. This is probably the most significant package ever passed to enhance the savings of American people because the IRAs go up, and many other things they will be using and are using will be enhanced dramatically. 
   The Democrats were up here arguing about retirement reform, in terms of having the ability to accumulate more savings for retirement time. They talk about it. This bill does it. It does it in a very good way. Frankly, there are some things in this bill I would not favor. It is a very large bill. This Senator remembers when we voted on a tax bill that was brought to the Senate in a big cardboard box. That is not a good way to do it. It happened to be a pretty good bill. But it was brought over here by the Clerk of the House in a big cardboard box; it was so big. It passed the Senate overwhelmingly because pieces and parts of it had passed  both Houses and, more or less, everybody knew what was in it and thought it was a good bill. 
   One last observation. For those on the other side who are talking about how late we are, I want to remind those who pay attention to us that in the last 25 years, most of which have been controlled by that side of the aisle, we have completed our appropriations bills on time only three times. That means every 
   single Congress, in 22 out of 25 years, was unable to get its work done by the October 1 deadline. I don't know why. I seek to change that. I seek to make appropriations 2 years and budgets 2 years. That might mean this won't happen in the future. But even that is hard to get passed. 
   So to those who think it is management and it is our Republican leader, let me say I think he has done an outstanding job. There has never been a more political time in the closure of a Congress in my 28 years here. The White House is playing politics to the hilt, the Democrats are playing politics to the hilt, and then they blame Republicans for not getting it done. 
   I believe the agenda to finish is an agenda that the Republican leader has in mind, and if we just get a little cooperation out of the President, we will get our job done. If he sits down there like a dictator instead of understanding that under the Constitution of the United States we have a very powerful right, and that is the purse strings and the bills under the purse strings of America--he comes at the end of the session and he wants all kinds of things, such as a major new immigration law. I might support it, but it obviously needs hearings and it ought to be worked on. 
   Now we are being told if you don't do that, you can't get the appropriations bill to keep the Justice Department open and the FBI salaries. Maybe we ought to test the President on that one. Maybe he ought to be permitted to veto the bill that pays the FBI, and other law enforcement, and the judges because he doesn't get one thing--just one item--on the bill he wants. That item may be one he is looking at out there and saying, let me be political and see if I can help Vice President GORE in his campaign. 
   I want to also suggest that the President of the United States is going to be vetoing this bill when it goes down to him, in spite of the fact that there are some real Medicare changes that help seniors across this land. I believe we have made the case that HMO Plus is a good program in States such as New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, and literally scores of cities across America. Why? Because the senior citizen is getting more than he gets when he goes to the Federal Government for Medicare. In many cases, they are getting prescription drugs, which we are arguing about giving them, too. They already get it under HMOs in some parts of America. 
   I want to talk about New Mexico. 
   New Mexico is one of those States that has been discriminated against in the Medicare+Choice reimbursement. We were receiving such a small amount that the HMOs are saying they cannot exist. And they have already told thousands of senior citizens in New Mexico that by January 1 they cancel out. That is because we have never had an adequate reimbursement. Why? Because when we passed the law, it gave the States essentially what is was costing them. In New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and scores of other places the cost of health care was very cheap. So they gave us a very low rate of reimbursement while other parts of America got very large ones. 
   To put it into perspective, in New Mexico the HMOs were getting reimbursed at $430 per senior, while in parts of New York they were getting $814. 
   We are asking that this discrimination stop, and the thousands of people in New Mexico who have HMOs that perhaps give them prescription drugs ask that you sign this bill so they can continue to have that kind of care and that kind of protection. 
   If it is vetoed, Mr. President, come January 1, in my State, everyone who is going to be denied their current coverage, which they think is very good coverage, can look to this White House and this President for saying: I will not sign that bill--even though it has many provisions the President likes. But he says the HMOs cost too much. He says the HMOs are big businesses. 
   Let me tell you, in my State, the three that deliver coverage are known as Presbyterian hospitals--two are the St. Joseph's Hospital Plan and the Lovelace Plan. None of them are profit making, as I understand it. Two are charitable, and one is a foundation of sorts. 
   So, Mr. President, veto the bill. Say to the seniors in New Mexico who are currently covered that we don't know what is going to happen to them on January 1. 
   There are many other provisions in this bill, contrary to what the minority leader said, on the Medicaid side that are very good for hospitals and very good for rural hospitals. I am not an expert on it. But this bill provides $31 billion in the first 5 years for Medicare reimbursement adjustments. 
   My friend is sitting here. Is it 31 over 10 or over 5?

   Mr. DOMENICI. How can the President of the United States say he is going to veto the bill because of the Medicare provisions? 
   Actually, everyone knows that nursing homes need additional reimbursement. That is in this bill. 
   I could go on with each one of them. 
   I believe what is happening is that politics is walking up from Pennsylvania Avenue into the Chambers of the House and Senate, and politics from the White House is saying: You give me everything I want or you do not get the bills completed. And then the White House can say: You didn't do your work. You didn't get your work done. 
   Let me say we will get our work done. 
   Mr. President, you just consider the compromise with us on some of these. This is a good bill for the American people. I might like to do it differently. In fact, if this bill is vetoed next year, we will do it a lot differently. But for now, Mr. President, you cannot get everything you want in this kind 
   of bill. 
   This one is not our President in the Senate. This is the President at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. That President, not our President here. You can't get everything you want, and when you don't get it, blame the Republicans for ``not completing their work.'' 
   I want to repeat one more time that the Republicans have tried to lead this Senate and get its work done. For those on the other side of the aisle who complain about not getting our work done, if you look back at the record, it has been the Democrats on that side of the aisle who have been insisting on their agenda all year long. They get a vote on guns; they want another one on an appropriations bill, or the next bill that comes through. They even held up the education bill because of guns. 
   That is the record. 
   The education bill that everyone touted was held up by the other side of the aisle who wanted their agenda of amendments on that bill. 
   I think our leader did the right thing. He wouldn't let them, after they had their vote once. 
   So what happened? We don't get the bill. Who is to blame? 
   It appears to me that what we ought to do right now is sit down together and get this work done. And Democrats ought to tell the President of the United States, instead of concurring with him every time and saying they are with him and to go ahead and veto the bill, they ought to say to him: Mr. President, we have done a very good job in the closing moments to try to get our work done, and you ought to help us, President Bill Clinton, get our work done instead of threatening us. 
   In fact, I am wondering about this business over the weekend with 1-day extensions of the appropriations process that has not been completed--1 day at a time. It is as if the President doesn't care anything about our leadership and what we think we ought to do. We have to come back every day to vote on a continuing resolution. 
   I have been here a long time--28 years. I have never seen a President do that. As a matter of fact, I have never seen a President use continuing resolutions to get their way as this President has. They just didn't do it in the past. 
   It was kind of a sacred thing to sign appropriations bills and get them done. 
   This President is on the way out. He is very desirous of electing Vice President GORE. And we all understand that. But everybody knows that the Justice  Department of the United States ought to get its money, the FBI ought to get paid, and all of those entities that are part of our criminal justice ought to get paid. They ought not be held up for one provision that is really extraneous to that bill because this is an appropriations bill. There is an authorizing bill the President wants on immigration. So the whole bill will die. 
   If they want to talk about who is to blame, then I submit to Pennsylvania Avenue that it ought to be a two-way street. It ought not get down to the end where it is a one-way street or one or two or three provisions that the President insists upon. We are close to completing the people's business, one or two or three provisions that the President of the United States insists upon that we have offered compromises on, and he says that or nothing.

Mr. President, before Senator GRAMM leaves the floor, I thank him for this aspect of the bill that helps every senior in New Mexico and across this Nation, 1.6 million, who have HMO Choice Plus. In this bill, we have provided new reimbursement, increased reimbursement to those areas of the United States that were not getting enough money to stay in business.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I will speak about Vice President GORE's lack of a Social Security policy. I will entitle my premise today ``Odd Gift of Bonds.'' 
   Let me start by saying I found it interesting that just 2 days ago the Treasury Secretary--that is, Secretary Summers--took time out of his busy schedule to speak with reporters and go on the talk show circuit to comment on Governor Bush's Social Security proposal. Some of Secretary Summer's conclusions appeared on the front page of the Washington Post yesterday. The title was ``Cabinet Opens Up On Bush.'' ``Treasury Secretary says Social Security Math Doesn't Add Up.'' 
   I hope when I am finished some people will take a look at the Vice President's so-called Social Security plan, and maybe they will conclude, as I have, that the math does add up, but it doesn't do a thing for Social Security long term. Nothing. Zero. 
   It should be noted, at least while I have been here, that traditionally, Secretaries of the Treasury do not get themselves involved in political campaigns, and for good reason. Indeed, former Secretary Bob Rubin, also an appointee of this administration, stayed out of the campaign in 1996. But apparently Secretary Summers had enough time to give interviews; but he didn't have enough time to offer any real evidence to back up his stated claims. None. No evidence. In fact, I'm quite sure that the Secretary of the Treasury is grading a fictional Bush plan so that he can join with the Vice President and many other Democrats in orchestrating a campaign to scare senior citizens, as they have done regularly in past campaigns. 
   Also, I find it interesting that the Washington Post reporter--whom I know--who wrote this story, didn't come to any Member or anyone who has tried to understand the Gore Social Security plan to ask for some comments about it and whether it does anything at all for Social Security. 
   So today I will take a few minutes to explain the Clinton-Gore Social Security plan, and then the Gore plan, which is slightly different than the Clinton-Gore plan, which is really not a plan at all but an illusion of a plan. It is not a plan. It is an illusion of a plan. 
   President Clinton initially proposed a version of this plan in January of 1999. It was never taken seriously then or now. And for good reason. I can remember it was very difficult to get a Democrat to offer the President's plan, including the so-called Social Security fix in the budget hearings, in the Budget Committee, and surely there were never more than a few Senators whom I believe in clear partisan dedication who supported this odd gift of bonds to the Social Security trust fund. 
   This so-called plan, the one that President Clinton sent us in 1999, is strictly a political exercise intended to create the perception that the President and Vice President have met their 
   commitment to ``save Social Security first,'' as they state it, when, in fact, they have no such plan, and the Social Security long-term problems remain absolutely unresolved. 
   In fact, as Governor Bush has said, for 8 years the Clinton-Gore administration has promised to save Social Security, and yet, under the Clinton-Gore administration, the present value of the Social Security deficits have already increased 60 percent during that 8 years of doing nothing, according to the Social Security actuaries. That's roughly $28,000 per household. That is the amount that it has gone up. Perhaps Secretary Summers, as the managing trustee of Social Security, should be asked why he has allowed that to happen. It has happened because we have not taken steps to reform or fix Social Security. 
   Now I will talk about the $40 trillion IOU plan. What does the Clinton-Gore plan do? Beginning in the year 2011, and continuing through 2050, they transfer IOUs from the general fund of the government to the Social Security trust fund. I will soon introduce a letter from the Congressional Budget Office that says over that period of time from 2011 to 2050 the total accumulated costs of both interest and IOUs--get this--will be $40 trillion. That means for that plan to make sense somehow, some way, some time, during 2011 and 2050, they will have to ask the American people to do one of three things: 
   No. 1, increase taxes by $40 trillion over that period of time. Why? To pay off the IOUs which are soon going to be needed by the Social Security recipients of our country. 
   No. 2, restrain and restrict the programs of our Federal Government over that period of time; that is, discipline our programs so we will save $40 trillion and put it against the IOUs--a mammoth expectation without any probability of occurring. 
   Or we can do some of the two of them. 
   Or we can just say we will do it all by cutting programs of ordinary people that are going on day by day. 
   Nonetheless, these estimates will indicate that we will have to do something in the future to raise large amounts of money that are not currently within the Social Security actuarial expectations from the payroll tax. It will have to come from somewhere. Is that a plan to fix Social Security? I ask anyone if that is a plan? It is not a plan. It won't work. It has been more or less unacceptable to Congress for the 2 1/2 years that it has been lounging around someplace, for somebody to consider. 
   The estimate I am talking about comes from the Social Security actuaries who estimated the initial amount of general fund transfers to be $9.9 trillion. 
   We then asked the Congressional Budget Office to calculate for us how much additional interest would be paid to the trust fund, based on these transfers. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, using the actuaries' numbers, estimated that the interest payments would add $30 trillion to the general fund transfers to the trust fund. In total, then, that is $40 trillion in IOUs by 2050. 
   For those who might have a little difficulty with IOUs, let me just say,  think of it as a postdated check. The check is there and it is valuable because it has a signature on it: USA. But it is dated 2050. Then when you say: OK, the check is good, pay me--we will, as a nation, have to come up with $40 trillion. 
   When the President initially made this proposal, he--that is President Clinton--he at least proposed one real provision that would have changed Social Security's long-term financing. The President proposed to set up a new Government-run board that would invest up to 15 percent of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market and private bonds. President Bill Clinton recommended that. But it would be run by the Government and the Government would be involved in huge numbers and huge dollar values of the stock of the American stock exchanges and of companies of America. 
   There was a resounding opposition to using a Government board to invest Social Security money in the stock market because it would become political. It would become a board that might not want to invest in this because of public opinion, or that, because the particular corporation causes obesity by selling hamburgers, that is not the right thing so you would not invest in that particular stock. 
   The Federal Reserve Board Chairman said, to that piece of the President's plan: Too much Government involvement in the private economy. 
   So the Vice President has said he does not support that portion of President Clinton's plan. So what he has left is a plan with no investment and $40 trillion will accumulate, by the year 2050, which we will have to pay from somewhere. 
   If you ask, Has he helped anything in his plan? Well, I ask you. He also, I think, makes matters a little worse by proposing two new unfunded benefit expansions that will cost between $100 and $180 billion over 10 years, which just adds to the numbers we have been talking about because we have expanded Social Security without the wherewithal to pay it after 2011. 
   To show you the lack of seriousness of this IOU proposal, the Gore plan does not start transferring funds to Social Security until 2011, well beyond any two terms that he might serve, and five Congresses from now. What he is really saying is he wants the economy of this country to commit $40 trillion in general funds on the promise that we will impose fiscal discipline on 10 future Presidential terms and 20 Congresses. But he will not transfer a penny to Social Security until 2011. 
   Who is going to pay these IOUs off? Our children and our grandchildren. They will be saddled with all the debt and they will be forced to pay these IOUs back--in the form of higher taxes or through the other suggestions that are possibilities that are talked about. 
   In March of 1999, Senator BOB KERREY said, this plan ``has a great deal of pain in [the] plan--a hidden pain in the form of income tax increases that will be borne by future generations of Americans.'' 
   That is by BOB KERREY, Democrat from Nebraska. I could not agree more. 
   What is more, the President's own budget for 2000 agreed with Senator KERREY:  
   These [trust fund] balances ..... are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, through borrowing from the public, or reducing the benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay the benefits.  
   An odd gift of bonds--which is the full extent, that I can find, of the plan the Vice President has put forth. I can find very few economists who believe these transfers to Social Security are a good idea and they will fix Social Security. 
   In fact, Ed Gramlich, whom this President recently appointed to the Federal Reserve Board, headed a commission for the President on Social Security. This is what he said:  
   During the deliberations of the 1994-1996 Social Security Advisory Commission, we considered whether general revenues should be used to help shore up the Social Security program. This idea was unanimously rejected for a number of reasons ..... there are serious drawbacks to relaxing Social Security's long-run budget constraint through general revenue transfers.  
   Alan Blinder, GORE's economic adviser, said, in 1999, that the administration should drop the ``gift of bonds.'' 
   It is from his quote that I named this assessment. He said that the administration should drop the ``gift of bonds.'' 
   This is what he said, that is Blinder, at a Ways and Means Committee hearing in 1999.  
   It amounts to a pledge to provide that much more money for Social Security in the future--somehow. But it does not specify the sources. Thus, by itself, it does not fill any of the funding gap....... There is a simpler and more intuitively appealing plan which, had the President proposed it, would, I believe, have generated less confusion and raised fewer objections. That would be to dedicate the [Social Security surpluses] over the next 15 years to debt reduction, and therefore to national saving--and to forget about the new gift of bonds and odd scorekeeping rules.  
   Meaning that you have to invent some way to score this in a budget way or to make sense. 
   The Clinton-Gore plan is not really a plan at all. It is a political proposal to confuse the debate and absolve him from the responsibility to offer a real plan to save Social Security.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a letter which I sent on October 6 to Dan L. Crippen--he is the Congressional Budget Office Director. I asked him the following:  
   I am attaching a June 26, 2000 memorandum from the SSA [the Social Security people] actuaries which gives the exact size of these annual transfers. Their data shows that $9.8 trillion in cumulative annual transfers will have been made by 2050 under the Administration's proposal. I would like CBO to estimate what the cumulative interest on these transfers would be in the years specified in the attached table. Secondly, could you tell me the total amount of IOUs that will be deposited into the [Social Security] trust fund as a result of the cumulative transfers plus the cumulative interest on these transfers in each of the specified years.

   Mr. DOMENICI. This is the response to my letter, dated October 18, which has an attachment to it. I will read a paragraph.  
   Although the transfers (and the interest earned on them) would improve the apparent solvency of the trust fund, they would increase the liabilities in the rest of the budget at the same time.  
   That is what I have been saying.  
   As a result, the proposed transfers would have no impact on the Government's net indebtedness, nor would they directly enhance Government's ability to meet promises to future retirees. Indeed, the Government's revenues and expenditures would be the same regardless of whether the transfers were made.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will tell the Senate what it says. It is attached to CBO's letter, and it goes 2010, 2015, 2020, right up to 2050, and it has the cumulative IOU transfers that were put in and then the cumulative interest on the transfers. 
   I was shocked--maybe I should not have been; it is almost automatic, it is almost arithmetic--but the total of the cumulative interest on the IOUs and the cumulative transfers amount to $40 trillion by the year 2050. That is the IOU that we give to the American people. They will have to pay it in order to keep Social Security solvent, but nobody is being told that. They are being told we have fixed the plan for x number of years from now.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments on two other subjects. First, the Vice President of the United States continues to tell the American people that he has been a master at reorganizing our Government and making it efficient, and that a very large number of employees have been cut from the payroll of the U.S. Government due to this effort. 
   I want to print in the RECORD a chart from the Office of Management and Budget--their own--the total executive branch civilian full-time equivalent employees during this period of time that they claim they reduced the workforce. 
   All I want to say is one thing: It did not take much to do this because 96 percent, a larger number than I thought, 96 percent of the employee reduction--that is the civilian full-time equivalent reduction--are military civilians who were taken off the payroll as we reduced the Defense Department of the United States; 96 percent. Four percent is the reduction in the nonmilitary civilian payroll of the United States. 
   Let's get it right, Mr. Vice President. Let's tell it right. There were no real reductions other than civilians who were laid off because we reduced the Defense Department. I want to be correct. I said there were none; 4 percent of reductions were from the rest of the civilian Government of the United States. 
   On the last item, let's get this one right. Mr. Vice President, you referred twice in debates to a program to give health insurance to kids. There is a program called CHIP which the U.S. Government gave money to each State so they could try to insure or bring into Medicaid or at least in some way cover more children. 
   The Vice President said to the Republican nominee: Texas has not done very well with that. Your program for covering children obviously indicates--I am paraphrasing--that you did not care about children's health. 
   What should have been said is that 40 States of the Union were unable to use their CHIP money. Would that not have been a fairer thing to say rather than say Texas? The State that has the largest amount of money under that program for children's health and cannot spend it, has not spent it to this date is the State of California. As a matter of fact, they had $591 million that they could not spend on children's health coverage because the program will not work. You cannot fit it into States. You cannot get it approved by the legislature. You cannot find the match, or whatever the reason. 
   Those 40 States, in addition to Texas, are California, Georgia, Washington, Minnesota--Minnesota had the highest percentage of that money left over because they could not spend it, 99 percent. New Mexico, my State, had 92. Arizona had 67 percent of their money. 
   Let's be fair. When you talk about children's health coverage and this Federal program, do not say Texas was unable to spend theirs. Let's say 40 States have been unable, so there must be some deficiency in the program, not in the States. All of those States are led in dollar numbers by the State of California which could not spend $591 million because the program is difficult to do and very difficult to effectuate the coverage of children. 
   It is widely recognized that this S-CHIP program began slowly because State legislatures and HCFA had to approve plans. Right now, we are busy trying to extend the plan for 2 more years for all States. That is because 40 of them have been unable to spend all of the money available. 
   I ask the Vice President: In all those States, including California because they have this huge balance they could not use, is the Governor there adverse to covering children and having more children involved in something like children's insurance or Medicaid or the like? I do not think so, nor do I think the Governor of Texas is because I believe when 40 States cannot do it, we ought to tell it like it is. 
   The next time you are talking about this, Mr. Vice President, you ought to say not Texas alone but California and 39 other States have been unable to use this CHIP money, this children's insurance money, for one reason or another. Texas is among the 40. They do not stand alone.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act which is included in this conference report along with the VA-HUD appropriations bill. 
   The energy and water bill is a very good bill that has unfortunately had a difficult path toward enactment. The bill originally passed the Senate by a vote of 93-1 on September 7. The Senate then approved the original energy and water conference report by a vote of 57-37 on October 2. However, the President vetoed that bill because of a provision intended to prevent increased springtime flood risk on the lower Missouri River--a provision the President had signed the previous 3 years. 
   Whatever the reason, it was vetoed, it came back to us, and now it is in a conference form. I regret it has taken so much of our time and taken so long to get done but it is a very good bill. 
   Earlier today, the House passed the conference report by a vote of 386-24, and I hope the Senate will also overwhelmingly support the conference report. 
   Senator REID and I, along with Chairman STEVENS and Senator BYRD, have worked hard to prepare an outstanding bill that meets the needs of the country and addresses many of the Senators' top priorities. 
   The Senate and House full committee chairmen were very supportive and have provided the additional resources at conference that were necessary to  address many priority issues for Members. They have allowed the House to come up $630 million to the Senate number on the defense allocation ($13.484 billion), and the Senate nondefense allocation to be increased by $925 million. 
   I would now like to highlight some of the great things we have been able to do in this bill. 
   The conference report provides $5.0 billion for nuclear weapons activities within the National Nuclear Security Administration, an increase of $370 million over the request and $580 million over current year. 
   The additional funds are required to meet additional requirements within the aging nuclear weapons complex, and reflects the conferees' concern about the state of the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program. As it is now, the program is not on schedule, given the current budget, to develop the tools, technologies and skill-base to refurbish our weapons and certify them for the stockpile. For example, we are behind schedule and over cost on the production of both pits and secondaries for our nuclear weapons. The committee has provided significant increases to these areas. 
   When we use the term ``Stockpile Stewardship Program,'' we are talking about a program that the United States has put in place to make sure that our weapons systems are indeed safe, reliable, and that we do not have to do underground testing to confirm that. In fact, we have not been doing testing because the Congress of the United States said we should not. To supply the information necessary to keep the stockpile strong, reliable, and safe, this science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program was put in place. It has a few more years before we will have it proved up and then we will look at it carefully and make sure that it does the job. 
   This does not mean we are making nuclear weapons, for we are not. It will come as a surprise to some who are listening that the United States makes no nuclear weapons and we have not for some time. Nonetheless, we must keep in place the infrastructure and the things that are necessary in the event we have to do that, because of a failure of our program called science-based stockpile stewardship or some other untoward event that might occur in the world. 
   Furthermore, DOE has failed to keep good modern facilities and our production complex is in a terrible state of disrepair. To address these problems, the mark provides an increase of over $100 million for the production plants in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, and South Carolina. 
   But it is not just the physical infrastructure that is deteriorating within the weapons complex, morale among the scientists at the three weapons laboratories is at an all-time low. For example, the last 2 years at Los Alamos have witnessed security problems that greatly damaged the trust relationship between the Government and its scientists. Additionally, research funds have been cut and punitive restrictions on travel imposed. None of this seems to move in the right direction, in fact, they probably did not help. 
   As a result, the labs are having great difficulty recruiting and retaining America's greatest scientists. To help address this problem, the conference agreement has increased the travel cap from $150 million to $185 million, and increased laboratory directed research and development to 6 percent. 
   The travel restrictions which have become so burdensome were put in because, somehow, we thought if we didn't let scientists travel they wouldn't go to meetings in Taiwan and China and someplace like that and exchange secret information. Clearly, travel restriction has become a very onerous burden, for good scientists working for universities or otherwise do travel. That is part of their growing up, maturing, and once they are mature and great scientists, they go there to show their fellow scientist what the past has put into their minds. 
   The conference agreement also includes a compromise proposal that allows work on the National Ignition Facility, a major laser complex to be used for nuclear weapons stewardship work, to continue. That project is funded at $199 million, $10 million below the request of $209 million. Of that amount, $70 million is fenced pending the project meeting a number of milestones by March 3, 2001. 
   The conference agreement also includes several provisions to strengthen and clarify the operation of the National Nuclear Security Administration. The conference report includes provisions to give the Administrator a 3-year term of office, prohibit the ``dual-hatting'' of NNSA and DOE employees, and limit the authority of the Secretary of Energy to reorganize the statutory structure of the NNSA. 
   I tell the Senate they have to do some very difficult things by March 15 or they do not get the fenced funding that is in this bill. 
   For defense nuclear nonproliferation activities within the NNSA, the conference report provides $874 million, which is $8 million above the request and $145 million over current year. This amount of funding again shows the Congress' strong support of a broad variety of efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear materials and expertise from the former Soviet Union. 
   For other programs within the Department of Energy, the conference agreement provides $422 million for solar and renewables, which is $33 million below the request but $60 million over current year. 
   For nuclear energy, the conference report provides $260 million, $28 million below the request. The decrease is due to a transfer of cleanup obligations to the Office of Environmental Management. Nuclear power R&D actually increased significantly over current year. 
   The conference report provides $6.8 billion for environmental cleanup at DOE sites across the country. That is $56 million over the request and $496 million over current year. 
   For the Office of Science, the conference report provides $3.19 billion, $24 million over the request and $400 over current year. The conference added over $300 million in order to address significant shortfalls that existed in both the Senate and House bills. The conference agreement includes full funding of $278 million for the Spallation Neutron Source in Tennessee. 
   On the water side of the bill, the conference report provides $4.5 billion for water resource development activities of the Army Corps of Engineers, including $1.7 billion for construction activities, and $1.9 billion for ongoing operation and maintenance activities. The total Corps number is $461 million over the budget request and $415 million over the enacted level for fiscal year 2000. 
   The conference agreement includes funding for approximately 40 high priority new construction starts across the country. While the recommendation is a significant increase over both the budget request and fiscal year 2000 level, it should be pointed out that there is a $40 to $50 billion backlog of authorized projects awaiting construction. 
   Regarding the construction account of $1.7 billion, although it is $350 million above the request, it is within the range of the current year construction level of $1.6 billion. 
   The conference agreement provides $776 million for activities of the Bureau of Reclamation. That is $25 million below the budget request and $23 million over the funding level for fiscal year 2000. No funding is included for the California Bay-Delta restoration due to the lack of program authorization for fiscal year 2001 and future years. 
   The conference agreement includes funding to initiate a small number of new water conservation and water recycling and reuse projects. Finally, the conference agreement provides funding for a number of independent agencies. 
   For the Appalachian Regional Commission, the conference report provides $66.4 million, $5 million below the request but slightly above the current year. For the Denali Commission, the conference report provides $30 million, compared to $20 million provided in the current year. For the Delta Regional Authority, the conference report provides $20 million for the initial year of funding, a reduction from the request of $30 million. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the conference report provides $482 million, the amount of budget request. The conferees have also included a provision extending and revising NRC's fee recovery authority. The revised fee structure will reduce fees gradually over 5 years to address fairness and equity issues raised by licensees.  
   Overall, this is an outstanding energy and water conference report. We have made a good faith effort to address the concerns raised in the President's veto message and I believe we have a bill that the President will sign. 
   Suffice it to say, we have been able in this bill to keep the Corps of Engineers moving ahead, to have projects in the States that many Senators requested that we believe feel are very solid projects. Without the extra money given to us in the allocation, we would have been unable to do that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased today, Mr. President, that Senator Campbell introduced this critical legislation, and am proud to have supported and cosponsored his efforts from the beginning. He and I have faced many a battle regarding this issue over the years. I believe, however, that this legislation reflects the cooperative efforts among the parties to secure needed water supplies in Colorado and New Mexico, and I am pleased it may finally become law. 
   While we are running out of time in this Congress, the Secretary of Interior signed a Record of Decision on September 25 supporting these amendments, and his staff helped to negotiate them. The time is ripe for action. After years of hard work by the proponents, everyone is ready to move forward. 
   The Southern Utes and the Ute Mountain Utes have a 5-year window before they have to sue to enforce their water rights. Passage of this legislation will settle negotiated claims by the Colorado Ute Tribes on the Animas and La Plata Rivers, while protecting other water users. 
   For years now, the San Juan Water Commission, together with non-Indian water users in New Mexico, Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Ute and Southern Ute tribes have been negotiating with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency and other to resolve the complex problems surrounding the Animas-La Plata project and water usage in the four corners area. The bill has Administration support, which has been long-fought and hard-won. Finally, the administration has shown their interest in settling the Colorado Ute Indian water rights claims by accepting the tribes' own suggestions and water needs of the Four Corners non-Indian community. 
   In New Mexico, this legislation will provide needed water for the Navajo Community of Shiprock and protect San Juan-Chama project water, on which tribes, towns and cities along the Rio Grande rely. The New Mexico portion of the project will be used by the San Juan Water Commission to provide water to the residents of North Western New Mexico and by the Navajos for their use in the Northern Navajo Nation. This legislation is not intended to quantify or otherwise adversely affect the water rights of the Navajos, and they support this legislation. 
   In anticipation of development of the Animas-La Plata project, the state of  New Mexico set aside 49,200 acre feet of water in 1956. Importantly, this legislation allows the State Engineer from the State of New Mexico to return all or any portion of the New Mexico water right permit to the Interstate Stream Commission or the Animas-La Plata beneficiaries. 
   I am pleased the proponents of the Animas-La Plata project have participated in the long process to search for compromise. I support the direction of the participants in this process to reduce costs, provide environmental benefits, and provide water for the Colorado Ute tribes under the 1988 Settlement Act. 
   Mr. President, the administration has a duty to protect the federal trust relationship with the Ute tribes, as well as a duty to the state of New Mexico to make good on the promises of 40 years ago. S. 2508 represents a compromise for which all parties affected have labored long and hard to achieve. It is the long-overdue vehicle for implementing the United States' promise of water to New Mexico, Colorado and the Colorado Ute tribes while still addressing the needs of endangered species and the American taxpayer. Water scarcity continues to be a critical issue in the arid West and no one would benefit from litigation of water rights if we do not press forward. 
   According to recent scientific predictions, rationing may be required within the next two years. Successful development of additional water in the San Juan Basin, with its endangered fish, will give the rest of New Mexico good arguments why other endangered fish, such as the silvery minnow, can co-exist with additional water development. Additionally, successful settlement of the two tribes' claims will remove the threat of disrupting the water supply vital to the economic and industrial base for Northwest New Mexico, which contributes to the rest of New Mexico. The citizens of Northwest New Mexico have waited more than 40 years for this water--that's long enough.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I believe I have 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to support for the Defense Authorization Conference Report of 2001. The conferees have worked very hard to achieve consensus or reach compromises on the provisions found in this year's report. 
   The conference report contains many positive things for ensuring America's continued military dominance; in addition, it also includes several authorizations for defense activities in the state of New Mexico. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member for their contributions. 
   I would like to specifically address what has been achieved in this bill with respect to laser programs and directed energy technologies. I strongly believe that lasers, like THEL and Airborne Laser, will offer offensive and defensive military means far beyond our current capabilities. These programs deserve our full support. At the same time, we need better coordination of our nation's efforts in lasers and other directed energy technologies. 
   I am pleased the Committee accepted my amendment that requires the Secretary of Defense to implement the High Energy Laser Master Plan and authorizes up to $30 million for these vital technologies. This amendment also requires selection of a site for the Joint Technology Office (JTO) by the Secretary of Defense. The JTO will perform a critical role in achieving better coordination and execution of our nation's laser programs. The bill also underscores the vital role of the High Energy Laser Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range and the importance of DoD's close coordination with other federal agencies, academia and industry in creating a stable foundation for further progress in these technologies. 
   Although my original legislation encompassed all directed energy technologies, including microwaves, in this defense-wide effort, the conferees would not support this position. Instead, the legislation will require the Pentagon to take a hard look at integrating all other directed energy technologies into the current structure for High Energy Laser programs. From my perspective this would be a logical next step in the Pentagon's efforts to streamline and better coordinate its research programs. This would also accelerate progress and maximize efficiencies for these related technology areas. 
   The conferees also addressed shortfalls in some specific ongoing laser weapons programs. They authorized $85 million to restore the most of the Airborne Laser (ABL) program funding. The Air Force's ABL program is the only missile defense system currently contemplated that would strike and kill missiles in their boost phase. 
   In addition, the conferees reached a reasonable compromise on the control of funding for Airborne Laser after the Air Force radically cut that program's budget. The Air Force will retain funding control for ABL; however, it must have the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's (BMDO) approval before making any changes to any aspect of the program, including its budget. 
   The Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) was authorized at $15 million for FY2001. THEL represents one of the first weapons systems being tested that utilizes high energy lasers for the purposes of missile defense. I led the charge to obtain an additional $5.7 million in FY00 funding for continued testing of this weapon system this year. Since the passage of the Senate bill earlier this year, THEL has shown that lasers can provide effective, speed of light defenses against Katyusha rockets. In the coming months, THEL will be tested against other targets and will provide us additional insights into the lethality of this particular type of system. 
   I am committed to addressing the shortfalls in the science and technology funding to ensure more rapid development and fielding of high energy laser weapons. However, I am also committed to expanding these efforts to all directed energy technologies. While I appreciate the Committee's attention to these vital programs, more must be done to ensure the directed energy science and technology is fully streamlined and sufficiently funded. These technologies can assist in countering some of the most prevalent threats confronting us. 
   This long-awaited conference report will have a positive impact on the day-to-day concerns confronting our military. For example, quality of life received much needed attention. I applaud the 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel and the comprehensive health care for Medicare-eligible military retirees. The conference report also retained the extension of the TRICARE Prime benefit to families of service members assigned to remote locations and the elimination of co-payments for services received under TRICARE Prime. 
   This legislation contains landmark provisions with respect to healthcare for our military retirees. Many complicated and situation-specific problems currently exist with the health care programs for active and retired military members as well as for veterans. It will take more than one year of fixes to find the right combination of policies and ensure that the funding for military health care is not forced to compete with other defense priorities. 
   These will aid in addressing the health care crisis within our military and provide proof of our desire to keep our promise. I applaud the conferees for enacting sweeping reform to a broken system. 
   Military Construction and family housing is authorized at $8.8 billion, an increase of $788 million over the Administration's request. I am pleased that projects critical to the operational effectiveness and well being of the service members and military families residing in New Mexico were addressed in this bill. These are not glamourous projects. These authorizations will replace critical crumbling infrastructure, such as repair of the Bonito pipeline between La Luz and Holloman Air Force Base. 
   Five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams were included at a cost of $15.7 million. This will provide us with a total of 32 Civil Support Teams by the end of fiscal year 2001. These teams are comprised of full-time National Guard personnel trained and equipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological events in support of local first responders. One such team is currently being trained and fielded in New Mexico, ensuring that New Mexico constituents and its vital assets have better protection against such attacks. 
   The bill authorizes a total of $13 billion for Atomic Energy Defense activities of the Department of Energy. A total of $6.4 billion of this funding is for the National Nuclear Security Administration. 
   Over $1.0 billion is authorized for the nonproliferation and threat reduction  programs of the Departments of Defense and Energy. These programs continue to make great strides in the critical process of securing weapons of mass destruction and retaining scientific expertise in the former Soviet Union. To further ensure that these threat reduction programs achieve their goals, the committee has also included several initiatives to obtain greater commitment and necessary access from Russia. 
   Earlier this year I introduced a bill to improve the structure and signal a meaningful U.S. commitment to DOE's nuclear cities initiative. I strongly believe that without significant restructuring in nuclear weapons production complex of Russia the progress in strategic arms reductions could readily be reversed. Further, the proliferation threat of underemployed and underpaid Russian weapons scientists could create a direct, negative impact on international security. I thank the Committee for focusing efforts on this issue. 
   While I am pleased with the authorization levels to support stockpile stewardship and nonproliferation, I am dismayed that the conferees took it upon themselves to adopt additional provisions on polygraphs. These new requirements will entail polygraphs for an estimated 5,000 additional persons working in our nuclear complex. I find it astounding--especially in light of the findings in the Baker/Hamilton Report--that the conferees included these provisions. That report stated unequivocally that ``(t)he current negative climate is incompatible with the performance of good science. A perfect security system at a national laboratory is of no use if the laboratory can no longer generate the cutting-edge technology that needs to be protected .....'' 
   There is little evidence that polygraphs administered as a screening technique is an effective use of security resources. The Conferees apparently view mass polygraphs of everyone at the Labs as a silver bullet that will ensure no future security breaches. That is a naive view of security that fails to recognize that polygraphs are simply one tool among many, that must be wisely and judiciously used to ensure a strong security culture that will allow science to thrive. Otherwise, the silver bullet of mass polygraph will end up killing the labs, not protecting them. 
   In sum, security is a moot point if our national laboratories fail to achieve scientific advances worth protecting. The Baker/Hamilton Report clearly indicated that we should avoid further ``made in Washington'' rules that frustrate scientific pursuits and only serve to further demoralize laboratory personnel. I believe these provisions will only make a bad situation worse. 
   Finally, $38.9 billion is provided for the defense research, development, test and evaluation programs--an increase of $1.1 billion over the President's budget. This funding will focus on the revolutionary technologies to address emerging threats and ensure that America's military remains dominant in the future. 
   In years past I have repeatedly emphasized the need to stop the ebbing tide and end the lengthy decline in defense budgets. We must not tire in our efforts to maintain a strong, ready and professional military. Quality of life is central to recruitment and retention. Combat readiness of our armed forces must never be at risk. And we must ensure that we are developing and leveraging new technologies to the maximum extent. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines require the means necessary to respond to international uncertainty and address different and diffuse security threats. We must not fail them or U.S. citizens in rising to this challenge. 
   One of the most dangerous things confronting the United States of America is the current situation of morale at the three nuclear laboratories of the United States. These are the three labs that for three generations we have sent the greatest scientists in America, the best young scientists who wanted to go because it was a great place to work. We used to get the top graduate Ph.D.s from Texas A&M in physics. They would cherish going to one of the nuclear laboratories for 10 or 12 years. From MIT, from Harvard, from Cal Tech, everywhere. 
   We were being told about a current report available to this committee, while it was in conference, the committee that produced this bill, called a Baker-Hamilton report, named after Senator Baker and Representative Hamilton. It is about 6 weeks old. They were asked to check the current situation in our laboratories. They are more worried about the morale of the scientists there than any other single thing. They have concluded that the recruitment of young, bright scientists is off in excess of 50 percent because of the constant bombardment of those laboratories over the last 18 months with references to security, some of which has been corrected. 
   They also concluded that a laboratory which is perfectly secure but cannot maintain the highest degree of science in the world is not a very good laboratory. They maintain that we should do less polygraphs, not more, be more targeted, and more efficient and more effective. 
   Guess what the bill does. This bill permits 5,000 additional laboratory employees. This may even permit them to go down to a janitor, I don't know, and submit polygraph tests to them. And believe it or not, they provide a waiver for the Secretary of Energy. Then they say you cannot use the waiver if, in fact, the reason for it is that the laboratory is having morale problems and cannot keep its personnel to stay alive. That is paraphrasing. 
   I read the exact words: This amendment would prohibit the Secretary from using the waiver to maintain the scientific viability of a DOE laboratory. 
   That is the precise reason you should be able to use a waiver, the viability of the laboratories. 
   Frankly, I am not at all sure everyone who signed this conference report and produced the bill that they really think is a great bill knows that provision is in there. 
   I say to my good friend, the chairman of the committee, I worked hard and fast and side by side with the Senator from Virginia to get a new law to create a new, semiautonomous agency with which he helped so much. It is now known as the National Nuclear Safety Administration, headed by a great general whom you know, General Gordon. If you asked him, Can these laboratories work under these kinds of conditions? he would tell you: Please don't do that. He would say: Please don't do that. That is the wrong thing to do. 
   Frankly, all I am asking is that the Senate take heed of what I am saying. I am not asking for anything more. I am not even asking the distinguished chairman for anything today. I only hope he is listening and next year, early on, when the Senator from New Mexico tries to change this provision consistent with the Baker-Hamilton report--and almost everybody who has looked at our National Laboratories since the Wen Ho Lee case would agree, too--I hope the distinguished chairman and the chairman's staff will consider, early in the year of the next Congress, something that will fix this provision; 5,000 additional polygraph employees is not the way to go with the laboratories in the position they are in now. 
   There is no evidence that polygraphs of the type they are talking about have anything to do with security, veracity, or anything else. I know the people who work there. It is somewhat of an insult to consider the average employee, some of whom have been there 30 years, has to be subject to a polygraph because security has gone awry in the laboratories. 
   I really wish I had had a chance to present this issue. I think it is exactly the kind of thing we should not be doing. I am going to do everything I can, starting next year with the first legislation that is around, to change this. In the meantime, I am glad the Secretary does not have to go next month and start immediately imposing these polygraphs. He has a little bit of time. I hope he squeezes the time so next year we can fix it. That is all I have on this subject. 
   I say to the distinguished chairman, thank you for yielding me time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. First, I will be as quick as I can because I understand Senator GRAMM wants to comment at more length than I. Let me say to the Senator from Nebraska, when you came to the Senate, I had already been here a while. I didn't know anything about you. I didn't know you were a Medal of Honor recipient of the United States. I know you don't like to hear this, but I want to tell you that what you are doing tonight shows that you have something about you that is intuitively or instinctively courageous because what you are down here doing is not so easy for many Senators because, obviously, there is going to be a lot of guff for what you have proposed tonight, asking that we not waive the Budget Act. 
   I wish to also say to everyone that neither of us--including Senator GRAMM--are saying we should not do what we are doing tonight for our veterans. What we are saying is, with 2 days left in the session, neither the House nor the Senate having any detailed hearings, nor the Medicare people having detailed hearings on this, we come out of a conference with an agreement and propose a little item that over a decade will cost $60 billion. 
   That may be something veterans are entitled to, but I believe we are all thinking that there is no end to American prosperity and to American surpluses. I think we have come to the conclusion that they will be here forever and they are in quantities beyond anything we can imagine--and whatever goes in the waning moments goes. I think I can support this; I just don't believe we ought to do it now, with 2 days left, without sufficient hearings on the effect on the rest of Government. I might say, without trying to figure out who we are going to give prescription drugs to under Medicare, who are also people who are hurting very much and who think Medicare should have covered them better--there are millions of those people. 
   I believe the Budget Act singularly permitted the Congress to get its deficit under control. There are benefits from that. Every single American, every single veteran, and everyone in this country participates in a prosperity movement, with low interest rates and things people thought they would never acquire because when we used to stand up and say, ``Don't waive the Budget Act,'' nobody waived it. In fact, I didn't check tonight to see how many years had gone by when neither Senator DOMENICI, nor Senator GRAMM, nor Senator KERREY, nor whomever would say that violates the Budget Act to see if you could get 61 votes. That is why the decade of the 1990s became the decade of discipline. 
   Do you know the Government of the United States, on average, for the decade of the 1990s grew 3.3 percent, the most formidable in terms of small growth in the last 50 years? There is no reason other than that as to why this deficit has come down the way it has and prosperity has grown the way it has. 
   I believe next year is a year to look at the big picture, to fit this into all of the other things we have to do. But I don't believe we ought to waive a Budget Act which has protected our people, protected our veterans, and protected the cost of military equipment because of inflation coming down. 
   Those are all great big benefits that we don't quite understand, but they are very important. 
   Again, tonight by insisting that we comply with the Budget Act, you are showing me a degree of courage that makes me understand who you are. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2000 budget through September 30, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 2001 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 290), which replaced the 2000 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 68). 
   The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $19.3 billion in budget authority and by $20.6 billion in outlays. Current level is $28 million below the revenue floor in 2000. 
   Since my last report, dated September 5, 2000, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-259). This action changed the 2000 current level of budget authority and outlays. 
   This is my last report for fiscal year 2000.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I want to congratulate Senator BYRD on his comments with regard to the very distinguished Mike Mansfield, and what happened to him recently with the passing of his beautiful and wonderful wife. I, too, in reading about him--I didn't experience as much of him as the Senator from West Virginia did--but he did things in a rather sensational and unique way. 
   Even though I didn't know him as long as the Senator from West Virginia, and didn't feel his presence as much, he is a very wonderful American. 
   Can you imagine in his early life what he did, how he became educated and found himself majority leader of the Senate? He did that for a long time, and is still the recordholder.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday, and maybe two previous occasions on the Senate floor, I discussed the Gore budget and what is going to happen to the huge amount of money that we are getting from the taxpayers, which we have begun to call a ``surplus.'' I choose now to call it the ``tax overpayment.'' It is what the people are paying in that we don't need. 
   I would like to, once again, make sure the Republican candidate for President, George W. Bush, and the candidate for Vice President--who last night did such a marvelous job--the distinguished former Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney--I urge them to continue to tell the American people what the Gore budget will look like. 
   When it is mentioned, everybody says this came from the Budget Committee staff and the Republicans, and, therefore, you shouldn't use it; that it is partisan; that it is like paper that is not even worth using. 
   I say to our two candidates, keep using it. Keep saying it is true because they are about as good as any people we have ever had to look at budgets. I am chairman of that committee, and, frankly, I have relied on their expertise year after year. I don't think I have to exaggerate and say they are the best. They are the best at getting to the bottom of programs and analyzing them. I asked them to do it. They did it. They gave us a major report on the subject, and I will say to our candidate--to the Governor of Texas, to the former Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney--no matter what they say about it, you use it. 
   The Gore budget has 200 new programs in it. If you estimate appropriately their cost based upon what is said about the program, you cannot pay for those programs without using all of the on-budget surplus and $700 to $900 billion of the Social Security surplus. 
   Now, that is our version. We think it is true. And we don't believe the American people actually think when you finally have a surplus--because we are paying so much more in taxes than we need--we don't think the American people want the Government to grow at the largest rate in modern history. Probably if you put the Gore expenditure budget into effect, you will increase Government in 1 to 2 years, more than any modern year, excepting maybe the Lyndon Johnson Great Society years. 
   Now, it doesn't matter to me as the chairman of the Budget Committee what Vice President GORE says about these figures, nor what our distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Vice Presidential nominee who I have great, great respect for, it doesn't matter what they keep saying. The truth is, we have an analysis of that budget. Early next week we will have a full analysis. They finally put their budget on to sheets of paper. It is a very large budget. We will finally have that analyzed. I am told it will come out no different. It will come out the same way, 200-plus new programs, the largest new expenditure in the next 5 years that we have ever had in the Government. If you take them at their word and do all of them, you cannot do it without spending part of the Social Security surplus. No matter what they say about its source, it is as good as anything they have. 
   I have great respect for the Vice Presidential nominee. He knows that. Last night he said something that wasn't true, and I ask him to revisit this. He said their budget, the budget they have, analyzed for the future, was done by a neutral body called the Congressional Budget Office. That is to make sure that everybody would think it is authentic and that the Domenici budget analysis is not authentic. I assure everyone, the Congressional Budget Office does not do an analysis of either candidate's budget. In fact, that is not within their prerogative. They have not analyzed the Gore budget. They have not analyzed the budget of the Governor of Texas, either. And they won't. 
   The Democrats have somebody analyzing theirs, watching out for them, who is on their team, and they want everybody to think ours, and the majority staff has worked on this for years, they want everyone to believe it has no credibility. I think to the contrary. 
   My friend Dick Cheney will be in my State in a few days. I hope he talks about this subject. Let them bring up the fact that Democrats don't think it is worth very much. We will make sure the public understands we have as good an analysis as anyone. If the Democratic nominee for President does every program he contemplates--there are some that are superexpensive. There are some universal programs in there that will never get adopted by Congress, but we might as well make sure the public understands they are expected, they are contemplated, they are out there to tell the people, elect us and we will do all these things. 
   That is part of my reason for coming to the floor, so anyone who wonders whether that is authentic, I can assure Members, I will not give ground on this through the election and after the election. I believe it is right. I think our candidates ought to use it. 
   Now I will talk about the so-called Al Gore tax cut plan and the George W. Bush plan. I don't know if I have enough time today to go through the George W. Bush plan, which is very simple. I am not sure I can do that because today I want to talk a little bit about a rather unique way to cut taxes, or allege you are cutting taxes, for middle-income America when you are not. 
   If there is a middle-income American who happens to be 
   listening, and they say, oh, boy, Vice President GORE has spoken so much about giving the middle class a tax cut, I will get a tax cut--my friends, you are not necessarily going to get the tax cut. The Gore plan says the Internal Revenue Service will decide whether you get a tax cut. And you are going to apply for it when you file your tax return, and if you are a family, you have to go through up to 25 different tests with the Internal Revenue Service to determine what you are entitled to. In fact, if the people think the Internal Revenue Code is complicated, and IRS is not doing a good job, then remember that every single so-called tax cut that Vice President GORE is telling you about is going to be administered by the Internal Revenue Service, which is going to pass judgment on whether you are entitled to one of the scores of tax credits or other tax benefits. Let me go further, the IRS will determine what tax refunds or government check you are entitled to, because under Vice President GORE's plan not only taxpayers get tax breaks, people who pay no taxes get government checks. 
   People will fill out their federal tax return. They will find a check in the mail from the Internal Revenue Service, even though they pay no taxes. 
   That is part of his tax plan. The part for middle Americans, middle-income Americans, you cannot just file your tax return and say, I am a middle-income American earning $65,000, and I want my 5-percent tax cut, or 7 or 10, you have to ask yourself if you qualify for a tax credit or a refundable tax credit under this plan. There are all kinds of reasons you might get some tax relief, but they are all going to administered by the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Isn't that nice? So if you apply, and the IRS agrees, you get to use your tax money. If you apply and if you fit, you get to use your taxpayer dollars for a certain specified purpose. 
   The most significant difference in the two men's tax proposals is that George W. Bush gives you a tax refund and you can spend it for whatever you want. The Vice President, the nominee from the Democratic Party, gives you no tax cut to spend as you may. Since it is your money, you have to qualify as if you were under a Federal program. 
   GORE wants to imbed social policy of the country into the tax code. We are substituting the Internal Revenue Service as the one that gets to see whether or not you are going to be able to have these particular services paid for by the Federal Government. I cannot believe when the American people understand this that they are going to say they want that tax approach.  
   Let me repeat, in order to get all of the so-called Gore middle-class tax cut, a family has to meet 25 different tests, at least one for each of the 25 proposed pieces of the Gore Middle Class tax cut. That means if you don't meet the tests, you don't get any relief, any help. Wouldn't it be better to have a 5-percent or a 10-percent tax cut, and you use the money as you see fit, if you are $67,000, a $72,000 family or $35,000 or $40,000? You have to understand or try to understand and then comply with 25 sets of rules before you see $1 of so-called tax relief. 
   I thought tax policy was supposed to be neutral. The best tax policy does not try to engineer social behavior. I didn't think it was supposed to be the vehicle by which you ran scores of social programs and you told Americans if you want that program, you can pay for it and we will give you the money; but if you don't want that program, you don't get any tax relief. 
   GORE proposes to substitute the Internal Revenue Service for a score of Government programs. 
   Instead of saying let's create a new federal program in this area with Government, AL GORE says file a tax return, and if you fit the cookie cutter profile, you can help your great grandmother who is sick--you get some of your tax overpayment back to help pay some of those expenses. The Government will help you. It will not help you with a program, it will help you so that you will get a piece of the taxes you pay refunded--or deducted. 
   This is not a step toward tax simplification. It will make the Tax Code more complicated. If it is too complicated today, it will become even more complicated. I think it would not take 3 or 4 years before the American people will force us to throw it out. But I do not think it will ever become law. 
   Some of the tax cuts are not even for taxpayers, much less for middle-class Americans. Because of the income limits, many people who think they are middle class are left totally out because they earn too much money to pigeonholed into AL GORE's ``middle class,'' or to be entitled to one of the myriad tax credits the Vice President suggests is good tax policy. 
   A refundable tax credit is Tax Code talk for Government checks to people who do not pay Federal income taxes. It sounds more like a way to have some welfare spending and use the income tax code to administer it. There is only one refundable credit in the code now, and many believe it is one too many. But I do not believe almost all of the entire surplus that is going to go to taxpayers ought to be done in this way, with refundable tax credits going to people who pay no federal income tax so long as the person does what the Vice President thinks you ought to do with your money. Refundable child care credits, refundable day care, refundable after school care--all specific and all already covered in the Earned Income tax credit. You don't have to be a taxpayer to get a so-called middle-income tax cut for child care, family leave, or stay-at-home parents or kids in afterschool care, or expanding the earned-income tax credit. More spending programs dressed up as tax cuts will be there for those who do not pay any taxes. 
   In addition to refundable credits, the Vice President proposes initiates that this Administration has vetoed. For instance, tuition savings accounts are listed now as one of those things in the long list of things that you might put your money away for and get some tax relief. AL GORE says he would like to enact them. Interesting; this administration vetoed that bill for them more than once. 
   The Vice President says he is for marriage penalty relief yet the Administration vetoed the bill providing it. The Vice President's proposal is curious. Let me say there is no marriage penalty relief if you own your own home and pay a mortgage. Isn't that interesting? This administration boasts record numbers of American homeowners. Yet, they will not give a dollar of marriage tax penalty relief to people who own homes and pay mortgages, again, using the Tax Code for social approaches in the United States. Perhaps the reason for this one is there are too many people who are building too many homes, and maybe we ought to slow it down. 
   There is a tax credit for individual health insurance. Yet you get part of the middle-income tax cut if you need additional training, or certification programs. That is a separate notion in their Tax Code. 
   So, today, I would like to start a series of discussions which I will bring to the floor regularly. The next one will be: What is the George Bush tax plan. The next time I come, I will include in the RECORD the entirety of Vice President GORE's so-called middle-income tax relief. I will bring the entire list. You might say: Why are you bringing a list? Isn't a middle-income tax cut just a percentage, just a cut? 
   No; it is myriad programs. If you do not qualify as having done one of those, or choose to do one of them, you do not 
   get tax credits nor refundable tax credits. That is a very new way to run America. 
   We are going to expand those beyond recognition. The most significant one we have now is the earned-income tax credit. It is refundable. A lot of people who pay no federal income tax get a check from the federal government under the Earned Income Tax Credit program. It is an encouragement for low-income workers to work--although we have changed that, where you do not have to work. But, just think, we have a few of them. The entire middle-income tax proposal of the Vice President is going to be specific things that specific Americans qualify for or they do not get any tax relief. 
   Essentially, I am going to close saying the most significant aspect of the Bush tax cut is that the 15-percent bracket is cut to 10. This is a tax cut for taxpayers. That encompasses almost the entirety of the tax cuts--15 percent at the bottom goes to 10. But, you see, everybody at every bracket pays taxes on some of their income at the lowest rate--15-percent bracket. So cutting the lowest rate helps all taxpayers. It is very simple. You get it because of the tax bracket and whatever other things are in the current Tax Code. 
   I repeat, there is much talk about the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent pays 33 percent of the taxes in America. When the Bush plan is completed they will pay 34 percent of the total tax take of America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in strong support of the conference report accompanying H.R. 4578, the Interior and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the joint House-Senate conference committee, I appreciate the difficult task before the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member to balance the diverse priorities funded in this bill--from our public lands, to major Indian programs and agencies, energy conservation and research, and the Smithsonian and federal arts agencies. They have done a masterful job meeting important program needs in this final bill. 
   The pending conference report provides an unprecedented $18.9 billion in new budget authority and $11.9 billion in new outlays to fund the Department of Interior and related agencies. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account the Senate bill totals $18.9 billion in BA and $17.4 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2001. The Senate bill is exactly at the revised section 302(b) allocation for both BA and in outlays filed by the Appropriations Committee earlier today. 
   I would particularly like to thank Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD for their commitment to Indian programs in this year's Interior and related agencies appropriation bill. They have included increases of $160 million for Bureau of Indian Affairs education construction, $214 million for the Indian Health Service, and nearly $102 million for the operation of Indian programs. 
   I commend the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for bringing this important measure to the floor with significant resources totaling $1.6 billion to address the aftermath of the devastating summer and fall forest fires, including my initiative to undertake hazardous fuels reduction activities within the urban/wildland interface to protect our local communities--the so-called Happy Forests initiative. 
   This bill also includes an important, bipartisan compromise to establish a new Land Conservation, Preservation and Infrastructure Program that will dedicate $12 billion over the next six years to conservation programs. This is an unprecedented commitment to conservation efforts by the Federal Government. I am pleased to support this initiative in its final form. 
   I appreciate the consideration given by my colleagues to several priority items for my constituents in New Mexico, which are included in the final bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I put a little editorial up here, and I hope I made it big enough that those who photograph what we talk about here can see it. 
   I want to read this paragraph in yellow, and I want to speak to Vice President GORE's constant harping about the 1 percent of the American taxpayers getting too much of a tax break.  I would like to do that for about 10 or 12 minutes. 
   But first, let me suggest to the middle-class American people who have been waiting for a tax cut that if you elect Vice President GORE, you can wait perhaps forever because, as this editorial says, he might say over and over and over--maybe as many times as he said ``1 percent'' the other night--that he is for middle-income Americans getting a tax break. 
   But this is the Washington Post--not the Washington Times or the Albuquerque Journal--that says:  
   If Mr. Gore believes middle-class people need a tax break, he might better give them one--and let them decide how to spend the money. If he believes the Government should do more to promote education, he could do so more effectively with truly targeted spending programs rather than with tax credits that, for example, go to those who could and would pay for tuition in any case along with those who need the help. But for political reasons, the Democrats, as in 1992 and 1996, believe they need to cloak their programs in the language and form of tax cuts. One result would be an ever more complex Tax Code.  
   The truth of the matter is that the Vice President of the United States spoke the other night about the unfairness of the tax proposals of George W. Bush. 
   I just want to start by correcting one thing for sure. 
   There are no middle-income tax cuts in Vice President GORE's proposal--the last time he spoke to it, the second time he spoke to it, and the time he sent us an 81-page budget. There are no middle-class tax cuts. Why? Because he chooses to say to the American people: If you do this with your money, you get a credit; if you do that with your money, you get a credit. 
   But for those who do not do this or that because they don't have any children to put in day care or they don't have any of the other things they need that he wants to give them tax credit for, the overwhelming percentage of the middle class gets zero. 
   That is maybe what we ought to be talking about whenever he says 1 percent. Perhaps we ought to say middle-class people, zero; middle-class Americans, zero--maybe 16 times, as he did the other night in referring to ``1 percent.'' 
   Having said that, I want to talk about the progressive taxes the American people pay and the progressive system we live under because I believe there are millions and millions and millions of Americans who have not been told what our Tax Code is and have not been told what George W. Bush's tax proposals would do. Let me try that for a few minutes. 
   I just told you what the Washington Post said about his tax proposals. In essence, even when he chooses to help--that is, the Vice President--the middle-class Americans, he chooses, I say to my friend from Alabama, to tell them how to spend the tax cut. 
   That is the essence of the difference between the across-the-board cut of George W. Bush and the Vice President, although he has much less on the tax side, in any event--the Vice President--but he chooses to say: Mr. and Mrs. America, I don't want you to have a $1,500 tax cut if you are making $60,000 or $50,000. What I want you to do, if you want to take advantage of what I want you to do, if you do one of these five or six things as we have said, you will get a tax break. 
   If you are Mr. and Mrs. America, you might say: I don't need any of those taxes. Why don't you just give me my money and let me spend it? 
   That is one of the very big differences between the two parties at this point, as indicated by this editorial. 
   In 1992 and 1996, Vice President GORE again chose in behalf of his colleagues to say: We want to give you a tax cut, but do not misunderstand; you have to use it our way or you don't get it. 
   Is there anybody in America who thinks a tax cut should be used only the way the Federal Government wants them to use it? I don't think they even understand a tax cut to be that. But you can rest on it, that is what he is talking about--not a single middle-income tax cut--zero. I repeat. 
   I would like to talk a little bit on what has happened to the Tax Code of the United States. 
   Mr. President and fellow Senators, we have the fairest and most progressive Tax Code any country has ever lived under. Let me tell you what it does today. 
   If anyone wants one of these, I will gladly give them one. The Internal Revenue Service gives us the information, and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a combined committee, gave us this information. 
   Let me talk about the 1 percent. 
   Fellow Americans, 1 percent of the taxpayers of America--1 percent--currently pay a shocking 33 percent of the taxes. 
   Let me repeat, Mr. President. On the income tax side, the top 1 percent of Americans pay 33 percent of the taxes that America collects from income. They are rather wealthy. They make $250,000 and over, and 1 percent pays 33 percent of the taxes. 
   Let me right off the bat give you an astonishing number. If you are to adopt George W. Bush's across-the-board tax cut, guess what percent the top 1 percent will pay then? Remember I said, right now under our very progressive code, they pay 33 percent of all the taxes we collect. 
   I say to my friend from Alabama, it is a startling revelation. After we cut everybody across the board, as George Bush suggests, the top 1 percent will pay 34 percent total taxes. In other words, their portion of the total taxes will go up 1 percent, not come down. Isn't that interesting? 
   So everyone understands who is rich and who isn't and who pays a lot of taxes and who doesn't, let's talk about the top 10 percent of taxpayers. Most people watching and most people visiting are in that bracket because the top 10 percent of the taxpayers are people earning $79,000 or higher. How much of the total taxes collected by America from income does the top 10 percent pay? I am sure, unless someone has studied it, in your wildest guess you will not conclude this. Sixty-seven percent of the income taxes collected come from the top 10 percent of the people in this country who are earning $79,000. Imagine. 
   Can anyone imagine a fairer system if you want to tax people who earn money than to have 1 percent of the population that makes substantial money pay 33 percent of the taxes, and the top 10 percent of 79 and higher pay 67 percent? Frankly, it is obvious to me our Vice President is, once again, running on an issue that has been tried before, and we are very grateful as a nation that it has never worked. He is practicing the art of class warfare. He wants to make sure Americans do not trust the capitalist system where people might make more money, one versus another, depending on what they are doing, what they have invested in, and for what they have taken a risk. He wants to make the issue that the top 10 percent, which pays 33 percent of the taxes, does not deserve to be looked at when we look at cutting taxes for Americans. 
   I am quite sure that sooner or later the American people are going to catch on that everybody who pays taxes gets a tax break. So nobody will have a misunderstanding, if you don't pay taxes, you don't get a tax break. I think that is pretty fundamental. There are many millions of Americans working for a living who do not pay any U.S. income tax. Right off the bat, when you speak about giving other people who are earning less tax breaks, we have to understand a very large percentage of Americans don't pay any taxes. They may think they are paying a lot because they are paying Social Security taxes, and neither candidate is recommending, from what I can tell, that we dramatically reduce the Social Security--other than George W. Bush saying let's investment 2 percent. Otherwise, I haven't heard anybody saying that onerous Social Security tax is the one that ought to be fixed. 
   Let me repeat, when the tax plan is in place under Mr. Bush, the top 1 percent will pay $4 trillion in taxes when we have finished the tax across-the-board cut. Let's give that again: That top 1 percent will pay $4 trillion in income taxes, and it will be 34 percent of the new income taxes that we are taking in. 
   What will that $4 trillion buy that 1 percent of Americans are paying in taxes? It will buy all of the following: All of our defense programs, welfare, food stamps, child nutrition, State child health insurance. We just picked some programs. That top 1 percent will pay for all of that out of what they pay in income taxes.  
   If Mr. GORE continues to refer to this top 1 percent as public enemy No. 1, then I can only say that the top 1 percent are high-income folks; the top 10 percent earn $79,000 and 
   above. One group pays 33 percent of the taxes; and the other group pays 67. 
   What should we do? Should we say because they pay 67 percent of the taxes but they make $79,000 or more they should get no tax reduction? If you are going to have a tax reduction because you have a giant surplus, let's be fair and say the American Tax Code is fair. We ought to continue to be fair, leave it as fair as it was, but make sure we understand the top 10 percent deserve some tax relief, since they are paying 67 percent of the tax. 
   Let me also suggest that the bottom rung of wage earners and taxpayers in America--so there is no misunderstanding about my progressivity comment that we have a progressive code--the bottom 50 percent pay 4 percent; the bottom 50 percent of our earners pay 4 percent of the taxes of America. 
   I think we have a pretty fair system. In fact, it is very heavily skewed towards those people making $79,000 or more. But George Bush, from what I can analyze, intends to leave it the same. It will come out like it is in terms of progressivity, excepting that those in the top 1 percent, by a coincidence of reducing the total tax take, will end up paying 34 percent instead of 33--even if we give them a tax break. 
   I do believe it is rather authentic when the Washington Post says to Vice President GORE, if you want to give the middle income a tax cut, give it to them. Don't tell them what they must use it for in order to get a tax credit or tax break. That is not very American. Why should the Government tell wage earners, people who are making money in the American system, what they must do with their income if they want a tax break? I thought if you were going to give it back, you would give it back to them so they can spend it. 
   I will discuss another issue, Mr. Vice President. I don't come today to the floor to talk about the case of the schoolgirl in Florida who had to stand for one of her first days of classes this fall because $150,000 worth of computers had yet to be unboxed. That is one of the statements made by our Vice President in his debate. It is now, today, authentic, that is not a true statement. The people from that school and that school district have denied it. I think by this hour the Gore campaign has said it is a mistake. 
   The Vice President said essentially in his own words that the analysis of his budget from the budget experts who work for this Senator, the chairman of the Budget Committee, although they happen to work for me, what they produced as the estimate of the cost of his budget ideas would use up the entire surplus and $700 to $900 billion of the Social Security surplus. He said something like, it is not worth the paper. 
   I have analyzed with this same staff many budgets. They have come out as right as anyone around. They said before the Vice President put his entire package together, that if every single program he advocates would get funded--it is 200 or more new programs--there will be between 20,000 and 30,000 new Federal employees. 
   Incidentally, when the Vice President takes great credit for shrinking the Government and says we have reduced the number of people working for the Government, it would be good to note that 90 percent of the shrinkage of Federal employees is because the military was reduced. 
   Between 85 and 90 percent of that entire personnel reduction is from military reductions. 
   But let's get back to this. That budget staff said there are 200 new programs in the Vice President's ideas for America. They also suggested to me it is a new era of big government, excessive government, and obviously huge increases in what government will do. 
   I laid that before the Senate in this report. It is as correct today as it was then. And, indeed, we have now seen Vice President GORE's plan all in one package. They reanalyzed it and said their original estimate is right, that he would have to spend the surplus to pay for his entire budget. We will have that report next week in an edition similar to this one, in which each program is analyzed and we tell the American people either the Vice President is suggesting myriad programs he does not intend to do or intends to do less than he said because if he is going to do what he says in his last written proposal, you cannot do those programs without spending all of the surplus and part of--not all of it but part of the surplus that belongs to Social Security. 
   I close by saying the Vice President Tuesday night talked a lot about the lockbox. Isn't it amazing that Democrats, including the Vice President, talk about the lockbox as if they invented it; they pursued it; they are the ones who really advocated it and kept it alive. I want to say this is one time when Senator DOMENICI has to say: That is not true. It came out of the Budget Committee and I was the first Senator to suggest it. The proposal I suggested has never been voted on to this date because it is a real lockbox. It really makes it tough to spend either Social Security--and if you want to use the same format for Medicare, that is fine. But let's get it straight. We have been trying to get a lockbox passed up here from our side. Whatever we propose is either too strict, too rigid, doesn't have enough flexibility for the Treasury Department, or something. But let's make sure everybody understands we started the idea; we pursued it with great vigor. It is now part, I believe, of what we believe. Whether we get it passed or not, in our form, I believe everybody around here is going to be frightened to death if a Budget Committee says: Hey, this budget is spending Social Security surplus money. I believe we have that ingrained in our minds because the public expects it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator BINGAMAN to introduce the ``Physician Recruitment and Retention Act of 2000.'' 
   Almost like clockwork one can pick up an Albuquerque newspaper and read about the shortage of physicians in New Mexico and the resulting problems. When individuals have difficulty receiving adequate medical treatment, action must be taken. 
   For example, in Albuquerque an urban area of almost 700,000 there are only two neurosurgeons besides the five practicing at the University of New Mexico. Such a ratio can only cause one thing, severe difficulties for patients. Thus, a patient recently waited eighteen hours in an Albuquerque emergency room before seeing a neurosurgeon. 
   I would ask my colleagues the following: what good are hospitals filled with the latest technology if there are not enough doctors? And what good are modern medical offices if there are not enough doctors to treat the patients in a timely manner? 
   The problem I have just described is not just occurring in New Mexico, rather other states are experiencing similar problems because of a common set of problems. I would submit the combination of high levels of poverty and low Medicare reimbursement rates causes a twofold problem. 
   First, patients often have difficulty obtaining timely care and second, states cannot effectively recruit and retain their physicians. Our Bill builds upon the simple proposition that if Medicare Physician reimbursement rates are raised, patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries. 
   The Bill we are introducing creates a two state demonstration program to address these problems by increasing Medicare Physician reimbursements by 5 percent for a period of three years if certain criteria are met. 
   The Bill also authorizes a GAO study to determine whether: (1) patient access to care and the ability of states to recruit and retain physicians is adversely impacted when the enumerated factors in the previous section are present; and (2) increased Medicare Physician reimbursements improve patient access to care and the ability of states to recruit and retain physicians. 
   Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, on this very important issue.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I, first, congratulate Senator GORTON. Everything considered--the pressure of the closing, the politics of this season--I think he produced a very good bill and I compliment him. I would like to quickly talk with him about three issues because they have been very dear to me and we have finally come around to solving all three of them in this bill. 
   First, the American Indian people will thank us because for the first time we are making the case for replacing Indian schools. They are so much in disrepair that nobody would send their kids to them, but there are no other schools to go to; they are out in Indian country, and we, the Government, happen to own them. There has been a dramatic increase this year. Thanks to this committee, we will add six new schools, and we will do a very large amount of maintenance on buildings that desperately need it. If Congress will heed what was discussed, they will do this for 5 or 6 years and get rid of the entire backlog. 
   Senator, you have heard me for years ask the administration to give us a multiyear budget proposal to take care of Indian schools because if we don't pay for them nobody will. They are ours. This year the President put such language in his budget after consultation with a number of us. It is a little late, but nonetheless the Indian people can finally say, ``We see some daylight,'' with reference to adequate schools for our kids.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator, my good friend, very much. 
   Second, we debated on the floor of the Senate an interesting sounding amendment. We called it ``Happy Forests.'' It was a $240 million amendment on this bill on the floor. I thought I was going to get a lot of guff here on the floor because I asked for $240 million and divided it among the two agencies that control our property, the Forest Service and the BLM. What I wanted to do with the money was to push, with a great deal of vigor, for these two Departments to go out and inventory where the forests were close to our cities, where the forests have grown up, where cities have grown up and where there is a proximity of buildings and people to the forest because that is very risky. 
   We did strike a positive tone with the administration when they admitted that there were many such cases and many examples. We have cited examples of a city such as Santa Fe in New Mexico where its water resource is right in the forest. If that forest happened to burn, they would lose their water supply. So we thought we ought to pursue this and start a list of those and make the Federal Government start to list the risky ones and then start to clean them up. 
   We had to argue for 3 days. We got about 75 percent of what we wanted. We gave in to the administration on some in a very valid compromise. But I can say as to number, as many as a few hundred communities that are right in the forests, they should be seeing the Federal Government around coming up with 
   some plans to try to alleviate this underbrush problem and growth that may, indeed, cause these communities to burn when we could prevent it with some maintenance and cleanup. 
   We have not reached, to my satisfaction, language that will push this expeditiously because they are fearful in the White House that we are going to push some of the environmental laws. We made it clear the environmental laws apply. Nonetheless, there will be some difficulty on the part of the bureaus of the Federal Government because they have to move with some dispatch and they have to advise people a lot more than they ever did about the proximity of fire and the risk to them and where they are scheduled to do the cleanup--where is that? They are going to have to start advising communities. 
   So I thank my good friend for that.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of extending enabling legislation for the proposed Air Force Memorial. Much has already been accomplished by the Air Force Memorial Foundation in its effort to make the Memorial a reality. More time is necessary, however, to complete the work that is left to ensure that our Air Force heroes are properly recognized. 
   Despite decades of unflagging commitment to America's national security, the U.S. Air Force is the only branch of the armed services without a memorial in the Nation's Capitol The time has come to establish a site where the American people can honor their aviation heroes. Building the memorial will accomplish this by recognizing yesterday's aviation pioneers, serving as a tribute to those serving their country today, inspiring future generations to proudly serve in the Air Force in the future, and by preserving the airpower lessons of the 20th century. 
   American policymakers have long understood the importance of establishing air superiority during military crises. Time and again, the United States Air Force has answered the call of duty and performed with distinction. Mr. President, we owe these brave men and women the honor of their own memorial, and I urge my colleagues to support extension of this enabling legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation of importance to military members serving at Cannon Air Force Base and the community serving that Air Force Base. This bill would allow the Secretary of the Air Force to convey hospital equipment from a closed hospital facility at Cannon to a new public hospital in Portales, New Mexico. 
   This is another win-win possibility for the local Air Force personnel and the surrounding community. The hospital at Cannon Air Force Base was closed several years ago. However, the equipment remains at that facility and has been collecting dust since the facility's closure. 
   A new, state-of-the-art hospital is now being built to serve Roosevelt County citizens. While the County has taken tremendous strides towards establishing a first-rate hospital, excess equipment from the Air Force Base would help ameliorate immediate costs of fully equipping the new hospital. In addition, service members and their families who reside in Portales will certainly make use of the new hospital facility in their area. 
   The Wing Commander and Medical Commander at Cannon Air Force Base agree that this is a beneficial arrangement. They have met with local community leaders and civilian hospital administrators to carefully review what equipment from the closed Air Force facility should be transferred to the new community hospital. Everyone agrees that this is a positive action to strengthen relations and provide better medical care for both civilian and military community members.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise to tell the Senate this is a good bill. I hope we will pass it. 
   The Senate passed this bill 97-1. It went to conference. Obviously, there were some changes made in conference but clearly not significant enough to have somebody vote against this bill. 
   When the call of the roll occurs, we are going to hear that a number of Senators on the other side of the aisle are  going to vote against the bill. I hope everybody understands that most of them have asked for things in this bill, and they have been granted things in this bill their States desperately need. I don't know how all that will work out, but they are being asked to vote against this because the President of the United States, after signing similar language regarding the Missouri River four different times, has suggested that this year, if it is in this bill, he will veto it. 
   This bill has taken much work on the defense side; that is, for the nuclear deterrent, nuclear weapons activities of America, and those activities related to it that have to do with nonproliferation. We have done an excellent job in increasing some of the very important work of these National Laboratories and our nuclear defense deterrent, people, equipment, and facilities. Sooner or later many more Senators are going to have to recognize the significance of that part of this bill. 
   The second part of it has to do with nondefense discretionary appropriations; that is, mostly water and water projects across this great land. Many of them are in here for Senators on the Democrat side of the aisle. We were pleased to work with them on that. 
   I hope the bill will get sent to the President and we will be able to work something out with reference to the Missouri River. The President indicates now that he doesn't want that paragraph, that provision, so-called section 103, in this bill. I am not going to argue as eloquently as KIT BOND, the Senator from Missouri, did with reference to why that provision should be in the bill. But I can say that a compelling majority of Senators agreed with him when we had a vote on it, and then agreed to vote on final passage which included that. 
   To make sure everybody understands a little bit about where we have been and where we are going, I will not talk much about this chart, except I will ask that we take a quick look at the orange part of this chart. You see how big that keeps growing while people worry about this bill, and legitimately so. Senator MCCAIN argues that perhaps there are some things in this bill that should not be in it. He may be right. 
   Let me tell my colleagues, when you have to put something together for a whole House and a whole Senate, sometimes you have to do some things that maybe one Senator wouldn't want done. 
   This orange shows what is happening to the American budget of late. This is the 2000 estimate, the orange part of the entitlements and interest we pay in our budget for the people. See how it continues to grow. The yellow is the Defense Department. If you will focus for a moment on this purple piece, that number, $319 billion out of a budget of $1.8 trillion, is the 11 appropriations bills that have not yet been passed. 
   May I point it out again. This is the entitlements plus the interest. This is defense, which has been passed. And 
   this, which you can see from this year to this year to this year, not very big changes compared to the other parts of the budget, this is what the 11 appropriations bills will amount to more or less, including this one. 
   It means that one-sixth of the Federal budget is at issue when we discuss the 11 appropriations bills that remain. Two of them were defense, and they belong in this portion of the budget. But if you look out, as we try to project 2005 and beyond, to see what keeps growing even though we are paying down the national debt, the entitlement programs keep growing. And the difference in this part, the purple part, is rather insignificant in terms of growth. 
   This bill is slightly over the President's budget in the nuclear deterrent, nuclear laboratory, nuclear weapons activities, and is slightly over the President on all of the water projects. I failed to mention the science projects that are in this bill, which are nondefense projects. They go on at all of the laboratories, and they are the cutting edge of real science across America--in this bill we are talking about. All of these, this and 11 others, belong in this small amount. Even for those who think it is growing too much, our projections beyond the year 2005 are that it still will be a very small portion of our Federal budget with a very large amount going to entitlements. 
   I wish I had one more I could predict, the surpluses along here, because I don't believe you need to worry about having adequate surpluses to take care of priorities in the future, to take care of Medicare, prescription drugs, and Medicare reform. Nor do I think there will be a shortage of money, some of which we should give back to the American people before we spend it. 
   My closing remarks have to do with what should we do with the great surplus the American people are giving us by way of taxes, which they have never paid so much of in the past. I look to the person who had most to do with our great thriving economy, Dr. Alan Greenspan. He mentions three things to us: First, you should put as much of it as you can on the national debt. The second thing is, you should give the people back some of it by way of taxes. That is the second best thing. He comments, ``If you are going to look at the big picture, the worst thing you can do with the surplus for the future of our children and grandchildren is to spend it on new programs.'' 
   So I suggest we all ought to be worried about the future. But today we ought to get an appropriation bill passed. I hope our people will understand that in spite of the plea from the minority leader that you vote against it because of the Missouri language, we can pass it today and see if in the next few days we can work something out with the President if he remains dedicated to vetoing this bill over the one issue of which the Senator from Montana spoke.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to commend a fellow New Mexican, Dr. Wendell Weart. He is a remarkable scientist, an international authority on radioactive waste management, and the Senior Fellow at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. After his distinguished career, he is retiring in October. His outstanding abilities have been crucial to the success of the world's first deep geologic repository for radioactive waste. It is highly appropriate that we recognize his contributions to that project and to the nation. 
   The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico began receiving defense-program radioactive wastes in 1999. The process that led to its opening was long and difficult, requiring the solution of innumerable technical and social problems. Although many people contributed to the solution of those problems, Dr. Weart's role was paramount throughout. 
   He led Sandia's technical support for the project from its beginnings in the early 1970s. In the early years his efforts were essential to the exploratory investigations and the final selection of the repository site. He then led the project through the conceptual design of the repository, through the formulation and implementation of the investigations that demonstrated the site's suitability, and through the arduous process of obtaining regulatory approvals. The rigorous scientific basis finally achieved for the repository was due in no small part to Dr. Weart's own scientific expertise and to his unmatched leadership. 
   At least as important as these highly technical contributions was Dr. Weart's ability to instill confidence among the scientific community and the public. His skill in explaining complex issues, his truthfulness in all controversies, and his tireless patience in dealing with questions and frustrations for more than twenty-five years--all were indispensable contributions to the project. Without the trust Dr. Weart engendered, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, though scientifically well grounded, might still have failed to obtain scientific, regulatory, and social approval. 
   The permanent disposal of radioactive wastes has proved intractable in many countries. Thanks largely to Wendell Weart, the United States now has an operating repository. Congress and the American taxpayers owe him our most sincere thanks and our best wishes.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate now turn to consideration of the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water Development Act. Earlier today, the House passed the conference report by a vote of 301 to 118, and I hope the Senate will also overwhelmingly support the conference report. I am very pleased that we are able to get this very important conference report to the floor, given the difficulties affecting more appropriations bills this time of year. Senator REID and I, along with Chairman STEVENS and Senator BYRD, have worked hard to prepare an outstanding bill that meets the needs of the country and addresses many of the Senators' top priorities. 
   The Senate and House full committee chairman were very supportive and have provided the additional resources at conference that were necessary to address many priority issues for Members. They have allowed the House to come up $630 million to the Senate number on the defense allocation $13.484 billion, and the Senate non-defense allocation has increased by $1.1 billion. 
   I would now like to highlight some of the great things we have been able to do in this bill. 
   The conference report provides $4.5 for Army Corps of Engineers water projects, an increase of $400 million over the Senate and $383 over the President's Request. 
   The increased resources have allowed us to get started on the very highest priority new starts in 2001--something we were not able to do under our original allocation. 
   The conference report provides $3.20 billion for DOE Science, an increase of $330 million over the Senate and $420 million over last year. We heard from many members over the last few months about providing more money for science and I am pleased we were able to heed their concerns and make significant investments in our future. 
   On the defense side, the conference report provides $5 billion for nuclear weapons activities, an increase of $150 million over Senate and $600 million over last year. 
   On clean-up, we have been able to continue to provide the environmental clean-up money that is so important to many of our members across the country. The conference report provides $6.1 billion, and increase of $390 million over last year. 
   We do have a few controversial provisions in this bill. The conference report  includes a provision that we have carried for several years that would prohibit the use of funds to revise the Missouri River Master Manual if such would result in increased springtime flood risk on the lower Missouri River. I know the administration has threatened a veto on this issue, and I take that seriously. But, we have been unable to forge an acceptable compromise and have insisted that the provision remain in the conference report just as it passed the Senate floor. Although there are other issues the administration has raised, we have made a good faith effort to address their concerns were possible. I believe we have a good bill that the President will sign.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator KENNEDY on the floor. I want to say to Senator KENNEDY and to Senator FRIST--who is not on the floor, but I have seen him personally--that I thank both of them for their marvelous efforts in having included in the health care bill, which was recently reported out, SAMSHA, and about five or six provisions contained in a Domenici-Kennedy bill regarding the needs of those in our country who have serious impairment from mental illness. 
   We did not expect to get those accomplished this year. We thank them for it. We know that we will have to work together in the future to get them funded. But when we present them to the appropriators, they will understand how important they are. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday for a bit and in the Energy Committee today for a bit about energy policy. I guess I believe so strongly about this issue that I want to speak again perhaps from a little different vantage point. 
   I would like to talk today about the ``invisible priority'' that has existed in the United States for practically the last 8 years. The ``invisible priority'' has been the supply of reliable affordable energy for the American people. 
   Let me say unequivocally that we have no energy policy because the Interior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Energy Department all have ideological priorities that leave the American consumer of energy out in the cold. 
   Making sure that Americans have a supply of reliable and affordable energy, and taking actions to move us in that direction, is the ``invisible priority.'' And that is giving the administration the benefit of the doubt. 
   ``Not my job'' is the response that the Interior Department of the United States gives to the energy crisis and to America's ever-growing dependence upon foreign oil and, yes, I might say ever-growing dependence upon natural gas. The other alternatives, such as coal, nuclear, or other--``not my job.'' 
   It is also the response that the Environmental Protection Agency gives when it takes actions, promulgates rules, and regulations. Their overall record suggests--let me repeat-- ``not my job,'' says the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   The Interior Department, making drilling for oil and natural gas as difficult as possible, says, ``Don't bother us.'' 
   ``It is not my job'', says the Department of Interior. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency's job is to get a good environmental policy based on sound science and be the enemy of an ideologically pure environmental policy at the expense of providing energy that we need. 
   My last observation: In summary, the ``Energy Department'' is an oxymoron. It is anti-nuclear but pro-windmills. I know many Americans ask: what is the Senator talking about? Nuclear power is 20 percent of America's electricity. At least it was about 6 months ago. We have an Energy Department for this great land with the greatest technology people, scientists and engineers, that is pro-windmills and anti-nuclear. 
   I will say, parenthetically, as the chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations, the last 3 years we put in a tiny bit of money for nuclear energy research and have signed it into law as part of the entire appropriation, and we do have a tiny piece of money to look into the future in terms of nuclear power. It is no longer nothing going on, but it is a little bit. 
   Boy, do we produce windmills in the United States. The Department of Energy likes renewables. All of us like them. The question is, How will they relieve the United States from the problem we have today? I guess even this administration and even the Vice President, who is running for President, says maybe we have a crisis. Of course we have a crisis. The Federal Government spent $102 million on solar energy, $33 million on wind, but only $36.5 million on nuclear research, which obviously is the cleanest of any approach to producing large quantities of electricity. 
   Sooner or later, even though we have been kept from doing this by a small vocal minority, even America will look back to its early days of scientific prowess in this area as we wonder how France is doing it with 87 percent of their energy produced by nuclear powerplants. 
   With all we hear about nuclear power from those opposed, who wouldn't concede that France exists with 87 percent or 85 percent of its energy coming from nuclear powerplants? They do, and their atmosphere is clean. Their ambient air is demonstrably the best of all developed countries because it produces no pollution. 
   We have an administration that, so long as we had cheap oil, said everything was OK, and we couldn't even seek a place to put the residue from our nuclear powerplants, the waste product. We couldn't even find a place to put it. We got vetoes and objections from the administration. Yet there are countries such as France, Japan, and others that have no difficulty with this problem; it is not a major problem to store spent fuel. 
   Let me move on to wind versus nuclear. Nuclear produced 200 times more electricity than wind and 2,000 times more than solar. As I indicated, solar research gets three times more funding than nuclear research and development. 
   The wind towers--we have seen them by the thousands in parts of California and other States, awfully strange looking things. They are not the old windmills that used to grace the western prairie. They have only two prongs. They look strange. 
   We are finding wind towers kill birds, based on current bird kill rates. Replacing the electric market with wind would kill 4.4 million birds. I am sure nobody expects either of 
   those to happen. However, more eagles were killed in California wind farms than were killed in the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
   The Energy Department calls wind a renewable energy policy, and the Sierra Club calls wind towers the Cuisinart of the air. 
   I will discuss the SPR selloff. For almost 8 years, energy has been the ``invisible priority'' for the U.S. Government led by Bill Clinton and the current Vice President. 
   Incidentally, the Vice President, who is running for President, had much to do with this ``invisible priority;'' he was the administration's gatekeeper on almost all matters that dealt with the Environmental Protection Agency and almost all matters that dealt with the Department of the Interior in terms of the production of energy on public land. 
   Let me talk about the SPR selloff for a minute. Treasury Secretary Summers warned President Clinton that the administration's proposal--now decision--to drive down energy prices by opening the energy reserve would be ``a major and substantial policy mistake.'' He wrote the President, and Chairman  Greenspan agreed, that using the SPR to manipulate prices, rather than adhering to its original purpose of responding to a supply disruption, is a dangerous precedent. Summers added that the move would expose us to valid charges of naivete, using a very blunt tool to address heating oil prices. 
   American refineries today have to make so many different kinds of fuel because of environmental protection rules that no one would believe they would be capable of doing. They were running at 95 percent of capacity last week. We have not built a new refinery in almost 20 years. 
   What has happened: America builds no energy, no refining capacity, because it is too tough environmentally to do that and live up to our rules and regulations. Yet you can build them in many other countries, and people are surviving and glad to have them--at least, new ones--because they are doing a great job for their economy and producing the various kinds of products that come from crude oil. Yet America, the biggest user in this area, has built none. 
   If we take the supply of SPR out of SPR, it will still need to be refined into heating oil. I have just indicated there is hardly any room because there is hardly any capacity. 
   The invisible policies wait ominously on the horizon, boding serious problems. We have found that natural gas produced in America, drilled for by Americans, offshore and onshore, is the fuel of choice. Now we are not even building any powerplants that use coal as the energy that drives them because it is too expensive, too environmentally rigorous, and nobody dares build them. They build them elsewhere in the world but not in America. 
   We use natural gas, the purest of all, and say fill your energy needs for electricity using natural gas. Guess what happened. The price has gone to $3.35 per cubic feet; 6 months ago it was $2.16. And the next price increase is when the consumers of America get the bills in October, November, and December for the natural gas that heats their house and runs their gas stove because we have chosen not to use any other source but natural gas to build our electric generating tower when hardly any other country in the world chooses that resource. They choose coal or some other product rather than this rarity of natural gas. 
   Now 50 percent of the homes in America are dependent upon natural gas. The companies that deliver it are already putting articles in the newspaper: Don't blame us; the price is going up. 
   Who do you blame? I think you blame an administration that had no energy policy and for whom energy was an ``invisible priority.'' It was an ``invisible priority'' because the solutions lay within EPA, the Interior Department, and an Energy Department that was paralyzed by an attitude of anti-production of real energy. That is the way they were left by Hazel O'Leary, the first Secretary of Energy under this President, and Mr. Pena; and Bill Richardson is left with that residue. 
   Fifty percent of homes are heated by natural gas. I predict the bills will be skyrocketing because we are using more and more of it because we have no energy policy, and American homeowners are the ones who will see that in their bills. When they start writing the checks with those increases, they are going to be mighty mad at someone. 
   Don't get fooled. The candidate on the Democratic side, if the election is not over by the time that happens, will blame those who produce natural gas for they are related to oil and gas production. Would you believe, as we stand here today, 18 percent of the electricity generated in America is produced by natural gas? Oh, what a predicament we have gotten ourselves into because we have an invisible energy policy ruled over by an Environmental Protection Agency that never asked a question about energy and an Interior Department that takes property and land of the United States out of production. 
   I want to tell you a couple of facts. As compared to 1983, 60 percent more Federal land is now off limits to drilling. On October 22, 1999, Vice President GORE, in Rye, NH, said:  
   I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling.  
   Then we have ANWR. It is off limits. 
   Offshore drilling is off limits. We could double our domestic oil supply if we opened offshore drilling. Yet we will have more and more transports hauling in refined and crude oil products, creating more and more risk for our ports where they are bringing it in. Yet we maintain we cannot do any more drilling because it is too dangerous. 
   The multiple-use concept in our public domain is, for all intents and purposes, practically dead. We have 15 sets of new EPA regulations. Not one new refinery has been built since 1976. Now we have soaring gasoline prices. I understand my time is up. 
   Would Senator KENNEDY mind if I take 1 more minute? I will wrap it up. 
   I will close with one more fact, and I will put the others in the RECORD. Californians usually spend about $7 billion a year in electricity. The price spikes were so dramatic that they spent $3.6 billion in 1 month, the month of July--half of what they annually spend was spent in 1 month. 
   Why? California is a big electricity importer. There is growing demand. Silicon Valley companies are big energy users. Demand is up 20 percent in the San Francisco area over last year but no new capacity has been built. 
   Environmental regulations make building a new plant nearly impossible in California. I predicted exorbitant home heating bills this coming winter even while we were experiencing the gasoline price spikes in the Midwest. 
   It used to be that one type of gasoline was suitable for the entire country. There are now at least 62 different products. One eastern pipeline handles 38 different grades of gasoline, 7 grades of kerosene, 16 grades of home heating oil and diesel. Four different gasoline mixtures are required between Chicago and St. Louis--a 300 mile distance. As a result of these Federal/local requirements, the industry has less flexibility to respond to local or regional shortages. 
   We have 15 sets of new environmental regulations: Tier II gasoline sulfur, California MTBE phaseout; blue ribbon panel recommendations; regional haze regs; on-road diesel; off road diesel; gasoline air toxics; refinery MACT II; section 126 petitions; gasoline air toxics; new source review enforcement initiative; climate change; urban air toxics; residual risk. 
   The MTBE groundwater contamination issue is going to make the gasoline supply issue even more complicated and reduce industry's flexibility to meet demand.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to talk about two things today. The first is energy policy--or America without an energy policy. 
   Let me say with as much certainty as I can muster that we have no energy policy because the Interior Department of the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States, and the Energy Department all have priorities, and they are ideological priorities that put the production of energy for the American people last. There is some other objective, motive, or goal that is superior to the production of oil and gas and the development of an energy policy that uses coal. 
   Do you think Americans know today that we have not built a coal-burning powerplant in America in 12 years? Do you think Americans know that the only thing we are doing to increase our electric capacity so they can have light, electricity, and everything else in their homes is to build a powerplant  with natural gas? We have built five--all with natural gas. And we sit back and wonder why natural gas has gone from $2 to $5.63 in 9 months. 
   Let me be the first to predict that the next crisis will be when natural gas goes even higher, because we have made it the only fuel we can use--under what? Under the policies of the Environmental Protection Agency, which has their own rules, their own regulations, and their own ideologies. I have not heard them say once we have adjusted an environmental concern because we are worried about America's energy policy. 
   I wonder if the occupant of the chair has ever heard the Environmental Protection Agency say we must be doing something wrong because there are no new refineries being built in America--none, zero, zip. The greatest nation on Earth has not built a new refinery to convert crude oil into the products of everyday use for years. We have, in fact, closed 38 refineries to environmental concerns--albeit they are small. 
   We own millions of acres of land. That is why I say the Interior Department is part of our energy policy. But they have different concerns. They never consult on energy issues. So what do they do? They lock up millions of acres of land that could produce oil or natural gas and say, We are not going to touch them. 
   Why don't you ask Americans? Why don't you ask Americans whether they want to be more beholden to the cartel or whether they would like to use a little bit of their property to go in and drill an oil well? Do it with whatever protection you want for the environment. 
   Let's have a serious debate about ANWR, an American piece of real estate that is beautiful and something we should protect. It has many millions and millions of barrels of American oil that could be produced by American companies for American use. And every time it is brought up on the floor of the Senate, the environmentalists in America consider that even to take a little, tiny piece of that huge refuge and go see how many millions of barrels of oil are there would be the biggest environmental disaster ever. 
   But who is worrying about Americans who want to use oil and have it refined so they can drive their automobiles? Who would like to use the coal we have in abundance and make sure we use it as cleanly as possible, and build powerplants so we don't run out of electricity and so we don't have brownouts in California?--Brownouts which some are predicting today because the policies that could have affected the production of electricity for California have not been judged on the basis of our energy needs, they have been based only upon environmental purity. 
   That is why the United States of America is the most difficult piece of geography occupied by humans in the world in terms of establishing in America a powerplant. It is the most difficult and 
   expensive place in the world to build a powerplant with the greatest engineers and scientists around. We can't build one because there is no agreement between the Environmental Protection Agency and the public holders of land to work together. The question is never asked: What would be good for American energy policy? 
   Let me move on. Let me make sure we understand. We don't have someone making energy policy, or setting the rules, or saying to the American private sector: Here are the rules; go work under them. We have none because Interior, EPA, and Energy all have priorities, and none of their priorities makes the production of oil and gas and the development of our coal high priorities. 
   The Interior Department is making the drilling for oil and natural gas as difficult as possible. EPA, rather than devising good environmental policy based on sound science, it has become the enemy. This is due to an ideological, pure environmental policy at the expense of providing energy we need. This is not understood by most Americans. Yet we have an Energy Department. Sometimes I feel sorry for the Secretary of Energy because there is no authority for them to do much about anything. But we do have a strange oxymoron. We have an Energy Department that is anti-nuclear power and pro-windmills to produce electricity and sources of electrical power for America. 
   I might repeat, we have an Energy Department that is pro-windmill and anti-nuclear. I give Secretary Richardson credit for moving slightly under the prodding of Congress to do a little bit of research in future years on the use of nuclear power, which may end up falling on America as being the only thing we can do in 15 or 20 years that is environmentally clean by the time we get around to explaining it as safer than most any other source of energy. Yet only recently do we have an energy policy that would consider anything that has to do with nuclear power now or for the future. 
   Treasury Secretary Summers warned the President that the administration's proposal--now a decision--to drive down energy prices by opening the Government's emergency oil reserves--and I quote--``would be a major and substantial policy mistake.'' Summers wrote the President--and Greenspan agreed--that using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ``manipulate prices rather than adhering to its original purpose of responding to a supply disruption is a dangerous precedent.'' 
   You see, fellow Senators, we have established a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the afterglow of some foreign country saying, ``We are cutting off your oil supply.'' And, even though it was a small amount, they said, We are cutting it off--and we were dependent on it. Lines were forming at our gasoline stations. Do you recall? In the State of New York, the lines were forming at 5:30 in the morning, to my recollection. People were so mad at each other that, if they thought somebody went ahead of them in line--in one case in eastern America, they even shot the person who went ahead of them in the line. 
   We said we ought to find a place to put crude oil so that if anybody stops the flow of crude oil to America, or engages in some kind of war, or mischief that denies us our energy, we will have a certain number of days of supply in the ground for use. 
   Mr. President, that is a lot different than an America which is now without any energy policy. 
   We say the prices have gone too high, even though everything I have said contributed to it: An Interior Department that won't let you produce oil, an Environmental Protection Agency that has no reason to consider whether their rules and regulations are so stringent, too stringent, beyond reasonable, whether in the area of refineries, in the area of building a powerplant, in the area of producing more energy through wells that we drill, their policies have nothing whatever to do with energy needs of our country. 
   With all that piled on America, we have an election coming up and the oil prices are a little too high. We would like to take a little bit of that oil out of the reserve and put it on the market and use it. Secretary Summers added that the move ``would expose us to valid charges of naivete, a very blunt tool to address heating oil prices.'' That is from the Secretary of the Treasury a couple of weeks ago. 
   Of course, over the weekend, a spokesman for this administration and for the Gore campaign got on the national networks and said: The Secretary is with us. Of course, he works for the President. 
   They all sat down and said: What is the worse thing that can happen to the Gore campaign? Clearly, they all said if these oil prices keep going up. It is not a question of, can we produce heating oil; our refineries are at the maximum production already. This release of additional barrels from the reserve can do nothing for that. It is just that the price is so high that a lot of poor people in northeastern America who still use heating oil, and those in the West are not aware how many, but there are millions; they are not going to be very happy. That is the issue. That is why the petroleum reserve is being used. 
   The truth is, in our country it behooves people like myself and many others to at least make sure the public understands why we are in the mess we are, who got us there, what was done to make it so that it wouldn't happen the way it has. All the answers come down to the fact that nobody was worried so long as the prices were cheap, so long as those OPEC countries were producing more than was needed in the world, keeping the prices down at $10 or $11 or $12 a barrel.  
   While we lived happily and merrily, month by month, with that situation, firing up our great economic recovery, at the same time we were destroying millions of little stripper wells that were producing three and four barrels per well. They closed down because the price was too cheap. Even today, we are producing less oil than we were 3 or 4 years ago because we destroyed oil production capacity when we let it go too low, while we were exhilarated with the fact that the cartel was cheating on itself and the price of oil was coming down. We didn't bother to find out how much that was affecting New Mexico in an adverse manner. When it went up in price, we went to them and said: Now it ought to come down; it is too high. I don't imagine for the first few months they greeted us with too much joy or willingness to help us after we sat by and watched it go so low without any concern for what happened to them. 
   Refineries were running at 95 percent last week. To take a supply out of SPR, it would still need to be refined into heating oil. Obviously, I have explained that isn't the issue. The issue will be the price. We don't have enough refining capacity to take the SPR and add to the supply of heating oil. 
   What else does this using the reserve as it was not intended by Congress do? It sends the wrong signal to the private industry in America. If I am in the business of storing heating oil, and the Federal Government starts stockpiling, I cut my reserve and I assume somebody will come in here asking us to prohibit them from cutting their own reserves. Clearly, they 
   cannot keep their storage to maximum capacity while the government is building its own capacity to compete--something we won't figure out until it is too late. Then somebody will say: Why did this happen? They should not have cut back on their reserves. 
   I indicated natural gas prices were going up, up, and away. This fantastic fuel is $5.35 per 1,000 cubic feet; 6 months ago it was $2.16. We are talking about oil and derivatives of oil because of the cartel. From $2.16 to $5.35 is not because of any cartel; it is because of the huge demand for natural gas. When the demand gets so big the production can't go up so fast, what happens? The price goes up. That is a big signal and a sign to us. 
   No one seems to be concerned in this administration that we haven't built a powerplant to generate electricity for the growing demand, such as in California. We haven't built a new powerplant of any significance because the only thing we can build it with is natural gas. We cannot build it with coal, even though they were being built around the world. America's environmental laws are out of tune with America's energy needs. They haven't been tuned to be concerned about America's energy future. It is just ideological--as pure as you can get it in terms of environmental cleanliness. That is it for America. 
   Inventories are 15 percent below last winter's level and 50 percent of America's homes are heated with natural gas. They are beginning to see it in their bills. Clearly, America has almost no competitor for that. We don't have an abundance of electricity to take its place. In fact, brownouts are expected in many parts of the country because we are underproducing what we need by way of electricity. 
   Natural gas fires 18 percent of the electric power. I am sure there are many sitting back saying: Isn't that neat? We haven't had to worry about nuclear. We don't have to clean up coal to the maximum and use some of it to produce electricity in America. We just build natural gas powerplants. We used to forbid it. I think the occupant of the Chair remembers that during the crisis we said don't use natural gas for powerplants. We took that out. 
   Here goes America. Next crisis, will there be enough natural gas or will the price be so high? It will not be just to those who are burning it for powerplants. It will be in 50 percent of the homes in America. They will start asking: Where is an energy policy with some balance between energy sources instead of moving all in one direction because all we were concerned about was the environment? 
   Compared to 1983, 60 percent more Federal land is now off limits to drilling. I spoke generally of that. Now I will be specific. As compared with 1983, there is 60 percent more Federal land that is off limits for drilling. On October 22, 1999, Vice President GORE said in Rye, NH: I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling. 
   I guess what we ought to be working on is when will we no longer need any crude oil, which is refined into gasoline and all those wonderful products? Because, if you brag to America that you will do everything in your power to make sure there is no new drilling, we have to ask the question: Where are we going to get the oil? 
   I will move to another item that I spoke of generally a while ago, a great American reserve of crude oil called ANWR, up in Alaska. I believe any neutral body of scientists--geologists, engineers--could go up there and take a look and report to the Congress and the people of this country that ANWR could produce oil for America without harming that great natural wilderness. I am absolutely convinced that is the case. Yet you cannot believe the furor that attends even a mild suggestion that we ought to do something such as that. Perhaps somebody will even quote what I just said, saying that I am for destroying the ANWR, that I am for destroying that wilderness area, that natural beauty. 
   No, I am not. I am for trying to put together a policy that increases our production of crude oil so we can at least send a signal to the world that we do not want to increase our dependence. We want to do something for ourselves, and wouldn't it be nice if there were a stable oil market so Americans could get involved in production here at home, hiring Americans? It would be owned by Americans if that happened in ANWR. What a stimulus for American growth in oil-patch-type activities. 
   OCS, offshore drilling--off limits. There is no question we could double our domestic supply if we could open up some of the offshore drilling areas. Clearly, the more we have to import crude oil, the more the environmental risk in getting it here in tankers where something could happen to them. The amount keeps going up. Yet right in various of our bays and ocean fronts, there is natural gas in abundance. And there exist wells where we have proved we know how to do it. But somebody says: Oh, my, no more of that. That's environmentally degrading. 
   What are we going to talk about when Americans say we cannot afford the natural gas because the only thing we are fueling powerplants with and using in America is natural gas? We have it out there in the oceans and in some bays--yet we would not dare touch it? There are 43 million acres of forest land that are off limits for roadbuilding, thereby making exploration and production impossible. 
   The Kyoto agreement would envision doubling the use of natural gas, thus doubling electricity costs. No policies address either consequence. Multiple use, which we used to think was a great thing for our public lands, is only words today. Multiple use means if there are natural resources that can help Americans and can help prosperity and help us grow, that ought to be used along with recreation and other things. That has almost left the vocabularies of those in high places who manage our public lands. There are 15 sets of new EPA regulations that affect the areas we are talking about. Not one new refinery has been built since 1976. This administration's energy policy has, in my opinion, been in deliberate disregard of the consequences on the consumers' checkbook and their standard of living and the way people will be living in the United States. 
   This summer we had soaring gasoline prices and that left motorists in America--as prices soared they got more and more sore, but they didn't know who to get sore at. The prices are still pretty high. 
   Other consequences that have been deliberately disregarded are the electricity price spikes California experienced this summer. Californians usually spend about $7 billion a year in electricity. This spike was so dramatic they spent $3.6 billion in the month of July, only half of what they spent annually before that. That is a great question to be asked--why? California is a big 
   electricity importer. They have ever-growing demands because of Silicon Valley. These companies use a lot of electricity and a lot of energy. Demand was up 20 percent in the San  Francisco area last year, but there is no new capacity. Environmental regulations make building a new powerplant in California impossible. That may be what they want. But I wonder where they are going to get the energy? Where are they going to get the electricity when nobody else has any to spare? 
   I predict in a very precise way that home heating bills this coming winter will be exorbitant, even while we are experiencing the gasoline spikes in the Midwest. It used to be one type of gasoline was suitable for the entire country. You remember those days. There are now 62 different products--one eastern pipeline handles 38 different grades of gasoline, 7 grades of kerosene, 16 grades of home heating oil and diesel, 4 different gasoline mixtures are required between Chicago and St. Louis, just a 300-mile distance. 
   As a result of these Federal and local requirements, industry has less flexibility to respond to local and regional shortages. There are 15 sets of environmental regulations--tier II gasoline sulfur, California MTBE phaseout, blue-ribbon panel regulations, and regional haze regulations--on-road diesel, off-road diesel, gasoline air toxics, refinery MACK II, section 126 petitions, and there are 6 more.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to make these remarks while the occupant of the chair is the distinguished junior Senator from Arizona because these remarks have to do with the Baker-Hamilton report. The Secretary of Energy asked these two men--one an ex-Senator, one an ex-House Member--to compile a report with reference to the national weapons laboratories and the missing hard drive incident. These hard drives were apparently taken out, put back, and found behind a copy machine, and everybody is wondering what happened. I will talk about this report. 
   I urge--and I do not think I have to--the occupant of the chair to read it soon. It is short and to the point. 
   The findings of this Baker-Hamilton report confirm what some of us suspected and have said in one way or another many times about the science and security at our National Laboratories. 
   The report concludes that the vast majority of employees of our National Laboratories are ``dedicated, patriotic, conscientious contributors to our national security and protectors of our national secrets.'' 
   The report states, however, that these individuals, the ones who are responsible for the viability of America's nuclear deterrent, have been hounded by ongoing investigations and security procedures that render them incapable of achieving their mission. 
   That is a very powerful statement. This commission is very worried about how the morale of the scientists at our National Laboratories, in particular Los Alamos, is affecting their ability to do their momentous work. 
   They go on to say that while new security measures and processes continue to be imposed, the authors found that X Division--the one that was involved in the last episode--is: ambiguously lodged in a confused hierarchy, subject to unclear and diffuse authority, undisciplined by a clear understanding of accountability for security matters, frightened or intimidated by the heightened sense of personal vulnerability resulting from the efforts to address recent security lapses. 
   These are hard-hitting, accurate findings. 
   The scientists at our laboratories need clear lines of authority and accountability. The Department of Energy needs to simplify the lines of command and communication. 
   The report overwhelmingly endorses the creation of the National Nuclear Security Agency--which we are beginning to understand exists, and we are going to begin to understand what it means when we say the NNSA--and the need to reinforce ``the authority of the NNSA Administrator.'' 
   The NNSA Administrator must have more authority, not less. General John Gordon, the general who is in charge, is in fact the head man and is an excellent person to lead this agency and implement the organizational structure needed for the job. 
   They reached some other very important conclusions on the current environment at our national laboratories: Demoralization at Los Alamos is dangerous; that poor morale breeds poor security. 
   There is a severe morale problem at the labs, and they cite four or five general conclusions: 
   ``Among the known consequences of the hard-drive incident, the most worrisome is the devastating effect on the morale and productivity at the laboratory.......'' 
   They also say that ``..... (the) current negative climate is incompatible with the performance of good science.'' 
   The report states, ``It is critical to reverse the demoralization at LANL before it further undermines the ability of that institution both to continue to make its vital contributions to our national security and to protect the sensitive national security information.'' 
   They recommend ``urgent action (is required) ..... to ensure that LANL gets back to work in a reformed security structure .....'' 
   Incidentally, they conclude that while they laud the Secretary of Energy for trying to create more security with the appointment of a security czar and the like, as some of us said when it was created, it fails to do a job; and remember the Senator from New Mexico saying we are creating another box but it is not going to have clear lines of authority, it is not going to have accountability, people are still not going to be in a streamlined process of accountability. I said it my way, they said it another way, but we concluded the same thing. 
   There are many other conclusions in this brief report. I urge all of my colleagues to read this report and reflect on their conclusions. 
   They call for a review of security classifications and procedures, security upgrades at LANL, need to deal with cyber security threats, and adopt or adapt ``best practices'' for the national labs. 
   Then, under ``Resources'' they underscore:  
   Provide adequate resources to support the mission of the national laboratories to preserve our nuclear deterrent, including the information security component of that mission.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly speak about the passage of the children's health bill and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reauthorization bill. 
   I would like to begin by congratulating Senators FRIST and KENNEDY for their work on this important piece of legislation and to tell them how pleased I am the package contains a number of provisions from the Mental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000, S. 2639. 
   Today we do not even question whether mental illness is treatable. But, today we recoil in shock and disbelief at the consequences of individuals not being diagnosed or following their treatment plans. The results are tragedies we would have prevented. 
   Just look at the tragic incidents at the Baptist Church in Dallas/Fort Worth, the Jewish Day Care Center in Los Angeles, and the United States Capitol to see the common link: a severe mental illness. Or the fact that there are 30,000 suicides every year, including 2,000 children and adolescents. 
   It was not too long ago that our Nation decided we did not want to keep people with a mental illness institutionalized. Simply put, it was inhumane to simply lock these individuals up without even using science to consider other alternatives. 
   Make no mistake, our Nation still has these same individuals with mental illness, we just do not have a very good way to deal with these individuals. Many of these individuals formerly locked up are now our neighbors taking the proper medication to manage their illness. 
   However, our Nation simply does not have an understanding of what happens when individuals stop taking their medications because sadly many of these highly publicized incidents of mass violence all too often involve an individual with a mental illness. 
   When these incidents occur, my wife and I watch with horror on television and we often turn to each other and say that person was a schizophrenic or that individual was a manic depressive. 
   Some of you may have seen the recent 4 part series of articles in the New York Times reviewing the cases of 100 rampage killers. Most notably the review found that 48 killers had some kind of formal diagnosis for a mental illness, often schizophrenia. 
   Twenty-five of the killers had received a diagnosis of mental illness before committing their crimes. Fourteen of 24 individuals prescribed psychiatric drugs had stopped taking their medication prior to committing their crimes. 
   With this in mind I am especially pleased that with the passage of this package we are taking a very positive step forward to address the problem I have mentioned. The provisions adopted from the Mental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000 will serve to give more people the ability to identify when someone might be suffering from mental illness and pose a threat to themselves or others. 
   I think it's important that we begin to find ways to get these people help before we find them involved in a violent tragedy and I would like to briefly touch upon several of those provisions I believe will take us a long way towards that goal: 
   A grant program will provide training to teachers and emergency services personnel to identify and respond to individuals with mental illness, and to raise awareness about available mental health resources. Another grant program creates Emergency Mental Health Centers that will serve as a specific site in communities for individuals in need of emergency mental health services, and will also provide mobile crisis intervention teams. 
   The Jail Diversion Demonstration will create 125 programs to divert individuals with mental illness from the criminal justice system to community-based services. And finally, the Mental Illness Treatment Grant will provide integrated treatment for individuals with a serious mental illness and a co-  occurring substance abuse disorder with an emphasis placed on individuals with a history of involvement with law enforcement or a history of unsuccessful treatment. 
   In closing, I really believe we have a historic opportunity to become preventers of serious, serious acts of violence before they happen and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to continue addressing this important issue.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of the conference report accompanying H.R. 4516, the Legislative Branch and Treasury-general government appropriations bill for FY 2001. 
   The pending conference agreement combines two of the 13 annual appropriations bills into one bill, which provides $34.9 billion in new budget authority and $30.9 billion in new outlays to fund the operations of the Legislative Branch, and the Executive Office of the President, and the agencies of the Department of the Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Customs Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the General Services Administration, and related agencies. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account the conference agreement totals $33.0 billion in BA and $32.5 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2001. 
   The final bill is $145 million in BA and $145 million in outlays below the most recent section 302(b) allocation for these two subcommittees filed on September 20th. 
   The final bill also has a revenue effect for two provisions--repeal of a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that temporarily increases federal employee retirement contributions by 0.5 percent; and repeal of the telephone tax enacted in the late 1800's to help finance the Spanish-American War. A loss of revenue totaling approximately  $4.8 billion is estimated for fiscal year 2001, and additional amounts in the outyears.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing a bill authorizing the next logical step in the City of Santa Fe's Regional Water Management and River Restoration Strategy. This bill allows the Secretary of Interior to participate in the design, planning and construction of the Santa Fe, New Mexico, regional water management and river restoration project, consisting of the diversion and reuse of water, the conversion of irrigation uses from potable water to reclaimed water, and the use of reclaimed water to restore Santa Fe River flows. 
   Limited water resources in the Santa Fe region and increased demands threaten the sustainability of surface and groundwater supplies. The Regional Water Management and River Restoration Strategy is a comprehensive, collaborative plan to responsibly and sustainability address the region's water supply needs. The full program goals are to return flow to the river, protect riparian habitat and the traditional, cultural and religious uses of the water. 
   The Santa Fe area has been working overtime to determine how best to improve its water supply. I have been proud to help fund its efforts. The FY99 Energy and Water Appropriations Act provided $450,000 and the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations Act included $750,000 to support the Santa Fe Regional Water Management and River Restoration initiative to address long-term water supplies in the greater Santa Fe area. That funding allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue and complete environmental studies required under the National Environmental Policy Act for the comprehensive plan to improve Santa Fe's regional water supplies through a reuse program and restoration of the Santa Fe River watershed. 
   I was also pleased to gain approval for $750,000 to support the project in the Senate FY01 VA/HUD bill to assist in the planning, coordination and development of restoration projects for the Santa Fe River under a comprehensive, watershed-based implementation  program. The funding, provided through EPA's Environmental Programs and Management program, would help the WMRRS reuse treated effluent to augment streamflow, recharge the regional aquifer, and enhance the riparian habitat and recreational uses within the Santa Fe River corridor. 
   The Santa Fe Water Management and River Restoration Strategy is a cooperative partnership among Santa Fe County, the city of Santa Fe, and the San Ildefonso Pueblo. The city of Espan 6ola, the Eldorado Water and Sanitation District, and the Northern Pueblos Tributary Water Rights Association (representing San Ildefonso, Namb&#233;, Pojoaque and Tesuque pueblos) are also involved. 
   In June of this year, a $601,000 grant was awarded to the project following my request in the FY 2000 Veterans' Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies (VA-HUD) Appropriations Bill. The funding was awarded through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Economic Development Initiative (EDI) program. 
   This funding represents federal support for the effort to rehabilitate the Santa Fe River, a project that is one aspect of an overall initiative to address the future of water in the Santa Fe area. Those funds will be used for urban river restoration planning, source water protection planning, and development of a comprehensive trails and open space plan. 
   This authorizing legislation takes the water management strategy to the next phase. The plan has already been backed by a local and regional commitment of at least $2.7 million for the multi-year program. The sponsors of the program have requested this authorization to provide additional financial support for this project. This legislative authority will make the project eligible for future funding as the project is developed, as well as federal cooperation with the surrounding pueblos. I hope that this body can take swift action on the worthy legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in order to complete our legislative agenda in the 106th Congress, our leadership has put forth a very simple concept. 
   For the upcoming new fiscal year that begins in about 12 days, lets devote 90 percent of the surplus to debt reduction. And the remaining 10 percent can be used for tax cuts and final spending bills. 
   This is a very reasonable and straightforward proposal, and I compliment our leadership both in the House and the Senate for making the proposal to the President last week. 
   I don't quite understand why the White House and some Democrats are so negatively excited about this proposal. For some reason, the White House and congressional leaders are having a great deal of difficulty understanding a very simple proposal. 
   Indeed, our distinguished minority leader, even said he ``smelled a rat'' in this proposal. Why is it so difficult for the White House and congressional Democrats to understand this simple proposal. 
   Maybe it is because they are really not serious about their own rhetoric about debt reduction. Maybe this is consistent with their blocking not once, but six times our efforts to pass the Social Security lock box legislation now on the calendar. 
   I am hopeful we will do that, with their help perhaps, in a way we can all agree upon. But we will do it, and we will do it under this 90-10 formula. 
   For my friends at the White House and across the aisle let me take just a minute to explain this proposal. 
   We first start with the current CBO estimate of the budget surplus for next year--that number today is $268 billion. We are even using the Democrats favorite definition of the surplus, a definition that assumes that appropriate accounts grow by inflation between 2000 and 2001--the so-called ``inflated baseline.'' This is not my preferred definition, but it is the most liberal one available from the Congressional Budget Office. 
   To this $268 billion estimate, we adjust for the net effect of the supplemental that became law after CBO made its summer update. Because the supplemental shifted some spending around, the surplus next year increases slightly to $273 billion. 
   Now, we set aside the Social Security and Medicare HI trust fund balances--we fully protect Social Security and Medicare as we promised--those two accounts make up about $197 billion of our debt reduction next year. 
   We also set aside $48 billion of the non-Social Security surplus for debt reduction. 
   So we set the Social Security and the Medicare surplus aside, and then we set aside $48 billion more--a rather historic event because that is out of the non-Social Security surplus. Forty-eight billion dollars of that will go to debt reduction. 
   In total, $245 billion of next year's surplus is set aside for debt reduction. This represents 90 percent of the total surplus next year--just do the arithmetic--leaving $28 billion in outlays for the end of the session spending and tax legislation. This $28 billion should allow us to finish our work expeditiously. It would allow us to finish the appropriated bills that are still pending, fund needed priorities for hospital and health providers, for health research, aid to States and localities that have suffered this summer's fires and droughts, and other important and basic needs. 
   The $28 billion should also allow us to provide minimal tax relief to American small business and families. This will be a smaller package than we have done before. We will ask the President of the United States whether there is any tax bill that we can send him that he will sign. We believe this is a winner, one attached essentially to the amendment that cleared the floor when we did our minimum wage bill. It was  my amendment. I offered it along with DON NICKLES and others to spread the minimum wage increase over 3 years and to provide small business and individuals with the kind of tax relief almost everyone agreed we should do. 
   This is the least we can do for the taxpayers, as I see it, following both a vote of the marriage tax penalty and the death. This will not, as assumed by the administration, cause irreparable damage to the economy. The Secretary of the Treasury came all the way over here to have a press conference because they were terribly concerned about this 90 percent to debt service and 10 percent to finish our work idea--the 90-10 button that is being worn around here. I don't understand how it will cause any kind of damage. 
   How quickly we forget the words of the Federal Reserve Chairman, who said the first thing we should do with a budget surplus is retire the debt. I can only conclude that the democratic roadblock to this very simple proposition must be, first, they do not want to provide tax cuts when taxes are at the highest level percentage of the American economy since the Second World War; second, they do not want to apply the surplus to debt reduction. 
   They must have a very large bushel of expenditures they want to make at the end of the year that exceed the $28 billion, which is the residue of the 90-10 that will be around for tax cuts, for add-ons to appropriations, and for those extreme needs we have in the Medicare area with reference to nursing homes, HMO plus, and the like. Those will fit within the $28 billion because we are speaking of outlays--I hope everybody understands that--in the year 2001. 
   Maybe this should not come as a surprise to anyone. The President of the United States has put forward an expansive and expensive set of budget proposals, a budget plan that even the Washington Post called a ``lopsided budget.'' The Financial Times article called it ``a masterpiece of central government planning.'' 
   Maybe these are the real reasons why my friends across the aisle cannot grasp the simple consent: 90 percent of the total surplus going to retiring the debt, and 10 percent being available to finish our work on appropriations, on the other expenditures, and some tax proposals that should clear. 
   I am prepared to talk to this issue with anyone, anywhere, and to produce the numbers. This is very close to what will happen if we take it right, watch our step, do what is needed, but not extravagantly spend money. If we try some very simple but needed tax cuts, which should challenge even this President in terms of his veto pen--and obviously we are all aware of fixing some Medicare needs, whether they are nursing homes that need some additional response from the Federal Government, whether it be the HMO plus, whether it be the home care, whether it be rural hospitals. Essentially, in the first year they do not cost that much money. They do a considerable amount over 5, but actually we believe they will fit within this $28 billion. That is the 10 percent of the 90-10 formula. 
   I hope everybody will take a look at it. I think it is a good way to go. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator HATCH in introducing the ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act of 2000.'' 
   We can all take a certain amount of pride in the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997. However, it should come as no surprise that legislation as complex as the Balanced Budget Act (BBA), as well as its implementation by the Health Care Financing Administration, has produced some unintended consequences that must be corrected. 
   Heeding this advice, Congress made a down payment last year on the continued health of the skilled nursing facility benefit by passing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. While I believe this was a very good first step, I am convinced the bill we are introducing today is urgently needed to assure our senior citizens continue to have access to quality nursing home care through the Medicare program. 
   The transition to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) contained in the BBA is seriously threatening access to needed care for seniors all across the country. For instance, almost 11 percent of nursing facilities in the United States are in bankruptcy. In my home State of New Mexico the number is nothing short of alarming, nearly 50 percent of the nursing facilities are in bankruptcy. 
   I simply do not know how we can stand by in the face of this crisis and watch our seniors continue to lose access to nursing home care. My belief is only buttressed in light of the fact that as the baby boomers grow older we will be needing more nursing homes, not less. 
   We must have a strong system of nursing home care not only now but, in the future. With time having already run out on many nursing home operators and quickly running out on others, I believe Congress must act immediately. 
   In New Mexico, there are currently 81 nursing homes serving almost 7,000 patients, and as the bankruptcies have proven, the current Medicare payment system, as implemented by HCFA, simply does not provide enough funds to cover the costs being incurred by these facilities to care for our senior citizens. 
   For rural States like New Mexico, corrective action is critically important. Many communities in my State are served by a single facility that is the only provider for many miles. If such a facility were to close, patients in that home would be forced to move to facilities much farther away from their families. Moreover, nursing homes in smaller, rural communities often operate on a razor thin bottom line and for them, the reductions in Medicare reimbursements have been especially devastating. 
   The legislation we are introducing today would go a long way to build upon the steps we took last year with the Balanced Budget Refinement Act in restoring stability in the nursing home industry. The Hatch-Domenici Care Act of 2000 would increase reimbursement rates through two provisions. 
   First, for a 2-year period, the bill eliminates the one percentage point reduction in the annual inflation update for all skilled nursing facility reimbursement rates and raises that same update by four percent. I believe this provision is a matter of simple fairness because we are merely attempting to accurately keep reimbursements in line with the actual cost of providing care. 
   Second, the bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reexamine the annual inflation update, the so-called market basket index, using actual data to determine the necessary level of update. As a result of the reexamination, the Secretary may adjust the inflation update accordingly. 
   I look forward to again working with Senator HATCH to pass this critical legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this bill before us is a decisive step toward normalizing trade relations with China. Chairman ROTH has characterized this vote, the one we will make on this bill, as the most significant vote we will take this Congress. I agree. 
   While we will be concerned with many more issues that seem more important to individual Senators, and certainly we will be looking after our parochial interests in our sovereign States as we work as Senators--and that is all very important--but when we look at America and what she stands for in the world as it is evolving and developing, the final vote on this measure is probably the most significant vote we will take this year and maybe in many years. 
   Senator ROTH, I repeat, said that. I agree wholeheartedly. I am quite sure the tenor of Senator MOYNIHAN's suggestions--I have not been privileged to hear them here with the Senate--would agree with that. This is a very important issue. 
   This is the one vote that will be heard around the world. This is the one vote which recognizes that countries must play by the same rules in a globalized market if the market is to be efficient and function properly. 
   We hear so much talk about what is happening to the world--globalization. International trade, as part of globalization, must be efficient and effective. 
   This is the one vote that will do a great deal to encourage democracy for one in five people living on this Earth. I say encourage democracy because I truly believe this is the one vote that invites China to be our trading partner and, at the same time, determines whether American manufacturers, farmers, and service industries will get the benefit of trade and of an agreement pursued and negotiated by three different American Presidents. 
   They cannot all be wrong. As a matter of fact, they were all right. China is joining the WTO and have implemented a lot of reforms in order to be eligible. Furthermore, it has made promises to do certain other things. So that the U.S. can benefit from this new WTO members' market, Congress needs to grant permanent normal trade relations to China. It just took us a long time to understand and to work our way to this day when granting China permanent trade relations is finally before us. 
   On the subject of PNTR for China, Chairman Greenspan said:  
   History has demonstrated that implicit in any removal of power from central planners and broadening of market mechanisms ..... is a more general spread of rights to individuals. Such a development will be a far stronger vehicle to foster other individual rights than any other alternative of which I am aware.  
   That is precisely what globalization and international trading--China trading with America--have a chance to do. 
   Exposure to democracy and capitalism, information, and telecommunications and communication technology will increasingly influence the course of global affairs, without any question. 
   Imagine what Internet success means to a one-party, authoritarian state such as China. Even if China's economic growth and military modernization appear to be threatening, our relationship with China will evolve within the context of a very different world, a world increasingly reliant on information to achieve economic growth, prosperity, and jobs. 
   Anyone who has gone to China recently or, for that matter, watched recent television programming regarding what is going on with the labor force in China will know that Chinese men and Chinese women will move to get good jobs. They are already moving from the countryside to the cities without any retribution. They are smiling. They are taking risks because they see the opportunity to get a good paycheck. Make no bones about it, they want jobs that pay them money so they can move up their standard of living in this world. 
   That force, if turned loose in China, will change China forever. In particular, since China does not have the kind of central government the Soviet Union had, although we have from time to time called them both Communist countries, they are certainly very different in terms of the ability to control people and whether or not the central government really has as much control or is as despotic as the government that was managed by a small oligarchy in the Soviet Union. 
   I am not suggesting the trade, the Internet and computers will topple authoritarian structures in China overnight, but I do believe that for many years information control was equivalent to people control, but information control is quickly becoming more and more impossible. 
   Exposure to our economic system through trade, telecommunications, and the Internet will encourage strides toward freedom, in my humble opinion. For every argument that China is a risk to America's future, I argue that China trading with America 
   is a move in a direction of freedom that takes away from the risk of the future, takes away from the risk of a centralized powerful Chinese Government being dangerous to the world. Not that they are not, not that they could not be, but I submit it will be more and more difficult for that to occur as free trade permeates the cities and suburbs of China and the people who live there and the businessmen who will prosper by it. 
   I offer that while it is not at issue, education is another catalyst for economic freedom and democracy. Chinese students attending American universities is an important part of any effective economic trade and foreign policy for the United States. I know there are a lot of young Chinese coming to American universities to be students here, and living our way of life while they get educated. I asked my staff to find out just how many. Fifty thousand Chinese students from China now, not Taiwan--attended American universities last year. The number grows by the thousands every year.  
   The important thing is that these students are not studying math and science and culture by remote control. They are doing this by being physically present in American cities across this land. I submit, the more the young people of China experience America and are exposed to American freedom and watch capitalism work in America, the more likely it becomes that the future of China will be subtly but unalterably influenced in a positive direction. 
   Whether these Western-educated, young Chinese people are involved in politics or business--I would add in science or math or physics--their views about democracy and the free market economics will not be controlled or dominated by the so-called party. 
   Over the long run, experience and exposure will have a direct and significant impact on mainland China. 
   And the leaders know what is happening. 
   The Chinese leaders do not attempt to stop their students from coming to the greatest universities in the world and get educated in the best way in the world. In fact, sometimes I think they must be aware that there is a better way than what they have in their country, and to some extent they may think a better way is substantially the free way, the American way. 
   China is a big, big market. It has been estimated that the PNTR would increase U.S. exports to China by about $13 billion annually and will grow every sector of this economy. China is densely populated. It is a country in which one in five people alive today live. Think of that. This is largely an open, untapped market, both for the mind and for substances of trade. 
   I will comment on my State, which is not looked at as an exporting State, but direct exports from New Mexico to China totalled $235 million in 1999; and adding indirect exports through Hong Kong, brings our total to about $320 to $350 million. 
   We often hear the expression ``everything from soup to nuts'' to describe something very comprehensive, something widespread. An apropos variation of this colloquialism is ``China-New Mexico trade covers everything from chips to cheese.'' 
   Agricultural tariffs will be cut by more than half. New Mexico has, believe it or not--and this is not because PETE DOMENICI is of Italian extraction, whose mother and father came to New Mexico as immigrants--the largest mozzarella cheese plant in all the world. The mozzarella cheese for all of those delis they have in New York, where does it come from? New Mexico. And so is the case for China; it comes from New Mexico. They are one of our large importers of that cheese, and many other cheese products made in our State. 
   Incidentally, I say to Senator MOYNIHAN, while time has been passing, New Mexico has been growing in terms of dairy cows and as part of American milk production. Everybody thinks dairy product production is a Wisconsin issue, but New Mexico is now ninth among all of the sovereign States in terms of the production of dairy products. That is why it turns out we are working with China. 
   PNTR and China joining the WTO will be a big help for the New Mexico producers of milk products, as the Chinese people get the opportunity to compare the comparative culinary merits of Domino's, Pizza Hut, and even Papa Johns. I know my friend from New York is not here working on this agreement because he wants to see more Pizza Huts in China, but I think he would not disagree that the United States has an array of export opportunities from State to State. When you add all those up, they do go as far as the ingredients that go into a pizza, all the way to the ingredients and intellectual knowledge that goes into making fancy computer chips or to make anything that China makes and sells to the world. 
   The tariff on agricultural products will drop. It will drop from 50 percent to 10 percent on cheese products; from 35 percent to 10 percent for lactose and whey, both of which are produced in large quantities in the States of the United States that have many dairy cows and much milk production. 
   It is not well known that Intel Corporation manufactures flash memory microchips in its Rio Rancho plant in New Mexico, right next to Albuquerque. Flash memory chips are used in cellular phones, digital cameras, personal computers. 
   The flash memory chips are sent to Shanghai for assembly and testing before they are shipped to customers worldwide. In 2000, Intel earned over $500 million in revenue from the flash memory chips manufactured in New Mexico and tested in China. Both China and New Mexico added profit to the product as it moved its way to market. 
   If we do not grant PNTR status to China, it is quite obvious that somebody else will take our place in each of these markets that I have described for my State in terms of being a manufacturer 
   of products. Obviously, someplace else in the world can decide, if we are going to leave that trade barrier up, instead of reducing it 50 percent and 30 percent, as I have described, to get the business and the profit margin, where a foreign business could have the tariff rate that is not being adjusted. 
   China is discovering the necessity for cellular phones. I am talking about a product with which we are all becoming very familiar. There were 40 million cellular phones in China last year. This year, the estimate is 70 million. By 2003, China has projected to have more cell phones in use than any other country on the globe. 
   You can understand that because, you see, to some extent cellular phone use in America was inhibited by poles, with telephone lines, and telephones that are attached to them. We had that before cellular phones were invented. While we think that is great, it is a burden to the growth of cellular phones. Maybe the word ``burden'' is wrong, but at least cellular will not grow as fast. 
   Now enter into a Chinese city where they do not have any telephone poles, and all of a sudden they have cellular phones. They will never build telephone lines. That is why you can say they will go from 40 million to 70 million in 1 year. And who knows thereafter? 
   I guess we could then ask, how many telephone poles could they put in the ground? And how many telephone lines could they put up? While this was not part of my prepared text, I would speculate that they are not doing hundreds of thousands of miles of telephone lines. Why would they? They would just leapfrog to the newest technology. And that is what they began to use. That is what they will use for a long time hereafter. 
   Some have argued that PNTR is an attempt to move manufacturing jobs overseas. That is an argument we have to confront every time we talk about lowering trade barriers with some country in the world. It was the same argument when created the North American Free Trade zone with Mexico, I say to my good friend from New York. 
   Let me illustrate that this is not the case with reference to that contention. Last week, Intel broke ground on a new fabrication plant in Rio Rancho, NM. This expansion had a total cost of $2 billion.

   Mr. DOMENICI. It will provide 500 to 1,000 more jobs for New Mexico, highly paid, skilled jobs. 
   Obviously, local businesses will also profit from this expansion. That is what expanded trade with China means to Americans and to New Mexicans. 
   I gave you the example of the $2 billion investment because that investment is made to make one phase of the computer chip that I just described. The other phase will be done in China. Both countries will gain employment and will gain in terms of the production of items that add to our respective gross national products. I do not know which will have more. I would assume they would have a few more workers doing theirs, but we will have the master plant with the most modern technology. 
   The challenge to America in an international global market is the risk that we are taking, and it is singular. It is one. It is that we will not be able to produce the high-tech, high-paying jobs ahead of the rest of world and keep them here. That is really the only challenge. If we can do that, and train our people sufficiently to do that, we will win all the time because we will keep the high-paid, highly skilled jobs here, as we are currently doing vis-a-vis a country such as China or other countries in the world. 
   So granting PNTR to China makes practical economic policy, and it  makes good foreign policy. I think they are tied together in this case. 
   I have had an opportunity to talk to Henry Kissinger, who I happen to know quite well from a long, long time ago, when he came to my State with his young son who is now grown up and is involved in the movie production business. 
   He was 13 when he joined his father in my city doing an event for me when I was a young Senator. He talked about the global policy significance, not just its economic significance. I agree. I agree that there is no doubt that this is good trade policy and good foreign policy. 
   Grant PNTR is practical economic policy, but it is also inescapable economic policy because it is impossible, in this era of globalization, for the United States to fence off 20 percent of the world's population and refuse to trade with them on the same trade terms we trade with others. Trade relations with China are not the same as they were in 1979 when China and the United States first resumed diplomatic relations. At that time, all trade flowed through the Chinese Government in the form of state-owned enterprises. Today the private sector accounts for nearly 70 percent of China's output. Maybe I would put it differently because some of these centers of trade, we don't know whether they are private sector, as we understand them, but the nongovernment sector, nonowned by the Government, is nearly 70 percent of the Chinese output compared with 30 percent Government-owned. 
   We understand the Government is not too happy with owning even the 30 percent because they really don't know how to run it. They are seeing what is happening in the competitive world, and big policy discussions are occurring there as to what do they do about that situation. They have observed and have learned what happened to state-owned businesses in the former Soviet states, and they went from total ownership to nobody wanting ownership. There was nothing in between. We have the former Soviet Union, at least Russia, with an economic production machine that has been reduced to almost nothing. We will soon be comparing the total gross domestic product of Russia with one of the smaller countries in Europe. Imagine that.

   Mr. DOMENICI. That is absolutely correct. I might add that what is happening in Russia, the Chinese have seen very clearly. They are never going to let that happen. We went from Government ownership to no ownership to oligarchs who substituted here in the middle who became powerful, rich people who put these businesses together; bought them from the Government. Now a few groups own more businesses than anybody expected in Russia and do not run it in any way consistent with Russia's future. It is just their own. Whether they pay taxes or not is their business. That is the way things go. It is not so good. 
   Let me talk about this trend that is occurring in China. I think it is excellent. It is a great sign because a growing market-based economy is the most effective path to democracy for China and should be encouraged as part of the American policy with other free nations in the world. 
   There have been a lot of amendments offered to this bill. I owe the Senators who offered them, individually or for themselves and others, an explanation of why I voted against each and every one. Some of them are very good. Some of them, if freestanding and not burdening a measure of this magnitude, I probably would have come down and even debated. I did not. I did not come and talk on any of them because I was not going to vote for any. It appeared to me that my responsibility as a Senator was to see that this legislation got through here, at least as much as I could. That meant don't add amendments to it that are apt to make it 
   impossible for this legislation to get passed and sent to the President for signature. 
   I consider this to be the most important event of this year and maybe of a couple years. While it does not come out of my committee, I have been informed on it. I worked on it. I am very proud of the Finance Committee and in particular the chairman, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, and obviously, the ranking member, the distinguished Senator from New York.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator MOYNIHAN for those kinds words and for his last observation. 
   Perhaps Mr. Shapiro said it more eloquently than I. I consider it one of the most important events, and I described that early on as I see it. 
   I would add one observation. I ask the Senator if he shares this. Frankly, I think it is very important, when China is granted PNTR, when it becomes a member of WTO, that they not leave with the American people in the next few years, that they not let activity on their part happen which would let Americans think that they are discriminating against the purchase of American goods and services. If we are competitive in this world, whether it be in services or in products or in agricultural products, we don't expect China to control that through its Government but rather leave it to the free and open market or, indeed, Americans will look at this as a sham.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Our companies are telling us they can compete. I know of many areas they can compete, and they are not competing because of trade barriers, because of tariffs, and because of the selectivity of some of the governmental entities in terms of who they pick and choose. That part is a little risky on their end. It may be a small amount of product, but it could be a very big wave if they are not careful.

Even though there is a very large number of amendments, we are trying to finish tonight. We have arranged to get started with two amendments. We are going to accept one; and one is going to require a vote. Then, when we finish debating those--we might have to put off the vote, I say to Senator DURBIN, for a little while while we work out all these amendments. But we will eventually, at some point, have a vote on Senator DURBIN's amendment before we finish this bill. 
   We are going to listen for 10, 15 minutes to Senator HARKIN's concerns about the NIF project at Lawrence Livermore. Senator REID and I have agreed we will accept his amendment tonight and proceed after that to debate Senator DURBIN's amendment. 
   I say to Senator DURBIN, a Senator who is opposed to his amendment will arrive soon. I assume we will have a time agreement, if it is satisfactory to Senator BOND.

   I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the Durbin amendment at 8 p.m. and there be up to 20 minutes of debate to be equally divided prior to the vote and no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote. 
   Second, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote on the Durbin amendment Senator HARKIN be recognized to offer his amendment--which he has already offered--the National Ignition Facility amendment, that time on the amendment be limited to 30 minutes for the full debate; that no second-degree amendments be in order; that Senator HARKIN has used his time, and we will not use 15 minutes on our side. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote relative to the Durbin amendment the two managers be recognized to offer all the cleared amendments and amendments that we have to modify to get cleared; 
   And, finally, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the disposition of the Durbin amendment the bill be advanced to third reading, the Senate proceed to passage of H.R. 4733, following the passage of the bill the Senate insist on its amendments and request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate which would be the entire subcommittee.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are about to adopt a bill tonight commonly known as the energy and water appropriations bill, but everybody should know that, at a minimum, it is an interesting set of words--``energy and water.'' On the other hand, it is even more than an interesting set of words. There is a great irony with reference to this bill. 
   First of all, believe it or not, by precedent, this bill contains all of the nuclear weapons research and development, preservation, and manufacturing, and along with it are all the water projects--the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and all the waterways--and a whole group of nondefense-related science research projects. 
   What has happened over the years, it seems to this Senator, is that piling these kinds of programs together and then limiting the amount of money has, over time, yielded more attention  to the water projects because there are hundreds of House Members concerned, and rightly so, and scores of Senators concerned, and here is our great nuclear weapons program. We have stood before the world and thanked our great scientists because they do not belong to the military. These are free-minded Americans, some who have worked for 40 years and are still at Los Alamos as the nucleus of scientists who understand the nuclear weapons. 
   What I tried to do in the last few years is build a wall in the bill between the defense money and the nondefense money so we can move ahead with some of the things that are so desperately needed for the nuclear activities of this country, especially since we continue to say we have to compete in that area in the world until we have no more nuclear weapons, which we hope will occur sometime. 
   In spite of this wall, and trying to hold the defense money harmless from domestic spending, what has happened this year in the House allocations just beats anything you could imagine. For the House decided to underfund both, believe it or not. They decided to underfund the President's defense requirements and underfund his nonnuclear, nondefense projects. We cannot expect to get a bill based on those numbers. 
   I submit the Senate would have a lot of difficulty accepting that bill that would come from those kinds of numbers. Thanks to Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, they have allocated $600 million more on the defense nuclear side than the House. And we are still short somewhere between $300 and $400 million for the water projects. So many of you Senators know that your water projects could not be accepted. 
   We understand there are some new projects that have been new for 5 years, maybe some for 7. It is awful to still call them new, but they have not been started, so we call them new, and we cannot fund them. We are going to try to get some additional resources because every subcommittee is being helped along. If we can, we can do better when we come back. 
   But I want to just share a couple things that I think everybody should know. 
   There are two huge problems that exist with reference to our nuclear weapons activities and personnel and physical plant--where they live and work and do the kinds of things that keep us up there, where we can certify to the President of the United States, from these three nuclear labs, that our weapons are safe and will do what they are supposed to do. These lab directors--civilians--certify that based on what they have in their laboratories. 
   To give you an example of how bad off we are on physical plant, I just want to cite to you a situation that you would find unbelievable at Y-12 over at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
   I say to the Presiding Officer, part of that is nondefense, as you well know. But part of it is defense and related to nuclear weapons. If you went there tomorrow and said: The subcommittee that funds this asked me to come and take a look at one of the big buildings in Y-12 that has some roofing problems, the first thing they would do to you, Mr. President--especially considering the condition of your scalp, where you have no protection from hair--they would put a helmet on you as soon as you walked in this building. Did you know that? A helmet. And you would say: What's that for? And they would say: Well, distinguished Senator, it is because if you walk around this building, the roof falls in on you in pieces. So we don't want to hurt you. Even though you're not doing anything that is harmful down here in your job, the roof falls in on you in pieces. 
   This is a building, owned by the Department of Energy, which does nuclear deterrent work for the U.S. Government. It is a shame. We are repairing it. We are putting the money in this year. But just as we do that, there are 40- and 50- and 60-year-old buildings that are part of the complex that we still have alive in some of our laboratories, from the very first Manhattan Project, whenever that was. We have not rebuilt them. 
   So scientists are finding it difficult, in today's America, to continue working at some of our labs. We need a major new program if we are going to maintain this situation of safe and reliable nuclear weapons, with whatever number of warheads. We need a program to start replacing these buildings. Either we are serious about this--we want the very best for our best scientists--or we do not. 
   The second thing is there is a huge morale problem among the very best scientists, who have been with us a long time and know everything one could know about our nuclear weapons. There is a serious problem that is objectively recorded that says the young brilliant scientists coming out of our schools with Ph.D.s and post-docs are coming to the laboratories in smaller and smaller 
   numbers per year when we go out to try to encourage them to come. In fact, it is tremendously off this year. 
   The morale problem is so bad that the superscientists are beginning to quit. They are being offered an enhanced retirement program by the University of California. The professors and the university want this program because the University has too many senior professors. They need to tenure more new professors. But when this University program comes along it applies to the great scientists, too, at our laboratories. 
   There is a morale problem built around the FBI and Justice Department from this last episode at Los Alamos, making a whole group of scientists in one of the most secret, most sophisticated, most important operations in nuclear weaponry in America feel as though they are criminals. They just do not appreciate this. They do not like that. Some of them have been there 35 years. They just do not like the FBI treating them all like criminals or even suggesting that, as patriotic scientists, they ought to take their lie detectors and be treated as if there is some criminal in their midst. Frankly, some have decided they are just not going to do that. 
   I do not know where that ends up, but I submit it ought to end up soon for those who are threatened by prosecution from that last episode of a hard drive being found behind some kind of a multipurpose machine. If there is no evidence of spying and no evidence of distributing information, they ought to get on with this. They ought to get on with it. They ought to even talk to some of these scientists, who have been working for us 30, 40 years, about their attorney's fees, because every one of them has been looked at, and told: You might be the one we're looking for. It couldn't be all of them. 
   When you put that kind of thing out, it labels everybody in a national laboratory. It includes our most patriotic nuclear physicist, who is one of the greatest design people in all of nuclear history. You are telling him: We are not quite sure about all this, but you may be the one, you could go to jail for 24 months--or whatever number is used. There is no spying. So why don't we get on with it? I have not said this publicly, but I thought I would use this opportunity tonight. 
   It is serious business. Did you know that we keep saying the only thing the Soviet Union is doing well, in spite of their economic depression and all the rest, is to maintain a pretty adequate and sophisticated nuclear delivery system? I could spend the evening telling you about the difference between the two. 
   They can maintain their weapons much easier than we can keep ours, because they make nuclear weapons differently. We make them sophisticated, complicated, and that is part of their greatness. They make them simple, robust, and re-make them very often, like every 10 years. They are not as worried about us. We keep them for many years, and then we try to prove they will last longer with this new program we are funding called the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
   That is my little summary. There is much more to talk about. I thought it would be good tonight to put in perspective the significance of this bill. It is not just for the harbors of America. It is for those laboratories and plants that harbor the scientists, the manpower, and the equipment to keep our nuclear weapons on the right path. That is pretty important stuff, it seems to me. 
   My job is to make sure everybody at least understands part of it, so they will help us get out of the dilemma we are in and have a much more robust, much more positive atmosphere around these laboratories soon.  
   In conclusion, there is a new man in charge. We ought to be hopeful. General Gordon has been put in charge of this under the new law which you helped us with, I say to the Presiding Officer--and many did--which put one person in charge of the nuclear 
   weapons aspects at the DOE. We are so fortunate we got a four-star general, CIA oriented, Sandia Lab-trained individual who in retirement took this job. If it is going to be fixed, he will fix it. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might say to both Senators, I very much appreciate their efforts. I think while they were talking, I was expressing to anyone who wanted to listen my heartfelt concerns about this bill in terms of the future of our nuclear weapons. 
   It would not be good if we wasted a year operating under last year's levels or operating under some kind of a veto. I join in not knowing what the veto threat really means. Nonetheless, it would be marvelous if we could work it out to their satisfaction so in some way the issue were resolved. 
   There is going to be a year hiatus, one way or another, when nothing is going to happen. I don't think the President is going to be able to deny us that. But I think if we worked it out where everybody understood and maybe we could convince him that that is a good idea--that means his council on environmental quality and others--it would be a very good thing for the United States. I hope it works out. 
   I compliment Senator BOND this evening and earlier on this bill. I think he made a very strong case. It is pretty obvious this is a difficult issue. As he knows, I have been on his side. I have similar problems with endangered species and other things out in the West. We don't have enough water. All our rivers combined don't equal the Missouri River. I think that is a pretty fair statement--maybe even half the flow for all of ours that we have. We don't quite understand how the Missouri River is a problem. We see it as something fantastic. One time we tried to get a little bit of it, take it west, and Scoop Jackson stood in the way, I guess, from the State of Washington. 
   Anyway, I thank the Senator for what he has done. There is not going to be a vote tonight on that issue.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my amendment to strike the language in section 204 results from an agreement reached between myself and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to delay implementation of a solicitor's opinion concerning the ownership of water facilities and related use of Rio Grande water, and to work toward a long-term solution to these water issues. 
   At issue is the relationship between ownership of water facilities and the desire to maintain flows in the Rio Grande. 
   Secretary Babbitt agreed to refrain from implementing a June 19 Solicitor's opinion, unless agreed to by the parties in litigation and the state engineer, or as permitted by court order. 
   I committed to work with him to achieve a long-term solution to these complicated water issues, and we agreed the current allocation, ownership and use of water in New Mexico have raised some issues of the greatest magnitude and at this time the most appropriate forum for their resolution is Federal court. 
   I have moved to strike this language based on the good faith of Secretary Babbitt, and I also note that he agreed to continue to resolve water issues related to the Fort Sumner Irrigation District (FSID) and the Pecos River, recognizing that the FSID and MRGCD facilities have different status. 
   However, based on our good faith discussions, I will continue to work with him on the Pecos issue, and expect that the Department will not take adverse action against that irrigation district in the meantime.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend Senator HUTCHISON, along with Senators DODD and FEINSTEIN for introducing this bill today. I am pleased to join in this effort. 
   The election of Vicente Fox as President of Mexico is a remarkable event in the history of our neighbor to the south. 
   After 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mexico is about to embark on an important test of its new democracy. 
   Mr. Fox has spoken very eloquently and persuasively in recent weeks and he has offered some interesting new ideas on critical issues which affect both of our countries, like immigration, trade and controlling illegal drugs.  
   Some of his ideas are quite impressive, and they certainly will spur debate both in the United States and in Mexico. 
   I think it is important for our leaders in the United States, particularly those in the border region, to engage Mr. Fox, talk with him, listen to his ideas and offer our own thoughts to him. 
   In this spirit of cooperation and acceptance, I think it is critical for the United States to suspend the drug certification process for Mexico this coming year. 
   Mr. Fox needs time to build his administration, and to develop his own plan for dealing with the drug cartels. 
   As we all know, the history of drug cooperation between the United States and Mexico has not been great. 
   Mexico remains the source of 70 percent of the foreign grown marijuana in the U.S., 50-60 percent of the cocaine and 25-30 percent of the heroin. 
   In recent months, our federal law enforcement authorities have dismantled a major heroin ring operating out of Nayarit, Mexico, which was responsible for much of the black tar heroin in the Southwest. 
   It is this heroin which has torn apart the northern New Mexico county of Rio Arriba, which has the highest per capita heroin overdose rate in the Nation. 
   President-elect Fox has said that he will redouble his country's efforts to fight the drug cartels, and will increase the number of criminals extradited to the United States to stand trial. 
   I have fought for years for more extraditions, and I am pleased that President Fox shares my goal. 
   I want to give Mr. Fox time to prove that he means what he says. Engaging in the certification process in March of 2001, within only 120 days of Mr. Fox's first day in office, will only serve as a hindrance to developing mutual cooperation between the two new administrations. 
   The bill we have introduced today merely waives for one year the requirement that the President make a certification decision about Mexico. 
   This waiver would not exempt Mexico from any of the annual reports or other activities associated with the certification process, including review by the State Department in its annual report to Congress. 
   It simply says that the next United States President need not grade Mexico and its new President in his first four months in office by choosing between certification, decertification or certification through a national interest waiver. 
   Mr. Fox should make no mistake--Senators from the Southwest care deeply about the drug problem, which affects our communities, courts, jails, hospitals and border region like no other issue. 
   We expect Mr. Fox to set concrete, measurable goals and timetables for crippling the drug cartels and ending narco-corruption. 
   This is a fair bill, one that respects the new democracy in Mexico, and recognizes that the new administration needs time to set its own agenda. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the new President of Mexico on this and other important issues of mutual interest between our two countries.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the managers' amendment to S. 2438, the bill before  the Senate, to modernize our Nation's pipeline safety programs. The issue of our country's pipeline safety regime came to the forefront again last year after the death of three teenagers in a pipeline explosion near Bellingham, WA. 
   Since that accident in 1999, the Senators from Washington State have worked tirelessly to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a vote. I want to commend Senator GORTON, Senator MURRAY, and the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, for their efforts on this legislation. Without their work, patience and persistence, this bill would not be ready for passage in the Senate. 
   As my colleagues know, in August of this year, New Mexico experienced its own tragic pipeline explosion. Just after midnight on August 19, an El Paso Natural Gas pipeline exploded on the Pecos River near Carlsbad, NM. Twelve members of an extended family were camping near the explosion, which sent a 350-foot high ball of flame into the air. Six of the campers were killed instantly, and the remaining six have since died from their injuries. The horrific accident is the largest pipeline disaster in the State's history and one of the worst in the United States. While the NTSB is still investigating the cause of the explosion, preliminary analyses indicate that the pipeline was highly corroded, and that half of the internal wall of the pipe had been eaten away in places, apparently causing a prolonged natural gas leak. 
   Sadly, this accident has again placed the spotlight on the need for Congress to update our pipeline safety standards. The bill before the Senate represents a marked improvement in our existing pipeline safety program. The bill requires companies to conduct periodic internal inspections of their lines; authorizes and provides resources to allow the States to exercise a greater role in pipeline inspections and oversight; increases civil penalties against companies who violate pipeline safety laws; and provides resources for greater research and development into pipeline safety technologies, including new internal inspection mechanisms, as well as enhanced leak detection technologies. 
   There are over 1.8 million miles of liquid and natural gas pipelines in the United States, including 7,000 miles in New Mexico. The Federal Office of Pipeline Safety is responsible for 5,000 miles of pipeline in New Mexico and the State must inspect the remaining 1,800 miles. Yet, the New Mexico State budget for pipeline safety allows for only four inspectors, who can cover only a few miles of pipeline per day. Because of this resource shortage, hundreds of miles of underground oil and gas pipelines go uninspected each year in my state. 
   The bill before the Senate authorizes more funding for State inspection activities, and provides the States with greater oversight authority to inspect both intra- and interstate pipelines. States are an important partner in the regulation of oil and gas pipelines. With this bill, Congress is stepping up to the plate to help reimburse states for undertaking a greater responsibility for pipeline safety. 
   As my colleagues know, the bulk of the responsibility for pipeline inspection falls on the oil and gas companies themselves. In fact, the liquid and natural gas industries spend nearly $4 billion annually on pipeline safety activities. Pipeline transportation is perhaps the safest way available to move liquid and natural gas across the country. Among all the methods of transport, including pipeline, highway, rail, aviation, and marine, pipeline accident fatalities represent less than 1/333rd of one percent of the total number of annual deaths related to the industry. 
   Yet despite this safety record, tragic accidents do occur. I think the industry, in partnership with federal and State regulators, can do more to better protect our citizens from these kinds of accidents. This bill represents an extension of that partnership, and I believe that industry should be commended for coming to the table and helping us reach this agreement. 
   This bill requires companies to file ``Integrity Management Plans'' with the United States Department of Transportation. These plans will outline how the company will periodically assess the safety of their pipelines, including the use of internal inspections, pressure tests, direct assessments and any other available methods of identifying weaknesses in the pipeline and detecting leaks. In short, this provision means that for the first time, companies will be required to conduct regular pipeline inspections, and to provide information on those inspections to federal and State regulators. 
   Finally, Mr. President, this bill authorizes additional resources for research and development of new pipeline safety technologies through the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. It is clear that we need to develop some new technologies to better assess the integrity of pipelines and detect leaks before they cause disaster. One of the problems with the line which exploded in Carlsbad was that conventional ``pig'' devices, which detect corrosion and leaks, could not be used to inspect that particular pipeline. We have tremendous scientific capabilities in our universities, national laboratories and in the private sector which could be tapped to help develop new and better technologies. 
   While everyone recognizes that Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico have great scientific capabilities which could be brought to bear on this problem, a private sector resource also exists in my home state. La-Sen Corporation in Las Cruces, NM has developed an airborne laser mapping system which can inspect hundreds of miles of oil and gas pipeline per day. I know that some of the major oil and gas companies, including El Paso Natural Gas, have seen the technology and have indicated that they would use it if it were commercially available. 
   I plan to work in the next several weeks to help this company find federal resources to complete development of this technology and make it commercially available as soon as possible. This is the kind of research and development that the federal government ought to encourage. 
   I am pleased to support passage of this bill. Even though the bill imposes new requirements on industry and provides for tougher penalties for violating the law, there are some who will say that it does not do enough to get tough on pipeline companies. In my view, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senators from Washington and other members who have worked on this bill have done an excellent job crafting a bill which will receive the unanimous support of this Senate. I hope the House will take this bill up at the earliest possible date and pass it quickly so that we can send pipeline safety legislation to the President for his signature prior to the end of the session. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished Senator from the State of Missouri, Mr. BOND. I say to the Senate, since the amendment that we are now going to take up for up to 3 hours this evening has to do with the upper and lower Missouri River debate, I am not going to manage any of that. I am going to let the management be in the hands of Senator KIT BOND, if he does not mind, in my stead. I join him in his effort. He knows that. But nonetheless, it is his issue. I prefer to have him managing it.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I recall coming to the floor when we considered the military construction appropriations bill. My friend, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. KYL, recalls that. The military construction bill came to the floor and we told the Senate how we worked for over a month, in a bipartisan manner, to provide the administration with tools to improve fuel reduction in the wildland and urban interface; that is, urban interface areas for communities that are at risk. 
   I understand the distinguished Senator, Mr. KYL from Arizona, has some very excellent portrayals of what happens to forests that are attended to and cleared as compared with those we leave unattended and then have a fire. Unfortunately, the administration threatened to veto the legislation we worked on because they found some of the suggestions too hot to handle. However, my colleagues found the suggestions very prudent, and later accepted my amendment to the Interior appropriations bill, which is where we finally were able to offer it. It was offered there as an emergency measure and received huge bipartisan support. 
   Throughout the United States, there is an increasing amount of land in what natural resource scientists and firefighting experts call wildland-urban interface. This is very important because if that burns, not only do we lose forests, but we lose communities, we lose villages, we lose watersheds right close to cities which have a propensity to destroy the water supply as the trees in the watershed burn. 
   Many millions of acres--according to the General Accounting Office estimate, 39 million acres or more--of national forests are at high risk of wildfires. 
   Over August--it was not a luxury; normally visiting my State is a privilege and a luxury--I had to go there to visit fire-devastated communities, and in particular one, Los Alamos, but also some smaller ones. One of the communities is named Weed, where a couple hundred people came with their concerns because they are so frightened about what is happening to the forests on which they live, work, and from which they used to make a living. 
   As of today, there are over 52 fires burning over 1,000 acres each across this country. 
   The total number of acres burned this year is 223 percent of the 10-year-to-date average. 
   On Labor Day, almost 17,000 acres burned--on that one day. 
   Close to half a million acres have burned in my State this year; many more in other States, including the States of Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and others. 
   When we first started working on this measure, the administration believed there was too much national environmental special interest group opposition to my mild fuel-reduction amendment. But I wanted to ensure that we did not just throw money at the problem and say we solved the threat to our communities. 
   We gave them, in that amendment, $240 million in emergency funding to work on hazardous fuel reduction. Actually, since that amendment, which will be in conference under the chairmanship of Senator GORTON, there have been many more fires that have occurred. Much more evidence has been discerned with reference to communities that are right up next to forests that are loaded with kindling on the ground, ready to make a small fire into a monstrous fire. 
   The language in that amendment provides the land management agencies additional authority that they now lack to do some of this fuel reduction work. We asked them, at their sole discretion, to do this work in a way that would provide jobs to local people, opportunities to private, nonprofit, or cooperating entities, such as youth conservation corps, and opportunities for small and micro businesses. 
   We asked the two Secretaries involved to identify those communities where hazard reduction activities were already underway or could be commenced by the end of the calendar year. We further asked the Secretaries to describe, by May of the coming year, the roadblocks to beginning hazardous fuel reduction work in the remaining communities at risk. 
   I can tell you about some of the communities in my State because our State forester had no hesitation to find out this information. He went out to find it. We have an excellent State forestry department and an excellent State forester. 
   They found the Ruidoso area, an area many people visit, has a very serious threat in terms of heavy pine scattered throughout the areas and residue on the ground of a very high kindling nature. 
   In Santa Fe, the water supply is in immediate jeopardy. 
   The growing East Mountain communities of Albuquerque are facing significant fire hazards. 
   The Middle Rio Grande Bosque--a green area, a greenbelt along our river, the Rio Grande--and the Espanola area, increasingly face the threat of out-of-control fire; that is, federal forests that are not cleaned up, forests that have not been paid any attention to in terms of management. 
   Los Alamos was deeply impacted by the Cerro Grande fire and will have the continued threat in unburned canyons. 
   We have all seen on television the terrible pictures of personal devastation from that area where more than 400 people were left without residences. Some were in duplexes that were burned to the ground. We have to pay for those because that fire was started by a Park Service employee who made a very serious mistake. I think we are all aware of that. That actually happened. 
   I want to summarize my remarks by suggesting that it is still very interesting to me how the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, can come out to the West and say some of the things he does. President Clinton's Interior Department has been in charge of many federal lands--along with Agriculture Department, in charge of the forests for as long as Clinton has been President. I say to my friend from the State of Arizona, soon that will be 8 years. They have been in control of: How should we manage? What should we cut? What should we do with these forests? It is interesting that Mr Babbitt  would come out West and say: This administration is not responsible for any of this; it comes from administrations before this one. 
   Frankly, how many years would it take this administration to fix the problems in the management of the forests? I have listened to my good friend, the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this issue in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I heard him talk about what the Federal Government has done and not done. 
   I have not heard anything about a major effort to clean up the forests. In fact, I think it has been to the contrary. I think there has been a fear that if you clean this up, you are logging. If you clean up the stuff on the ground so it will not burn, you are putting people to work in rural areas; and you are supporting this idea that there are many uses for forests, you are making it a reality--where this administration wants to push more to only public use rather than any private use. 
   I say to the Secretary of the Interior--and I certainly have not heard Secretary Glickman say this--but for him to come out West and say this didn't happen on their watch seems to me to be skating on very thin ice in terms of the reality of things. 
   What do we have now? What we have now is a Presidential election. Vice President GORE is running, and many of us think most of these policies were run through his staff for their ``environmental'' validity. 
   I think it would be nice to know, since the Secretary of the Interior denies that this administration and our Vice President, who many know was in charge of a lot of environmental policies--where was he on all these fire danger issues? More importantly, where will he be if he is elected? I cannot believe that if a set of questions were put to him--and we can't do that--he will answer them only if he wants to and only if they write them up a certain way. What did you do during your 8 years with reference to this problem, and if you are elected, what will you do during the next 4 years? Be very specific. Wouldn't it be something if you asked: Do you support a policy saying you can not put a road in the forest, even to stop the fire? I don't know if he would answer that. 
   The policy in this country now appears to be not to put any roads in. In my State they have told me that in the overgrown Santa Fe watershed, they don't believe they are allowed to put a road a half mile up--even a temporary one--to thin a rather steep slope, which you cannot get to from the main road. There are many frustrating stories like that. We hear stories about the federal land management agencies concerned with ``protecting'' certain things on the ground before you use a Caterpillar to stop a fire. 
   Frankly, to me, the results make that policy an adversity, because in order to save some resources, the result is ironically thousands and thousands of acres of burned forests and damaged resources. So which is the more prudent policy? To try to stop the fire early on at a quarter of its entirety using mechanized equipment, or let the whole thing burn and look back on it and say we didn't touch any of the ground with a tractor or any equipment, but we sure burned the forest down? These are very important issues. Where do we go next? 
   I submit that Congress is going to see--even in the few days it has--that that $240 million as an emergency comes out of that conference. I think some Senators are getting some estimates about the environmental restoration cost for some of these forests that burned in the State of Senator KYL, and certainly in the distinguished chairman's State, and in the State of Montana and others. What will it cost to go back and rehabilitate and make them grow again? That surely is a great American emergency. 
   Do we want to leave these millions of acres with only the stark reality of a fire? Millions of trees are standing that are burned. Do we want to leave them all there until they rot away? Don't we want to say that as part of a rehabilitation plan, we ought to remove some of them? 
   Frankly, I will give you one example. We have a little community in Otero County called Alamogordo. It had one nice lumber mill, which just closed. Do you know what is around it? A very big fire that we reported here on the floor. Around the small town of Weed, near that closed sawmill, stands millions of burned trees with about 25 percent of their utility gone. We have not yet decided to remove one of those trees and to put somebody back to work in that lumber mill because of the policies the Senator from Idaho was speaking of. 
   We need plans. I agree. But we also need to put the money up so the plans and the work be done quickly, in my opinion. One of the biggest and most important things we can do in the coming weeks is to provide this to the administration and say, ``Get started.'' Clearly, they won't accomplish a great deal, but the sooner we get started the better. 
   I understand Senator KYL has an expert in his State who has worked on the issue of how much good can we do in cleaning up the forests, so that we have some fire prevention, instead waiting around and then trying to put out a devastating fire. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, clearly I appreciate the distinguished minority leader's cooperation in getting this bill up. I appreciate the tone of his comments in that he desires apparently to get this bill and other bills passed. I hope that is true. I say to the Senate, I will do my best to try to finish this bill tomorrow night. I don't know of a lot of real difficult amendments. There are some important amendments for regions of the country and otherwise. Clearly, I have seen no amendments thus far that attack the substance of this bill which I will explain shortly. 
   Mr. President, what is not said by the minority leader, in an effort to analyze the entire Presidential election and  what is going on here in the Congress as of this moment, first, on tax reform measures that the Republicans have proposed, call them what you may. Of course, the distinguished Senator, minority leader, chooses to call them so-called marriage penalty reform. 
   Between 35 and 45 million American couples are affected by that bill. Affected how? Their taxes will go down for no other reason than we will eliminate a penalty currently imposed just because they are married. Whether we have some other people covered in it or not, let me suggest we know what it will cost in 5 years. We know what it will cost in 10 years to the Treasury if we give back a little bit of money to the married couples in America who are getting taxed extra just because they are married. 
   What else did we pass? We passed a 10-year phase-in of the death tax. Surely those on the other side know that by definition the only people who pay a death tax--that is, a tax on death--are people who have accumulated some assets. So they could all be called rich. Essentially, the current law of America says if, after your mother and father have worked their whole lives and have acquired four drugstores and own a house and have invested in a piece of property, if that ends up being $10 million--I am speaking to Americans who might have worked 40 years--right now the Government can take as much as 65 percent of it upon their death. 
   That is the question. Is that right? Does America want that? Or should we ask our President to sign a bill that phases that out over 10 years? 
   I happen to have looked at numbers to see how they relate one to another in this budget process. My estimates are as follows: Both of those taxes combined cannot be risky to America. 
   Why can't they be? Because they amount to somewhere between 10 percent and 12 percent of the surplus--10 percent to 12 percent of the surplus, the non-Social Security surplus which is $3.4 trillion. 
   The same people who say that is risky have on the table at least five new programs that will spend more of the surplus than those two tax cuts. Are those programs therefore risky, because they spend more of the Federal surplus than these two tax reform measures? No. But neither are the tax cuts, just because they are tax reform measures. They are not risky just because they give people back some of their money. To those on the other side and the Vice President, who is running for President, they must be risky because they give back to the American people some real tax reform money. 
   If we want to go on to debate whether the Vice President even has a plan to give Americans back any of their tax money, we can do that at any time. I am not on the tax writing committee, but I will volunteer. I will be here. And I can tell you right up front, very little of what the President proposes goes to taxpayers for tax relief. Almost all of it goes to Americans whom the Vice President chooses to give back money, by way of just giving them a check that matches or exceeds their own money, in a huge way. The largest transfer of wealth that we probably have ever seen is tucked away in what the Vice President calls tax cuts for the American people. 
   Read the Washington Post editorial of 4 days ago. While they are quick to criticize Republicans, they have a very good paragraph in the middle of their editorial saying: Mr. Vice President, Democrats, why do you insist on telling the taxpayers, including middle income taxpayers, how they should spend the tax dollars you want to give them back? The Washington Post says: If you want to give them a tax cut give them a tax cut. They don't do that. They create some new targeted programs. If you want to use them, you have to use it for college tuition. If you want to use it, you have to use it for this, that, or the other. 
   Question: Don't some Americans have more concern about how to use it and where to use it, and would do that right, rather than to have the Government do that for you while making the Tax Code more complicated and claiming they are giving you tax relief? 
   Frankly, I could answer many more of the questions but I will just do the issues raised by the minority leader, and I will only address one. 
   The President of the United States has never attempted to seriously do a bipartisan Medicare prescription bill--never. He has sent us his own, but never has negotiated with Republicans. The one time we had a bipartisan committee, since you required a supermajority, he pulled his support so it would not have a supermajority--yet it had a majority, bipartisan, for a major reform and prescription drug bill. So one of the reasons most of the things not getting done are not getting done is because they have become so partisan that the other side of the aisle says, ``Our way or no way.'' The President says, ``My way or no way.'' The Vice President says, ``I am running for President and here is what I propose. It will be that way or no way.'' 
   That is what the American people will find out, I hope, as we debate these issues in an effort in the next 5 weeks to resolve many of them. And I hope we do.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Committee on Appropriations favorably reported H.R. 4733 by a vote of 28 to 0 on Tuesday, July 18. 
   Senator REID and I have worked very hard this year to put together a fair bill under extremely difficult circumstances. As reported by the committee, the recommendation would provide $22.470 billion in new budget authority for fiscal year 2001. That total is broken out between a defense allocation that is pretty good, and a non-defense allocation that is extremely limited. 
   The Defense BA allocation is $13.484 billion. That is $400 million over the President's request and $1.384 billion over last year. The committee requested the additional money to address some very serious needs in the nuclear weapons complex, defense environmental clean-up, and in ongoing international nonproliferation programs. 
   However, the BA allocation on the non-defense side of the bill is much more difficult--it provides $8.986 billion, which is $603 million below the President's request and $73 million below the current year level. 
   In order to accommodate some serious shortfalls in the President's request, and some very legitimate requests from Members, we have had to cut a significant amount more than the $603 million we are short from the request. 
   The allocation has also forced the committee to make very difficult choices, and we have tried to do that on as fair a basis as possible. We have followed certain criteria. In the water accounts for example: 
   No. 1, we have tried to focus available funding, to the greatest extent possible, to ongoing studies and construction projects. 
   No. 2, we have included no new construction starts or new initiatives in fiscal year 2001, and only a very limited number of new studies or planning projects. 
   No. 3, we have not included unauthorized projects or water and sewer infrastructure projects contained in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. 
   No. 4, numerous projects budgeted at or near the Corps' capability have been reduced in order to pick-up funds for congressional priorities and to restore funding not requested by the administration for flood control and inland navigation projects. 
   No. 5, given these constraints, we have been limited to accommodating  only the highest priority requests of Members where possible. 
   Having said that, the recommendation for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers totals $4.104 billion. This is $41 million above the budget request and $22 million below the FY 2000 enacted level. The following is a highlight of the recommendation of the Corps Budget for FY 2000: 
   General Investigations totals $139 million, down $23 million below the current year. 
   Construction General totals $1.361 billion, down $24 million below the current year. 
   Operation and Maintenance totals $1.862 billion which is $8 million over the current year. 
   Moving on to the Bureau of Reclamation, the recommendation before the committee totals $753 million. This is $48 million below the budget request and $13 million below the current year level. The recommendation includes: 
   Six hundred and fifty-five million dollars for Water and Related Resources which includes both construction and operation and maintenance of Bureau projects. This is $50 million over the current year level. 
   None of the $60 million requested for the California Bay-Delta Restoration program is provided in the bill, as the authorization for this program expires in fiscal year 2000. 
   Thirty-eight million dollars for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund a reduction of $4 million from the current year. 
   For the Department of Energy's non-defense accounts, we have proposed some substantial reductions from the President's request. However, in many cases, those reductions appear large only because the President proposed large increases we will not be able to accommodate, given our non-defense allocation. 
   In other accounts such as Nuclear Energy R&D, the administration request was 4 percent below current year. Therefore, the committee has tried to balance the Department's research efforts by providing reasonable increases to these important research efforts. 
   For the Science programs at the Department of Energy, the committee recommends $2.870 billion, an increase of $82 million over last year, but still $292 million below the request. 
   Over half of the total proposed increase to Science was in one construction project, the Spallation Neutron Source in Tennessee. The committee strongly supports this project and has provided $240 million, an increase of $140 million over current year. 
   The allocation forced the committee into some very difficult decisions regarding many otherwise outstanding programs and initiatives under the Office of Science. For example, although the committee has traditionally provided strong support to High Energy Physics, Nuclear Physics and Fusion Energy, all are funded at below last year's level. 
   Within the defense allocation, we have been able to add significant funds to some very pressing problems. 
   Within Weapons Activities, the committee has provided $4.883 billion, an increase of $244 million over the budget request. The committee is very concerned about the state of the science based Stockpile Stewardship Program. As it is now, the program is not on schedule, given the current budget, to develop the tools, technologies and skill-base to refurbish our weapons and certify them for the stockpile. For example, we are behind schedule and over cost on the production of both pits and secondaries for our nuclear weapons. The committee has provided significant increases to these areas. 
   Furthermore, DOE has failed to keep good modern facilities and our production complex is in a terrible state of disrepair. To address these problems, the mark provides an increase of over $100 million for the production plants in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, and South Carolina. 
   But it is not just the physical infrastructure that is deteriorating within the weapons complex, morale among the scientists at the three weapons laboratories is at an all-time low. For example, the last two years at Los Alamos have witnessed security problems that greatly damaged the trust relationship between the government and its scientists. Additionally, research funds have been cut and punitive restrictions on travel imposed. 
   As a result, the labs are having great difficulty recruiting and retaining America's greatest scientists. To help address this problem, the bill has increased the travel cap from $150 million to $200 million, and increased Laboratory Directed Research and Development. And I intend to offer additional amendments to increase LDRD and travel. 
   For security, the committee recommends $336 million for the Department's security office, an increase of $213 million over 
   last year. This is in addition to the $45 million for increased Cyber Security that was just enacted as part of the fiscal year 2000 Supplemental. In addition, the committee has made sure General Gordon, as the new head of the NNSA, will have the resources and the authority to take care of security throughout the weapons complex. 
   The Department has experienced tremendous difficulty in constructing its special experimental and computational facilities within budget and within schedule. The National Ignition Facility is only the most recent example, and on that issue, Senator REID and I have agreed to recommend at this time only the $74 million requested by the administration, recognizing that much more money will be required this year if this project is to continue. 
   Regarding accelerator production of tritium, the committee has combined that with other programs to begin an exciting new program called Advanced Accelerator Applications. The committee recommendation includes $60 million to continue the important work on a back-up tritium source for defense purposes, but will also fund important work on accelerator transumutation of waste and other accelerator applications. 
   The committee continues its strong tradition of support for nuclear nonproliferation issues. We recommend $909 million, an increase of $43 million over the request, and $180 million more than last year. 
   For Defense Environmental Management, the committee recommends $6.042 billion, a $326 million increase over last year. To the extent possible, we have tried to address the needs of Members with environmental management sites. We have provided increases at Savannah River and the Hanford site, and provided additional funds for environmental science and technology research at Idaho and other labs. 
   In summary, the recommendation before you is for $22.47 billion, a reduction of $225 million from the request. Within that amount, non-defense programs are reduced $603 million while defense accounts increase $400 million. This is going to be a difficult year, but I look forward to consideration by the full Senate. 
   It is our intention to work hard over the next few evenings to complete work on the bill. It is my intention to seek a unanimous consent that all amendments be filed by noon on Wednesday. We will be here all evening, and I urge my colleagues to bring any amendments they may have to the floor so we can consider them. It is my intention, shortly after all amendments have been filed, to act on a package of managers amendments. 
   Before I yield back, I would like to thank Chairman STEVENS for the strong support he has given to the energy and water bill, particularly on the defense funding side. I would also like to thank my ranking member, senator REID, for all the effort he has put forth in working together on this bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, for what he has said, and I echo the compliments. I think the Senator from Vermont understands the delicate position we are in this year in that the nondefense portion of this appropriations bill is inadequate to cover the nondefense research and water projects we ought to be covering in the bill. 
   I believe when we were able to almost match the Senator's and his cosponsors' request on solar and wind, they understand we are hopeful when we get to conference of getting some additional money from the budget and the appropriators for the nondefense portion of this bill which will make it easier for us to keep this and hold it all the way through. I have been sure and careful to explain that to the Senator from Vermont. I am sure he is aware of it. I wanted to put it in the RECORD.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while Senators are going to talk about projects, programs, activities, and amendments to add $5 million here or $7 million there, I want to break this appropriations bill into two parts--I wish I had it on a chart, and maybe I will have it the next time we are on this bill--so that when anybody offers an amendment that costs money, if it is in the nondefense part, whatever it is for, maybe some science research, maybe a water project that we did not fund, maybe operation and maintenance for some part of the Mississippi, a levy system, we are going to try to show you where we are really hurting for money is the nondefense part of this budget, the water projects and the nondefense science. 
   As a matter of fact, the allocation is about $604 million below the President's request in the nondefense part of this appropriations bill. That is $73 million less than last year's appropriations. It is not a question only of not being able to meet the President's request. We are, in essence, below last year's appropriated number, which many people say isn't realistic unless you are prepared to take some programs out of the Department--and we can hardly do that. That is a negative $73 million. 
   Fortunately, on the defense side, we have talked our way through all these different hurdles of how much defense money is available, and I am very appreciative of the fact that through the efforts of our chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the appropriators who spend defense money--that is the big defense bill, the smaller bill on military construction and a very small bill on Commerce that spends some money on defense--they have left, as part of the increase, sufficient money to cover the defense in this bill, which is $13.5 billion. 
   I regret to say the problem we have is when we go to the House, we have to raise the House's number because they are about $600 million below us on the defense side of their bill. It is a difficult problem. 
   I do believe the allocation that both chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are going to ultimately come up with will make us whole at the Senate level on defense. I just explained why. The money is there, and I hope before this is over, 
   we will convince everyone we are in an area where we have to be very concerned how much money we are spending on the defense side because the morale and capability of our National Laboratories to maintain our nuclear weapons activities is getting very close as to whether it can continue in a manner we have expected over the years. 
   When somebody says it is only $7 million and I need it for a levy and I need to start a program even though we said no new starts, I want to keep in front of everybody that we are $604 million below the President on nondefense, and the House is $600 million below ours on defense, and we are $500 million higher than the President's on defense. Those will be put up here for everybody to see. 
   If anybody wants an interpretation of what is in this bill, I tried very hard in a nonpartisan way to explain it in my earlier statement. I have given full credit to the magic of bipartisanship when it comes to writing a bill like this. We have to try to work together. Maintaining our nuclear capacity through science and research and nonproliferation should not be a partisan issue. Thanks to Senator REID, it is not. There are a few disagreements he and I have. We will iron them out on the floor. 
   I want to make sure everybody understands that right now, this day, 5 weeks before the new fiscal year, the nuclear defense laboratories, which essentially are made up of a piece of the  National Laboratory in Tennessee called Oak Ridge, called Y-12, plus Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque and Livermore, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, are the laboratories that maintain our nuclear weapons activities that measure the performance and ability of our nuclear weapons, and their safety and reliability. 
   Right now, they are fragile because the morale is low. Throughout this short debate, I will keep mentioning to Senators that we better be careful with reference to the scientists who have done the big defense work who we must retain at these laboratories to perfect our Stockpile Stewardship Program, which allows no weapons testing while we are still going to protect the reliability of our weapons. We need to retain the old heads who have done this work for so long. At Los Alamos there are about 40 of them who are in the X division, including NEST or the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. 
   Their morale is very low because, my colleagues will recall, that is the area where that hard drive was found behind a machine, and they did not know how it got there. They have now been under investigation for 14 weeks. Fourteen weeks is a long time to have the very best scientists in the world who have maintained our nuclear capacity, some of them for 30 years, some for 25, some more 40, under investigation. We do not want them to leave the laboratories, and we want to attract the best new scientists to follow in their footsteps and have them educated by the other scientists. We are not succeeding at either. 
   The new recruits of the very best scientists are at an all-time low, and that is measurable. In other words, we know how many scientists we invited to work and how many accepted. I will put that in the RECORD. It is very low compared to 5 years ago. We also know how many are planning to leave, and it is very high compared to other years. 
   Everybody knows I have a parochial interest. At least they would assume that. If one of my colleagues had a laboratory like Los Alamos in his or her State, I say to any Senator, I assume they would be concerned about it. If they had a Sandia National Laboratory, which is the engineering laboratory for nuclear weapons, I assume they would be concerned. 
   I am concerned, and I have to try to convince the Senate that we have to put back some money in terms of morale builders, and we have to start telling those great scientists that they have done a wonderful job for America. 
   So something got messed up. 
   If you can't prove there is spying or espionage, pretty soon you ought to get off their backs and you ought to say to them: We are going to fix this administratively. 
   I could go on tonight and tell you how we are going to do that because we have a new administrative approach to running the nuclear weapons activities of America. We have a great man, General Gordon, heading it. Give him a chance. Give him a chance to restructure. At the same time, let somebody who knows their problems lead this effort. He is about as knowledgeable as anyone we could get to head the NNSA, the National Nuclear Security Administration. It is hard to remember that name, but it will not be hard in a couple years because this general is going to make sure we know about it. 
   He is already showing some real leadership in terms of our understanding what NNSA is. It is the entire package of activities for our nuclear safety as far as our weapons and nonproliferation. We know he is going to fix this morale issue if we give him a chance. 
   For now we have to be very careful. For instance, the House limits their travel again, even lower than the President recommends. Does it ever occur to anyone that the great scientists travel? Was that ever an astonishing conclusion? If you did not know it, let me tell you: Great scientists travel. They love to go to conventions and conferences to share ideas. And if you say to a young crop of the best scientists in America: Come and work at Los Alamos, but you had better remember that you can only make one trip a year--well, what they are telling us already is: Hey, I have a company that doesn't limit me. They are offering me some stock options. They want me to come. 
   Pay isn't a problem. We pay our scientists pretty well at these laboratories, as a matter of fact. I must tell you, if they like their work they will stay there. 
   So my concern is a very serious one. We could not do what I think we must do and live with the House number on defense in this bill. We are $600 million higher than the House. We tell the Senate that with much pride because you have to give these laboratories what they need. 
   Let me give you just one area. The National Laboratory structure, with reference to nuclear weapons, is in need of an entire new, let's say, 10-year plan for rebuilding ancient buildings. I use the word ``ancient'' because some of them are so old that if you could apply the historic preservation statutes in the State of New Mexico, some of them would be untouchable because they are too old. That is how old they are. I do not want to tell you how old. But it is not very old to be labeled ``old'' anymore if you are a building. 
   But we started a plan. We started an approach for $100 million in this bill, to start some of that--for lack of a better word, we will call it infrastructure. But it is buildings; it is equipment. We must go on beyond that for a few years and get the nuclear weapons complex, so to speak, built up or decide we are going to have an inferior one. We would not be able to tell Americans the best people work there. 
   The best brainpower of America is devoted to making sure our nuclear weapons are right and safe. As we lower the numbers--which we are going to be doing; that, we can all say--even with lower numbers, we know what we are doing. We do not have to have tests because we know they are safe. 
   If we do not, I am going to support people who come to the floor and say: Let's start testing again. Have no doubt about it. We voted in the Mark Hatfield amendment to start a moratorium. We are doing it unilaterally. They are saying: Why don't we sign the treaty? We are not doing any testing by statute right now. 
   So these great scientists have to substitute brainpower and equipment for what underground testing used to give them, with information about the adequacy, the safety, the reliability. 
   Now we have to do it by computers, by new machines, new, fantastic x-ray machines that look inside bombs. We had better have the very best people in America working there, wouldn't you think? I would. 
   My distinguished friend from Nevada wants to speak. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through July 26, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 2001 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 290), which replaced the 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 68). 
   The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $17.5 billion in budget authority and by $20.6 billion in outlays. Current level is $28 million below the revenue floor in 2000. 
   Since my last report, dated June 20, 2000, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Military Construction Appropriations Act, fiscal year 2001 (P.L. 106-246). This action changed the 2000 current level of budget authority and outlays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator REID for his comments and his cooperation. We still have a few days to go. The picture presented with reference to the nondefense portion of this bill, in particular, is absolutely true. I cannot figure why the House and Senate in their overall scope of allocating money continue to underallocate for nondefense when Senators and House Members probably request more of us in the nondefense part of this bill than any bill, except perhaps the interior appropriations bill.  
   The Senator mentions 1,000 requests. Those have to do with projects or programs or activities for dams that are clearly within reason as things we should do. I am working hard and will continue to work hard to try to get additional allocation before we complete the conference. I hope we can. Obviously if we cannot, with what the House has appropriated this will be a bad overall result for the nondefense part of the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the energy and water bill on appropriations has been held up. I understand that the distinguished minority leader has an objection to it. I share with Senators the importance of that bill. I suggest, hopefully, that the minority leader rethink this because I do have some confidence that he is not exclusively interested in partisan politics, and that perhaps this very good bill on energy and water could be passed and sent to the President; although, my hopes are dwindling. 
   Essentially, one looks at the energy and water appropriations bill, and while I would devote some time to the energy crisis, which my friend spoke about eloquently, I will interrupt my comments to say this to the Senator: Incredibly, there is a position being formulated by the Vice President's campaign to claim that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney would be bad for American energy consumers. Isn't that a joke? 
   What is bad for American energy consumers, and the reason gasoline prices are so high, and natural gases are skyrocketing, and we are growing in dependence upon foreign countries for our very lifeblood, for without energy, we have no economy. Of late, we have decided it must be so clean that the only thing we are using in any increased abundance is natural gas. We are even shying away, in this administration, from clean coal technology. Did the Senator know that technology to clean up coal is being pushed down by this administration instead of up?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me tell the Senator this: I asked this administration and I asked this Vice President to send to us what their great energy policy has been during the last 8 years. Every time we say there is none, they say they have got one, they have had one and we turned it down. I would love to see it. I would like to evaluate it and send it out to the energy people and ask them what would it have produced had we given more money to solar and wind than we did. How would that have had an impact on the consumers of America--paying this enormous price for gasoline, this enormous new price for natural gas? 
   Frankly, I say to my friend from Utah, if Americans don't know it--because we worry so much about Social Security and its future, Medicare and its future, what happens to this surplus, and what happens to the debt--probably the biggest challenge to the American way of life and our standard of living, driving automobiles and finding jobs and factories growing, is that we have no energy policy. And we are going to move slightly and slowly, because of this administration, into a position where we are not going to have enough energy to make America go, or it will be so high that Americans will wonder what in the world happened to us. 
   Do you know when that will be? That will be when our dependence on foreign sources of energy grows some more. Americans should know that over 50  percent of the crude oil and crude oil products this great Nation consumes comes from foreign countries, from the so-called cartel. It is not all Saudi Arabia. We have South American and Central American countries in there, too. But do you know what. They are not interested in America. They are interested in how much their oil will bring on the market to them. For a few years, they can sit back and say: America, America, when oil prices were $10 a barrel and you were hopping along and we were broke and we could not pay our debts and could not borrow money--one of the closest things to a financial crisis for Saudi Arabia, whether or not you like the sheiks--financial jeopardy was when oil prices dropped so low. We were thrilled. What do you think they are going to think when the oil prices finally get up where they are making a lot of money and America is crying for it? They are going to say: Where were you when oil prices got down below 10 and hovered around 10 while we cried? 
   Frankly, I believe if the Vice President's campaign decides that our wonderful ticket for President, because one comes from a mass oil-producing State, and he is proud of it--and the other one, after serving in the highest office in this country, is the president of a 100,000-person corporation that happens to be involved in seeing to it that we continue to get oil and gas in America by working down there in oil patch--frankly, I don't think we ought to assume that this attack makes any sense or that they will do it. 
   I think what we should do is we should attack Vice President GORE as being the mastermind, the promoter of a no energy policy for America, unless it is wind and solar, which all of us think is marvelous but clearly cannot help America through a crisis. 
   I thank the Senator for his comments. I know a lot about nuclear power. I am embarrassed for America that we are doing what we are doing on nuclear power. It is so scientifically unreal and untrue, as to the attacks on nuclear power, and it is a shame. The greatest country on Earth in engineering cannot take high-level fuel rods and move them a little bit across the country and put them somewhere for safekeeping. We can't do that. But 1 out of 25 American ships sails the seas, some with one nuclear powerplant--as they have over there in Pennsylvania. Some have one, some have two. They have sailed the seas since 1954. 
   No more in America--except one in New Zealand that denies these ships with fuel rods safely on board access to their ports. There is no risk. There has never been an accident. Here we sit because a few Americans are frightened to death of radioactivity--low, high, or indifferent; just the word ``radioactive''--while they live in an radioactive environment on average. All of us are exposed to more low-level radiation than most of the things we are afraid of because there is plenty of it around. But because of them, we sit here and cannot find a way to help the State of Minnesota that has fuel rods sitting there from nuclear power which have been as safe as can be, and we can't get enough votes here to move them across the country. Yet those boats with it move all over the world. We sit here with a President--probably supported by the Vice President--who says no. 
   Look, if they like to talk about energy policy, I think we ought to just say: Mr. Vice President, the one thing you take into this campaign is that you have been part of an administration with as bad an energy policy as any because, as a matter of fact, you had none.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know about that. We will build a short-term nuclear waste facility within 6 to 8 months of the next President, if he is a Republican, because it is totally safe. Whether they put it in Nevada or somewhere else, I don't know.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say again, getting back to the energy and water bill, that I hope we can work something out on his issue, an issue that bothers some States on his side of the aisle, while on my side of the aisle, the Missouri Senators and the Mississippi Senators and others, have a different view. There is an amendment to this energy and water bill that attempts to solve that problem by not letting some amendments proceed with reference to a Corps of Engineers manual. 
   If this bill does not become law by October 1, I want to talk about a couple of things that will really be bad for some States, and certainly for my State will not be good. 
   In Pantex, TX, there are 2,800 employees; there are 7,300 at the Sandia National Laboratory; there are 3,000 in the Kansas City nuclear weapons plant. Moving over to water, the Army Corps of Engineers has 125,000 workers on 1,400 projects. 
   This is an important bill. I don't want to go up to October 1 and not have a bill and have to say to them that because somebody would not let us bring up our bill--which we could have done, which we could have gotten passed--we are now at October 1 and can't get anything passed. And we are playing a game of who did what to whom. Who keeps the Government open? Who closes it? We could have had this completed. We could have been in conference this weekend and be back from the convention with it finished. It could then go to the President and be signed. I don't go beyond just asking that the problem be eliminated. 
   I take Senator DASCHLE at his word. There is nothing to this other than he is concerned about protecting a couple of States. I am concerned about a couple of other States or more. I am concerned about keeping in law what has been in the law for at least two previous years. 
   I again thank the distinguished Senator from Utah for his comments. 
   I want to respond for a moment to a very good friend of mine from the other side of the aisle. I consider him a friend. For the most part, we run into each other on dairy issues. People do not know that New Mexico is a big dairy State. But clearly, the distinguished Senator, Mr. FEINGOLD, comes from a State with a lot of dairy cows. We frequently are on each other's side, or against each other, principally because that is a farming issue. But today, in some brief remarks, Senator FEINGOLD took his farming issues, and instead of being concerned about his State, got over into my State and into an issue that involves thousands of farmers in New Mexico. 
   The issue is that thousands of farmers in New Mexico are on a river that runs short of water in dry years. We are growing into a confrontation as to who owns the flow of the river in a dry year, and a silver minnow, which has been declared an endangered species, which they think currently resides in the extreme southern regions of the river close to the Texas border. Thousands of farmers use it to irrigate small and medium-sized farms, and there are a few large ones. 
   I hope, if the Senator's constituents, as he said, are concerned about this, they are concerned about the entire problem--the problem of cities that own water in a dry river basin, and the river basin is not always totally moist and running with water. What about the thousands of farmers who under our State law own the water? I think if he clearly 
   understood that, he would say: I choose not to interfere in a contest between the minnows and thousands of farmers and maybe two cities or more. And maybe he would say: I wouldn't like Senator DOMENICI getting involved in that if that were my State situation. Though he is entitled to and can certainly come down here and do that, I hope maybe before doing it--or maybe even now--he would talk with us about the issue, which is a very interesting issue. 
   For the last 2 1/2 weeks, I have been constantly in touch with the Secretary of Interior seeing what we could do to try to work this issue out. I have put on this energy and water bill something so that water will not be governed totally by a Solicitor General's opinion. 
   That is the issue. I contend it shouldn't be. We might be able to work that out soon because there are some very serious problems involved that ought to be worked out.  
   I thank Senator FEINGOLD for his consideration of issues that might affect my State. I think I have been concerned with his. I would truly like to talk to him about this subject because I don't believe it is as simple an issue as perhaps some of his endangered species constituents indicate in their request to him that he get involved in the issue of thousands of farmers in the State of New Mexico and whether they get water.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with some very distinguished colleagues from both sides of the aisle--Senator WYDEN, who is here, and Senator GRASSLEY, who is not here--who are cosponsors of this measure, along with Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska. 
   Mr. President, let me suggest for Senators' staff who are looking at this to look alphabetically. You will find how much is being reimbursed in your cities for the Medicare+Choice reimbursement. Look at it, and you will see how the HMOs are reimbursed to provide this rather good, fair, and competitive coverage to the senior citizens. You will be astounded. Many people think New York is covered. They are getting a very high rate of reimbursement because they started high. But look at some of the cities in New York. You will find that New York has a number of cities that are under $450. We reimburse them on the high level--as high as $800. 
   The bill we are introducing today we are going to call the Medicare Geographic Fair Payment Act. Week after week, the Federal Government deducts a portion of everyone's paycheck to support the Medicare program. After our seniors have retired and begin to take advantage of the program they have supported for so many years, I think it is fair that they continue to have a choice. 
   Right now they have a choice. But the choice is really not for all seniors because we made a decision when we put in the Medicare+Choice Program, which was really an alternative that seniors could choose. We made a decision as to how we would reimburse the provider. That decision was made based upon, as I understand from my good friend, Senator WYDEN--allegedly based on what they needed to get the job done to get the program going. 
   I don't intend to be critical, but in many instances those who had not been frugal, had not been careful about costs, got high reimbursements. But if you lived in Senator WYDEN's State or New Mexico, where they were being extremely frugal in what they charged for the services, they got a very low rate. 
   It is unfortunate, but for Staten Island the rates of reimbursement are $814; $794 for Dade County--I am not complaining; I am stating a dollar amount--$702 for New Orleans; and $661 for Los Angeles. 
   Senator WYDEN, perhaps, could intervene and tell me what it is in Portland.

   Mr. DOMENICI. $445; Albuquerque is $430, $15 under Oregon. That is all the government will give as reimbursement if you decide to get into the HMO business with hospitals and everybody else joining together, if you are going to furnish this service. Remember, there are some places getting $800-plus. 
   I am not here to take away anything from anyone. That is how our amendment is different. We are not trying to take the pie, leave it the same size, and say those who are getting more money have to cut back. Rural areas are even lower and are expected to provide the same level of benefits or nearly half the reimbursement. 
   There were seniors who had a marvelous Medicare+Choice Program. Why was it good? It was good because for a reasonable cost they were getting prescription drugs, which you don't get under Medicare, and the whole package was new benefits. Some of them got dental insurance, which they don't get. Some of them got a number of different things they don't get under Medicare, for a premium they could afford. 
   These programs are being closed down every day we delay. Thousands of seniors are getting notices. They had a good program, but they won't have it in January. I want everybody to know if there are going to be any entitlement bills getting out of here on anything that is even close to Medicare, this is an amendment that will be on there--or something better. This amendment says by January 1st of this year, the rates are raised. They are these low rates we are talking about. Very simply, under this bill, we will change the rates. 
   It is pretty easy for everybody to understand. This is not a complicated bill. What we are doing is saying for those metropolitan areas which are 250,000 or more, the minimum reimbursement will be $525. If we can't get that through here to preserve some of these plans where seniors are just falling off the log, desperately getting their notices, and raising it to $525, then I don't know what is fair around here anymore. For all the rural counties, we have raised the minimum to $475. 
   My friend, Senator WYDEN, can talk about his State and about his observations. Clearly, he has been asking everybody around here, including the Budget Committee, to have hearings on this great disparity which he calls penalizing efficiency. 
   The truth of the matter is in my home city and in my State of New Mexico, what is happening, the HMO companies can no longer stay in business. Seniors are getting notified. In fact, we don't have a lot of people under this program--15,000 are going to get knocked off the program right now, very soon. If you think they are not going to meetings, they met with Heather Wilson, one of our representatives, and 400 people showed up because they read in the 
   newspaper she was holding a meeting and they already got their notices: Come January, find a new plan. They are asking: Why? The plan is good. It is very good for me. I have been paying all my life. Why are you taking this away? 
   I ask Senators to take a look. In my case, we will get $34 million in additional reimbursements during the first year and $170 out of this bill. Incidentally, this bill will cost $700 million the first year. I say to the thousands of seniors who may be able to keep their insurance and be under this kind of program, that is a pretty good bargain. Over 5 years, it will cost $3.7 billion. 
   It also includes a third provision which I ask Senators to look at. It is the product of some very wise thinking by Senator Grassley. It should have been separately called the GRASSLEY bill, but it is packaged in this as our third title. It says essentially hospitals will hereinafter be reimbursed on labor costs--on what the actual cost is, not on what the stated cost is. That makes the payment to hospitals go up substantially. My small State will go up about $6.5 million over the year. I don't know what it would be in a State such as Ohio, but it would be rather substantial. 
   I have extensive research, with cities alphabetically listed. Just look for your city and see what the reimbursement rate is. If it is under $525, we will take it to $525. If there are rural counties that are not in these lists, call home and ask what some of the counties are getting reimbursed. Raising it to $475 will help an awful lot of people. Is it enough? I don't know. I want to get something done. My friend wants to get something done, as do my two cosponsors. I assume in a couple of days or a week we will have a lot more Senators, bipartisan, asking to be on this. 
   I remind everyone, the total cost of doing a bit of fairness to seniors and ending discrimination by region is going to be $700 million in the first year and $3.7 over 5. We have been talking about astronomical numbers for Medicare reform, prescription drugs. I don't know where we will end up. I hope in the heat of this political 6 weeks we don't do anything major, because it will be wrong, but clearly we have to do something. 
   Come January 1, if we don't put money into this reimbursement program, I think my friend, who has followed this carefully, will say hundreds of thousands of seniors will be denied the option to buy coverage which they think is rather good in many cases, including prescription drugs, for which they only have to pay $50 extra. They can't get that anywhere else. They got extensive coverage of items in their health care needs that are not covered anywhere. 
   I very much thank the Senators who are cosponsoring, Senators WYDEN, GRASSLEY, and BOB KERREY of Nebraska. We will have more.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might suggest--and I do this in the presence of my good friend from Massachusetts; I wish the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. HARRY REID, were here. I have an observation. Maybe I am 2 weeks ahead of time, but I believe the plan is that the Democrats are not going to let us do anything of significance, literally nothing, unless and until they get everything they want. 
   The truth is, for this little period in history--I have been here 28 years, and  it is a small piece of that--the Republicans have controlled the Senate and the House. But the Democrats are bound and determined this year, in an election year, that we are not going to pass the regular appropriations bills, period. They call us ``do nothing,'' but they are obstructionists of the highest order. 
   I will just talk about one bill, then I will talk about the appropriations bill on education. I am just going to talk on one appropriations bill. We have heard from the beginning platitudes about working together to get all the appropriations bills done. The distinguished occupant of the chair has heard they want to get the Interior bill finished; they want to get the Treasury bill finished. For the American people, these are the bills you have to pass every year in order to keep certain big parts of our Government open. It comes down to October 1st, and if they aren't passed, you get the President of the United States talking about who is closing down the Government. 
   I am going to refer to just the energy and water bill. I am going to beg the Senator, the minority leader from the other side, in the same way he pleads with us to get something done that is right. This energy and water bill was not drafted by Senator PETE DOMENICI; it was drafted by Senator PETE DOMENICI and Senator HARRY REID of Nevada, who spends a great deal of time on the floor of the Senate and, I might say, for one who worked with him for years before he got to spend all his time on the Senate floor, he has been a very solid performer. I praise him for his leadership on the floor. I believe he has been fair, and I believe he has been nonpartisan. But I believe what he is seeing he can't even speak about because right down deep in that Senator's mind and heart he knows it is wrong to hold up appropriations bills for the reasons being stated by his colleagues and his leader who compel him to do it. 
   This energy and water bill is being held up. We can't even bring it up because the minority leader wants a provision that is within it taken out. He wants assurance we won't vote on it in the Senate. Who has ever heard of that? Take a provision out of a bill that is in a bill that has been voted in by a committee. And if you want that bill to see the light of day in the Senate, you take out a provision and you don't vote on it in the Senate. 
   I am not familiar with the contents or substance of the amendment, except it has to do with a dispute between the upper Missouri River and the lower Missouri River. But it is most interesting, that the provision that the minority leader speaks of has been in the appropriations bills at least two times. The President has signed it, and it has gone out of the Senate. Maybe something dramatically changed in the meantime, but it has been in the bill. It has been signed. Some who know more than I say it has been in more than two times. I can tell the Senate, since I have been writing this bill, it has been in 2 years in a row. 
   All of a sudden, it isn't enough to have an up-or-down vote in the Senate. The only thing that will suffice is that we take it out and agree not to vote on it. That means if you don't want to do that, you don't get an energy and water bill for this fiscal year. 
   We are getting close because we still have to do this bill. 
   It is different from the House bill. We need to get some new resources assigned to the committee on the House side. We might not be able to make it by the October deadline. 
   This little innocuous title, ``energy and water,'' is a very misperceived title. Energy doesn't mean energy. Energy means all of the nuclear weapons programs in the nuclear laboratories in America. By a strange coincidence, they are in the energy part of this bill. We have been asked by the Department of Energy to put $100 million in new money in that bill to take care of production facilities in three cities, cities such as Kansas City, Missouri; Amarillo, Texas; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Aiken, South Carolina; where we have production facilities that are desperately in need of repair. We have cleanup in the State of the occupant of the chair that is ongoing because of our previous nuclear weapons reactor work. We have hundreds of millions of dollars in for that kind of cleanup. 
   We have all the water projects and dredging projects and flood protection programs in this country in this bill. We have all of the national laboratories and their special effort and all their employees' pay in this bill. I could go well beyond that. 
   Now I come to the conclusion: Why can't we take this bill up? Frankly, if ever there was an issue where there was something besides this bill that somebody has in mind, I have not heard of it. This has to be as bad as it is. What is it? 
   Is there some political issue we don't understand that has nothing to do with the fundamental needs this bill addresses in water, water safety, in dams, in diversions, in the dredging of harbors and, over on the nuclear side, all the safety programs for our nuclear weapons designs, for stockpile stewardship, which is an entire program aimed at making sure our nuclear bombs are safe and sound without us doing any underground testing? We can't turn that on and off and say, wait an extra month, close down the buildings, close down the people for a month or so because we have a little problem about the Missouri River that somebody doesn't even want to let you vote on. It is not a question of whether that provision is right or wrong, it is simply a question of whether you will vote on it. 
   I wonder, if we would have left it out and we would have brought it to the floor and this bill was rocking right along here on the floor and somebody offered an amendment to do just what the committee did because it had done it 2 years before, what would the response have been? Would it have been, you can't do the amendment and you can't move on with the bill? I assume that would be the case. I think we would have a chance of convincing Senators that is not right. 
   I understand there are some other appropriations bills that are being held up. I am not aware of the specific reasons why, so I won't make the same kind of argument or evidence the same kind of concern as I have about the energy and water bill. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts talked about getting our education programs funded. We are talking about two things. We are talking about an elementary and secondary education authorization bill which has gotten tied up in all kinds of problems from both sides of the aisle on amendments. When can we pass it? Can we get agreement? 
   But over there in those new offices beneath the Senate, that are called ``SC''--those offices out there that are really nice to work in--there is a whole batch of House Members. I was in there. I made up a very large group of Senators working on the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. I just have a hunch, from the little bit I have participated, that the White House does not intend to sign that bill no matter what we do. We have already put in that bill resources amounting to $106 billion, the largest appropriations for those functions in the history of the Republic. 
   In fact, there is now in that bill, to be spent on education and other things, $12 billion more than the Budget Committee contemplated. While our numbers aren't binding, the Senator who occupies the Chair knows we reported out a budget resolution, and we assumed all these pieces would fit together. We assumed about $96 billion--$94 billion or $96 billion--for Labor, Health and Human Services. We have now gotten to the point where we have taken from others and we put $106 billion in. 
   From what I gather in that committee, there is little we can do to convince the Democrats to be for that bill. My guess is if it rocks along as it is, it is going to be a partisan bill, and then no matter what we try to do, the President is going to say, ``I want more,'' and the President is going to say, ``It is not a good enough bill''; and he will find some reasons to say it doesn't fund this enough or that enough. We are moving toward a real shipwreck. The issue is going to be, at some point, why are we where we are when we come to that shipwreck point? 
   I am going to start today, and I will watch everything I can, and I will come to the floor. But I am starting today taking just one bill and saying it would appear to me that on the energy and water bill, for some political reason, we can't take it up, and as time passes and moves on, whether or not we can get a bill and do all the things I have alluded  to or not will be in the hands of the Democrats and the President, and then we will see who is to blame. 
   I want to suggest that to the extent we are called ``a Senate that doesn't do anything,'' I believe we have to put another mantra on somebody else and we have to talk about the marvelous obstructionism that is going on by the other side of the aisle. It is being done with such dignity, such ease, with such platitudes about ``we are all working together,'' and ``we are trying to get there,'' and ``we are not trying to delay things.'' It really is that, unless they get their way on everything, there will be nothing moving in the Senate. 
   Now I never saw it run quite like that, and I have never seen anyone ever win an argument on a claim that the other group wasn't doing anything. We will see how it comes out. In the meantime, we ought to try to work together one more time, and I beg the minority leader on this bill--it is $23 billion, not one of the biggest. I literally beg that he reconsider and let us vote and let us have our 2 days of debate. There are about five very serious problems in this bill that will be debated. But they will be debated and done with, just as the Missouri River issue will be debated and finished if they will let us do it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to respond. The Senator from Nevada does so well that I was almost going to come over and sit beside him and say he is right. The fact is, he is not right. 
   At this late stage--when he knows there is hardly a risk of our being able to get appropriations bills finished in a timely manner to keep the Government open--to tie appropriations bills up because a judge has not been appointed is not right. It might be that there is an argument about the judicial appointment, but is it right in the waning days of Congress, when we have about 25 working days left, for somebody to come along and say: Now it is my turn. I will not let any appropriations bills be approved by the Senate unless certain people are appointed to the judicial and judge positions in this country? I think it is not. 
   Second, this is not a partisan issue. I don't know if it is a minority versus majority party issue, because I think in the final analysis there are some people on that side of the aisle who would like to vote on their issue and who may not agree with the distinguished minority leader as to their interests for their respective States. 
   My last point is that we protect minority rights. But I wonder in this case, when it is obvious that Missouri River upper and lower groups are going to argue about this, if it is a question of protecting minority rights. It stands in the way of getting a vote on the issue. If it is important enough to the upper Missouri that they think it is very important but it is also similarly important to those on the lower Missouri, it would seem that the way to settle it is to let our colleagues understand the issue--that is what this Senate is all about--and let us vote. I don't quite understand why we can't vote. I wonder what is worrying people. The Senate expresses its views on many things. It resolves disputes such as this regularly. 
   But, in this case until some future date, who knows when we will not be permitted to express the collective Senate will by voting on this issue--which in 30 minutes could be known by all sides and all parties, and a good decision could be made by the Senate. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Santo Domingo Pueblo is one of the largest Indian pueblos in New Mexico. It is located north of Albuquerque and South of Santa Fe, about midway between the two. For about 150 years, some 80,000 acres have been in dispute with neighboring Indian pueblos, Spanish land grants, and private land holders. Many of these disputes have been in court, but remain unsettled. 
   I am pleased to inform my colleagues that three years of negotiations have produced a settlement agreement. Our legislation would ratify that agreement, thus resolving a complex land ownership situation in New Mexico. 
   The initial Spanish land grant establishing the Santo Domingo Pueblo Grant was issued in 1689. When this Spanish grant was surveyed in the mid-19th century, approximately 24,000 acres of land to the east of the current reservation boundary were erroneously excluded. The excluded lands are now held in private deeds and public lands, but not by Santo Domingo Pueblo. 
   The Pueblo of Santo Domingo purchased the Diego Gallegos Spanish Land Grant to expand its reservation on the west end. That purchase excluded some privately held lands and overlapped with both the San Felipe and Cochiti Pueblos. 
   Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands have also been claimed by Santo Domingo Pueblo. 
   The global settlement we are endorsing, resolves the complex set of title disputes between Santo Domingo, the Pueblos of San Felipe and Cochiti, the federal government, and private land holders. 
   In return for both money and land, the Santo Domingo Pueblo will waive their land claims and remove the clouded title for private land holders. This settlement envisions a monetary settlement of $23 million. Of that amount, $8 million would be payable from the Judgment Fund. The remaining $15 million would be from appropriated accounts over a three year period at $5 million per year, beginning in FY 2002. 
   Approximately 4500 acres of BLM land would be conveyed to Santo Domingo Pueblo, and the Pueblo would have an option to purchase 7000 acres of Forest Service land for the agreed upon price of $3.7 million. 
   Three lawsuits will be settled by this legislation. The first is Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. United States. This case is over 50 years old and was filed under the Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA). In this action, the Pueblo asserts monetary claims against the United States for trespass, lost use, and breach of the ICCA's ``fair and honorable dealings'' provision by the United States. The Pueblo's claims, based on its Spanish land grants, involve more than 80,000 acres of land. Our legislation affirms the compromise award of $8 million for these claims and also includes the Pueblo's stipulated settlement of the ICCA case. 
   The second lawsuit is Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. Rael. This issue stems from the Pueblo's purchase of the Diego Gallegos Grant. The Pueblo sought possession of land from a private landowner in the same grant. The Federal District court for the District of New Mexico entered judgment for the Pueblo. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the Rael action held in abeyance until the Government intervened in Rael or judgment was entered in the overlapping ICCA case. To date, neither has occurred. The settlement legislation will resolve the issues in the Rael case. 
   The third lawsuit to be settled by this legislation is United States v. Thompson. In this case, the United States sought to enforce the Pueblo's title against third-party owners who trace their titles to overlapping land grants. In 1991, the Tenth Circuit held that the United States' claim for the Pueblo was time-barred. The Court of Appeals, however, found that the Pueblo Lands Board had ignored an express Congressional directive in its determination that the overlap lands were not the Pueblo's lands. 
   The Court of Appeals did not resolve the ownership question, again due to the time bar. These overlap lands are currently in the possession of non-Indians and in the Army Corps of Engineers. This global settlement will resolve the ownership questions in favor of the private landowners and the Army Corps of Engineers in the overlap area. 
   The global nature of this settlement will put all these issues to rest. Assuming the Congress agrees with our legislation, the next step would be entry of the stipulated settlement of the ICCA case and dismissal with prejudice of the Pueblo's existing quiet title action in Rael. The Pueblo of Santo Domingo would then receive both the money and the lands agreed to in this settlement agreement. In addition to waiving its ICCA claims and the Rael case, the Pueblo agrees to waive other existing land claims. 
   In this settlement agreement, the Congress would ratify and resolve the Pueblo's land claims with finality and do so in a principled way which serves the interests of all parties. The Pueblo of Santo Domingo boundaries have been in dispute since the mid-19th century. This settlement resolves the Pueblo of Santo Domingo claims once  and for all, and clearly delineates the Pueblo's boundaries. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, first, I thank the distinguished majority leader for the effort he has just made. This is a very good bill and very important to America. It contains all of the nuclear weapons funding, some very important money for the enhanced security apparatus for the National Laboratories that we have all been concerned about. It contains about $100 million to build some of our old, decrepit nuclear manufacturing facilities which are still being used for parts in other things and are held in abeyance in case they are needed. 
   We have a report saying they are in desperate shape. We have a report that some of the facilities we are trying to maintain in the State of Nevada--that are still there from the underground testing--need to be fixed up because they will not be in a position of readiness. 
   We have hundreds of water projects in this bill for Senators. And we wait  to go to conference to even fill in some more. 
   Oh, let me talk about the Missouri conflict. I am not aware of the substance of it, but when the distinguished Senator from Nevada says there are quite a few Senators who are concerned on your side, let me suggest that there are more than quite a few Senators who are worried on the other side--and they are here, and they are there--as to who is being impacted. 
   I hope at some point they would let us fight that issue out. We would be willing to have a full debate on it, if the minority leader will let us. He is a wonderful and hard-working minority leader who tries to put things together. We all agree with that. But in this instance, these provisions have been in three previous bills that I have brought to the floor with my good friend, Senator REID. They have been in there and signed by the President of the United States. 
   To take a bill we worked on diligently, that contains all of these important issues I have just discussed, and say we can't get it done--I see the minority leader. I just said I have great respect for everything he does in the Senate. I just want to make sure that everybody understands, this is a very important bill. We ought to get it done and go to conference. We need some additional resources to get the job done on the water side and other aspects, but we will get a good bill completed. I hope we are not in a position where we will never get this bill. 
   If the Senator insists that it go his way, I think we won't get a bill. I hope at some point he will let us vote, I say to the minority leader. I have told him before and I confirm, I put the language in three times that is in this bill. The President signed it. I would very much like to move ahead. I am not trying to put any untoward pressure on anyone, just to state the problem that I see in not moving ahead.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to lay before the Senate two propositions. One, using a normal conventional budget approach, I want to  share with the Senate the incredible amount of money we are taking from our taxpayers each year, and for the foreseeable future, that the current Government doesn't need. The question is, How much of that extra money we are getting from our taxpayers should we give back to them, and how much should we spend, and how much should we put on the debt? 
   That is a very important threesome, with everybody knowing one of the most significant things to do is to get the debt down. Pervasive in everybody's plan, whether it is a 10-year plan or whatever, is don't give it all back; put some on the debt. 
   Those who know they want to spend a portion of it have to answer the question, Do you not want to give some back to the taxpayer? And a further question: Don't you want to try to fix the Tax Code where it is unfair and where it unfairly taxes Americans? 
   I think the answer would be, if you have a very large surplus, that essentially belongs to the taxpayer--not the Government; it just happens we are putting in more taxes than we need. The question should be, Do you want to fix the marriage tax penalty? 
   I believe almost anyone looking at the American Tax Code and taking into account our culture, what we live by, what we say is powerful about America, has to say that we honor and respect married life along with families. We are not saying it has to be every family structure, but I think nobody should disagree, we surely want to stay there and move in that direction and cherish that concept. 
   If we do, then you have to answer a question: If that is the case, why would we leave a tax on the books that makes it more difficult for married couples to survive economically? We tax the working couple and the married couple more than we would tax two individuals who are not married, earning the same income. 
   That is the essence of the problem. Most married husbands and wives are not quite aware, if they run into two people with whom they have been friends a long time and they have similar jobs to theirs, and the two who have a family are struggling, their friends are paying significantly less in taxes because they are not married. That is what we are asked: Do we have enough resources accumulated in surpluses to do that? 
   Second, there is a very onerous tax called the death tax. Anybody looking at the Tax Code would have to say that deserves looking at, because at a point in time it is no longer considered to be very wealthy; or on an estate that has a lot of assets, citizens can wake up and find out that the Federal Government is going to take 55 percent of the accumulated worth that might have come over 40 years of work. 
   Say you have parents, a mother and father living together, struggling, both working, and they now own two filling stations--I use that as an example--and a very nice house. Today, filling stations are not the little filling stations with two pumps that were on Highway 66 when I grew up. If you were in the business, it was a pretty good enterprise, but you owned two of them because you worked at it. Both of them are in an airplane crash and die. They have five kids, three kids--whatever. What a shock when those two filling stations and the house are worth, just hypothetically, probably in today's market, $1.5 million to $2 million. 
   They are going to get whacked by the Federal Government on everything over $650,000. That is not fair. The Democrats can deny this and talk about all the rich people who are not going to pay, but most Americans say it is not fair to take it away. Believe it; I may get there myself. Things are happening so vibrantly in the American economy, maybe this person is looking at this and says: I might be rich enough for them to take away 55 percent of what I had left and accumulated in my life. So what the Republicans have done is they have said: Let's, over time, get rid of that. Let's take the marriage tax penalty and really take the ax and chop a bunch of it away. 
   There can be two reasons the President will veto these bills, and two reasons that most of the Democrats who have voted against them would use as their excuses. No. 1, they say it is too big a tax cut and therefore it uses up too much of the surplus. They even use the word ``risky.'' What is risky, in essence, to fix the marriage tax penalty? There is nothing risky about that. What is risky about getting rid of the death tax? That cannot be risky per se. 
   So this is what happens. The answer is it is risky because it is giving too much back to the American taxpayer and we do not want to give that much because that is risky economics. 
   I want to make one simple point today and that is for anybody who is listening, wondering: Is there money left for Medicare if we want to do something, small or large, about it? Is there money left if we decide to move in a direction of more defense money each year? Is there money if we were to decide on a little more assistance for education? I will tell everyone you should understand we do not participate, out of the National Treasury, in helping with education to any significant degree. So we have our debates about education but we are talking about 8 percent of the funding for our public schools that comes out of Federal tax coffers. Maybe at one point it was 9, but it is now tottering between 7.5 and 8.5 percent. Maybe we want to change that and make it 2 percent higher. 
   I want to assure everyone, using conventional, acceptable budget analysis, if the President were to sign the Republican tax cuts which amount to $195 billion over 10 years--do you see this chart? You can hardly see the piece in red that the U.S. Government is giving back to the people. See the little sliver? 
   All of this is money set aside for the Social Security trust fund or, believe it or not, a huge amount of money over the decade that the taxpayer has sent us that does not belong to Social Security. Therefore we say: Is that too much? We are calling this the love and death tax cuts. I don't know who nicknamed it that on the floor, but I borrowed it here. Only 5 percent of the non-Social Security surplus will be used over the decade. Five percent will be used for those two taxes. 
   Frankly, I challenge anybody to say to the American people this is risky, giving back that much in tax cuts. All the rest of the money that we might need for anything--Social Security, Medicare--is all the rest of this surplus that is in white. Because that total is $3.15 trillion--trillion--of which we are giving back, under our cuts, $195 billion. You understand, the argument cannot be maintained that it is too big. The only argument that can be made is that we would like to use it for something else. 
   I would like somebody to come down and we can talk about 
   President Clinton's marriage tax penalty relief. It is so small, in his tax package; it is 10 percent of what he would do in his various tax relief targeted measures--10 percent. I believe the marriage tax penalty has to be solved, and it cannot be 10 percent of the tax package that you put before the Congress. It has to take care of the marriage tax penalty significantly, substantially, almost all. 
   Then let's look at this. The Clinton-Gore budget that we got showed 10 years with new spending. Out of the $3.35 trillion, that plan would spend $1.35 trillion, leaving $1.99 trillion. I do not believe we are ever going to spend this much out of this surplus. But even if you gave them all that money, there is $1.99 trillion left, of which we are giving back $195 billion. 
   I truly believe when we really get down to this, in order to make sense to the American people, the President and those who oppose this are going to have to say we really don't believe that a significant portion of this money that is accumulating, that the taxpayer has paid to us, that is in excess of our Government needs--you have to be saying we are not going to give much of it back. I believe that is a terrible mistake. Unless you could say--and nobody could say this--we are not going to touch any of it; we are going to put it all against the national debt. 
   The next time I come to the floor I will tell you how much we are reducing the national debt already. It is the most significant reduction of the national debt, that will occur by the end of this year, for a 3-year period. And there is no comparable debt reduction period in American history; it is so big. 
   So the only answer could be: Wait around for our plan and we will not give the taxpayers back that much money; or they will come to the floor  and say they want to give it all back to the poor taxpayer, the taxpayer who is middle income and poor. Before we are finished, that debate is going to be talked about, too. 
   What we have to do when we have a tax cut, we have to give it back to people who are paying taxes. One would not think that tax relief would mean giving it back, in some way, so the people paying taxes do not get any relief, and those who are not paying, or paying very little, they get some relief--even a check from the Federal Government. To say we think you are paying too much taxes, even if you are not paying any, so we give you back more money--that may be one of the propositions. We ought to debate that for the American people. You can then say the tax relief is going to the working poor. Frankly, you are not giving it to anybody who earns money enough to pay a tax. I thought this all was about tax reduction. I thought the overage was giving back Americans who paid it a little more, a little bit more than what is being talked about by the other side. 
   I close by saying some people think it is a mystery about all this new revenue we have, this surplus, part of which goes to Social Security and part of it is left over. There is no mystery about it. Cumulatively, all the taxpayers who are paying taxes, the American people, the combined amount has increased. Some will come up and say, ``but the median income has not increased, this has not increased, and the tax on these people has not increased''--how does the tax take go up $3.35 trillion? Everybody out there combined is paying more taxes--and is it really more? Yes, it is. On average, America existed and existed beautifully with 18 percent of the gross domestic product coming into the Government as taxes. 
   We are now at 20.4 percent, 2.4 percent higher in terms of a tax take versus the gross domestic product of our Nation, a way to measure what we want to measure, and that is out of the total economy how much are we taking away and putting in our coffers. It is very high at 20.4 percent, and the economy is booming. The reason we have the surplus is because we are taking more from the taxpayers. 
   I believe if it can be understood and if we can get around ads that are confusing the issue and attack ads that have nothing to do with the real problems and issues, if we can boil it down to: Mr. and Mrs. America, if the surplus is this much, would it seem fair to you that we should give back 25 percent of it to the American people by way of tax relief? I think most people would probably end up saying: I guess that seems fair; maybe that is even a little low. 
   That would leave 75 percent of this surplus for the things everybody says we will take care of when we get a new Congress. I submit that we cannot forget the taxpayers as we think about new ways to spend this surplus. We ought to probably start with them, not stop with them at the end of the line. That is what we will be talking about, it seems to me, in the next few months, at least I hope so. 
   Then we can look at whose tax cuts are fair. We will see the other side stack up dollars and say the Republicans give it back to the rich people. The marriage tax penalty relief in this bill, in terms of to whom it goes--if the President of the United States would listen to us instead of listening to the technical advice of the Treasury Department--it is eminently fair; it is loaded at the bottom end of the earnings and yet gives people in the middle- and high-income categories something. 
   If you do not want that, what do you want? Stack up the dollar bills--rich versus the poor--all you want when it comes to the marriage tax penalty, which is a very big and fair tax cut and tax reform at the same time. 
   Obviously, I am on a subject on which I could talk for a long time, and I continue to have a lot of interest buildup in me. Sooner or later, people listening cannot pay attention, and I believe we are getting close to that. 
   I yield the floor and thank the Senate for giving me the privilege of speaking. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am reluctant to say this, but I have to sooner or later. How many items are we going to keep adding and calling them ``emergencies''? We have already passed a lot of emergencies for agriculture. I believe there are emergencies in this bill. I just wonder how many more we can come to the floor with. Everybody should know that when you come here and designate it as an emergency under the Budget Act resolution, it means it doesn't count against anything. If we want to, we can be down here the rest of this evening adding additional items and saying they are emergencies. 
   I don't know enough about this amendment. It is difficult to understand, even though it has been read. But we do know one thing: It costs $900 million. 
   Obviously, there are some who do not want anybody interfering with people's ability to come down here and add money. But I frankly think what we ought to do is test this one out. I don't believe it is the right amendment to adopt as an emergency. I think maybe we will discuss it. Some will decide what it looks like and understand it. I don't know. But I am going to make a point of order that this amendment contains an emergency designation in violation of section 205 of H. Con. Res. 290, the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. 
   I am perfectly willing to have a debate. We have the statute in front of us. If the Senator wants to make a case for the Senate that in fact he has a brand new emergency, it wasn't available to the committee. It wasn't available the last two times we had an agriculture supplemental--a number of which were emergencies for which we paid billions of dollars. I can recall a couple that were $7 billion. One was $6 billion. Then there are lesser ones now that are all supplementals for emergencies for agriculture. I have been told there is no limit so don't bother. There is no limit to those things that will pass as emergencies in the agricultural area. 
   It is kind of difficult when it is an agricultural issue to get up here and say this because there are some in my State; there are some in other States. I am sure when we are through understanding this amendment, they will try to convince us that everybody should vote for it because it affects them. Frankly, even if it does affect them, it doesn't mean we have to determine that it doesn't count. It should count. 
   I have a statute in front of me. I will yield the floor for a moment. Perhaps the Senator from Texas would like to read the statute.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to be very brief. 
   I want to make an observation. I honestly believe that we would be better off if instead of continually adding emergencies for agriculture or anything else, if we were to add more money straight up to the appropriations process. I believe we ought to just ask the chairman and ranking member at the end of this year to add more money. But we ought not to, by the week, add emergencies. 
   I know there are a number of bills--who knows where we will come out on them--that are taking care of problems by adding emergency provisions. I believe the chairman understands, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee understands our problem. I believe Senator BYRD understands our problem. The solution is not to add an emergency by the week, have a bill and then everybody comes running and we say: There is no room for it. Well, call it an emergency and then there will be room because it doesn't count against anything. 
   I want to make another observation about the agricultural community. I probably have the best support or at least as good support as any Senator here from the agricultural community of my State. But I am not impressed with the year-in-year-out emergency requests of the agricultural community of this country. It is approaching the ridiculous. They ask the Budget Committee, put more money in for agriculture. 
   We were pretty skimpy on other things, but we were not very skimpy on agriculture. We provided, and the committee held on to this in the appropriations, a $5.5 billion reserve fund for market losses. As soon as they funded it, the reserve fund was released, and they had $5.5 billion. Market losses are emergencies in the broad sense for agriculture, I guess. I understand that to be the case. People are getting checks because the market didn't work. They didn't get money. 
   We put in a new crop insurance allowance for which everybody thanked us. It was passed, but it was passed even bigger than we thought. And that was all right. That amounted to $3 billion. It is heralded as a fantastic success by people such as Senator PAT ROBERTS of Kansas. We finally did it. Now crop insurance is emergency money. It is a rational way to take care of annual losses by crop insurance, a sharing of the burden by a lot of people. When a crop fails, you have something to help them with. 
   Well, that wasn't quite enough and we knew it. And we heard: Don't hold your breath; there will be more agricultural emergencies. 
   I hope and pray the bill finishes tonight. I wish it would have finished a week ago. Sooner or later, we have to  stop adding emergencies to a bill in the agricultural area. I am not sure that every one of these are agricultural subsidy enhancers. The bill has a lot of jurisdiction. It could be other things. The distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi manages the bill beautifully. He knows what he is doing. 
   I noted also, when he sent these amendments to the desk, he said: I send them on behalf of the Senators that have asked for them. He did not say the chairman of the Agriculture Committee submits these and asks for all of them. I believe he really thought somebody would challenge some of them but he would offer them because he had worked on them to narrow down a request that was even bigger than this. 
   I suggest that we try this on tonight, that we decide that if we need more money and we are going to put it in bills, that we ask the chairman to spend more money. I will not agree with my friend from Texas. It is not the appropriations bills that are going to break this budget. It is not the appropriations bills that are going to cause us to run out of the surplus that is being generated. You can count on that. The increases in appropriations will be wiped out by one entitlement bill. Whatever you expect to be added to appropriations the next decade will be wiped out by the first major entitlement bill that comes along. It will take from the same pot of surplus as appropriations. It is not appropriations that is breaking the bank. 
   I compliment Senator GRAMM for trying to keep us from going wild, but the truth is, it is not appropriations. We don't have any control over it, if in fact instead of asking for the money to be added to the budget and vote on that as grown-up Senators, we added money, and do you want it or not. You will have a shot at that when we add it because we are going to add money. The chairman is going to have to ask us for more money to get the appropriations bill, substantially more. 
   But it will be a heads up add-on. It won't be coming along the way we are here. So when it is appropriate, after asking a parliamentary inquiry, I will make a point of order. What is pending before the Senate right now?

Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for working on this with me and the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee and all those who helped put an agreement together, including TED STEVENS, Senator STEVENS, and those who helped him. I really believe the discussion tonight was a very good one. Whether or not it means anything in the weeks and months to come, who knows? But, frankly, I am fully aware in that list 
   there are some items that are really natural disasters, or disasters of one sort or another that we would compensate for. I just believe that at some point or another in the field of agriculture, and on the agricultural bill, at some point in time adding  emergencies has to kind of end. I submit there would be more than this if it would be 2 weeks from now when the agricultural bill came up. 
   That is my point. I really have a lot of faith and confidence in THAD COCHRAN and his minority ranking member. But I frankly believe sooner or later we ought to just face up and add to the budget and not continue to add emergencies when they are not emergencies. And certainly many of them were. I did not have a chance to look at it thoroughly.

Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the Chairman of the Subcommittee, the Senator from Iowa, and the Senator from New Mexico regarding the establishment of a Bioinformatics Institute for Model Plant Species as a collaborative effort between the USDA Agriculture Research Service, New Mexico State University, and Iowa State University.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The chairman is correct that this cooperatively operated institute would reduce duplication of effort as research institutions across the country find the need to develop bioinformatics systems to validate and disseminate results from plant genomic studies. Three model plant species have been identified by the National Science Foundation, and this institute would incorporate software platforms that will enable the integration of these model plant bioinformatic resources with crop plant bioinformatic resources.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Funding from the Agricultural Research Service will be needed to establish this institute. I understand that with the funding provided for ARS in this bill, that may not be possible. I ask the Chairman if he would assist us in the upcoming Conference Committee to ensure that ARS funding is adequate to accommodate this important project?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   The Senate-reported bill provides $75.1 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $39.4 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. All of the discretionary funding in this bill is nondefense spending. 
   When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $64.2 billion in BA and $46.7 billion in outlays for FY 2001. Including mandatory savings, the subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in both BA and outlays. 
   The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation totals $64.4 billion in BA and $46.7 billion in outlays. Within this amount, $14.9 billion in BA and $15.0 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending. 
   For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all the mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill is $315 million in BA and $6 million in outlays below the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. It is $75 million in BA below and $131 million in outlays above the 2000 level for discretionary spending, and $630 million in BA and $77 million in outlays below the President's request for these programs. 
   I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its 302(b) allocation. I appreciate the committee's support for a number of ongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation. 
   I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator HELMS. He asked if he could speak before me. I said, of course, and that permitted me to hear what he had to say. It was beautiful, and I was privileged to hear it. 
   Most of us are privileged to believe in a hereafter. Frankly, it is difficult for me to conceive of an adult human being with a mind and a heart, difficult for me to see how they do not all believe there is a hereafter. But there is no doubt in my mind that what I believe by faith is true, and there is no doubt in my mind that PAUL COVERDELL is in the hereafter. 
   I didn't come to the floor today to speak about matters of great depth or of religion or faith or hope. I came to talk about the PAUL COVERDELL I knew day by day. 
   Let me first say, it is very difficult to put the flowers and the cloth where they actually belong, because PAUL COVERDELL is not known as much for being at that desk as he is being in this aisle and taking somebody's place in this chair. For most of his time in the Senate, he was either putting together a group of Senators to address an issue or he was trying to get the Senate's work done, because he was asked either by a chairman or by the leader to do it. The more difficult the task, the more it was given to him. 
   When you had an education bill with 200 amendments or a Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill with, at one point, 270 amendments, somebody quietly asked that one of our Senators help. It was almost always PAUL COVERDELL who was asked. He was so good at it and so friendly and could bring people together so well that the chairman willingly accepted his help. I can see the last time he pulled up his coat and was given, after he accepted the assignment, a list with hundreds of amendments on it. The task was: Narrow them down. By the end of the day, they were talking optimistically about finishing. And by the next day, PAUL COVERDELL, not at that desk but walking these aisles and sitting with Senators everywhere, was getting the work done, always being considerate, kind, and understanding. 
   Sometimes we herald Senators because they have been here a long time. I suggest that PAUL COVERDELL and his wife Nancy and those who knew him, those who elected him, and those who supported him must know by now that he was a wonderful Senator. That was not measured by his having four or five terms as Senator, as I have been lucky to do, or my friend, THAD COCHRAN, who sits here, from the State of Mississippi. But he, in a few years, captured all of our hearts and all of our hopes for success. We would transplant them over to him. 
   I came with no speech but with a letter. Two days, 3 days before he died, I arrived at my desk and found a letter. My staff had taken it out of the mail and put it on my desk. Frankly, I left it there not knowing he would die. I was going to read it in due course. Surely, the day that he died, I sat down at my desk and read his letter. 
   The letter is not profound. The letter is PAUL COVERDELL. It is the PAUL COVERDELL who is so considerate that after coming to my office and spending an hour and a half of his time with a staffer of his and two of mine, where he had asked me if I would be of help, he willingly said: I will come to your office. We talked with a couple of my staff who were assigned to him. He did a job for the Republicans in preparing something we needed, and then he wrote a letter on top of all that where he was doing the labor, the work. He wrote this letter:

   Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, that is correct. However, I would note that the emergency needs for on-the-ground work on fuel reduction in New Mexico are very great. I understand that the agencies could use more than $50 million in emergency dollars for projects ready to go in New Mexico by the end of the year. The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program will help promote additional projects for fuel reduction. Considering the terrible toll fires have taken in the state, I hope our federal land management agencies will use as much as possible in this emergency funding to decrease the risk in New Mexico urban-wildland interface communities.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Friday morning, July 12th, the House of Representatives passed the Valles Caldera Preservation Act by a vote of 377-45, and it will soon be signed by the President. 
   Later this month, the Secretary of Agriculture will take possession of the Baca ranch. He will be charged with the task of managing the Valles Caldera National Preserve for an interim period until the Trust is appointed. 
   In order for the Preserve to be opened to the public at the earliest possible time, the Secretary and the Trust will have to complete a substantial inventory, put together interim plans, and provide for the immediate requirements of basic public safety and law enforcement. 
   The Department of Agriculture has provided us with a breakdown of proposed activities over the next year, and estimates that they will need about  $990,000 to prepare the Preserve for an eager public, over half of which will go into planning and law enforcement activities. 
   Once the Trust takes over, hopefully in about 6 months, funds will transfer to them, so that they can take over management responsibilities for the Preserve. 
   The $990,000 will be taken out of the budget of the Department of the Interior Solicitor's office, the bureaucrat who recently issued an opinion to federalize several reclamation projects in New Mexico.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. This legislation contains many positive things for the state of New Mexico and the United  States--both in the programs funded and the changes made to enhance research and development efforts. Chairman WARNER should take pride in his committee's efforts to appropriately allocate defense funding. 
   For the second year in a row the committee was able to recommend a real increase in defense spending by adding $4.5 billion above the President's fiscal year 2001 request. The recommendation of $309.8 billion is not only consistent with the budget resolution it also allows for a 4.4-percent increase in real growth for defense from last year's appropriated level of funding. 
   The committee authorized $63.28 billion in procurement funding, a $3.0 billion increase over the President's budget. Operations and maintenance was funded at $109.2 billion with $1.5 billion added to the primary readiness accounts. Research, development, test and evaluation was budgeted at $39.31 billion, a $1.45 billion increase over the President's budget. These impressive funding levels mark the beginning of a challenging march toward a stronger, better, national defense. 
   Quality of life receives needed attention. I applaud the 3.7-percent pay raise for military personnel, the comprehensive retail and national mail order pharmacy benefit, the extension of the TRICARE Prime benefit to families of service members assigned to remote locations and the elimination of copayment for services received under TRICARE Prime. 
   Military construction is increased by $430 million. I am delighted that projects critical to the productivity and well being of the service members and their families residing in New Mexico have been included in this bill. These are not glamorous projects, they are projects that will replace critical crumbling infrastructure, such as the replacement of the Bonito pipeline between La Luz and Holloman Air Force Base. 
   Five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams were included at a cost of $25 million. This will provide us with a total of 32 Civil Support Teams by the end of fiscal year 2001. These teams are comprised of full-time National Guard personnel trained and equipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological events in support of local first responders. One such team is currently being trained and fielded in New Mexico, ensuring that my constituents have better protection against such attacks. 
   Over $1.0 billion, an increase of $363 million over fiscal year 2000 funding, is authorized for Defense and Energy nonproliferation and threat reduction programs. These programs continue to make great strides in the critical process of securing weapons of mass destruction and retaining scientific expertise in the 
   former Soviet Union. To further ensure that these threat reduction programs achieve their goals, the committee has also included several initiatives to obtain greater commitment and necessary access from Russia. I also will offer an amendment to increase funding and expedite our efforts in restructuring the Russian nuclear weapons complex. 
   Finally, $446.3 million is provided for the defense science and technology program--a 9 percent increase over the President's budget. This funding will focus on the revolutionary technologies to meet challenging emerging threats. 
   Several projects critical to New Mexico's contributions to our national defense are supported by this legislation. The Armed Services Committee approved an authorization of $60 million for the Warfighter Information Network program. Laguna Industries plays a key role in manufacturing and assembling these mobile command and control units needed by active and Guard units across the nation. 
   The committee also authorized $94.2 million to fully restore the Airborne Laser, ABL, program funding. The Air Force's ABL program is the only missile defense system currently contemplated that would strike and kill missiles in their boost phase. 
   The Tactical Higher Energy Laser, THEL, was authorized at $15 million for FY2001. THEL represents one of the first weapons systems being tested that utilizes high energy lasers for the purposes of missile defense. The THEL program has been funded through a cost-share arrangement between Israel and the United States, with TRW having also made substantial investments in the program. 
   I strongly believe that lasers will transform both our offensive and defensive military means in the years to come. We should fully support these programs and address shortfalls in the science and technology funding in these technologies to ensure more rapid development and fielding of high energy laser weapons. 
   The committee also authorized $49 million in additional funding for activities of the Air Force Research Laboratories at Kirtland Air Force Base, including $5 million for the Scorpius Low-Cost Launch program, $15 million for Military Space Plane, and $5 million for the Solar Orbit Transfer Vehicle Space Experiment. 
   The Big Crow Program Office was authorized at $7 million by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Big Crow represents a unique electronic warfare test and evaluation capability used by all of the services to ensure their weapons can perform as needed in realistic warfighting scenarios. 
   An authorization of an additional $3 million will ensure continuation of the important blast mitigation research at New Mexico's Institute of Mining and Technology. New Mexico Tech houses our Nation's experts in terrorist explosives and is developing innovative ways to protect against this threat. 
   While I appreciate the committee's attention to these and other important programs, I believe that more must be done to ensure the directed energy science and technology is better coordinated and sufficiently funded. These technologies can assist in our defense efforts against some of the most prevalent threats confronting us. I will also be offering an amendment to this legislation that I believe will go a long way in achieving these goals. 
   In 1998 I spoke before this body and stated the need to start the new millennium by stopping the ebbing tide and ending the lengthy decline in defense spending. This year I am grateful to see the chairman and his committee have made the crucial step of maintaining, and improving on, the FY 2000 increase in defense spending. We must not flag in our efforts to support a strong national defense. The committee has recognized, as do most of us concerned about our national defense, that combat readiness of our Armed Forces must not be at risk. Our soldiers, and our country, deserve a national defense budget that is in keeping with international uncertainty and growing threats. Our soldiers and U.S. citizens are counting on us.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to make a point of order very shortly. I think the Parliamentarian will agree that it will be granted unless a motion is made. They are going to have to have 60 votes to waive it. It is good on the part of the Senate to have such rules. 
   To give a little history, in the Budget Committee we were talking about $20 billion for Medicare over the next 5 years. My recollection is that the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, offered an amendment and they took it all the way to $35 billion. A little while later in the process, with Senator WYDEN helping, a bipartisan approach was taken in the committee and we said $40 billion--$20 billion if you don't get any reform and $40 billion if you get some reform--in the first 5 years. 
   Everybody should know that the President asked for $31 billion. The budget resolution provides $20 billion plus $20 billion, which is $40 billion. And then, everybody should know that the President's proposal doesn't take effect for 3 years, until 2003. All of a sudden, when the year is about over, we have somebody proposing not to spend the $35 billion that Senator LAUTENBERG wanted, not the $40 billion that the bipartisan Senators did in a budget resolution, which everybody thought was a very wonderful idea--in fact, Senator SNOWE and Senator WYDEN led that in the committee, as I recall; is that correct, I ask Senator NICKLES?

   Mr. DOMENICI. It was their proposal. Now they say forget about all that; they want $80 billion. We want to rewrite a budget resolution in July of the year, instead of months ago when we were writing budget resolutions. All of a sudden, they want $80 billion set aside for Medicare and prescription drugs. 
   If ever a point of order was not only correct under the law, but, substantively speaking, right, so that we don't spend the whole Medicare fund and end up with more burdens on the fund than we can pay for, and have some prescription drug program that starts 3 years from now, it is now. 
   I feel very comfortable in saying to the Senate that you ought to stick with the Budget Act and the budget process. In the end, the seniors will be glad you did because their children will be protected. There will be a Medicare program around for an awful long time, and we will reform it in a way that can be sustained, that we can afford, and of which everybody will be proud. 
   If I have any time before I make the point of order, I yield it to Senator NICKLES.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have raised the point of order on this amendment. Let me just recap for you. 
   Not too many months ago, we produced a budget resolution. There was debate in committee. We started at $20 billion as a good starting point to reform Medicare and provide some prescription drugs. Just to show the sequence, the ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG, thought we ought to have $35 billion. Before we finished, a bipartisan solution was crafted by the distinguished Senator from Maine, as I recall, and the distinguished Senator from Oregon. It was heralded as the solution. It was $20 billion to reform, $20 billion for prescriptions. Everybody said, ``Good.'' 
   That is in effect. When somebody comes to the floor tonight, with a few days left in the session, and wants to rewrite the budget and change that to $80 billion, I say the seniors know we just cannot continue to have this kind of bidding. We will bankrupt Medicare ultimately and we will not get the kind of reform we need and we will be holding out to them a bankrupt system, but we got prescription drugs. Incidentally, the President thought we could do it with $31 billion, and he would not start it for 3 full years. How do you like that? 
   All of a sudden, we have the solution to all the problems, and the solution is, not $20 billion, not $35 billion that Senator LAUTENBERG wanted, not even $40 billion. It is $80 billion. 
   The point of order is real substance in this case. Seniors know we should not be doing this because of their future and the children's future. We should not be trying to raise the ante on the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think almost everyone has heard the name Dr. Milton Friedman. I would like to start my brief remarks by quoting this very distinguished Nobel prize winning economist, who notes:  
   The estate tax sends a bad message to savers, to wit: that it is OK to spend your money on wine, women and song, but don't try to save it for your kids. The moral absurdity of the tax is surpassed only by its economic irrationality.  
   You could stop there and say no more, and ask, do we really have a tax on the books of the United States that will lead Americans to waste their money rather than save it to leave to their children? And then to be add the economically irrational absurdity. One could just read that indictment and conclude that it is a good source of information, a Nobel winner in economics, a splendid proponent of entrepreneurial capitalism and what makes it work and what detracts from its working. Dr. Friedman's quote could be the sum and total of my speech. I could stop there. 
   But let me proceed on with a couple of facts. These are real. It does not raise very much money. It is a big trap for the unwary. It is viewed as the most confiscatory tax, with its rates reaching 55 percent, and if coupled with the generation-skipping tax, the practical effect of the tax is that it can grab as much as 85 cents on the dollar. I do not believe we in America ought to have any tax on the books that can take as much as 85 percent of any dollar, earned or owned, by any American. So that is the debate. 
   It hits a diversity of people. Two groups most adversely affected are small businesses and family farms, which are absolutely frightened of the concept that at a point in time when they most need their managing partner, when the business or farm needs its key person the most, that key person has died, by definition, and up to 55 percent straight on--without generation-skipping trusts protecting children--55 percent of the estate would go to the Government. 
   There are all kinds of excuses and explanations. It is payable over time. 
   Yes, some would say: Thank you, Federal Government, as you take 55 percent of everything we saved and earned and built up; it is generous that you let us pay that 55 percent over time. 
   I do not know if that means anything. It probably means the Government got to the point where it was absolutely absurd trying to make them pay that 55 percent all at once because the horror stories were so rampant that Congress would say: What are we up to? After listening to that for a while, they made it payable on the installment plan. 
   Again, my own sense of what this does and what my constituents have told me is consistent with Dr. Milton Friedman: The Estate Tax penalizes savers. Someone who is getting old may have accumulated an estate perhaps made up of a nice house, a nice summer cabin, and may own two filling stations. Try that on as to whether they are a real rich person: A really nice house, a summer cabin, and two filling stations of the modern type today. They are going to pay a huge amount on the appraised value of that estate, and let's add to it that they saved and have $50,000 in the bank. All of these assets were acquired with money that had already been taxed as income under the Federal income tax. 
   It is a double tax; I do not think anybody would doubt that. Nobody would come to the floor and say it is not. Assets are purchased with after-tax dollars and then taxed again under the estate tax. 
   The approach in the bill before us is a very fair approach. There are some who think the bill allows rich people to avoid paying taxes. It does not. The change is a timing change. Death would not be the taxable event. Instead, a family business or farm or other asset inherited would be taxed when it is sold, but it is not a giveaway, as some allege, because the basis for calculating the tax at the time of the sale would be the same as if the original owner had sold it. It would be taxed on a carryover basis. 
   That means, to make it very simple, if your entire assets are three warehouses when death occurs, the three warehouses have a value at the date of death, but they are not taxed then. When one or two or three of those warehouses are sold by the inheritor, they pay a capital gains tax using the original value, which might have been the value 10 or 15 years ago when the asset was first acquired. 
   If they make a very large amount of money when they sell it, that is taxed as capital gains. It is changing the taxable event from the date of death that triggers the tax to the date of an actual sale by one who inherits it. That is the event. 
   It seems to me when everybody has that understood--some of the people who are saying this is not a fair approach, and some Americans who have been listening might say, Is this really fair--they will come down on the side that this is a much fairer approach than taxing on the value on the date of death. 
   I compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee for his fine work. He is correct that this is one tax that should be abolished. This is a good and  fair tax policy, and it moves us toward tax simplification, which, in and of itself, is commendable and something we are always trying to do with our Tax Code but succeed rarely. We talk much and succeed rarely.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk about some other things that should be abolished. Last week, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued a two-paragraph memorandum that he calls a legal opinion. In that memo opinion, he attempts, in one fell swoop, to overrule New Mexico water law and the rights that are established under New Mexico water law which are called the rights of prior appropriation, the cornerstone of water rights, and the right to use water and how to allocate water when water is stored. 
   In that same opinion, as I view it, he has abolished our water law and nationalized the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, one of the largest irrigation districts--if anyone has flown over Albuquerque, that big green belt is the Rio Grande, and anything you can see in Albuquerque on that part of the river is part of the conservancy district. That conservancy district is not, as the Solicitor said, ``an agent of the Federal Government.'' He is going to have plenty of time to prove that for he is going to be challenged in every court wherever we can, and perhaps even in the Congress, on whether that is an appropriate conclusion. 
   Let me tell you about the creation of this Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District and its mission. 
   First, it was created by the State of New Mexico by our State legislature in 1923. It was the Conservancy Act of New Mexico. It was not created by the Federal Government. It was created by New Mexico. It owes the Federal Government no money. It paid off its last rehab and construction loan in 1999. 
   Solicitors at the Department of Interior or any other lawyers just do not walk around nationalizing assets. In some countries, dictators do, but certainly it is not the way we do things in America. 
   The partial effect of this memo is to overturn New Mexico and western water law. In our State, water is a precious commodity. I wish we had more of it so it would not be so precious, but it is precious and we have too little of it. 
   In New Mexico, we have endangered species. We have more than one, but one lives in the lower reaches of the Middle Rio Grande River. We have a silvery minnow. And in the river right over the mountains is a blunt-nosed shiner. I wish we had fewer endangered species and more water--that would be very good--but such is not what has been dealt New Mexico. 
   We have a water rights system, and it essentially is a seniority system. This Solicitor ignores that basic premise. Adding insult to injury, the matter was already before our Federal courts, and on June 19, 2000, Interior Solicitor Leshy issued a brief opinion stating that the Bureau of Reclamation, the entity that manages some of the water, has title to the water in this Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. How he will ever make that stand up I do not know, but I hope there are judges left who will get to the heart of this issue and determine that is not a policy nor is it fact. 
   In October of 1999, the Bureau of Reclamation biological assessment stated the bureau did not have a controlling property interest in this Middle Rio Grande conservancy facility. 
   On Thursday, the Albuquerque Bureau of Reclamation area manager sent a letter to the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District that they operate as agent of the United States and should operate its ``transferred works'' allow 300 cfs of water to bypass San Acacia Dam on the lower river for the silvery minnow. 
   This places all the burden on these farmers and none on the rest of the users, which is inconsistent with New Mexico law again. This places all the burden on this one group. 
   The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District's position is that providing water for the fish should not all be borne by their water 
   users, i.e. the farmers. The burden should be shared. There are many big water rights holders including the city of Albuquerque. The Bureau of Reclamation countered that it has title to the Conservancy District's water so it can claim it, but that it does not have authority to take the Albuquerque city's water because it is other people's water. 
   New Mexico says that the Federal Government must comply with State law and get a permit to change irrigation water to water for fish habitat. It further admonished that the Federal Government has no authority to interfere with the state's interstate delivery obligations. I believe the federal government's strategy is to divide the parties, as well as to avoid a hearing on the merits of the biological need for wet water for the fish. 
   To conclude, if we are ever to have cooperation to preserve this endangered species, the silvery minnow, this is exactly the way not to do it. There was a burgeoning working together, cooperative group. I was part of it. Many environmental groups were part of it. 
   We were looking for a way to collectively and collaboratively create some habit activities, and then construct some habitats for this minnow, and to do it with the full assistance of the Federal Government. Along comes this Leshy opinion and out the window goes all that. Now it is full speed ahead with litigation on all sides, and people working in the Congress to see what we can do to be fair. 
   If I have not used all my time, I yield whatever I have to the distinguished floor manager, the Senator from Wyoming. I thank the Senate for the time given me this morning.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I can engage in a discussion with the distinguished chairman, Senator SLADE GORTON, on the bill before us.  
   By way of some opening remarks directed at the fine, excellent job he has done on this bill, I want to talk with him for a moment about what we have done for the U.S. Government-owned-and-maintained Indian schools in the United States in the Interior appropriations bill. 
   First, when we are finished supplying the numbers for the RECORD, which are obviously in the bill, it should not go unnoticed that this is the first time we have substantially--and I mean substantially--increased the money for the construction of Indian schools owned by the U.S. Government. Let's not be confused with public schools. These are schools that if the Federal Government does not pay for, I ask my chairman, nobody will pay for them, right; they belong to us?

   Mr. DOMENICI. And they are maintained by us. As the accounts will show, not only are we in a terrible state of disrepair, in terms of those schools that need management money, but we have a huge backlog of schools that should be built--that is, built anew--because the facilities that Indian children are occupying are truly intolerable. 
   Thus far, have I stated what the Senator from Washington has attempted to accomplish in this bill?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Is it not true one other major function of activities that we must do in behalf of Indian people has to do with health care, wherein we have hospitals and medical facilities that are run by the U.S. Government for the Indian 
   people? There, again, we have just been barely getting by in terms of keeping them open and properly maintained, and they are rather good medical facilities, I say to the American people. It is not like the public schools that we are ashamed of because they are in such disrepair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The Indian schools, yes. They are in such a state of disrepair. Indian health is in pretty good health. In this bill, the President asked for substantially more money, and we were able to fund a substantial increase in Indian health money in the Interior appropriations bill; is that correct?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for a period of about 4 years, I was joined with bipartisan letters that we sent to the President of the United States and to the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs saying: Will you please put in your budget a 5- or 6-year proposal to pay for the great backlog we have in Indian school construction which, I repeat, only we can make. It is not a question of somebody being generous or kind in building an Indian school. These are Indian schools we own, we operate, and we pay the teachers--we being the United States of America. 
   The President, after a visit--not the last visit he made to Indian country which was to New Mexico, but one just before that, which was his first visit to Indian country as a President--came back and talked about doing something to enhance economic development--that is, jobs--for Indian people. 
   I was very privileged to be at the White House and discuss the issue with him personally, after which time we joined with a bipartisan group of Senators and put together a package that strengthened our construction and maintenance of schools, that did somewhat more for Indian health and a few other things. The aftermath of that was the introduction of a bill, and the aftermath of that is the bill on the floor which increases funding in these very important areas. 
   In closing, the funding in this bill, which essentially resulted from that meeting in the White House to which I just eluded, and then joining a bipartisan group of Senators, really is not going to move us much in the direction of better jobs in Indian country for the Indian people. All of these things that I mentioned are a necessity. 
   Essentially, there is something basic that the Indian leaders and local communities and the National Government are going to have to do that will make the climate in Indian country better for private sector job growth. I do not levy any criticism at anyone individually, but it is quite obvious that tax credits alone will not do it, for we did that 4 years ago. The most extensive tax credits were passed to give Indian communities a chance to bring in private sector jobs. It is still on the books. It is a huge tax credit per Indian employee. We passed accelerated depreciation at the same time. If somebody builds a plant, they get to accelerate the depreciation much more rapidly than if they were next door in non-Indian country. 
   The problem is that the combination of all of that has not worked to create any large acceleration in the number of Indian people being employed in Indian country in permanent jobs. 
   I submit it will take a kind of a change in the attitude of Indian leaders. I think they are beginning to understand that. Businesses will not go even to an Indian reservation in America with tax credits and other benefits if, in fact, they are not satisfied with the business climate on the reservation; that is, if they can go 50 miles to a community off reservation and believe they have a lot more certainty of law, more certainty with reference to rules and regulations, they are not going to be coming to Indian country. 
   I have been urging that the Indian leaders, while they claim their sovereignty, understand that every government entity that claims sovereignty, from time to time, shows that sovereignty by giving up a little bit of it, by waiving a piece of it, or by entering into an agreement where they share responsibilities with another unit of government, frequently called intergovernmental agreements. These things are going to have to happen if we are going to bring jobs to Indian country. 
   There is much more to be said about it. There are many people who have tried, and I do not know just when it will work or when it will start working to any significant degree, but I am confident that this year we took a giant step in terms of the public responsibility. There are things moving around, either at the White House or out in Indian country, that are trying to move this whole attitude issue in a direction of business feeling more comfortable on Indian country. 
   I thank the chairman, again, for the bill with reference to the Indian people and I thank the committee that worked with him to bring it here. 
   Having said that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, Senator CRAIG, that under our Constitution this body was enacted to have two Senators from every State. I hope every State is concerned with what happens in other States. I will be the first to admit that it is very easy not to pay attention to the speech the Senator just made because, obviously, there are whole States--many of them--that don't have this problem because they have no vast public ownership in the midst of their cities, out in their countrysides, or built right up against communities, be it the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service. So there is a tendency not to pay attention when a couple of States come to the floor and show some very dire problems that exist in the management of the public domain. 
   I have a few issues today that won't all be raised on this amendment I will offer. But before the Interior bill is finished, I will talk about some very serious problems out in the Southwest, which is more than one State. Over the last 3 or 4 weeks, New Mexico has had its share and then some. So I want to talk about, first, a substitute that I am going to offer, which the distinguished Senator CRAIG understands I will offer. I hope we can vote on both his suggested amendment and the one I am offering as a substitute. 
   But I think we have come to the conclusion--he and I and others--that if we can pass the substitute today and have it go to conference with the distinguished chairman and ranking member supporting it in the manner that it will receive support in the Senate--which I think is rather overwhelming--we will be satisfied that that is a good day's work and something that is very important for the forests of our country, which many Senators don't know about because they don't have any public forests. But they can take it from a group of us that the forests of the United States, whether they are run by the Forest Service or whether they are run by the Bureau of Land Management, are in terrible shape today. 
   Of course, there are people in the country who can talk about how they got that way. But I say to my good friend from Illinois, I know he doesn't have time, but it would be a pleasure to take him out to some areas surrounding Santa Fe, NM, or the areas that our good friend, Senator FEINSTEIN, will talk about in her State, or that Senator BINGAMAN has observed as he toured Los Alamos. The fire there and the fire on the other side of the State took almost 30,000 acres. It would kind of pale in comparison to that incendiary on the top of the hill that almost burnt down Los Alamos. 
   Let me tell you the reason we are offering this substitute. It is because there is an emergency existing in our forests that has to do with cleaning up the forest so that we can lower the threshold for fire. Anybody paying attention to the 48,000 acres that burned around Los Alamos would quickly come to the conclusion that the forest was almost like a storage of gasoline on the ground in barrels, and that when a fire started, it was just like gasoline burning because we never cleaned the forest. All over the place were knocked down trees with debris and trees that were so close together that if they started burning, it was just like the wind. The wind was blowing at 35 to 45 miles an hour in both of our fires. With the hazardous waste on the ground that we never clean up because either we don't have enough money, or there are certain people in the country who 
   fight even cleanup, where you take the small logs in the forest and you take the kindling that has been accumulating and take it out of there and either control burn it or let it be used by those who can find usage for that kind of a resource. 
   So we have a substitute today that is called the Hazardous Fuel Reduction Act. We are asking the Senate to find that an emergency exists out there in our forests. I am very pleased to say that a number of Senators concur that there is an emergency and that we ought to put some money up in the state of emergency and get on with cleaning up these forests. 
   I thank my cosponsors today. We have done this without a lot of work because I have to do this rather quickly upon my return from New Mexico, seeing that the city of Santa Fe, NM, could possibly burn because the community is in direct contact with the forest. The watershed for the city of Santa Fe, which many people like to visit, is right up in the mountains and is filled with kindling and with hazardous waste waiting to burn. So what I have done is ask a few Senators to join me today. I will quickly summarize what we are doing. 
   The Senators who joined me are from both sides of the aisle. On the Democratic side, we have Senator FEINSTEIN and my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN. On the Republican side, in addition to myself, we have Senators KYL and CRAIG. I am sure Senator CRAIG would quickly indicate with me that if we wanted to circulate it, we would get many more Senators. The point is, we want to get this disposed of on this bill and not cause a great delay for the two distinguished managers. 
   Let me say up front that we don't change any environmental laws. We have worked at this, and we have had everybody work at it. We have not modified NEPA and we have not changed any other laws of that type in this measure. This measure will allow the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to use all current authorities for fuel reduction treatments. It will give new authority for using grants and cooperative agreements for fuel reduction. 
   It is at the sole discretion of the Secretaries. There is nothing mandatory about it, that they can provide jobs to local people in the local communities for fuel reduction activities. 
   In my State--which might be different from California--there is a very huge built-up desire on the part of people living in the rural communities of New Mexico to want to join in partnership through their communities and put people to work helping to clean up the forests. 
   There is nothing in this substitute that says we are going to log the forests. Yet if there is an opponent who comes to the floor to argue against this by some who do not want it, they will  say it is just another way to log the forests. If anybody says that, read the amendment. I don't choose to read it today, but it does not do that. In cleaning the forest, they will cut some small logs, but it will be pursuant to a plan which will show that the primary reason for all of this is to get rid of some of that hazardous fuel that has been piling up waiting to be burned. 
   In addition, the Secretaries will be able to include in some of this work nonprofits and cooperative groups, such as the YCC, or other partnerships and entities that will hire a high percentage of local folks. The Secretary has to publish a list. 
   The other things were options and discretionary. This one has to be published by September 30, identifying all urban wild land interfaces. 
   That is what we are worried about--not the whole forest, the interface, the communities at risk from wildfire, and, identify where fuel reduction treatment is going on, or will start by the end of the year. Then by May they will have to say why they have not and cannot treat the rest of these communities where the interface has occurred. For any reasons not limited to lack of funds, they will have to state why. 
   Finally, the Forest Service has to publish its cohesive fire strategy, which they have in draft form. They haven't published it. They will have to publish it and simply explain--not delay, but just explain--any differences in current rulemaking and how the new policy of closing roads could impact with firefighting. I know they don't want to do this. 
   The truth is that is the only way the public is going to find out how conflicts are occurring and whether they should be resolved or whether we should leave them lingering out there in a state of combat, ending up almost daily with lawsuits filed with one side trying to beat the other with some select group of environmentalists in nature most of the time filing these lawsuits. 
   I repeat that there is nothing that exempts environmental, labor, or civil rights laws. There is a lot of permissive language in here and very little that is mandatory. 
   But from what this Senator has seen of the forests after these two enormous fires, it is pretty obvious that the professionals will want to employ these techniques to get started where the interface of communities with forests have occurred to some major degree.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, many of you for a week or more watched on the nightly news as the forests surrounding Los Alamos National Laboratory, America's most renowned scientific laboratory, in spite of some of the negatives that have come forth with reference to security--that laboratory which has supplied us with the very best by way of science expertise and nuclear weapons expertise, not the second best, but the best for the entire era when it was America versus the Soviet Union--we watched each night as that fire got closer and closer to that laboratory. In fact, it burned some buildings, albeit none were critical to the future of the laboratory. 
   We watched it move literally huge distances at night when the winds were blowing. We watched it go from an adjoining forest called Bandelier National Forest. We watched it grow from a tiny spot where park people had impropitiously started a fire to clear away a piece of land. They started with their torches, and there it went out of control--48,000 acres, 440 residences burned to the ground. When you go back and look, you see that these forests were in desperate need of being cleaned so that the kindling on the surface would be at a much, much lower temperature. 
   That brought forth from this Senator and others a very significant cry: Let's get on with doing some of this cleanup. Let's give them additional authority in this bill and some emergency money. Let's see if we can get it done.  
   I thank the cosponsors. I thank the chairman for his attention and for his giving me confidence to offer this amendment because this is the appropriate vehicle. It is my hope that Senator SLADE GORTON will support this measure before we are finished.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank everyone. There have been so many people working on this amendment. It has boiled down to a page and a half, but it is a very good amendment. It will permit the Forest Service and the BLM to do a lot of things they otherwise would not be able to do. 
   I am very thrilled today. I had originally nicknamed this bill ``happy forests'' because I thought maybe if we cleaned them up and took all this gasoline, using that figuratively, that is waiting around to burn them down--I thought they might just smile; they might just be happy forests. I want to say that is going to be the title of the bill. It has another fancy title. But when it passes today, let us just put in the RECORD, Senator DOMENICI is going to call this the happy forest bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator DURBIN, I apologize for not being present on the floor when he gave what is always an eloquent speech, which he also did in this instance, with some very marvelous background information. Since that graphic is so alive, I suggest that the Senator should know when the vote starts he has to take it down. 
   In any event, the good Senator from Illinois said there is no good reason to continue to support the Domenici amendment from last year. Incidentally, on an up-or-down vote on the Durbin amendment last year--he will get up and say it is a different amendment, but essentially it is the same issue--58 Senators voted against Senator DURBIN in favor of the Domenici amendment and 37 voted against the Domenici amendment, and 5 did not vote. I am looking at those who did not vote on the Domenici amendment, and I think the numbers will get more lopsided, I say to the Senator from Illinois, because more of them will go my way than his way. 
   So we want everybody to understand that we still need what we needed last year. I will answer the rhetorical question, which was, there is no good reason for doing this again. I will say, there are 1,300 good reasons to do it this year, for there are 1,300 Americans--some in my State, some in the State of the Senator from Montana, some in the State of the Senator from Wyoming, but there are 1,300 permits that are still not done, and those are for the years 1999 and 2000. We have 2 1/2 months left in 2000. But there are 1,300 permits backed up for processing that are not completed. 
   Let me make sure that in just a few minutes everybody understands what this means. 
   If you were to come around 5 years ago or 6 years ago and ask, what is the issue with the National Environmental Policy Act and the grazing permits--as I told my friend from Illinois last year, it did not exist because nobody thought that renewing a grazing lease qualified under the National Environmental Policy Act--get this--as a major Federal action. 
   But it has happened in this administration. They have concluded that these 10-year leases we give to ranchers, which are policed by the U.S. Government, are subject to NEPA. Be it the Forest Service rangers or the BLM rangers--they police these permits. They see that they are managed right. That is their job. 
   Incidentally, during that 10-year lease, if they violate it, they are penalized. If they do not take care of things, they get their allotment cut. It is not operating in a vacuum. It is operating all along with the rancher trying to make a living and the Government saying: Do it right. 
   Then here comes this administration and it says: Why don't we make both Forest Service permits and BLM permits go through a National Environmental Policy Act review for each and every one. 
   I can tell the Senator, they heard from me then, but all they heard from me were two things: One, it really isn't needed; and, two, if you are going to do it, you will never get it done on time. 
   I turned out to be right on both scores because, I say to the good Senator from Illinois, in my State, for each and every NEPA evaluation that preceded a lease renewal, about one from my entire State was changed significantly. That means across the board, 99 percent-plus of the time, the NEPA analysis found nothing needed to be dramatically changed. 
   As I said to the administration way back then, NEPA analyses aren't needed. And then secondly, I said: You will not get them done on time. 
   Lo and behold, 2 years into that process, we started getting letters from ranchers and property owners saying: Look what is happening. They are making us do a NEPA statement, but they have not done the work yet, for the Government does the NEPA statement. They have said: What is going to happen when our lease expires? 
   Nice question. The administration could say: We are not ready to give it to you because we have not done the environmental impact statement on each and every grazing lease, which almost everybody looking at the land says is unnecessary. But let us conclude that they had authority administratively to impose NEPA. Incidentally, they never got authority from Congress. Senator Scoop Jackson was the author of the NEPA law. 
   It would be very interesting if we could ask him from his place, wherever he is on high: Scoop, did you ever think that a grazing lease renewal was a major Federal action under your law? And I swear, if he is listening, he is turning over in his grave because ``major Federal action'' meant a major Federal action, not renewals of every single lease on the grazing lands of America, which are thousands. 
   Nonetheless, when I offered my amendment last year, all it said was: Look, Federal managers, because of your own fault, you did not get the NEPA work done. Here is all the money you need. How much money do you need? I remember in the Interior bill they asked for more funding. The distinguished chairman gave them that money, so they had no more complaints. They got every bit of the money they needed to do it. 
   They set about to complete each and every impact statement on leases that were expiring. The problem is, they have not gotten it done yet. All we said is, since you are the ones that are supposed to get it done, and you did not get it done, then you renew their lease. Give them the renewal, but write in this law and on that renewal that as soon as the NEPA work is finished --get this, my good friend, the Presiding Officer--as soon as the NEPA work is done, whatever your conclusions are, you have a right then to impose them on the permit. 
   I have every confidence in the world, since I believe only one lease in New Mexico had any major changes made because of NEPA, that this law that I am asking to continue again--because they are still behind--will do no damage to the public domain. 
   Let me make it very clear. There are some marvelous environmental groups in the United States. They have taken on some fantastic causes. Albeit they  do not like my voting record, that is all right with me. I like some of the things they have done. I do not necessarily ask how they want me to vote before I vote. I saw too much of that when I was a young Senator. 
   I saw Senators come to the floor, knowing little or nothing about it, who said: How are the environmentalists positioned on this vote? 
   They would say: They are an aye. They would vote aye. 
   I just do not happen to be one of those Senators. I am kind of proud of that, to be honest. I do not think anybody should come to the floor and say, I better vote with them. I hope I am informed before I get here. 
   In spite of what I just said, and that some of the brightest Americans are leading these environmental groups, believe it or not, I say to my fellow Senators, they have made this little amendment a major American environmental test. Using my name, they have spread it far across the country: The Domenici amendment is calculated to destroy the public domain, to let ranchers ranch without having the Federal Government oversee their growing malignancy which is destroying ranchlands. 
   I say to my friends, it did not destroy any because they did not find anything wrong on most of them. There is a chance they will not get completed on time, and we just ought to stay where we were last year because there are too many Americans who are desperately afraid of the arbitrary action that can be imposed on the rancher by lawsuits. They are afraid of arbitrary actions of people who represent the Federal Government. 
   They kind of cry out to us, when we go meet with them, saying: Just don't do another thing to us, not giving us our lease renewal, when we had nothing to do with the reason for the denial. 
   I can't put it any more succinct. That is the way it is. 
   I urge every Senator to do something very simple, and just send a word back that the proof in the pudding is that the NEPA reviews are not saving the public domain. They are just costing a lot of money, taking a lot of time. At least we ought to say to the ranchers who manage well--which is the overwhelming number--we are not going to hold you hostage out there and do what the distinguished Senator from Illinois recommends, which is that it is no longer mandatory that you proceed in a manner that the Domenici amendment last year said. That law allowed the renewal and then, in due course, when the NEPA analysis is finished, act accordingly, with the Government losing no rights. He would say the Government may do that if they want to. 
   Everybody should know, if you turn the amendment into a ``you can do it if you want to, Federal Government,'' you know what is going to happen, at least for a while: The environmental pressure on the Department will be great enough that they won't do it for anybody. A ``may'' will turn into ``thou shalt not.'' 
   I don't think that is fair. I have high regard for the Senator from Illinois. We were just talking before this debate, saying maybe one of these times we are going to be on the same side. I was thinking, if that happened, we might just overwhelm the Senate. We might get 99 votes. 
   In any event, I am sure hoping he doesn't get 99 votes tonight. I am hoping I get the same number I got last year, maybe even a few more who have thought about it a little bit. Those who understand that it is kind of ridiculous to claim this amendment that DOMENICI put in this bill is going to wreak havoc on the public domain. 
   I will go anywhere to debate this issue with anyone as to whether this justifies being a major environmental issue. If it does, we must not have very many environmental issues around. They must have paled from the horizon if one of the major environmental issues in America is this issue. This is an issue where the Government doesn't do its work and therefore can't give the rancher a 10-year permit renewal, which he might be completely entitled to. The agency just hold them in abeyance and says: When we get through with our work, we will give you a lease. In the meantime, maybe you will lose your financing. 
   A lot of Senators know about ranchers and financing. I wonder what the banks would do if their leases were not as certain as they have been because the BLM or the Forest Service can just say maybe we will be able to renew the permit. 
   I have spent a lot of time on the floor between the happy forest and perhaps the happy solution to this environmental issue. We will have a vote pretty soon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, let me say the idea of putting posters around has proliferated. I don't think we ought to add more to the confusion of a vote by having them around. I had no intention to pass judgment on the validity of your exhibit, which I find very difficult to interpret and rather irrelevant, but besides that, I don't have anything to say about it. 
   Let me say, why strike a provision that the Federal Government's inaction cries out to be left in this bill, which was signed by the President last year? I might even tell my friend from Illinois, can you believe it, I talked to him personally on this issue because he wanted to understand what the hoopla was about. I will not paraphrase him, but he signed the bill with this provision in it. It does no one any harm, and nothing has happened to say it has hurt the environment in this past year. And this issue has nothing in the world to do with how much ranchers are paying. 
   If we ever get into a debate upon the issue of, are they getting a great deal from the Government, I will bring from my State name after name of ranchers who are just not even making a living on the Federal domain today. Whatever price he suggested, they just can't hardly make a living under the rules and regulations of the U.S. Government. 
   That has nothing whatever to do with this issue. The assertion is not correct that the BLM has to leave correctable degradation in place and issue a new permit while damage could continue on the property. Read the amendment. Whatever power the Bureau of Land Management has, it keeps. That means if they issue a permit and they had the authority to make a correction to its terms to fix a problem, they still have it. Nothing is missing. 
   This provision lets the rancher feel a little more comfortable. He is not as denuded and vulnerable by having no permit until they get ready to issue it to him after they finish processing, which in the past would have taken a couple of years, maybe 2 1/2 years. Now BLM is getting closer to finishing processing of all the expiring permits. I am glad. The amendment is working. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in strong support of H.R. 4578, the Interior and related agencies appropriations bill for FY 2001. 
   As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee, I appreciate the difficult task before the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member to balance the diverse priorities funded in this bill--from our public lands, to major Indian programs and agencies, energy conservation and research, and the Smithsonian and federal arts agencies. They have done a masterful job meeting important program needs within existing spending caps. 
   The pending bill provides $15.6 billion in new budget authority and $10.1 billion in new outlays to fund Department of Interior and related agencies. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account the Senate bill totals $15.5 billion in BA and $15.6 billion in outlays for FY 2001. The Senate bill is at its Section 302(b) allocation for BA and $2 million under the Subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation in outlays. 
   I would particularly like to thank Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD for their commitment to Indian programs in this year's Interior and Related Agencies appropriation bill. They have included increases of $144 million for Bureau of Indian Affairs construction, $110 million for the Indian Health service and $65 million for the operation of Indian programs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. It is good to see you, Madam President, and to be back today. I just arrived from New Mexico, which accounts for my failure to put a more conventional tie on, but if I took the time to do that I would have missed an opportunity to speak on this issue. 
   I am going to take a few minutes to discuss the way I see the matter, the pending nomination of Madelyn Creedon for Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration for Defense Programs. 
   Let me start by suggesting that everyone should know, and I believe the nominee understands, that she does not work for the Secretary of Energy. She works for the new National Nuclear Security Administrator for Defense Programs within the Department of Energy. We might hearken back to only a few months ago when we had a very lengthy, multiday debate with reference to what we should do to reorganize the Department of Energy in the aftermath of the Wen Ho Lee incident, and a very major report by the President's most significant security group headed by former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. 
   They recommended, and we adopted by law, a total reorganization within the Department of Energy of the matters that pertain to nuclear weaponry and nonproliferation on the basis that the Department of Energy had been built up just topsy-turvy and we had, within a very dysfunctional multilayered department, a most, most significant American concern, to wit: the nuclear weaponry of America. Believe it or not, a Department called Energy is in charge of the nuclear laboratories that produce all the science with reference to nuclear weapons and the three or four sites within America that used to produce weapons when we produced them. They are now part of a very dramatically changed effort called science-based stockpile stewardship, which means we are going to make every effort to make sure our nuclear weapons are safe and secure without ever doing another nuclear test. We are trying diligently to do that. 
   Now we have a new department within the Department. Let me repeat that, because we are having so much difficulty getting out the message that we have already created a new entity, just let it start working. It is called the National Nuclear Security Administration. It is a hard name. In fact, I remembered it by carrying around to hearings a coffee cup that had ``NNSA'' on it. Then I was able to remember the name. But across the country they were all asking about 6 weeks ago: What are we going to do in the aftermath of Wen Ho Lee, finding some other secrets that had been misplaced in very peculiar circumstances? 
   The first thing we ought to say is that we have already done something about it. We have created a semiautonomous agency that, in the not too distant future, will be running all of that. We have already selected the person in charge, thank God, a very distinguished general--that means he is a four-star--who was with the CIA, worked at Sandia National Laboratories and was an adviser to two Presidents on security. He has agreed to take this job. In other words, he will be running, within the Department of Energy, under his own power, all the nuclear weapons activities. This nominee will work for him. 
   It was very important that we find out, since he did not select her, whether he wanted her for this job. I would think that would be the most logical question we would have; if the new man, General Gordon, who is going to run this, was not part of her selection and she was going to be his deputy, we surely ought to ask: Do you want her? 
   So I am first reporting to the Senate that I had a responsibility of finding that out, because she also wanted to know. 
   I can report to the Senate that he said: As matters are going now, I would not want to stand in the way--in fact, I will support her confirmation by the Senate. So let's not expand much on that. Let's just say that the man for whom she will work, because he is going to be in charge of all this--she is not going to be working for the Secretary of Energy--has said: OK, even though I did not pick her, let's try her. 
   I also want to tell the Senate that she had a lot to do, staffwise, with opposing this new law. She was the one helping Senators who opposed the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration. So I have talked with her at length and I have said: Will you enforce this law? And she said: I will. 
   Do you understand, you are working for the general who runs the new National Nuclear Security Administration? 
   She said: I do. I work for him. I will try to help him be a success. 
   Do you understand that the Secretary of Energy has created a number of positions that violate this law, to wit: He has put dual-hatted some people to work for him and the new man, when Congress did not intend that? 
   They intended that all the people who worked for the general worked only for him, not the Secretary; that there not be 10, 12, 14 people who worked for both of them. 
   She said: I understand that. 
   He said: Did you hear the Secretary of Energy say he would fight that no longer? 
   She said: I did. 
   Did you hear him say he would support amendments to totally clarify this so there are no dual-hatted people who worked for both the Secretary of Energy and the general in charge of trying to create some decent management within our nuclear weapons complex, including the laboratories and the manufacturing centers and the nonproliferation activities that go with the laboratories? 
   She said she understands that. 
   Everybody seems to be on board. 
   The problem is the general was just sworn in. There were a few months of  delay for various reasons, not the least of which was that right after signing the bill into law, the President and Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, did not seek to implement the law very quickly. As a matter of fact, they went very slowly. 
   We are now at a point where the general is in office, and he needs to build his team. She will be part of his team. If Senators are worried about whether she will work in that regard, they can vote for her or against her. I did not come to the floor to fight her nomination because I satisfied myself that she understood the law and pledged to enforce it and understood she worked for the general, not for the Secretary of Energy, for the foreseeable future. I do not know how long she will be in office. I do not know how long he will be in office, although we intend to make his term a 3-year term. 
   With that, and given this background, I will vote for her. I am clearly of the opinion she has sufficient talent and expertise based on background and who she worked for and what she did. I do say it will be very challenging, based on her experience, for her to truly help this general make this work because she will be working for him, a very distinguished American retiring from the Air Force where he was a four-star general to undertake this job. It was a true act of patriotism on his part. He decided to take one of the most challenging jobs in Government, hardly understood as of today. But I assume that if it all works out, he will be very well known in a few years. If it really works out, he will be known for having set the nuclear weapons part of our Government on the right path, with the right management, not only with reference to security--for that will be his job also--but he will set it on a management path that something as refined as our nuclear weapons should have in place for the American people. 
   That has not been the case. There have been at least three major studies just crying out for us to fix this, the last one done by the President's board on national security matters, headed by Warren Rudman with four other distinguished Americans, recommended this, and we helped draft the first law. We had five chairmen on the Republican side sponsoring the legislation which worked its way through the Senate and through the House and has now created this semiautonomous agency that I just described to the Senate and to those who are interested in where the security is going to come from for the nuclear weapons complex and our laboratories. 
   We have created a whole new management effort. It is not going to be setting new boxes within the Department of Energy, which I have predicted will never work, but rather a total semi-independent agency with its own national administrator who will have total power and control. 
   For those who are fearful of this, we have indicated on the environmental side that they must comply with NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act. But as to other rules and regulations, it is clear they can make their own, consistent with good judgment, 
   preserving and protecting the safety of our nuclear weapons and preservation of these great National Laboratories. 
   We banter around the security problems that have occurred, but everybody knows, since the Manhattan Project, we have always had the best--not the second best--we have had the very best laboratories in the world in charge of our nuclear designs, the nuclear weapons breakthroughs, and Los Alamos has always been the leader. 
   They are having problems. Instead of saying, here are new rules we are going to pass in Congress, let's just make sure we are going to give the new administrator of that semiautonomous agency, General Gordon, everything he needs to take it out from under the dysfunctional Department of Energy and run it in a semiautonomous manner as described by law. 
   Madelyn Creedon will be a big part of that. I came to the floor to speak so she will know that many of us have a genuine interest in this working, and we will have our minds and ears and eyes wide open and paying attention, and the Secretary of Energy knows we will, too. We want this general to have as much as he needs to do this job right. She will be his first assistant. Everybody should understand it is a big job. 
   I do not need anymore time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can I make sure the Senator from Michigan and I have one thing clear because he has been so honest with me once we got past this problem? We are both going to see to it, to the best of our ability, that the semiautonomous agency, as created by law, is carried out. He told us that the other day when he was meeting with Republicans. 
   I am very pleased because I think we all have to watch it. Clearly, General Gordon is going to need a lot of help. I think the Senator from Michigan would concur it is not easy to set up a semiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy. He told us: Let's go. And so did Senator LIEBERMAN: Let's get it done. Is that a fair assessment?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of how the United States Department of Labor is administering Grants for Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities. 
   Both the FY 1999 and 2000 Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill contained earmarks critically important to New Mexico's economic well-being. The earmarks were directed toward training workers for the State's rapidly growing technology-based call center industry. 
   In fact, the industry is generating in excess of 450 jobs per month that pay approximately $11 per hour with substantial benefits in New Mexico. These grants would allow for the continued expansion of this industry by allowing the New Mexico Consortium to create a training curriculum that will lead to employment in the call center industry with an emphasis on the placement of hard-to-employ individuals. 
   However, the Department of Labor's actions regarding these earmarks has left me deeply distressed by the ill treatment New Mexico has received, especially in light of the priority placed on this issue by not only me but, the Committee as well. 
   It is also my understanding the current program year for the Department of Labor ends this Friday, June 30th and that there may be unobligated funds left over at that time. It is also my further understanding that in the event there are such unobligated funds the Department could provide some of these funds to a deserving program, like the training program in New Mexico.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critical importance of mental health research. 
   The human brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other organs of our body, it is subject to illness. And just as illnesses to our other organs require treatment, so too do illnesses of the brain. 
   With this in mind, I think that it is appropriate to be discussing the benefits of mental health research as we have just concluded the ``Decade of the Brain.'' During this time we witnessed breakthrough achievements like new medications and brain imaging techniques that have provided innumerable benefits for so many Americans. 
   Just last year, I dedicated the National Foundation for Functional Brain Imaging at the University of New Mexico. The Foundation's purpose is to advance the development of magneto-encephalography, or MEG, technology that provides real-time imagery of neurons as they operate within the human brain. 
   As we explore functions of ``normal'' brains, as well as brains of individuals suffering from severe illnesses, we may well be on the brink of exciting breakthroughs for mental illness treatment. 
   Moreover, one only needs to look at the amazing research being done by the National Institute of Mental Health to realize how far we have really come over the past decade. And finally, the close of the decade gave us the first ever Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health entitled, ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General.'' 
   However, even with these fabulous advances we must still maintain our vigilance and continue our support for research so even newer and better breakthroughs are made by our nation's researchers. 
   For instance, about 5 million individuals in the United State suffer from a severe and persistent mental illness. Nearly 7.5. million children and adolescents suffer from one or more types of mental disorders. 
   There is a final area I would like to touch upon and that is children. While researchers have already made fantastic breakthroughs in the area of mental illness, research for children still remains incomplete. 
   We must continue the excellent work already being done, like studies seeking to understand the basic mechanisms of brain development and comparisons of effective treatments for specific illnesses. 
   Additionally, scientists have already established preventive steps that can be taken that are effective: Genes are identified to see if a child has a predisposition to a certain illness and if so monitoring begins. In conjunction with that, a calm environment is sought for the child and early stage drugs are administered if appropriate. 
   I would submit the key for not only children, but adults is the continuation of research that will allow us to realize even greater breakthroughs that will enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses of a mental illness. And I firmly believe the key to ensuring continued discoveries through our research is to continue providing our nation's researchers with adequate funding.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about a pending national disaster. 
   Mr. President, I want to discuss something that is unfortunately not part of this fire package. For over a month, I have been working intensely with other Members and the Clinton Administration trying to begin to address a serious problem that in the West has been highlighted in stark terms by the events that happened to the community of Los Alamos in my state, as just one example. What happened to the homes and families of Los Alamos is unfortunately going to happen again unless we, as a Congress, can convince the Clinton Administration to join us in bold and deliberate actions. Throughout the United States there is an increasing amount of land in what natural resource scientists and firefighting experts call the ``wildland/urban interface.'' With more people moving into the West, and more homes being built in communities surrounded by federal lands, neighborhoods like those that burned in Los Alamos are becoming more numerous. 
   At the same time, as a consequence of decades of fire suppression as well as years of increasing drought, many millions of acres--by the General Accounting Office's estimate, 39 million or more acres--of national forests are at high risk of wildfires. They are in this situation because fuel loads have risen to dangerous levels and forest management has been dramatically curtailed at the same time. The escape of the prescribed fire in Bandelier National Monument, and its subsequent effect on the town of Los Alamos make it clear, as Secretary Babbitt has already conceded, that in many places prescribed fire is not a viable management tool to reduce fuel loads. It is particularly risky to use in the wildland/urban interface because of the presence of homes and families. 
   Therefore, joined by others Members on both sides of the aisle, I worked over the last few weeks to provide the Administration with both the resources and the tools to begin an accelerated program of fuel reduction in wildland/urban interface areas for communities that are at risk throughout the West. We suggested a number of proposals that the Administration found too hot to handle. For instance, we asked whether the Council on Environmental Quality would designate this an emergency situation and expedite NEPA compliance for hazard fuel reduction activities in the wildland/urban interface. The Administration representatives said no. They felt that this would be too controversial with national environmental special interest groups. They pleaded with us not to pursue this option. 
   We asked whether they could suspend administrative appeals for these hazard fuel reduction projects. That would eliminate one source of delay. Anyone who wanted to stop one of these  projects could still go directly to federal court. Here again, the Administration said no. They urged us not to propose suspending appeals because it would be met with opposition by national environmental special interest groups. 
   We suggested the use of stewardship contracts to do fuel reduction work. A stewardship contract is one where the government can trade the value of any merchantable material removed through a fuel reduction project against the cost to the government of the fuel reduction activity. This is an authority that would be very useful, but that the federal government presently lacks. Here again, the Administration felt that there was too much national environmental special interest group opposition to stewardship contracting. They urged us not to pursue this option. 
   Throughout this discussion we told the Administration that we would be sensitive to their concerns, as long as they would commit to us that they would not treat this crisis in a ``business as usual'' fashion. We weren't simply going to give them more money and say we had resolved 
   the problem when we know that isn't true. 
   Finally, Senator BINGAMAN and I came to an agreement on the additional tools and resources that we would provide the Administration while being sensitive to their concerns. We wanted to increase fuel reduction activity by $240 million. In the course of doing that, we were going to direct the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture to use all available contracting and hiring authorities under existing law to do this work. We were also going to provide the Secretaries with authority which they now lack to do some of this work using grants and cooperative agreements. We asked the Secretaries, at their sole discretion, to do this work in a way that would provide jobs to local people, opportunities to private, non-profit, or cooperating entities, such as youth conservation corps, and opportunities for small and micro businesses. 
   We must begin a serious dialogue throughout the West about the severity of the problem that we face. In order to accomplish this, we directed the Secretaries by September 30 of this year to produce a list of all of the urban/wildland interface communities, within the vicinity of federal lands that are at risk from wildfire. In that list, we asked the Secretaries to identify those communities where hazard reduction activities were already underway, or could be commenced by the end of the calendar year. We further asked the Secretaries to describe by May of next year, the roadblocks to beginning hazardous fuel reduction work in the remaining communities on the list. 
   It was our view that this would provide an opportunity to commence a very necessary dialogue: (1) among communities at risk, and (2) between the affected communities and the federal land management agencies to gain some consensus on approaching this problem. That was the intent of directing the Secretaries to produce these lists. 
   It was also our hope that, as communities recognized the degree of risk, they would match some of the federal contributions with their own money and effort. This would get the work done even more quickly. 
   Regrettably, I must inform the Senate, including Members from western states who have communities at risk, and some burning now, that the Administration rejected our proposal because they thought that ``it might encourage logging.'' Now remember we weren't talking about wilderness areas. And we weren't talking about roadless areas either. Nor were we talking about areas of special significance for ecological or wildlife values. We were just talking about the federal lands adjacent to communities. We were talking about the woods next to subdivisions. We were talking about places like the city of Los Alamos, or people burned out of the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico. We could have easily have been talking about Santa Fe, New Mexico, or Bend, Oregon, or Sedona, Arizona, or Missoula, Montana. We could have been talking about neighborhoods in each of those cities, and many dozen more scattered throughout the semi-arid, western states. 
   Even though we were talking about these kinds of areas, the Administration was much too concerned with offending environmental special interest groups to move aggressively and effectively to reduce fire risks because it might involve encouraging logging. 
   Well this is a tragedy. And it's a tragedy that will be repeated as the summer progresses. It is a tragedy that will probably occur each week until the snow falls later this year. 
   I want to advise the Senate that when you next look at footage of forest fires on CNN, just remember that the Administration didn't want to address this problem because they were afraid it might encourage logging. When you look at footage on CNN of burned out forests, dead and dying wildlife, and devastated watersheds, just remember that the Administration didn't want to address this problem because they were afraid it might encourage logging. When you see footage on CNN of burned-out neighborhoods, destroyed homes, devastated families and ruined lives, just remember that the Administration didn't want to prevent this problem because they were afraid that by doing so they might encourage logging. And next winter, when you see the first CNN footage of dramatic flash floods in watersheds that were burned-over the previous summer, and you see homes buried in the mud, just remember that the Administration didn't want to prevent that problem because they were afraid it might encourage logging. 
   And finally, when you're forced to see it up close, when it affects a community in your state, when you're not just watching it on TV, but actually meeting with the citizens of your state who have been burned out of their homes and their neighborhoods--just tell them that the Administration didn't want to prevent the problem from occurring because they were afraid it might encourage too much logging. Just tell them that the Administration didn't want to prevent the problem from occurring because they were afraid of the national environmental groups who claim to want to save the environment. Maybe then the Administration will realize that they should have been afraid of what would happen if they did listen to the national environmental special interest groups. 
   The publicly owned forests of America are not very happy today. I intended to put on the supplemental bill a provision that I was going to call ``happy forests.'' That is a strange name. But it is either happy forests or it is what we have today. What we have today is a philosophy that seems to say to the forests of our land: Burn, baby, burn. That is the theme. 
   The administration fears logging and it is frightened to death when anyone suggests something that might sound like ``logging.'' It is all right if they keep their policy not to cut anything going, but it is not all right where the forests of America come in contact with communities. The interface between communities, buildings, churches, and the forests of America is just crying out while waiting for a forest fire that will devour communities and burn down buildings. 
   I have a city in my state called Santa Fe. Everybody knows of Santa Fe because it is a great place to go. The mayor recently has taken many people to see the forests around Santa Fe and the community. Santa Fe is frightened that their watershed is going to burn down. It is right up against the community and provides its water. That watershed will burn down while the U.S. Government sits in its ivory tower and says don't do a thing that might look like logging, might smell like logging. 
   Even on this bill that we have before the Senate, which provides emergency fire relief, the administration ended up rejecting, after negotiating for weeks, language that would have helped thin forests to protect communities. This was a small, but very necessary, program. Before we are finished this year, the American people are going to have such a fear about the forests burning down they will support a policy across this land of thinning these forests in the interface with communities and buildings. 
   We had a fire that cost the Government over $1 billion in Los Alamos, affecting our laboratory and the people that work there, because the Interior Department started a fire, a ``controlled burn'', on a national monument  right next to Los Alamos. They didn't follow the right rules, didn't have the right weather; they did everything wrong. The little fire got to be a big fire and the U.S. Government burned down 48,000 acres, put 400-plus families out of their homes by burning them to the ground. The Cerro Grande fire burned almost $200 million worth of Los Alamos scientific buildings. We are lucky that the whole community didn't burn to the ground. 
   Sooner or later, we are going to have to get serious and pass the kind of legislation which would have been on this bill. The administration called it a rider. The distinguished newspaper, the Washington Post, today argues against riders on this pending bill. They said one of riders removed encouraged ``timbering.'' I ask the editors to read the language. It did not encourage timbering. It said thin the dangerous forests where communities are at risk, and it provided great limitations. It encourages the use of locals in rural communities, and give jobs to their young people, to clean out the forests in the summer. 
   This committee of appropriations is willing to get it the program started. This administration said we will veto this whole bill, even as far as defense of our Nation goes, if you put something in that changes the way we are doing things on federal land. 
   A panel of experts recently visited the watershed of Santa Fe, NM. They made a statement. They are frightened that watershed will burn down because the area hasn't been thinned and nothing is being done to the forest land to keep it from turning into a tinderbox.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friends who have spoken to this, there is a novel position in this legislation I think you will like. I am not sure it was not what brought certain environmentalists to the White House, along with some others. There are so many people such as mayors and councilmen in communities who ask us: Look. Right over there are all these dead trees, thousands of dead trees. They say: Why do we leave them there dead? The longer we leave them in that position, they are going to turn more and more into additional fodder for fires. What good do we get out of dead trees, just sitting there? 
   Actually, what we are going to say when we finally get around to passing this is that the U.S. Government, which owns that property has to, in writing, tell that community why they cannot thin that forest, and what is holding up action. It is going to be interesting. This should become law because, sooner or later, I am going to ask the Senate to vote on it. We ask something that is very understandable and makes common sense. 
   But you see, if you are holding fuel reduction up for a year and a half for a NEPA statement on land that just has dead trees on it, somebody is going to say: Why don't we hurry up? Why does it take so long? 
   Getting that information is going to be part of this process of trying to get action. We should be saying to our forests and the communities abutting  them: We want you to live together. We don't want one to burn the other one out. And you cannot promise them that if you do not thin those forests. 
   With that, I am finished, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much. I hope I don't use all of the time and that I can yield Senator BROWNBACK time because he started this great discussion with his amendment, on which I support and commend him--the Ashcroft Medicare lockbox. 
   I have a pretty good suspicion that sometime soon it is going to be adopted by the Senate. The Senator can take great credit, being one who from the very beginning wanted to have a lockbox on Social Security--and even joined in the real lockbox bill, which, incidentally, was not the lockbox we are considering for Social Security today. He has been on the cutting edge of new ways to save both the Social Security trust fund and today on the Medicare HI part of the trust fund. 
   I rise to talk a little bit about the Social Security lockbox. 
   First of all, everybody should think for a minute. What kind of lockbox must the Democrats have when they have resisted a lockbox five times? That was a lockbox we came up with that the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, introduced with me and others. And five times the Democrats have resisted it and have  not let us pass it. That ought to put up a little bit of a question: what is the difference between the two, since all of a sudden today on an appropriations bill--which probably means amendments are going to go nowhere other than to make a little racket here--we have two distinguished and good colleagues of mine adopting a Democrat lockbox for Social Security. 
   First, let me change that to six occasions when we have offered a lockbox we put together. Most people who check for a real lockbox, in the sense of what that word means, say ours will do it and that others are questionable. Others are, in one degree or another, more easy to use in terms of violating the lockbox and spending the money elsewhere. 
   The reason they are different is that ours is real. In the very sense of a lockbox written into law, ours is real. 
   Let me essentially tell you what we did. We calculated where the debt of the United States would be if all of the Social Security money were left in, if we knew the numbers, and if we put in law and statute the level of debt each year for the foreseeable future. 
   Then we said that statute locks that money in, except in the case of war or the case of economic emergency--we defined that as most economists do--and great national disaster. 
   That is a lockbox. In order to spend it, we have to have a statute, a law that will change that level of debt that is related to Social Security. 
   My friend on the Budget Committee, Senator CONRAD, has for a long time been a proponent of making sure we have the debt down, and I commend the Senator. He has been concerned about Social Security, as have many of us. 
   Essentially their lockbox is an invitation to waive the lockbox or, by a 60-vote majority, get rid of it. Thus, whatever you want you spend. 
   I urge, instead of the lockbox they have before the Senate, serious consideration of accepting the lockbox that Senator ABRAHAM, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator ASHCROFT have tendered on six occasions. It is truly what the senior citizens deserve when speaking about lockbox. We should not be telling them it is a lockbox, but it can be waived simply on the floor of the Senate. 
   How simple is it? We have just waived, for the two bills before the Senate, the Budget Act, which precluded doing what they were doing. We got up and said: Let's waive it. We could reach the point where we want to spend Social Security and Members could come to the floor with a vital program and say, just as we waived the Budget Act in order to take this off budget, let's waive it to spend it. 
   If you do the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lockbox for Social Security, you have to introduce a bill, say we want to change the debt limit as Social Security impacts it. Frankly, I am very proud to have come up with that idea. I think my friend from Michigan would acknowledge I came up with it. I am very proud of him. For a long time, he has been trying to get that voted on. He has told people what he was for, as Senator ASHCROFT has. We have not had a vote. 
   We tried six times to get a lockbox vote, and we were denied it by this institution, by our fellow Senators on the other side. Then all of a sudden, on an appropriations bill, with a pretty positive chance that the amendments aren't going anywhere because we cannot pass this kind of an amendment on an appropriations bill when it gets to the House--you can take it out the door and send it to the House, but you are pretty sure if it is not dropped before getting to the House, it is probably dropped when you open the doors to the conference because it does not belong on this bill. I am not suggesting that either amendment is being offered knowing full well it is not going anywhere, but I am asking why doesn't the Senate vote on the real lockbox for Social Security. 
   We are going to have our vote today. I am wondering whether the Senator might give consideration to offering the real lockbox and see where we stand. I ask Senator ABRAHAM what he thinks of that idea in terms of being a chief proponent.

   Mr. DOMENICI. One last point in reference to the Medicare lockbox off-budget proposal that my friends on the other side of the aisle have offered. 
   There is a giant loophole that we have never considered in the Social Security trust fund lockbox, nor is it considered in their lockbox on Social Security. Current HI law permits all kinds of additions on the expenditure side of Medicare. 
   If we leave that language in, we are opening that trust fund instead of closing it. When we take it off budget we open it to spend it, which, to me, seems almost inconsistent with why we are doing it. 
   I am not going to vote for either of the Democratic lockboxes because I think the Medicare does not work and the Social Security is not a real lockbox. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. For 10 years, we have had a written proposal with reference to the lockbox for Social Security and never have we put in language that said what their Medicare lockbox amendment says, that the surpluses can be used for spending related to the programs currently in HI. As a matter of fact, we have used the money for Social Security with a lockbox, a ``verbal'' like theirs, that never included such language, and we have spent the money on Social Security. 
   What I am saying is this is an invitation to expansion and spending, rather than an invitation to protecting it. We could be making HI less solvent under this language rather than more solvent.

   Mr. DOMENICI. He and I are going to share a little time. 
   Before I do that, I say to Senator DASCHLE, believe it or not, I was the first Senator involved in genome. Whether people know it or not, it was not the National Institutes of Health that started this program. It was the Department of Energy. In fact, the National Institutes of Health did not want the program, and a very distinguished doctor left them and went to DOE. They came to me. The first bill was introduced and Senator Lawton Chiles funded it. That is the origin, which I am going to talk with my friend, Senator SESSIONS, about in a minute. 
   Let me suggest that I don't know what is in the Senator's amendment. But I do know from the very beginning that there has been concern about the effect of discrimination. I don't believe we should go from being concerned about the effects of discrimination to a 30- or 40-page bill that we--how big is it? Ten. Frankly, we need to make sure that what we are not doing is putting genome research into a vulnerable position where it is not stable and people do not know precisely what they can do on it. 
   That is all I have to say about the amendment. 
   I yield to Senator SESSIONS for a question.

   Mr. DOMENICI. But whether it is Congress or the President, someone should recognize formally a Ph.D. named Dr. Charles DeLisi, the dean of engineering at Boston University. In the year 1986, he left the National Institutes of Health in protest over their unwillingness to proceed with a genome project of national significance.  He went to the Department of Energy. He said there were a lot of big brains in the Department of Energy, and maybe they would listen and come to the same conclusion. 
   They were researching genetic projects because they were charged with deciding the extent of radiation incapacity generationally as a result of the two bombs that were dropped in Japan. The Department has all the scientists. He went there. They put together a team in DOE. I am very fortunate because they came to see me. They said: Why don't we do this since the National Institutes of Health doesn't want to? Why don't you 
   start it? 
   I got a little tiny bit of a bill through, saying the DOE will run the program. That was the beginning for the National Institutes of Health. As soon as they saw the bill introduced saying DOE would do it, they came running to me saying: We told Lawton Chiles we would like to get in on it. Of course, then we passed legislation that said both DOE and the National Institutes of Health would run this program. 
   Since then, it has been a scientific marvel. The entire chromosome system of human beings is mapped. Pretty soon it will be available for scientists investigating grave diseases. They will have them at their fingertips in terms of transmutation. 
   Perhaps we have just laid before the public and the people of the world the greatest wellness potential in the history of mankind. We may find locked up genetically the secret to most diseases. The scientists may pick it up and find solutions in the next 25 or 30 years that nobody thought possible. 
   Sooner or later I will have somebody recognize Dr. Charles DeLisi. I have spoken to him. He is a marvelous educator at a great university. President Clinton is now aware of this and very interested. I am very hopeful he will be recognized. It is important people understand.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my fellow Senators in honoring Senator DANIEL INOUYE with the Congressional Medal of Honor. This man is a representative of our nation who has persevered through war, debate, and many had fought campaigns. I have had the pleasure of working with Senator INOUYE and applaud my colleagues for bestowing this great honor upon him. 
   Senator DANIEL INOUYE is a Veteran of World War II and was a captain in the Army with a Distinguished Service Cross (the second highest award for military valor), a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart with cluster, and several other medals and citations. Serving in the Senate almost 40 years, Senator INOUYE is also the first Congressman from the state of Hawaii. His courage in combat is a testament to the Senator's true commitment to his country and to freedom. Serving on the Defense Appropriations Committee, I know how much Senator INOUYE cares about the protection of our country and his professionalism and dedication to finding a balance for defensive spending. His diligence and dedication speak for themselves and I am proud to serve our Armed Forces with a man of this caliber near the helm. 
   I have also had the pleasure of working with Senator INOUYE on the Indian Affairs Committee for over 20 years and know first hand that his bravery did not cease on the battlefield, but still continues today. When he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator INOUYE was highly regarded among tribal leaders for his efforts to re-establish their sovereignty over their own people and their own affairs. Tribal leaders consider Senator INOUYE to be a true leader and friend to the Indian people to this day. I thank Senator INOUYE for his leadership and dedication to service to our country, and I thank him for his friendship and example. 
   Mr. President, inscribed on the medal is the word ``Valor.'' Senator INOUYE is one of the most valiant men I know. I praise the Members of Congress for honoring him and hope that our young people may see that it takes courage, bravery, and valor to enjoy the freedom which so many men like Senator INOUYE fought to protect. Thank you, once again, to Senator INOUYE for your example, and thank you to all of the veterans who have served to protect liberty and justice.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2553, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY 2001. 
   The bill provides $272.6 billion in new budget authority and $221.9 billion in new outlays for the operations of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and numerous related federal agencies. 
   I have concerns about $6.1 billion in mandatory offsets in the bill. These offsets are likely to be challenged on the floor in a way that could put the bill over the allocation. I am also concerned about the advanced appropriation for 2003 in the SCHIP program. 
   When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $335.0 billion in budget authority and $330.7 billion in outlays. The bill is exactly at the Subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays. The scoring of the bill reflects the adjustments agreed to in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) and adoption assistance. 
   I commend the managers of the bill for their diligent work.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the first thing I want to do is congratulate the distinguished Senator from Texas for her speech today. Before she leaves, I say that I summarize the problem we have today in a way that maybe down in your country, with Texas in mind, they might say it this way: The chickens have come home to roost. 
   The truth is, we have no energy policy, and until something like a crisis occurs, nobody seems to worry about it--in particular, this administration. We have had a ride economically--up, up, and away. Part of it is because oil prices from foreign countries was so cheap, and America was reducing some of its own, and we just decided that there was no worry about becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil. 
   Look at the facts. While we have had this booming economy, I might suggest to everyone that the unit utilization of petroleum products that make this economy go has come down--not because of anything we did but the high-tech industry uses a little bit less. Nonetheless, we have grown so much that we use far more--as much as 14 percent more--petroleum products now than we did a few years ago. Guess what happened. The foreign countries became our source of supply in ever larger proportions. We were happy-go-lucky when Mexico was starving on $11-a-barrel oil that we were buying from them. They could not pay their debts; we were just gobbling it up, and the American producer was disappearing. The price was so low we closed down the opportunity to drill. 
   The litany of what this administration has done so we will produce less domestic oil is as long as this sheet of paper; from saying that in big areas in which you could look for oil 10 years ago, you can't look for it anymore because something is more important. Not very much is more important than our growing dependence, as the greatest industrial might in the world, upon the dictates of foreign countries who sell us that tremendous product, without which we fail. At least from what I can tell for the next 35 or 40 years, there is no substitute for it. 
   I heard recently that this administration has somewhat of a defense because they are going to say: We asked you for some renewable energy research money and you didn't give it to us. I say right here before the Senate that we will take every single proposal this administration has made for renewables--wind, solar, and the like--and submit it to experts. 
   And we will ask them: Would that have changed the crisis of dependence on foreign oil? And, if so, how much? Do you know what it would be? Zero. We don't use those kinds of energies in automobiles anyway. 
   Frankly, we are getting answers that the way for America to go is to put more in renewable sources and the like. We ought to do that. But if anybody thinks that is a solution to America's growing dependence on foreign oil, they had better take a long sleep because when they finally wake up, they are going to be absolutely surprised that our dependence grew while they took a nap. 
   The truth of the matter is we had better sit down with the President and decide how we are going to start fixing this. 
   I want to say right now that it is in the worst condition it could be--less American production; more of our land taken out of production; and more demand from the foreign countries; and they have finally found out how to enforce their agreements. They did not cheat the last couple of times on each other; that is, if Saudi Arabia agreed to X number of millions of barrels, they didn't sell it to someone on the side to flood the market, nor did Mexico, nor did any country in South America. 
   They are putting just so much oil on a world market that demands more. What do you think happens? The price goes up. It is now past $30 a barrel. It was as low as $10 a barrel. But, in the meantime, nothing is being done for the American producer--large and small--to substantially increase their domestic production. 
   I am informed enough not to want to leave false impressions. We do not have the wherewithal to totally eliminate dependence. Look at our great Nation. We are going to be dependent on Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and a few other countries that produce for a long time after I have left the Senate, if I am successful in staying here 2 more terms. I don't know how long my good friend, the Senator from Texas, expects to be here. But we are going to be dependent. 
   Let me predict the next thing. We are going to have brownouts in America, which means the electricity supply to a region of the country cannot quite supply enough because we are exchanging it between areas. Then there will be another hue and cry: Who did that to us? 
   Just like the answer of this administration today--that it is gouging. They may find some gouging. But that is not going to fix this energy problem. 
   We are going to have brownouts because we have not been producing enough electricity. We are scared to death to produce it anyway, other than through natural gas, which is the cleanest fuel around. Yet it is a carbon dioxide producer and is a small portion of the problem that we have in the ambient air and the so-called greenhouse effect. 
   While we hide under the desk and don't want to even discuss nuclear power--which currently supplies 21 percent--it has literally zero greenhouse gases. Eighty-four percent of France's electricity is nuclear. Their ambient air is as clean as a whistle. They are not frightened one bit to have interim storage of nuclear waste. 
   Here sits the greatest industrial Nation on Earth in a total logjam over the issue of moving forward with just a little bit of the nuclear energy and saying let's temporarily store it, while Europe is doing it without any difficulty and no fear. 
   Where are we going to get the electricity in the future? 
   The problem with greenhouse gases is so severe, according to some, that we aren't going to be able to build any coal-burning plants until we clean it up more. Are we going to do every single one in the future with natural gas? Then the citizens are going to wake up and say: What did you do to natural gas prices? Our bill went up in our homes, and now we are coming to Congress and asking them to do something about it. 
   If you decide to produce all the electricity needs in the future with natural gas, you are going to put a huge demand on American natural gas. Who knows where the price will go? Yet we have literally an abundance of natural gas in the offshore regions of America. We are frightened to death to drill any more wells. Those who do not want to change that one bit because they are scared of environmental things have won their way, and we are not open to the production of natural gas as much as we should.  
   I close today by saying I believe 7 1/2 years of doing nothing has ``come home to roost.'' We are just going to get around the corner maybe with this election. But I submit this great Nation is in for two big problems: Where do we get our electric-generating power in the future? What do we do about nuclear energy? 
   We ought to do much about it instead of falling under the table when a small percentage will raise their concerns. We ought to increase the domestic supply of oil so that the world knows we haven't gone to sleep by opening as many areas as we can.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, isn't it interesting. I came to the floor today to discuss a completely different subject. I want to do so briefly. It is very difficult to do this because, frankly, there is a great story about it in the United States today. 
   The National Institutes of Health announced that they have just about mapped the human genome, which means in the future, at a minimum, every known dreaded disease of mankind will be located in our chromosome system by the mapping of the human genome. Where scientists used to take 25 years and devote an entire science department to try to locate where multiple sclerosis came from within the human body, in short order all of those dreaded diseases will be defined in reference to the genetics of the human body, and mutations of that will be discovered as the reason for the diseases. What an exciting thing. 
   I have not been part of the ceremony, but I started the genome program in Congress. I am very thrilled to find that it has resulted in what we predicted in 1996 and 1997. 
   I want to tell the Senate a rather interesting story of how the genome got into the National Institutes of Health and how today it is still one-third in the Department of Energy. 
   A very good scientist who worked for the National Institutes of Health named Dr. Charles DeLisi had been urging the National Institutes of Health to get started with a genome program. He had described its greatness in terms of it being the most significant wellness program mankind had ever seen--wellness. They defied his request and would not proceed. He said: I quit. 
   He meandered over to the Department of Energy, which had done a lot of research on genetics because they were charged with discerning the effect of radiation from the two atomic bombs that had been dropped on Japan. He joined their department. 
   He came to see the Senator from New Mexico, who worked for the laboratories hard and long, and said: Why don't we start a genome program in the Department of Energy since the National Institutes will not do it? 
   I am trying to recap for my future by writing it, and I am putting it together. 
   But what actually happened was I proposed that the genome program start, and that it start in the Department of Energy. 
   Guess what happened. The National Institutes of Health heard about it. All of their reluctance disappeared because somebody was about to give the genome project to the Department of Energy. What an easy patsy they became. 
   They came to the office. Then we went to see Lawton Chiles, the Senator from Florida, who appropriated the science part of this budget. They said: Let's do it together--a little bit for DOE, and a whole lot for NIH. I said: Whatever it takes, let's do it. 
   Within the next year--1997--we funded the first genome money without a Presidential request. It had come forth, I think, in the Labor-Health and Human Services bill that will be before us today at somewhere around $20 million, maybe $29 million. 
   We funded it for another year. Finally, the President of the United States funded it in his budget in the third year of its existence. Ever since then, it has been funded in a President's budget and by us. It is up around $129 million or $130 million. I think it is something like that. But they predicted that within 15 years they would map the entire chromosome structure of the human being. Today, they made an announcement. I don't think they are really totally finished. But there is competition afield as to how to use it, and the private sector group is purportedly moving more rapidly. 
   The NIH and another group of scientists announced at the White House to the American people and the world we have essentially mapped the chromosome system of a human being. We now know the site, the location, the map is there, for discerning what the genes contain with reference to human behavior and human illness. 
   I predict, as I did at least five times before committees of the Senate from the years 1987 to about 1994, where I appeared more often than any other committee urging we fund the genome project, we are ready today to say the map is there; let's get with it and start using it. We will have breakthroughs of enormous proportions with reference to humankind's illnesses. 
   I am neither scientific enough nor philosophical enough to know what else it will bring. When we do something of this nature, we bring other questions. There will be problems of abuse, of genetic mapping to decipher people in a society prone to cancer and who therefore will not be hired, unethical research using mutations in ways not good for humankind. 
   Incidentally, we were aware of that problem from the beginning. Senator Mark Hatfield said: Let's set aside 5 percent--that is my recollection--of the funding to use for education and ethical purposes to try to make sure we are on track. I have not followed that well enough. I am not exactly sure how that is going. We still have some legislating to do in the area regarding uses in research, and legislating with reference to an insurance company taking a whole group of people and saying: We are not insuring you because we know something about your genetics. 
   Those are serious problems. They are bigger than the problem itself. They could make America angry at this program. We don't want to do that. We want the American people happy that we have put this into the hands of human beings, for wellness purposes. That is our desire, so that people not get dread diseases, or we find out how to cure them when they get them. Genome mapping ought to be heralded as something we did right. I don't know where it goes. 
   I close today by thanking Dr. Charles DeLisi for bringing this idea from the NIH to my office. Senator Lawton Chiles, now deceased, is the one to whom NIH ran, saying, let's get something going. He and I worked on these projects well together. We got it going in an appropriations bill. I thank him, and I thank many Senators who worked on this, principally in the committee, whose legislation is pending. That is the subcommittee that did most of the work and helped it along, more than any other group in the Congress. 
   I am delighted to have a chance to speak today.

   Mr. DOMENICI. First, I say to Senator BREAUX, while I was not physically present on the floor when you made your speech, I was listening. I am very privileged and pleased to join you tonight in suggesting that this is not a real vote on Medicare. 
   Most of the time--in the past--Senator ROBB is a very realistic and forthright Senator. But somehow or other we are getting close to an election, and somebody has suggested to him that this is a way to get a real Medicare vote. The truth of the matter is, everybody listening should know this is not a real Medicare vote. 
   If anything, if we adopt this on an appropriations bill--that funds all of the priorities of the other side of the aisle--if they want to fund education, it is funded in this bill. If they want to fund community centers to treat the people that are poor, they are funded in this bill more than last year. But now they come along and ask us to attach an amendment, a huge bill that we have never had a hearing on, and we call it prescription drugs for America. We put it on with education, community centers, all the health programs for our seniors, and we say, just put it on there and tell the committee, that knows nothing about Medicare because they are not expected to, to bring back a comprehensive Medicare program on an appropriations bill. Then the suggestion to the American senior citizens is, we are doing something for you. 
   What we are doing is trying to force a vote before we have a bill. This is not a bill that has been considered. It is not going to be voted out by our bipartisan effort. A great bipartisan effort is taking place. 
   If I were a member of the Finance Committee--be it Dr. BILL FRIST or the Senator from Texas or the distinguished Senators on that side working on it--I would be ashamed today to say: I am going to vote to usurp and take away all your power and vote in a so-called prescription drug bill that a few of us have written up. And we are going to pass it on an appropriations bill where that committee does not know anything about prescription drugs. 
   They are sort of expected to robot out of here and robot back in with a great prescription drug bill. 
   I submit that we should not vote for it. We should not use our procedures and our processes in this perverted way. 
   I am going to ask five or six questions. They are not answered by this legislation, and they are not answered here. 
   Let me first ask: How does this amendment affect the solvency of Medicare? Nobody knows. What are the premiums for drug coverage? Nobody knows. I don't know that anybody knows the official cost estimate of this bill. But I know it is expensive. Don't you think we ought to know those answers before we try to convince Americans that we are passing a prescription drug bill which could not become law? 
   There are two more questions: Are there taxes in this proposal? If there are, the bill goes nowhere.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 2522, the foreign operations and export financing appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   The Senate bill provides $13.4 billion in budget authority and $4.5 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of State, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral economic assistance, and related agencies for fiscal year 2001. 
   When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.4 billion in budget authority and $14.3 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2001. 
   The subcommittee is below its section 302(b) allocation for budget authority and at its section 302(b) allocation for outlays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through June 19, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 2001 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 290), which replaced the 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 68). 
   The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $2.3 billion in budget authority and by $6.8 billion in outlays. Current level is $28 million below the revenue floor in 2000. 
   Since my last report, dated March 8, 2000, in addition to the changes in  budget authority, outlays, and revenues from adopting H. Con. Res. 290, the Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 106-181) and the Trade amd Development Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-200). The Congress has also cleared for the President's signature the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 2559). This action has changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that would allow for the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the Melrose Air Force Range in New Mexico and the Yakima Training Center in Washington to the appropriate Service in the Defense Department. Both of these affected areas are public domain lands under the Department of Interior. This legislation simply transfers authority from the Department of Interior to the Secretary of the Air Force in the case of the Melrose Range and to the Secretary of the Army in the case of the Yakima Training Center. 
   Transfer and conversion of the lands to real property is proposed in lieu of the more customary withdrawal pursuant to the Act of February 28, 1958. The affected lands are multiple parcels of public domain lands within a large block of Military Service acquired real property. Enactment on this transfer would provide for simplified management of these lands by the respective Defense Department Service. 
   Melrose Air Force Range in Roosevelt County, New Mexico, is comprised of six parcels of public land, totaling about 6,714 acres. Over 1,118 acres are utilized as bomb impact zone; the remainder is required as a safety buffer. The transfer is needed to provide the Air Force with complete control over land uses on the Range. This should serve to minimize potential safety concerns, liability of the United States, and land use conflicts that could interfere with the training mission. 
   The lands have been used as part of the Range since 1957, under lease or other arrangement with the State of New Mexico which had ownership of the lands at the time. Expansion of the Range was authorized by Public Law 89-568, in September 1966. In 1970 and 1973, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) acquired the lands through a land exchange with the State. During this same period, a land acquisition program to enlarge the Range was being conducted by the Air Force through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The BLM exchange was undertaken in aid of that effort. In 1975, the U.S. Army Corps, on behalf of the Air Force, applied for withdrawal of the lands that the BLM had acquired. 
   The lands that would be transferred through enactment of this legislation are an integral part of the Range, and continue to be suitable for training purposes. These lands will continue to be needed for Air Force training for the foreseeable future. 
   The second installation affected by this legislation is the Yakima Training Center in Kittitas County, Washington. Congress authorized a 63,000 acre expansion of the existing Center by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 and the Military Construction Appropriations Act of 1992. 
   The lands to be transferred at the Center consist of 19 scattered small tracts of public lands totaling 6,649 acres within the expansion area. The remaining approximately 56,400 acres of real property within the expansion have already been acquired by the Army. There are an additional 3,090 acres of public domain mineral estate associated with the acquired land to be withdrawn from the general mining laws. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, this bill provides for the transfer of public domain lands to the Secretaries of the appropriate military service to complete the acquisitions at both installations as authorized by previous Acts of Congress. The consolidation of these lands as real property with the surrounding military acquired lands would provide a common management situation for the Military Service. This should serve to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their range operations and natural resource management.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is to provide $20 million to support rural air service to the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   The Wendell H. Ford Aviation and Investment Reform Act of the 21st Century (AIR-21) included in Section 203 a provision to provide grants to attract and subsidize improved air carrier service to airports currently receiving inadequate service. The provision authorizes $20 million for grants of up to $500,000 to communities or community consortia which meet certain criteria for participation in the program. 
   My amendment would provide discretionary authority to the Secretary of Transportation to implement this pilot program utilizing not more than $20 million in FY 2001 for this purpose. 
   Mr. President, I want to emphasize how important this program is to my home State of New Mexico, particularly southeastern New Mexico where I have worked for years to bring rural air service to that part of the state. The communities of Roswell, Hobbs, Carlsbad, and Artesia have formed a consortium in anticipation of applying for federal funds under this program. The consortium has raised $200,000 in local funding and $200,000 in state funds, and can demonstrate that existing air service in that part of the state is insufficent and is accompanied by unreasonably higher fares. The southeastern New Mexico consortium is precisely the sort of applicant this grant program is intended to benefit. A similar consortium is being put together in northern New Mexico. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide badly needed air service to rural areas in the country.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Transportation and Related agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing us a balanced bill within necessary budget constraints. 
   The Senate-reported bill provides $15.3 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $19.2 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Transportation, including federal-aid highways, mass transit, and aviation activities. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $14.0 billion in BA and $48.0 billion in outlays. 
   The Senate-reported bill is exactly at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority, and the bill is $310 million in outlays under the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. 
   I thank the chairman for the consideration he gave to New Mexico's transportation priorities. 
   Mr. President, I support the bill and urge its adoption.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say from the very beginning of this discussion today, it has been a real pleasure to work with Senator BINGAMAN and his staff--and I hope that is mutual--on putting together a bill that we are going to introduce today. It is our best effort to put together a bill that permits the citizens of Los Alamos, the people who reside there, whose houses or personal property were damaged or destroyed, and businesses that existed, owned either by corporations or individuals--the damage they might have suffered. This is just a partial list. I will read the list before we leave the floor. 
   This is an effort to compensate the Indian people for similar losses. 
   Mr. President, since May 4, 2000, it is now known that the National Park Service started a forest fire, a so-called prescribed burn, at Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico. That was done during the height of the fire season and, regrettably, as everyone now knows, that fire, which was expected to be a controlled burn by the Park Service in Bandelier National Park, was not able to be controlled by those who were called in to control it. 
   The fire went right down the mountainside, ended up burning down the forest and parts of the community of Los Alamos. The fire destroyed more than 425 residences. 
   I am going to start from the beginning with just one photo. Senator  BINGAMAN has others. He drove the streets while some of the fires were still cooling off. As I understand it, Senator BINGAMAN could see the remnants of steam and heat, and the residue of fires that had not yet totally burned out. 
   This is just one picture of the old town site. That means there is a part of the area that was built up by the Federal Government years ago when Los Alamos was a closed off and secret community, at which the first atomic bomb was being built. All of the science was put in place up there, and it was totally a secret city. Years later, while I was a Senator--I have been here 28 years--we tore down the walls and sold those houses to individuals. 
   This is the way the fire looked as a house burned adjoining the trees and forests that surround Los Alamos. It was actually much worse than that. But that is the best we can do in a photograph of this type. 
   The fire started on May 4, and by May 5 it was a full-fledged wildfire devouring everything in its path. Ultimately, it devoured 48,000 acres of forest land and significant parts of the community where houses and businesses were owned by individuals. 
   During the time this fire burned out of control, our Nation was celebrating the 50th anniversary of Smokey the Bear; that is, the date of his rescue from a raging forest fire in the Lincoln National Forest in NM. 
   For 50 years, Smokey the Bear had cautioned Americans to be careful. Apparently, no one told the Park Service. 
   The decision was made to start a forest fire. The basis was a miscalculation of the danger. The result was, believe it or not, about 25,000 people were evacuated; 405 families lost their residences or homes; two Indian pueblos lost land, livelihood, and sacred sites; and 48,000 acres were transformed from a lush forest into a charcoal garden covered in some places by 12 inches of ash. 
   The cost thus far to taxpayers just to fight the fire is perhaps $10 million. 
   We now have a couple of official reports. We have a 40-page report called ``Sierra Grande Prescribed Burn Investigative Report'' dated May 18, 2000. It can be summarized. 
   Too little planning; too few followed procedures; too little caution; too little experience; too much dry underbrush; too much wind; too much advice unheeded; and too late arrival of the ``hotshot'' experts; and, it was too bad. 
   It is more than too bad. It calls into question the policy with reference to prescribed burns. But that is an issue for another day. But I am hopeful that serious discussions are taking place as to how we should handle controlled burns in the future. 
   We have a catastrophe. It is a catastrophe that it started in the first place. There is no doubt about that. 
   It is a tragedy that it destroyed homes. There is no doubt about that. 
   It is a disaster that fire disrupted businesses. It cost State and local governments millions of dollars. There is no disagreement about that. 
   Imagine the horror of seeing your home reduced to ashes and the freakishness of owning a concrete staircase to nowhere and calling it your home as you come back to visit. The house is burned to the ground, and only cement steps remain. 
   Imagine seeing your neighborhood reduced to a row of brick chimneys and concrete foundations. 
   Consider the irony of a home burned to the ground while the wooden tree house stands unoccupied in the yard. 
   Imagine the task of sifting through the ashes for any unincinerated remnants of your life. 
   Think about the gawkers and the TV trucks driving through your neighborhood waiting to see if the first rains produce mudslides and/or floods. 
   Imagine your life if you were they. 
   You want to go back to work, to get the kids back into a routine, but your life is a series of back-to-back-meetings, dealing with appraisers, contractors, insurance, FEMA, SBA, and flood insurance. 
   Everyone involved wishes that the fire could be unset, the match unlit, the decision unmade, but there is no way to undo the catastrophe. 
   The Federal Government can't undo the damage, but it can provide prompt compensation. That is the objective of the legislation that Senator BINGAMAN and I are introducing today. We have worked closely with the administration, and I am pleased that they support this legislation. 
   I am pleased to introduce legislation that starts the process of rebuilding lives. It provides an expedited settlement process for the victims of the fire. 
   The first estimate of the cost that we are covering is an approximate number of $300 million. We will use $300 million as our approximate cost as we take this bill into conference on the MILCON bill and attempt to get it adopted in an expedited matter as part of that conference, along with the moneys needed to compensate the victims for their claims under this legislation. And there are moneys for other components of the fire under other federal programs--$134 million for the laboratory damage itself, which is a separate appropriations item. 
   To accomplish the goal of compensating fire victims in the most efficient and fair way possible, this legislation establishes a compensation process through a separate Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims at FEMA. 
   It provides for full compensation for property losses and personal injuries sustained by the victims, including all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, small businesses, local governments, schools, Indian tribes, and any other entities injured as a result of the fire. 
   Such compensation will include the replacement cost of homes, cars, and any other property lost or damaged in the fire, as well as lost wages, business losses, insurance deductibles, emergency staffing expenses, debris removal and other clean-up costs, and any other losses deemed appropriate by the Director of FEMA. 
   To make sure that this is an expedited procedure, within 45 days of enactment, FEMA must promulgate rules governing the claims process. After the rules are in place, FEMA must publish in newspapers and other places in New Mexico, an easy-to-understand description of the claims process in English and Spanish, so that everyone will know their rights and where and how to file a claim. 
   Once those rules are in place, victims will have 2 years to file their claims, and FEMA must pay those claims within 6 months of filing. 
   During the adjudication of each claim, FEMA is authorized to make interim payments to victims so that those with the greatest need will not be forced to wait a long time before receiving some form of compensation from the government. 
   This bill also will reimburse insurance companies for the costs they paid to help rebuild Los Alamos and the surrounding communities. Under this bill, insurance companies will be able to make subrogation claims against the government on behalf of themselves or their policyholders in same manner as any other victim of the fire. 
   I want the victims to know that this bill requires that 
   they will compensated before insurance companies. 
   The intent is to encourage insurance companies to settle with their policyholders and then come to the government for compensation. That way, victims can get on with their lives as soon as possible, and insurance companies can get reimbursed through the claims process without the need to proceed under the cumbersome Federal Tort Claims Act. 
   For victims whose insurance will not cover the complete replacement cost of their property loss or their personal injury, insurance companies should cover all that is required under their policies, and the government will make up the difference. 
   Mr. President, I think that in this bill, we have developed a process which is fair, comprehensive, and efficient. Yet there will be some who believe, for whatever reasons, that they are not receiving what they are entitled from the government. 
   For those individuals, this bill preserves their right to sue under the Tort Claims Act or to protest the final claims decision of FEMA. I hope that there will be few, if any, such lawsuits, but I believe we must maintain the rights of individuals to proceed to court if they are unhappy with their claims award. 
   I think we have taken an excellent first step in proposing this claims legislation. There is no way one bill can address every issue which might arise in every circumstance. Many of the details will be determined by the Fire  Claims Office. I want my constituents to know that I will do all I can to monitor the process as it moves forward to ensure that New Mexicans are treated fairly and in accordance with the intent of this law. 
   All our citizens owe a tremendous gratitude to the workers at Los Alamos. We won the cold war because of their contributions. Today we enjoy our freedoms because of their dedication. We need their continued dedication to assure that those freedoms survive for our future generations. And they need our help to rebuild their lives and return to their vital missions. 
   I hope my colleagues will support the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act. 
   Citizens can choose not to take this claims approach provided for in this legislation, and they can go to the Federal courts under the Federal Tort Claims Act. If they do, they will get no compensation under this bill. That is their option. 
   If they choose the option provided under this bill and they go through it to get money for their damages--let's just take an item, such as a house which Senator BINGAMAN and I discussed. If there is a dispute as to the value of that house, and they are supposed to get the value for the replacement cost--if there is a dispute, this bill provides an opportunity to use arbitration. 
   We have limited attorney's fees in this bill to 10 percent. We don't think this is going to be a heavily litigated process. I repeat, if citizens want to make their claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, this legislation does not preclude that, other than they have no right to claim anything under this bill. 
   We owe tremendous gratitude to the workers of Los Alamos. We won the cold war because of their efforts and their predecessors in the various activities and scientific niches at this laboratory which has been run admirably by the University of California. 
   Today, we enjoy some of our basic freedoms because in that cold war with the Soviet Union we had great people in this community and a couple of other communities, always staying ahead so people could be assured nuclear weapons would never be used against our people. 
   That laboratory is having some trouble besides the fire. When it all finishes, we will still stand in awe at the fantastic brain trust that is assembled in the mountains of northern New Mexico. We have a sister institution in California, obviously, and an engineering institution in Albuquerque called Sandia National Laboratories. They are three labs that are tied together by scientific prowess and a commitment to serve America in her needs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I once again thank Senator BINGAMAN. 
   Part of the time these discussions were taking place in New Mexico, I was not available to be there. As most people in New Mexico know, I have been there twice, but I missed one occasion when Senator BINGAMAN got to talk with the people. I thank him for that because he brought back a number of ideas. One of my staffers was present with him. Those ideas are incorporated in this legislation. 
   In particular, let me repeat that the bill covers ``loss of property,'' and it says what that means; ``business losses,'' and it says what that means; ``financial losses,'' and it says what that means. Then a ``summary of the claims process'' and a summary of the remedies and a summary of appeal rights. 
   The lead agency is going to be the Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims within FEMA. James Lee Witt or his successor will oversee that office but has the discretionary authority to designate an independent claims manager to run the office, if he so desires. 
   We are not creating anything new, it will be FEMA. But if he wants an independent claims manager, he has the latitude and authority to do that. There will be a separate account for the victims of the Cerro Grande fire that will be separate from the disaster assistance fund. Also, all of the money appropriated will be designated as an emergency.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill before us today. I would like to sincerely thank Senators STEVENS and INOUYE for their strong leadership on the Defense Subcommittee. I also would like to recognize the diligence and professionalism of the staff on this Committee. 
   Every year this Committee goes through the difficult exercise of trying to allocate sufficient funds to provide for our nation's defense. These decisions require balancing carefully between present and future, people and technologies. 
   This year, despite the fact that this appropriations bill provides over $3.1 billion more than was in the President's budget request and $20 billion more than the FY 2000 appropriation, the decisions to fund the wide array of critical Defense priorities were just as difficult as in the past. Despite these challenges the Committee has put together a comprehensive bill that meets many of the most pressing needs of the National Defense and remains within the constraints of the budget authority and outlay limits established in the 302(b) allocation. 
   I would like to briefly mention some of the most important aspects of our defense addressed in this spending package. 
   The bill provides $287.6 billion in new spending authority for the Department of Defense for FY 2001. In parallel with the Defense Authorization, the bill funds a 3.7 percent pay raise, new increases in recruiting and retention benefits, strengthens our missile defense program, boosts the Army Transformation Initiative, and provides a long awaited pharmacy benefit for our military retirees. 
   The bill also provides approximately $4.1 billion in the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund, almost double the funding provided in last year's bill. It is our hope that the Department of Defense will now have ample resources to conduct unforseen contingencies and protect the resources we provide in this bill for training and combat readiness. 
   There is good news for the Research and Development appropriation. The Committee approved $39.6 billion, an increase of $1.74 billion over the budget request. The Ballistic Missile Defense Program alone received an additional $4.35 billion. These resources will help prevent erosion of the scientific and technological foundation of our armed forces. 
   The Committee also provided for items that will ensure that New Mexico based defense installations and programs remain robust. I would like to briefly highlight some of the items that received funding in the appropriations bill. 
   Of the increase in Operation and Maintenance funding provided by the committee an additional $5.1 million is included to maintain and upgrade the Theater Air Command and Control Simulation Facility. This is the largest warfighter-in-the-loop air defense simulation system in operation and proudly operated by the 58th Special Operations Wing at Kirtland Air Force Base. Another $8 million will upgrade the MH-53J helicopter simulator to include Interactive Defensive Avionics System/Multi-Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal capability. Both of these projects will strengthen and support our Air Force's readiness and capabilities. 
   American dominance relies heavily on our technological superiority. The Committee recognizes this and, therefore, supported substantial increases to Research and Development funding above the President's request. Of this, an additional $24.4 million will go to the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range to support advanced weapons development and transformation initiatives for solid state laser technology. The Theater High Energy Laser anti-missile program, successfully tested last week at White Sands also received an additional $15 million. Finally, the Airborne Laser program's budget was fully restored with an increase of $92 million. ABL is the Air Force's flagship program in directed energy weapons systems. Keeping this missile defense potential on track is vital to our demonstration of the role lasers can play in future defense capabilities. 
   The Committee also recognized the active and reserve Army's need for lighter, more mobile command and control vehicles. Therefore, the bill funds a $63 million increase to the Warfighter Information Network program to produce these communications shelters; Laguna Industries manufactures these shelters. 
   The bill includes many other New Mexico defense activities. An additional $16 million will be provided for the Information Operations Warfare and Vulnerability Assessment work of the Army Research Laboratory at White Sands. The Committee also provided $10 million for the Magdalena Ridge Observatory and $5.3 million to combat the threat of terrorism with radio frequency weapons. 
   With the help of my colleagues new technology has a strong foothold in New Mexico and I thank them for supporting us in our endeavors. There are more hurdles ahead of us but each step takes us closer to our ultimate goal of being a major source of support to the  military technological transformation in the 21st century. 
   I believe this bill demonstrates the balance required to best fund our armed forces. Again, I am pleased by the hard work of my colleagues on this Committee and express, once again, my admiration for the hard work of Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE in achieving an appropriate spending package for our military men and women.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say hearty thanks to the U.S. Senate for passing the budget resolution that contemplated this issue and this problem and this solution. Normally, in years past on agriculture emergencies, we have waited until the end of the year and gotten into an enormous argument as to how much emergency relief is enough emergency relief. This year we decided, in the budget resolution, with the help of some experts and the committee, to decide that we would modify the resolution that applies to this year and provide $5.5 billion in this year's budget to be spent by the authorizing committee from a reserve fund set up by the Budget Committee and $1.6 billion for next year, all of which could be used for emergency purposes by the authorizing committee if they chose. 
   They have chosen to follow that to the letter: $5.5 billion this year and $1.6 billion next year. We have provided in advance a pretty good package, as my colleagues have said, on emergency relief. 
   I am not the expert. I am not here vouching for every item in the bill, but I am suggesting it is good to recognize that we had the foresight this time in advance to devise a prescription for the solution of what I think is most of the emergency relief that is going to be sought for farmers. There may be others in other bills. I thank everyone for living under that resolution and under that format. I thank the experts who told us this is a pretty good package, and we provided for it in advance. It turned out to be a pretty good dollar number that provides a rather substantial amount of relief. 
   In addition, we have had budgeted for quite sometime money for crop insurance. It has been languishing until now. It is high time a solution to that has been tailored, and now they are together. There is $7.1 billion of emergency assistance, and it is prescribed by the budgets we have voted for heretofore. 
   I commend those who have lived within those margins. I do hope the farmers of America understand that we have prescribed a very large package here, in addition to the regular appropriations bill that comes through, and we may have additional arguments on how much additional emergency money might be provided, if any. 
   I do believe this is a good example of doing it right for a change. We did it right from the very start, and now we are seeing the fruits of some good thinking in advance to avoid conflict at the end of the year. 
   Mr. President, while the spending in this conference report does not violate the budget, and again I congratulate the authors for following those spending guidelines, I must be honest in saying that some provisions in Title II of this conference report concern me. When the Budget Committee established the $7.1 billion funding to assist producers of program crops and specialty crops, I can assure you that at least this Senator did not envision some of the types of indirect assistance to producers this bill provides. Nonetheless the bulk of assistance will go directly to producers and provide some relief to those now suffering depressed farm incomes. 
   Finally, it must be said, that once this $5.5 billion in Agriculture Marketing Transition Act, AMTA, payments are made this year, total Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, outlays for FY 2000 may exceed $30 billion--a historic record level of spending. Just for the calendar year 2000, direct payments to producers will exceed $21.6 billion--another record. It is also understood that when we return from the Memorial Day recess, the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill may be before the Senate, and it to may contain additional emergency spending for the current fiscal year. 
   At a time when the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament are focused on agriculture trade issues, and the level of subsidies being provided on both sides of the Atlantic, I think it is important to take a step back and make sure we all understand what assistance is being provided in this bill to agriculture. 
   I will support this conference agreement today. But I hope that another bill the Senate may consider after the recess--the PNTR China bill--will provide expanded markets for our agriculture sector and thereby lessen the need for future agriculture subsidies. Most farmers and ranchers I know want to and will produce for the market given a chance. They do not want and should not want to ``farm'' government subsidies.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000 with my friend Senator KENNEDY. 
   Today we do not even question whether mental illness is treatable. But, today we recoil in shock and disbelief at the consequences of individuals not being diagnosed or following their treatment plans. The results are tragedies we could have prevented. 
   Just look at the tragic incidents at the Baptist Church in Dallas/Fort Worth, the Jewish Day Care Center in Los Angeles, and the United States Capitol to see the common link: a severe mental illness. Or the fact that there are 30,000 suicides every year, including 2,000 children and adolescents. 
   It was not too long ago that our nation decided we did not want to keep people chained in institutions. Simply put, it was inhumane to simply lock these individuals up without even using science to consider other alternatives. In fact, one of the first awards I received as a Senator was a Freedom Bell made from these very chains. 
   Make no mistake, our nation still has these same individuals with mental illness, we just do not have a very good way to deal with these individuals. Many of these individuals formerly locked up are now our neighbors taking the proper medication to control their illness. 
   However, our nation simply does not have an understanding of what happens when individuals stop taking their medications. 
   I believe the American people are ready for a direct assault on their consciences about a comprehensive approach to prevent the tragic incidents  mentioned. Many people just do not take notice because America is known for her freedom, but sadly many of these highly publicized incidents of mass violence all too often involve an individual with a mental illness. 
   When these incidents occur, my wife and I watch with horror on television and we often turn to each other and say that person was a schizophrenic or that individual was a manic depressive. 
   Sadly, society often does not want to take the extra step to help these individuals because they are either scared or simply do not know how to help. Unfortunately, there is no place that a community can 
   take these individuals for help. The police can do very little and likewise for hospitals. 
   I believe we must come together as a nation to find a community based solution so when someone sees an individual in obvious need of help they will know exactly what to do. 
   Some of you may have seen the recent 4 part series of articles in the New York Times reviewing the cases of 100 rampage killers. Most notably the review found that 48 killers had some kind of formal diagnosis for a mental illness, often schizophrenia. 
   Twenty-five of the killers had received a diagnosis of mental illness before committing their crimes. Fourteen of 24 individuals prescribed psychiatric drugs had stopped taking their medication prior to committing their crimes. 
   In particular I would point to a couple of passages from the series: ``They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what they plan to do.'' ..... ``a closer look shows that these cases may have more to do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health issues ..... In case after case, family members, teachers and mental health professionals missed or dismissed signs of deterioration.'' 
   It is for these reasons that I am so pleased that Senator KENNEDY has joined me to introduce this comprehensive piece of legislation. The legislation attempts to prevent these incidents and the other tragic results of mental illness before they happen. 
   The bill we are introducing today will provide for: A mental Illness Anti-Stigma and Suicide Prevention Campaign; Emergency Mental Health Centers to serve as the central receiving point in communities for families, friends, emergency medical personnel, and law enforcement to take an individual in need of emergency mental health services; Mental Health Awareness Training for Teachers and Medical Personnel to identify and respond to individuals with a mental illness; Mental Health Courts that will maintain separate dockets and handle only cases involving individuals with a mental illness; A Blue Ribbon Panel to make recommendations on issues relating to mental illness with a focus on the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; and Increased Funding for Innovative Treatment and Research. 
   I really believe we have a historic opportunity to become preventers of serious, serious acts of violence before they happen. Thank you very much and I look forward to working with Senator KENNEDY and my colleagues on this legislative initiative.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator KYL today in introducing a bill to remove a major impediment to business development on the Navajo Nation. Our bill will accelerate the long and arduous process now in place for obtaining a business site lease on the Navajo Nation. For years I have heard case after case of large and small businesses waiting from two years to four years, and longer, for such a lease. Delays occur in both the tribal and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) lease approval processes. 
   This dual process exists as a direct result of the U.S. Government's trust responsibility for Indian reservation lands. In study after study for the past three decades, the tediously slow and cumbersome land leasing process on the Navajo Nation has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting new private business ventures. 
   In our search for ways to encourage more private enterprise for Navajos, I encouraged and sponsored the Navajo Economic Summit in Tohatchi, New Mexico in 1987. Again, many of our key speakers from the business world reminded us that the Navajo Nation itself, and its protective federal agency, the BIA, needed to find a better way to make land available for private enterprises. 
   Along another avenue of encouraging businesses to go to, or expand on the Navajo Nation, I cosponsored legislation by Senators INOUYE and MCCAIN that was incorporated into the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In Sections 13321 and 13322 of that Act, we were able to enact generous wage tax credits and accelerated depreciation for businesses that chose to locate or expand on America's Indian reservations. Despite the availability of a wage tax credit for every eligible Indian hired, many businesses still viewed the complexity of Indian courts and land allocation methods as comparable third world nations. 
   Business has not flocked to the Navajo Nation, although many tribes around the country have taken advantage of this wage tax credit. Our incentives allow a direct credit off-taxes  owed at the rate of 20 percent of the first $20,000 paid in wages and health insurance for every Indian hired. In addition, all investments from infrastructure to computers were given accelerated depreciation rates, about one-third faster than non-reservation investments. 
   The Navajo Nation is our Nation's largest Indian reservation in both area and population. About 200,000 Navajos live on a reservation that straddles four States and is slightly larger than the entire state of West Virginia. Unfortunately, the poverty rate is high, unemployment hovers around 40 percent year after year, and private sector jobs are all too rare. Sadly, the time lag for obtaining a new land lease also remains painstakingly slow. 
   I commend Navajo President Kelsey Begaye for his interest in encouraging a better system for making land available for businesses and other purposes. Although other incentives like access to State and Federal courts will still be needed, a faster land lease will go a long way to encourage more business activity. 
   Our bill will establish a streamlined process for the Navajo Nation to lease trust lands without having to obtain the approval of the Interior for individual leases. The exception is exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral resources. These types of leases will still require Secretarial approval. 
   The Secretary of Interior would be required to approve the regulations adopted by the Navajo Nation to implement this new leasing authority. Once approved, the Navajo Nation would have regulatory authority to finalize land leases that do not exceed 75 years. They will be able to do this without having to be second guessed by the BIA in a follow-up process that always adds months, and sometimes years, to the process. 
   The trust obligation of the Secretary of Interior would remain in place. The Navajo Nation, would, in effect, be acting as an agent of the Secretary. By eliminating the need for Secretarial (BIA) review of its land leasing decisions, however, our legislation will allow a more efficient land leasing system to be put in place. 
   I am confident that President Begaye's Administration will work hard to reduce the time the Navajo Nation itself now takes to issue a lease. Without the follow-up review by the BIA, the potential business applicant will be able to open up months sooner. 
   Rather than getting caught in a blame game, a new lease applicant will be able to focus on a single process for obtaining a land lease, and the Navajo Nation will be the responsible party for delays. Again, I admire the courage of President Begaye's Administration for its willingness to accept this responsibility and to encourage more private sector business activity on the largest Indian reservation in our country. 
   I believe this initiative will encourage the Navajo Nation to be more business friendly. I urge my colleagues to join us in allowing the Navajo Nation to fully accept the responsibility for creating a single track land leasing system in place of the dual system now required.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2603, the pending legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator BENNETT, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator FEINSTEIN, for bringing a balanced bill to the floor. The bill supports ongoing Senate operations and those of the congressional support agencies we depend upon, such as the  Congressional Budget Office, the Library of Congress, the Government Printing Office, and the General Accounting Office. It also sustains a commitment to increased security for the entire Capitol complex and the thousands of visitors we receive each day. 
   The bill as reported to the Senate provides $1.7 billion in new budget authority and $1.45 billion in new outlays for the operations of the Senate, joint items, and our related agencies. The House will add the funding for its operations to its version of this bill. When outlays from prior-year budget authority, funding for House items, and other actions are taken into account, the bill totals $2.6 billion in both budget authority and outlays for fiscal year 2001. 
   The Senate bill is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority, and it is $4 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. The Senate bill is $54 million in budget authority and $53 million in outlays above the FY 2000 level. It is $216 million in budget authority and $169 million in outlays below the budget request. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of describing the nature of this very important amendment to provide $85 million on an emergency basis to begin the process of reopening and restarting the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the aftermath of the worst wildfire in the history of New Mexico. 
   The cost of restoring the laboratory to full operations will undoubtably grow as the Lab discovers further conditions upon reopening and restarting facilities and buildings. But this amendment is designed to provide the first installment of resources to assist the laboratory on its road to recovery. The funds will be used for: 
   Restart of laboratory operations (including replacement of lost scientific equipment, computers, and government vehicles) 
   Fire protection (including the replacement of broken or worn fire fighting equipment, replacement of destroyed or malfunctioning fire alarms, and the expansion of fire alarm coverage) 
   Environmental protection (including extension erosion control efforts to prevent mud slides; expanded air monitoring and equipment replacement; expanded water monitoring of run-off and groundwater) 
   Cean-up and infrastructure repair (including clean-up of smoke and fire damage, replacement of electrical power lines and transformers, repair of water and gas infrastructure, and repair of communications systems)

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending Military Construction Appropriations bill provides $8.6 billion in new budget authority and $5.1 billion in outlays for Military Construction and Family Housing programs and other purposes for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2001. 
   A major aspect of this bill is that it is the vehicle for emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for U.S. military operations in Kosovo, East Timor, and Mozambique  and for other purposes. Those other purposes include the repeal of ``pay shifts'' and obligation delays enacted last year, based on agreements with the Office of Management and the Budget. 
   Because these obligations, amounting to $3.6 billion, will be moved from fiscal year 2001 to 2000, there is a resulting negative impact on 2001 outlays in this bill. The net outlay impact of the bill is reduced from $8.6 billion to $5.1 billion. 
   This legislation provides for construction by the Department of Defense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it provides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. military services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and quality of life programs for our service men and women. 
   The fiscal year 2000 supplemental provisions of this bill support ongoing peacekeeping operations of U.S. Armed Forces, permit the payment of past due health care obligations of active duty military personnel and their dependents, and provide compensation to the Department of Defense for unforeseen increases in fuel costs. 
   The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished subcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Montana, and the Chairman of the full committee, the Senator from Alaska, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's allocation. 
   The bill provides an important and necessary increase in budget authority above the President's request for military construction in 2001. Most of the $601 million increase in budget authority funds high priority projects that the President's request failed to address. The bill also reimburses the military services for the costs already incurred for their peacekeeping operations, and it permits these operations to continue to the end of the fiscal year. It also fully funds healthcare needs and fuel costs that have been left unaddressed by the President but must be funded. Because the bill makes important additions to the President's requests, supports appropriate full funding budgeting practices, and funds highly important programs for our armed services, I urge the adoption of the bill.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join the community of Ruidoso, New Mexico in mourning the loss of Samuel James Tobias. Sam, a twenty-four-year veteran of the U.S. Forest Service, lost his life this week battling the Scott Able Fire in southern New Mexico when the spotter plane he was in crashed shortly after takeoff. His loss leaves a tremendous void for his wife, Jackie, the Forest Service, and the entire community of Ruidoso. 
   Sam joined the Forest Service in 1977 and worked in Recreation Management his whole career because of his love for the National Forest and the public. Preserving the land was his passion, and although fire fighting was the most dangerous aspect of his job, it was the part he especially enjoyed. Sam joined many local and regional fire teams and became trained as an Air Attack Coordinator. His skills in coordinating air tankers, helicopters and fire crews became well known and he gained the respect of all throughout the fire fighting community. 
   Sam was also deeply respected as a person. A big man with a soft voice, he was known as always having a smile on his face. One of his coworkers remembered him as ``the peacemaker with that big smile, always helping and giving good advice.'' Others have talked about the ``twinkle in his eyes'' and his big ``bear hugs.'' His lifelong friend, Dale Mance, recalled how Sam helped him find his way out of the steel mills of Pennsylvania and into a career with the Forest Service. There are so many examples of Sam's goodness; obviously, he had a heart that matched the size of his physical stature. 
   The many testimonals about Sam that his friends and family have offered carry a common theme: his willingness to help others, his selflessness, his concern for others. Often, such character is uncommon in men. For Sam Tobias it was natural, because he held genuine love for his family, his neighbors, and the land. Mr. President, I share the grief of the community of Ruidoso and my heartfelt condolences go out to the Tobias family.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Directed Energy Coordination and Consolidation Act of 2000. While enactment of the provisions in this bill will greatly enhance and accelerate some of the research, development, test and evaluation activities in my home state of New Mexico, I firmly believe taking this action is also in our national interest. 
   Last year's Defense Authorization Act required the Defense Department to convene the High Energy Laser Executive Review Panel (HELERP). This Panel was to make recommendations on a management structure for all defense high energy laser weapons programs. The authorization language also instructed the Panel to address issues in science and technology funding, the industrial base for these technologies, and possible cooperation with other agencies. 
   Mr. President, let me briely outline some conclusions and recommendations made by the Panel. The findings include the following: 
   Laser systems are ready for some of today's most challenging weapons applications, both offensive and defensive; laser weapons would offer the U.S. an asymmetric technological edge over adversaries for the foreseeable future; funding for laser Science and Technology programs should be increased to support acquisition programs and develop new technologies for future applications; the laser industrial supplier base is fragile in several critical laser technologies and lacks an adequate incentive to make investments required to support current and anticipated defense needs; DoD should leverage relevant research being supported by the Department of Energy and other agencies, as well as the private sector and academia; and, lastly, as in other critical high tech areas, it is increasingly difficult to attract and retain people with the skills necessary for directed energy technology development. 
   In sum, the Panel found that these technologies have matured sufficiently to offer solutions to some of the most daunting defense challenges the U.S. currently confronts. However, other findings indicated that science and technology funding is inadequate to realize these aims, the industrial base is steadily eroding, and this field cannot recruit and retain adequate talent to remain viable. We have the means, but we're not making the investments required to achieve our goals. 
   As requested by Congress last year, the High Energy Laser Master Plan approved by the Defense Department in March of this year proposes a different management structure. The Services all approved of this defense-wide management structure for making decisions regarding the specific technologies to pursue for specific defense applications and resource allocation. 
   Mr. President, this legislation echoes the findings of the High Energy Laser Executive Review Panel and codifies the proposed management structure outlined by the Panel. Furthermore, in accordance with the Panel's findings, the bill authorizes $150 million in defense-wide research and development funding for directed energy technologies. Up to $50 million of those funds can be utilized to leverage the directed energy expertise and technologies developed within our DOE laboratories. Lastly, this legislation requires that 
   microwave technology investment decisions also be coordinated within this management structure.  
   The bill would relocate the Joint Technology Office (JTO) proposed in the Master Plan from the Pentagon to Albuquerque, New Mexico, by January 1, 2001. This Office is currently being established at the Pentagon. However, the Pentagon is not a focal point for technology developments in directed energy. Albuquerque offers a sensible location for the JTO. 
   Support for Albuquerque as a location is offered by the findings of the 912c Tri-Service Armament Panel Report. This Panel Report was an outgrowth of the July 1999 DoD ``Plan to Streamline DoD's Science and Technology, Engineering, and Test and Evaluation Infrastructure.'' This Army, Navy and Air Force Senior Steering Group proposed that all DoD Directed Energy Science and Technology and Test and Evaluation be consolidated at Kirtland Air Force Base. The Steering Group recommended creation of a DoD Directed Energy Center of Excellence at Kirtland that would be responsible for identifying, advocating, developing, and transitioning directed energy technology to meet all DoD requirements. 
   Now that the High Energy Laser Master Plan has proposed an appropriate management structure, the time is right to take action. New Mexico is already a focal point for a lot of the research, development, test and evaluation activities in this field. Kirtland boasts tremendous assets to facilitate this research. White Sands is the premiere directed energy testing range. Co-locating the Joint Technology Office among a critical mass of directed energy activities--both Army and Air Force--is not only sensible, it should also serve to facilitate this work. 
   No doubt that the activities of the Air Force's Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland will be enhanced by this legislation. However, each of the Services will be required to compete within this management structure. 
   Let me be clear. Implementation of this management structure, regardless of the location of the Joint Technology Office will have no impact on the existing laser programs, such as the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL), Airborne Laser (ABL) or Space-based Laser (SBL). The objective is to grow all directed energy programs desired by any one of the Services, depending on specific applications pursued. 
   Any new programs will be competed--with one exception. The legislation includes a $20 million allocation for the Advanced Tactical Laser program under the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program Office in order to take a first initial step in addressing some of the industrial base concerns. 
   American dominance relies heavily on our technological superiority. Unlike other instances where the Department of Defense is using outsourcing or privatization to reduce costs, the attrition within the research community will require significant renewed investments over a long period of time to rebuild in the future. We are steadily approaching this situation in the field of directed energy. The lack of emphasis on and investment in revolutionary technologies, such as directed energy, unnecessarily limits the myriad possibilities for effective, surgical defense against a range of missile threats and vast potential for numerous defense applications. 
   Mr. President, in order to better leverage the federal Government's investment, ensure adequate stability in the industrial base, and promote educational opportunities in directed energy technologies, the Directed Energy Coordination and Consolidation Act of 2000 will take a critical first step. I ask my colleagues to join me in ensuring that we rigorously pursue directed energy solutions to our nation's defense needs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note on the floor with me this afternoon is Senator BINGAMAN. We are both here to speak about the disaster and catastrophe that has occurred in New Mexico. I would like to speak maybe for 5 or 6 minutes, then yield to my colleague, and then come back and do a little more. 
   During my time in the Senate, which is now approaching 28 years, I vividly remember coming down and hearing Senators have to tell the Senate about a disaster of significant proportions in their home State. The Senator wanted to tell us about how bad things were and lay the groundwork for the Congress, the Government of the United States, to do what it must to help those who are victims in a disaster. 
   To tell you the truth, I have been to Los Alamos, oh, so many times over the last 28 years. Most of them have been very joyous occasions, when we met with some of the greatest scientists in the world, talked about some fantastic science, met some wonderful people, and saw a beautiful town up there in the mountains. It came into being when the United States of America decided a former boys' academy up there in the mountains would be the center around which we would develop our first atomic weapons. It was a closed city for a long time but a beautiful place. 
   Sure enough, never did I expect to see what I saw last Thursday when Senator BINGAMAN and I, the Secretary of Energy, and James Lee Witt, the head of our emergency disaster relief agency for the United States, and others flew out there. Then we helicoptered around. Then we drove the streets to see what was occurring. 
   Senator BINGAMAN took a little different tour than I. He saw some of the housing. I saw where they set up the headquarters to manage and operate things. So he will have some very vivid recollections of what he saw, of houses burned to the ground. 
   Essentially, it is, indeed, a very sad day when probably one of the greatest laboratories human beings have ever set up--in terms of great science, not just because of great buildings but because great scientists have lived there and worked--is surrounded by flames. Many people supported those most talented of Americans--and even some of our greatest friends from other countries have been there as part of America's research in atomic and nuclear weapons safety, responsibility, and reliability--to go there and see a ghost town as you drive the streets, with smoke on one side, fire on one side, a house burned down, your heart kind of goes out. A great deal of empathy pours from you. 
   We are very lucky, the Senate should know; even though over 44,000 acres have burned, something like 400 housing units have burned to the ground, and upwards of 25,000 people have been evacuated--many are returning now. Damage and fire are still going in some of the canyons--but, we are very grateful that in the canyons that are still burning there are not very many housing units in the path. The forest is still burning and will burn for a long time. Yet nobody died, nobody got seriously hurt. Two or three firemen were injured, as I understand it, and none of those was serious. 
   The fire is now no longer threatening the houses of the city of Los Alamos or of White Rock, the adjoining community. In some very miraculous way, none of the big administrative and research buildings of the laboratory was hit by this fire. It went around them and got some housing subdivisions, but only a few buildings of minor significance that are part of this enormous science complex were burned. 
   The houses that burned, burned right to the ground. All that is left is cement foundations, as Senator BINGAMAN will describe and perhaps show some pictures. If there were houses that had cars in the front yards, the cars were burned to a crisp. The metal is 
   twisted and burned. In some places, you can see an icebox that is hanging over the vacuum that used to be sheltered by walls and roofs. The icebox just melted. It is no longer even noticeable. You cannot recognize it as being such. It is melted and completely different in form. 
   Essentially, all this was going on right around and close to a laboratory that does an awful lot of nuclear work, that has some compounds that are housed in cement bunkers so nothing can happen to them. And, sure enough, to this day there has been no radioactivity escape from any of these buildings and/or research facilities. 
   That is not just the Federal Government saying it. The New Mexico environmental department has monitored this. The greatest and best monitors from around the country are located there, and the ambient air monitors have indicated there is no radioactivity in the air. So now we have to start back up the path of trying to see how we can rebuild the lives of people there. 
   I am not going to go into detail other than to say we are beginning to move in the right direction. The laboratory personnel will begin to move in and see what is needed. In one of the communities, people are coming back. Parts of Los Alamos will be reoccupied soon. But I am sure Senator BINGAMAN and I will be asking the Senate, from time to time, to assist us, either with legislation that will direct how this should be handled, or certainly with money that will make the repairs and bring this facility back to where maybe we could say we will make it as whole as possible. 
   I want to close my first few remarks, and then yield to my friend, Senator BINGAMAN, by saying that right next to this forest, which surrounds Los Alamos, the Los Alamos property that belongs to the Department of Energy, is a national monument called Bandelier. It is rather renowned. 
   Both Senator BINGAMAN and I have had reason to work specifically for things to preserve and make the Bandelier National Monument a great and beautiful place. But it appears that in order to clear out that Bandelier forest a bit, because so much growth had accumulated and because of so many fallen trees and other things, that a planned burn took place. It looks as if  that planned burn got out of hand. It further looks as if it maybe should not have been started at all. I think the House passed a resolution today indicating that the U.S. Government is responsible for all these damages because of this controlled fire that got out of hand. Surely that will be looked at. 
   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Senator MURKOWSKI, with Senator BINGAMAN as ranking member, has asked the General Accounting Office to begin an investigation. The executive branch has been rather forthcoming. They have told us, by Thursday evening, no later than Friday, they will give us, and I presume the people of New Mexico, the country, and Los Alamos, the results of an evaluation by some of the Government's best experts on controlled fires and forest maintenance. They will tell us what they think went wrong. 
   At this point, I do not think there is any question that, at least--I start with the proposition, and I am certain Senator BINGAMAN will address the same issue--we are responsible to make that community whole, to make those individual residents who lost their homes and lost their property whole, and whatever expenditures have been incurred by the people and by the community that we, as a national Government, must make them whole. I am not sure what that means. But it will not take us long to find out. 
   In the meantime, I am very pleased that New Mexico's delegation is going to meet this afternoon. Hopefully, we will all be working together, the three House Members and the two Senators--Senator BINGAMAN and myself--in an effort to bring before the Senate and the House the appropriate remedies and the appropriate resources that are needed to do everything we can to make that community whole and make the individuals who have been subject to this terrible disaster as whole as possible. 
   I have additional remarks, about another forest fire occurring in another part of New Mexico and about some of the heroes there. There were heroes in other fires, too. But I yield to Senator BINGAMAN for his comments, and then I will reclaim some time when he is finished. 
   I thank the Senate and the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator BINGAMAN for his remarks and his observations. 
   Mr. President, I've visited Los Alamos countless times during my years of service in the Senate. I've been there for many celebrations, celebrations of their immense contributions that have helped to preserve our national security and maintain our scientific leadership. 
   Well, I was there a few days ago, and it was no celebration. I witnessed incredible devastation caused by the massive forest fire that is ravaging the area. Thousands of beautiful trees have burned and smoke was rising everywhere. Hot winds were fanning new flames. Thousands of acres of forest were devastated. The lives of many people were shattered. Over 20,000 people had been evacuated, and were receiving shelter with friends and in public areas. Many homes lay in ruins, consumed by flames. 
   These are homes of people who have dedicated their lives to preserving our precious freedoms. They are true patriots. It only added to my heavy heart to know that the fire was caused by an ill-advised ``prescribed burn'' in nearby Bandelier National Monument. 
   In the face of the tragedy, I was immensely impressed with the superb emergency services that were being provided. The State Governor spent a long night in Los Alamos. The Red Cross set up shelters throughout the northern area. The Forest Service mobilized hot shot firefighting units and brought superb expertise, capabilities, leadership and coordination to this horrible situation. The FEMA Administrator was on site. The Secretary of Energy arrived with some of his key staff. 
   The local emergency personnel were doing wonderful work, trying their best to safely cope with the immense challenge of protecting public safety during a complex evacuation, while also ensuring that none of the hazardous operations at the Laboratory caused additional concerns. The evacuation of Los Alamos took only about half the time anticipated, partly because they had recently practiced an evacuation drill. 
   There have been many acts of heroism, in which emergency personnel performed critical functions. Many of the lab personnel who manned emergency posts lost their homes in the fire, yet they continued at their stations to ensure the safety of others. People from throughout New Mexico reached out to help their neighbors. Assistance to evacuees from Pojoaque, Espanola, Taos and Santa Fe, along with other communities throughout the State, has been heart warming. Community leaders of these areas, like Jake Villareal from Pojoaque Pueblo and Richard Lucero from Espanola, were some of the first to offer generous assistance. 
   Given the state of the devastation, it's amazing that there has been no loss of life, or even serious injuries. The fire burned over bunkers full of high explosives--those bunkers provided the planned levels of protection and there were no accidents. Laboratory buildings, which house hazardous operations, remained secure, thanks in large part to years of careful planning. In fact, Laboratory leadership, under the direction of John Browne, deserves accolades for assuring that the Laboratory did not compound the fire-related crises, and bringing the laboratory through the events without significant loss of the facilities they require to accomplish their mission. 
   In the near term, we need to care for the immense human dimensions of the tragedy. We must ensure that people have adequate shelter, that public health and safety are protected, that public services are rapidly restored, and that some semblance of normalcy can return to their lives. We need to provide assistance to people as they rebuild their lives and their houses. 
   In the longer term, we need to ensure that the town regains its vitality, which is essential for our national Laboratory to return to full productivity. With the cessation of nuclear testing, the challenges facing that Laboratory are even greater than in years past. Now we've asked their staff to assure that our nuclear deterrent is safe, secure, and reliable--and do it without any nuclear tests. Our nation depends on that deterrent. We need these patriots to continue their work. 
   While I'd like to list the groups and individuals that have worked together to mitigate this catastrophe, that's really an impossible task. I do want to especially thank President Clinton, FEMA Administrator James Lee Witt, and regional FEMA Director Buddy Young for their quick reaction to this devastating disaster. FEMA's assistance has and will continue to be critical in helping to make the community whole again. 
   Up to this point, much of the focus has been on the tragedy facing the Laboratory and the communities of Los Alamos County, but there are additional dimensions to this horrible fire. It is still burning, and may threaten other communities. In fact, it could burn for months, as dry fuel in these mountain areas is plentiful. 
   As we are speaking, the Abiquiu land grant has been voluntarily evacuated. Beautiful and sacred areas of the Santa Clara Pueblo are burning or are threatened. We must make the same assistance package being prepared for the Los Alamos community available in these other locations, if this fire damages property there. 
   Last Wednesday, Governor Johnson requested that the President declare a state of emergency in New Mexico, and President Clinton signed that request within hours. The emergency declaration triggered immediate assistance to Los Alamos, as well as Sandoval and Santa Fe Counties, and Rio Arriba County was added soon thereafter. The emergency declaration provided for short-term assistancem including funds for things like: Food, water, medicine and other essential needs; shelters and  emergency care; temporary housing assistance; emergency repairs and demolition; and emergency communications service and public transportation. 
   Over the weekend, at Governor Johnson's request, the President declared parts of northern New Mexico to be a federal major disaster area. This triggers additional federal assistance from FEMA and other agencies for the following counties: Bernalillo, Cibola, Los Alamos, McKinley, Mora, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, San Juan, San Miguel, Santa 
   Fe, Taos and Torrance. 
   FEMA has only begun the process of assessing the damage, but the assistance will include funds to help individual families with rental housing, hotel/motel costs and other living expenses. Federal aid also will be available for county and city governments to help begin the process of rebuilding their infrastructure. 
   Thankfully, it is estimated that 98 percent of the homes destroyed or damaged by the fire were insured. But, there are other effects this fire will have on the community, particularly the business community so heavily dependent on the Laboratory for its existence in Los Alamos. SBA will make available low interest loans to help small businesses pay for their property losses and to cover cash flow shortages or working capital deficiencies because of the fire's impact. 
   FEMA has completed its initial assessment of the situation in northern New Mexico, and I have been assured that all appropriate federal agencies that can provide support will do so. FEMA will coordinate these activities and work closely with local officials to implement a comprehensive plan. No amount of money can replace many of the things which have been lost during this devastating tragedy, but all available federal resources will be brought to bear to do the best job we can. 
   Over the next few weeks, we will begin to understand the types of assistance that will be required for the Laboratory and its staff to return to productive work. I stand ready to work with all of you to assure that those resources are provided swiftly and surely. 
   Unfortunately, FEMA may be called upon to assist other communities in New Mexico, as my State is being devastated by a series of major fires. In the southern part of New Mexico, there are fires comparable in size to the Los Alamos fire. My heart goes out to those people as well, as they work to rebuild their lives. 
   I've joined a call within the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, together with Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senator BINGAMAN, to carefully establish the chain of events that led to the horrific events associated with the Los Alamos fire. The Government Accounting Office has begun a detailed investigation. Even with the limited information we have now, it appears clear that major human errors caused this fire. We need to understand those errors and be sure they don't occur again. We may, for example, need to reexamine the procedures for evaluating the safety of ``controlled burns.'' 
   It's also clear, even with the information we had last week, that the federal government is responsible for this disaster. Thousands of people were impacted by this mistake, and hundreds of those people have suffered major financial losses. Those folks are plenty angry, and they have every right to be furious. In Congress, we need to find ways to make those folks ``whole'' again, as quickly and efficiently as possible, with an absolute minimum of red tape. 
   All our citizens owe a tremendous gratitude to the workers at Los Alamos. We won the Cold War because of their contributions. Today we enjoy our freedoms because of their dedication. We need their continued dedication to assure that those freedoms survive for our future generations. And they need our help to rebuild their lives and return to their vital missions. 
   Mr. President, there are a lot of people to thank. I thank the President for acting expeditiously in declaring a national emergency. I thank James Lee Witt, the FEMA Administrator. He visited personally. He has put one of his best directors in charge. I thank Buddy Young from FEMA, who is out there setting up the appropriate centers. Obviously, at the forefront throughout this entire disaster has been our distinguished Governor, Governor Johnson. He probably knows more about it than any outsider today. He has spent untold numbers of hours, along with his wife, finding out what was going on, making sure things were coordinated and organized. I thank him in a very special way for all he has done. There are many others to thank whom I will forget to mention and they are very important. 
   I think the people in this country ought to know this laboratory was very well organized. It is the center of some very significant activities that require expertise and require that we do things absolutely right. They had an evacuation plan. It was followed to a tee and, believe it or not, with just four roads out of the mountains, all of these people went to other parts of our State 20, 30, 40, 50 miles away. That occurred without anything other than a mild jam up of automobiles on a couple of occasions as they left. They are staying with friends and neighbors everywhere. Motels offered the people from Los Alamos some very excellent, reasonably priced, accommodations and were very generous in doing that. Now, people from Los Alamos are starting to move back and we anxiously await their return. I have a few comments for them. 
   Without a doubt, it is the people who make this laboratory great. It is imperative that in our efforts to make this community whole, we do so with as much dispatch as humanly possible. Let it not be a long, dragged out, protracted effort to focus our attention and resources on what the people are entitled to and need, and let's get it done. We don't need any discouragement directed at those who are either new on the job, with great scientific prowess, or those who have been there a long time and are a part of the real nucleus of our nuclear and our deterrent capability. We don't need to discourage them. They should not be discouraged. We hope they come back and take up their jobs. Nobody should lose anything because of this fire in terms of remuneration, or pay, or the like. It is our responsibility. 
   As I indicated in my remarks, we have acts of God where lightning and other things burn our forests, and we have people in recreation areas who make a mistake and start a fire. This one apparently was started by the U.S. Government, although another department of Government, the Park Service, under the Interior Department; that is different from the Department of Energy that manages this laboratory. 
   Nonetheless, it seems to me that there are lawyers talking about trying to get our constituents there to sign up with them so they can get remuneration. I am very hopeful, as Senator BINGAMAN has indicated, and as Congressman UDALL from the district where this laboratory lies, who spoke last night at an event. We ought to give our assistance in an effort to make people whole. We ought to do that quickly and make sure the people understand they don't have to go through protracted litigation and courts to get the compensation they are entitled to. We intend to make them whole. But obviously, there may be different definitions, depending upon what vantage point you take, as to what ``making them whole'' means. 
   But wherever you can measure property losses such as a house, that which was in a house, personal property, automobiles, and the like which might have been damaged or destroyed, it is pretty easy. We need to put somebody in charge. We owe the people for what these destroyed assets were worth to them. 
   This isn't a town way up in the mountains. It is not going to be easy to build 400 new residences, if that is what people choose to do. It will take some time. The Federal Government has a lot of resources that it puts to bear and focus in emergencies. They will all be there, and hopefully organized in such a manner so that people will not be frustrated, and we will get on with this. 
   In the meantime, the process of controlled burns ought to be looked at thoroughly by Congress, but also the entire process of how we are maintaining our forests and our national parks in terms of trees that are knocked down; blighted areas where we have timber standing that is totally dry and dead; underbrush that is growing; pine needles that are piled up everywhere making a tinderbox out of some of our national monuments, some of our national parks, some of our forests, and  some of the Bureau of Land Management land. We have to take a look to see what we should be doing about that. 
   Should we leave that independent kind of situation waiting around for a fire of this magnitude or should we begin some orderly process of doing some things that will clean it up a bit and make it a little more safe? I opt for the latter. 
   I hope there will be some detailed hearings about that because I believe something should be done. 
   I understand the Senate is going into recess for the Republican and Democratic lunches. But I am not in charge of that time, unless leadership wants me to do something in that regard. 
   I yield the floor and thank the Senate. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an article from the Albuquerque Journal that talks about a marvelous man, Alton J. Posey, 68 years old. Essentially, this 68-year-old retired man knew a lot about forests and mountains. That was his job. He went out to save his mountain house, which was his dream--a two-story log cabin in the mountains. He doused himself with water, took his water hose, and stayed there and kept that house from burning while things burned all around him.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senate in advance for the generosity that it is going to show, as it always does for those who suffer a disaster in this country. 
   I want to say to New Mexicans that the Senate won't let you down this time either. We are going to do what we have to do to organize it properly, put it in the right hands, and make all of you out there in New Mexico whole, rebuild that lab where it needs to be built, and make it safer where it ought to be safe so it can continue its marvelous work in behalf of peace and freedom as it has done for so many decades. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 provides that the statement of managers accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget contain allocations, consistent with the resolution, of total new budget authority and total outlays among each committee of the House and Senate. 
   Allocations must cover the first year covered by the resolution and the sum of all years covered by the resolution. Unfortunately when we were preparing the statement of managers to accompany the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, (H. Con. Res. 290, H. Rpt. 106-577) the table indicating the five-year allocation to the committees of the Senate was inadvertently omitted. The table indicating the first year allocation was included as well as both the first and five-year allocation for the House committees. 
   I have discussed this matter with the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, Senator LAUTENBERG, and we have agreed that we would insert the appropriate table here in the RECORD and ask unanimous consent that this table serve as the 5-year allocation under section 302 of the Budget Act as if it had been included in the statement of managers at the time the conference report was filed in the House of Representatives. I therefore make that request now of the Presiding Officer.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to support override of the President's veto of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. This bill, S. 1287, under Senator MURKOWSKI's leadership, provided the first opportunity for real progress on nuclear waste issues during the term of the Clinton Administration. 
   With nuclear energy providing 22 percent of our Nation's electrical power, it is simply irresponsible for the Administration to continue to avoid all attempts at improving our handling of spent nuclear fuel. We must maintain nuclear energy as a viable energy option for our nation, and without concrete progress on nuclear waste, we will lose this part of our national energy supply. 
   American consumers are still facing dramatically higher prices for gas and oil, driven in no small part by the failure of this Administration to develop a coherent energy policy. We can't afford to place 22 percent of our electrical supply in jeopardy, and then pretend to be surprised when energy prices skyrocket. 
   These recent oil shocks have proven again the folly of over dependence on a single source of energy. They should have reinforced to the Administration that we need, more than ever before, a coherent energy policy that maintains a diverse energy supply portfolio. Nuclear energy is an important component of that portfolio. 
   As I've noted in the last few months, our response to this latest oil price episode was to approach the OPEC countries, tin barrel in hand, asking them to increase the flow of oil and lower our prices. That only serves to make us more dependent on their oil and increase the impact of the next episode of restricted oil availability. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI incorporated a very large range of concessions into the current bill, concessions that met every one of the Administration's advertised concerns. Unfortunately, as  we've seen before, this Administration is so determined to undercut the role of nuclear energy, that new objections were invented faster than concessions were granted. 
   I find it interesting that the Administration is treating the two major electrical producers in the nation, coal and nuclear, in somewhat similar ways. These two sources together account for over 70 percent of our electricity. Yet in both cases, the Administration is not focusing resources on actions that would address remaining concerns with these two sources. Our dependence on foreign oil would be far more serious with loss of either of these energy sources. 
   For coal, they should be increasing resources on clean coal technologies. For nuclear, they should be advancing timetables for addressing spent nuclear fuel. Neither is happening. 
   I believe that consumer concerns relating to nuclear energy are changing, as more information about the successes of this energy source becomes better known. Just yesterday, I checked on an MSNBC Internet poll on the 20 year anniversary of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. 
   In that poll, 80 percent of over 18,000 people responding said that they believe nuclear energy is safe, with 85 percent favoring licensing of new plants. 
   I find it amazing how fear of anything in this country with ``nuclear'' in its title, like ``nuclear waste,'' seems to paralyze our ability to act decisively. Nuclear issues are immediately faced with immense political challenges. 
   There are many great examples of how nuclear technologies impact our 
   daily lives. Yet few of our citizens know enough about the benefits we've gained from harnessing the nucleus to support actions focused on reducing the remaining risks. 
   Just one example that should be better understood and appreciated involves our nuclear navy. Their experience has important lessons for better understanding of these technologies. 
   The Nautilus, our first nuclear powered submarine, was launched in 1954. Since then, the Navy has launched over 200 nuclear powered ships, and about 85 are currently in operation. Recently, the Navy was operating slightly over 100 reactors, about the same number as those operating in civilian power stations across the country. 
   The Navy's safety record is exemplary. Our nuclear ships are welcomed into over 150 ports in over 50 countries. A 1999 review of their safety record was conducted by the General Accounting Office. That report stated:  
   No significant accident--one resulting in fuel degradation--has ever occurred.  
   For an Office like GAO, that identifies and publicizes problems with government programs, that's a pretty impressive statement. 
   Our nuclear powered ships have traveled over 117 million miles without serious incidents. Further, the Navy commissioned 33 new reactors in the 1990s, that puts them ahead of civilian power by a score of 33 to zero. And Navy reactors have more than twice the operational hours of our civilian systems. 
   The nuclear Navy story is a great American success story, one that is completely enabled by appropriate and careful use of nuclear power. Its contributed to the freedoms we so cherish. 
   Nuclear energy is another great American success story, it is not a supply that we can afford to lose. It's a clean source of power, without release of greenhouse gases, with a superlative safety record over the last decade. The efficiency of nuclear plants has risen consistently and their operating costs are among the lowest of all energy sources. 
   I've repeatedly emphasized that the United States must maintain nuclear energy as a viable option for future energy requirements. And without some near-term waste solution, like interim storage or an early receipt facility, we are killing this option. We may be depriving future generations of a reliable power source that they may desperately need. 
   There is no excuse for the years that the issue of nuclear waste has been with us. Near-term credible solutions are not technically difficult. We absolutely must progress towards early receipt of spent fuel at a central location, at least faster than the 2010 estimates for opening Yucca Mountain that we now face or risk losing nuclear power in this country. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI's bill is a significant step toward breaking the deadlock which continues to threaten the future of nuclear energy in the U.S. I appreciate that he made some very tough decisions in crafting this bill that blends ideas from many sources to seek compromise in this difficult area. 
   One concession involves tying the issuance of a license for the ``early receipt facility'' to construction authorization for the permanent repository. I'd much prefer that we simply moved ahead with interim storage. An interim storage facility can proceed on its own merits, quite independent of decisions surrounding a permanent repository. Such an interim storage facility could be operational well before the ``early receipt facility'' authorized in this act. 
   There are absolutely no technical issues associated with interim storage in dry casks, other countries certainly use it. Nevertheless, in the interests of seeking a compromise on this issue, I supported this act's approach with the early receipt facility. 
   I appreciate that Senator MURKOWSKI included Title III in the new bill with my proposal to create a new DOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. This new Office would organize a research program to explore new, improved national strategies for spent nuclear fuel. 
   Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing away with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be recycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting additional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., and Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but also to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms. 
   Now I'm well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically desirable now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, it must only be done with careful attention to proliferation issues. But I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for a future evaluation that may determine that we are too hasty today to treat this spent fuel as waste, and that instead we should have been viewing it as an energy resource for future generations. 
   We do not have the knowledge today to make that decision. Title III establishes a research program to evaluate options to provide real data for such a future decision. 
   This research program would have other benefits. We may want to reduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public concerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and want to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products at that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize the storage potential of a future repository, and that would require some treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition. 
   Title III requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent fuel be studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. As we do this, I'll encourage the Department to seek international cooperation. I know, based on personal contacts, that France, Russia, and Japan are eager to join with us in an international study of spent fuel options. 
   Title III requires that we focus on research programs that minimize proliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires that we study the economic implications of each technology. 
   With Title III, the United States will be prepared, some years in the future, to make the most intelligent decision regarding the future of nuclear energy as one of our major power sources. Maybe at that time, we'll have other better energy alternatives and decide that we can move away from nuclear power. Or we may find that we need nuclear energy to continue and even expand its current contribution to our nation's power grid. In any case, this research will provide the framework to guide Congress in these future decisions. 
   Mr. President, I want to specifically discuss one of the compromises that Senator MURKOWSKI developed. In my view, his largest compromise involves the choice between the Environmental Protection Agency or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to set the radiation-protection standards for Yucca  Mountain and for the ``early release facility.'' 
   The NRC has the technical expertise to set these standards. Furthermore, the NRC is a non-political organization, in sharp contrast to the political nature of the EPA. We need unbiased technical knowledge in setting these standards, there should be no place for politics at all. The EPA has proposed a draft standard already, that has been widely criticized for its inconsistency and lack of scientific rigor--events that do not enhance their credibility for this role. 
   I appreciate, however, the care that Senator MURKOWSKI has demonstrated in providing the ultimate authority to the EPA. His new language requires both the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences to comment on the EPA's draft standard. And he provides a period of time, until mid-2001, for the EPA to assess concerns with their standard and issue a valid standard. 
   These additions have the effect of providing a strong role for both the NRC and NAS to share their scientific knowledge with the EPA and help guide the EPA toward a credible standard. 
   Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator MURKOWSKI for his leadership in preparing this bill and in leading this over ride discussion. We need to overturn the President's veto, to ensure that we finally attain some movement in the nation's ability to deal with high level nuclear waste. 
   Mr. President, I won't respond to the millirem argument with reference to New Mexico and WIPP. Frankly, I believe it is irrelevant. Nonetheless, I wish to talk about nuclear energy power and what is happening to the United States of America. I say to the Senators from Nevada, I compliment them. They have been able, for a number of years, to delay the United States of America from having an underground permanent repository, and today, once again, they are successful. I understand they are acting in what they think is the best interest of their State. They are, once again, going to preclude the United States from coming up with an interim storage facility for nuclear waste. 
   Whatever the arguments have been, there is no science or engineering issue with reference to whether or not the United States of America can build, plan, and safely maintain an interim storage facility for high-level nuclear waste. Let me repeat. Nobody can, with any credibility, come to the floor of the Senate and say we cannot do that. In fact, we are doing so many things with reference to nuclear energy, with reference to radiation, that are more difficult than building an interim storage facility, a temporary storage facility for high-level waste for 25 or 50 years. In fact, the idea that we must find a permanent repository, one that will last for 20,000 or 30,000 years, for the fuel rods that come out of nuclear power reactors before we can proceed to take care of it for 50 or 100 years, borders on lunacy. It borders on standing reality on its head. The only possible reason could be that we don't believe we will build a permanent one if we build interim ones. But the truth is that it is not difficult; it is very safe once you have established it, and the only possible argument could be transportation. 
   We should have a debate on the floor of the Senate on whether it is dangerous for the American people to transport nuclear waste from fuel sites across the United States--and every Senator knows where they are in their States--to interim facilities that we don't have today. We told the American people that the waste would move from their states. Nobody should conclude that it is unsafe to move it across the United States. We are moving more, and risking more dangerous things on a regular basis, across the highways of the United States, with utter and total safety, than would be involved in this. 
   What is the issue? It seems to me that any time you are involved with radiation and anything nuclear, those who oppose it rely upon scaring the American people or their constituents, when the truth is that the United States of America gets 22 percent of its electricity from nuclear powerplants. Let me suggest that anybody who wants to test out what I am going to say have at it. That 22 percent of electricity produced in nuclear powerplants is the safest electricity produced in America. If you want to talk about risk of lives, injuries, health conditions, anything you would like, those are the safest sites producing electricity for the engine of American industry and for Americans living every day with computers built upon energy sources and electricity, and the like. 
   I laud Senator MURKOWSKI for his compromise legislation. Actually, I thought he might have even given away too much at one point, but looking at how things are going, he can't even get this passed. He has conceded a number of issues since this was originally proposed. 
   What do we do? We continue our dependence upon oil, and now natural gas, for our electricity in the future. This administration, by vetoing this bill and other actions, does the following things: One, they don't spend money on coal technology that will clean that technology up. Two, they don't spend money on finding an interim facility for nuclear waste. And then, three, we go begging those in Saudi Arabia and in Central and South America to continue to provide us with reasonably priced oil because we have become hostage to their oil. 
   Here we are, as a nation, worrying about oil supplies while the Democrats on that side get up and say this is not an issue; that the issues are Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security. Well, the issue about 7 weeks ago was skyrocketing oil prices, which caused skyrocketing gasoline prices. What if we cannot produce electricity as we need it in America? Think what would happen to America. 
   Think what would happen in the United States if, in fact, we decided, as a nation, that we were not going to do anything with nuclear power, it is too dangerous, too scary, and we decided to shut it down. 
   The United States would become a basket case soon. 
   When the Democrats get up in rhythm with each of them, saying this is not an important issue, my friends, this is a big issue. This is one of the most important issues to America's future because it has been made the linchpin about which we discuss the future of improved nuclear power in the United States of America. 
   I've become a strong advocate for nuclear power. I speak to it wherever I can. People listen. I think people believe we ought to continue with it. But we can't continue with it unless we decide what to do with the waste. 
   Recently, my spirits were lifted a bit by a poll on MSNBC Internet. I know it is not scientific poll, but it is pretty interesting. It's being conducted on the 20th anniversary of Three Mile Island. People still hearken back to that event and say, ``Look at what happened with nuclear power.'' Well, actually nothing happened. There was a leak. Nobody got hurt, and nothing happened. 
   Over 18,000 people responded on that MSNBC Internet poll, and 80 percent believe nuclear energy is safe. Eighty-five percent favor licensing power plants in the future for nuclear power. 
   Right now, today, the U.S. Navy has slightly over 100 nuclear reactors with partially spent fuel rods in the power plant. Those 100 nuclear power plants are sailing the oceans and the seas of the world in the hulls of submarines, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Some have two power plants in them--two complete nuclear reactors with the fuel rods that we are down here talking about and we don't know what to do with. They are on ships. Those ships are welcomed in almost every seaport in the world, except New Zealand because it had some argument about it years ago. 
   Imagine, all the big ports in America welcoming U.S. Navy ships into their waters and their harbors. What do they have in them? Nuclear power plants with their fuel rods. Why do they let them in? Why don't they say that is terrible, as we are saying here on the floor, and people are going to get hurt? Because they have been audited, and reaudited. 
   The General Accounting Office has looked at it and concluded, like no other study, that U.S. Navy ships are totally safe, never having had an accident since the Nautilus was launched in 1954. 
   We are here today arguing about whether we can safely take spent fuel rods--not in a pond of water where, if something happens, it goes everywhere. But we are talking about whether we  can haul it down the road or highway and take it somewhere. It is on all the oceans of the world, and nobody is even talking about it. 
   Then we are arguing about, once you get it there, it is just too scary to think of storing it there. 
   France has about 80 percent of its energy in nuclear. They get the benefits of what I am bringing to the surface now--there is no air pollution to speak of in France because nuclear power does not create the air pollution we are worried about with reference to global warming. 
   The United States of America runs around the world negotiating how to clean our air so we will not have global warming. And here we're talking about the principal source of electricity that would be totally clean. We scare our people to death about moving fuel rods down a highway when the oceans and seas of the world have nuclear power plants floating under water and on top of the water by virtue of 100 U.S. Navy ships at sea. 
   Actually, France, which I just described, does not today have a permanent repository. 
   You heard the argument, fellow Senators, and those listening, that we don't want to have interim storage until we have a permanent repository for certain. 
   I think France is pretty concerned about the health and safety of their constituents, the French people. They aren't building 
   underground repositories yet because they are very satisfied with having interim, temporary storage. Sooner perhaps than later, they will find a way to use that spent fuel, which is highly radiated, either to produce more energy, or they will break it into its components and make sure they can safely put it somewhere. 
   There is no question in this Senator's mind, that this is a big issue. This is America trying to turn science, engineering, and safety on its head to try to make fear where there is no reality of fear, to try to conclude that this great Nation cannot take care of the nuclear waste coming out of our powerplants with the end product being no more nuclear power. 
   What a shame, if that happened in the Nation that started it, that led it, that built the safest reactors in the world--safer than 20 or 30 coal-burning, electricity-generating plants, or any kind of plant. 
   What if we as a matter of fact kill nuclear power while the rest of the world proceeds to use it in China, Japan, Europe? We're doing that by not finding a way to do the easiest part of the fuel cycle, which is to temporarily put spent fuel somewhere in a repository of interim measure? 
   It would appear to me that, innocently or intentionally, those who oppose it are failing to recognize the significance of the future of nuclear energy and nuclear power for America and for a world that wants to be clean and wants to have growth and prosperity without global warming. 
   From my standpoint, not only do I refute the argument that this is not important, that there are other issues more important. 
   I want to say that the President is making a very big mistake for America's future by vetoing this compromise bill. The Congress passed it in both bodies overwhelmingly. Now, because of his veto ban, we need 66 votes in the Senate. That is probably too hard to do for an issue such as this. But sooner or later, a President will sign a bill. I am hoping it is sooner. 
   Obviously, we shouldn't try it again with the current President because it won't fly. But I personally believe the day will come soon when we will have the repository, wherever it is, and we will not come to the floor of the Senate and hearken back to the numerous times we have denied the validity and credibility of the fact that it can be easily and safely transported and easily and safely put in 30- to 50-year interim repositories. 
   I yield the floor. I thank the Senate for listening.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I will say this on a subject we will be together on. I understand that the parity for insurance purposes for the mentally ill in America bill--the Domenici-Wellstone bill for total parity--not some piece of parity, no discrimination of outreach, we are going to have a hearing soon, right?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Some people will recognize that, even according to WELLSTONE, DOMENICI is right sometimes. I thank the Senator very much. 
   I wish to take a few minutes to speak now because I am not at all sure that tomorrow, or even the next day, I could speak to this issue, so I am going to do it tonight. I want to start by saying that it is really good for Americans--whoever watches C-SPAN, or whoever pays attention to what we are saying on the floor--to hear speeches about how we are going to improve education for every child in America, or even to hear speeches about the Federal Government needing to do more of what it has been doing, or speeches saying if we just paid attention and took care of things, all these children in America the education system would improve. 
   Let's be realistic, for starters. We don't pay for much of public education. Now, considering the tone of the arguments about what we ought to be doing for education and for all our children, one would never believe that we only pay for about 7 to 8 percent of what it costs to educate a child in the public schools of Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Iowa--I won't say New Mexico because we get about 9 percent, because we have a lot more children who are dependent upon the Federal Government in terms of military establishments, plus our Indian children. But let's make sure everybody knows that this great national debate on education is talking about 7 percent of what is used to fund the public schools of America in the 50 sovereign States. 
   Let's make sure we understand fundamentally the States--in some places counties, in other places cities--collect local taxes, in some cases property taxes, in other cases sales taxes, in other cases income taxes--not here in  Washington, but in the capital of Santa Fe, NM, or in the great State of Pennsylvania, or the State of Oregon or Washington--they collect the money, they have the programs, and they decide between the State, the legislature, the school districts, and in many places, commissioners of education, what to do with all the real money that is applied to the public education system and, thus, the students of America. 
   So it may shock some to know that education reform is occurring in the State capitals, at the education departments across America, and our debate is about a little, tiny margin of 7 to 8 or 8 1/2 percent of what goes into each student. We are doing this in the context of trying to improve and help our public schools, because we have been greatly enhanced, as a nation, during past generations, when the public education system of America was the model for the world. What many of us are trying to do is take it back to the glory days when every student received a better education and the manifold problems that teachers experienced in the classrooms today were, in some way, alleviated so more of our children can learn. 
   In doing that, the issue is, for this little share that the Federal Government sends down to our school districts by way of special grants, hundreds of categorical programs, title I programs, 
   which is $8 billion or $9 billion, all of those programs go down and help in some way in the total mix of dollars and programs that the cities and counties and States and commissioners of education put together. 
   The question is, Can we do better with our small amount of money than we have been doing? Let me assure the Senators that whichever side they are on on this bill, to reform the education system, which is reported out by our Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, that this is one of their education functions--this bill, in essence--and it may shock people to know this--provides an opportunity to leave things just as they are. So for those on that side of the aisle, or perhaps one or two on our side of the aisle--I don't know--that say they want the Federal Government to continue to be involved in all these programs and to be telling everybody how to run them, so that 7 or 8 percent of the money generates 50 percent of the paperwork, we want that to continue. Just wait and read the bill in its entirety and if that is what you like, the school boards, the commissioners of education, or the Governors who run education in our States can decide to leave it just as it is. 
   Now, I can't understand how schoolteachers can be against an approach that says this is not working as well as it should. But if you like it, please understand this bill says you can keep having it like it is. That is why we call it a menu. 
   You get to look at a menu. If you went out to eat, you wouldn't like to have in front of you three items we have been having for 15 years. And our nutrition isn't working well, and our bodies aren't feeling well, but we get the same restaurant menu of the same three things. Wouldn't we like it if the menu added a few other things just to try? 
   This is a new approach only in that you can keep it as it is or you have another couple of choices. 
   What is wrong with some choice which might bring some innovation, which might cause us to do better with our 7 or 8 percent of education than we are doing, because it might let the States, the school districts, the education commissioners, and the principals meld our dollars into their needs in a better way. 
   If you want to keep it as it is, you can come down here and say: That is what I want; I am voting for this bill; and I sure hope my State keeps it as it is. Right? We sure hope whoever wants to say that, that we will keep the same menu we have been having, and we don't want to add to the menu, we don't want to add to the choice. 
   It is wonderful to be a Republican who can come to the floor and say: We don't think the menu we have been delivering to the schools of America with our 8 percent is a very good menu. It is not the best menu, and we are going to provide some additional items of choice. 
   I want to thank a few Senators for taking the early lead on this. 
   In that regard, I want to recognize Senator SLADE GORTON because he is the first one who came up with the idea, albeit it was a piece of education, to say let them choose down there, but if they don't want to choose, let them keep on doing what they are doing, but here is a new opportunity to handle those Federal dollars differently. 
   That imaginary, innovative, visionary idea has been expanded so now there are a number of really interesting choices that those who educate our children in our sovereign States can choose. 
   Essentially, if I went no further and did not explain the choices on this menu, I think I might have performed a minor service for those who are interested to find out that the bill we are talking about says the old menu doesn't work, let's try a new menu and put some new items on it--not mandatory, but that you can choose. 
   Let me tell you how poorly we do our job at the national level when we decide we are going to do more than that and we are going to put a little bit of money in and tell everybody what to do. Let me talk about special education for a minute. 
   Special education is an admirable commitment--in fact, some would think one of the greatest civil commitments that could be made in the field of education. The National Government began not many years ago to say you are going to educate children who are hard to educate, who are special education children, and special needs children. And we came along and said exactly how you should do it; if you want our money, you do it this way. The courts interpreted and told you in even more detail how you are going to do it. Lo and behold, we said we will pay for 40 percent and the States and localities will pay for 60 percent. 
   Is anyone interested tonight? Take out a piece of paper and write down your guess of this year as to how much we are paying of the 40 percent. If you think we must be paying 35 or 38, you are desperately wrong. We are currently paying 11 percent instead of the 40 percent to which we committed, and the years have passed us by. 
   If you run the school and you get Federal money, don't you think you would be a little bit upset if we came along and told you how to do it, and then we didn't give you the money but our law 
    said we would give you the money? 
   I have to compliment a couple of Senators who have said the best thing we could do is put more money in special education so the schools wouldn't be paying so much for it, and that would loosen up money for them to do other things with. In particular, Senator JUDD GREGG has been a leader on that initiative. 
   It goes unnoticed because it is not very politically sexy, at least to the general public, to say we have increased the funding for special education by 4 or 5 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. That doesn't sound like coming to the floor and giving a speech about how we want to take care of every child in America, when we are only paying for 8 percent of the bill, and how we ought to be taking care of all those needs out there when the Government doesn't even try to take care of most of them. 
   We still have a commitment to 40 percent. We are only paying for 11 percent of that. We come along and have a bill, and people want more of the same. I think educators would like to try something different. 
   I congratulate the committee because they reported out a bill that has some very exciting items added to the menu. I suggest people can call it what they like in terms of trying to describe the new items on the menu. But I see it as an opportunity on the part of the constitutionally enfranchised leader in a State, whether it is a commissioner of education, or the legislature, or the Governor. This bill says you can collapse the strings, you can collapse the rigid boundaries in two different ways--at least two. One is an approach that is called Straight A's. 
   The Straight A's Program says there is an option for 15 States--not all of them, and they don't need to take it. But 15 States can opt for a State demonstration program. It will be for at least a 5-year commitment on the part of the Federal Government and up to--isn't that interesting?--13 big grant programs and little grant programs can be collapsed.  
   The thing that makes them rigid and makes them kind of a one-shoe-fits-all concept on education is that up to 13 can be collapsed. They can collapse five of them, if they choose, and leave the other eight as being as rigid as they currently are. 
   In that ability to collapse under Straight A's is an option to use title I money--our biggest program--in that manner along with other programs. 
   That is not going to be free to the school districts of America, nor to the principals and teachers, because commensurate with it is going to be an agreement on the part of the States. The States are going to agree, if they take this option, this added menu item, to a significant new standard of student achievement within their schools. 
   They are going to figure out a way locally to see if collapsing these programs and administering them differently helps the schools. We are going to say you can continue to do this if you have a plan to improve student achievement, which we choose to call accountability. 
   We also talk about the collapsing of the rigidity of the program--the rigid boundaries. We call that flexibility. 
   I think it is kind of better to say you are permitted to collapse the programs, administer them less rigidly, and require student achievement, and in return measure student achievement. But if you want to choose the Straight A's Program, my guess is that 15 States are going to run quickly to get it and it will be used by 15 States. In the end, they are going to be saying: Let's try this new thing. Let's see if we can collapse these programs and do a better job. The agreement with the Government will require that achievement occur at every level, including those covered by the current Title I program. 
   We have said if you do not want that menu item, because it is a pretty big step away from what we have, there is another one called Performance Partnerships which the Government permitted. You can collapse up to 13 programs, but that cannot include Title I, the program whereby we measure aid to schools based upon the number of poor children in the school. 
   What we are saying there is the Secretary of Education will still be able to determine the boundary and use of Title I money. That is a second option--collapsing up to 13. But the Secretary still keeps his finger on the Title I money. The Governors thought that would be a very good option, and we put that in. 
    I don't see anything wrong with that. 
   Then we say for 10 States and 20 school districts, in exchange for new accountability, new agreements on student achievement, you can switch the current Title I funding from school based to a child-centered approach. Isn't that interesting? We are not interested in school-based education programs. That is just a mechanism for talking about an institution that educates children. 
   It seems to me what we are talking about is that all the programs should be child centered and we are going to give 10 States and 20 school districts the option to choose a new funding mechanism for Title I. Eight billion dollars is my recollection of the $14.6 billion we spend on elementary and secondary education. It is more than half. We are going to say for these few States and few school districts, you want to be bold? Want to enter into a student achievement agreement? In exchange for that, you get the opportunity to have Title I money follow the students. 
   I close by saying that the committee did another exciting thing. We are all concerned about improving teacher quality. Whether we have excellent teachers or not, I don't think we ought to pass judgment on the floor. We hear many of the schools are worried that teachers are not necessarily as highly qualified as the principals, the superintendents, the school boards, and the parents want them to be. We understand that is a major, major concern. We think part of it is because we don't have an adequate way of helping develop better teachers. 
   We have decided to have a new State teacher development grant program, with a substantially larger amount of money, about $2 billion for fiscal year 2001, that focuses on the long term and sustained development of teachers, and includes professional development for administrators and principals. There will be some who will come to the floor and say right now that we don't have all this in one pot of money. We have some very special programs--one is the Eisenhower program--that we want to leave alone. Why do we want to leave them alone? Shouldn't we give the States an option to say they don't need all that preciseness, if they want to use it in their school districts in their State to produce long-term benefits by way of teachers being better equipped to teach their subject matter? 
   There is much more to say and I will have printed the 13 programs that can be collapsed and made less than 13 in either the Straight A's or the performance partnership. I will include that list in the RECORD to be attached to my comments. Some of the attached lists are technical, but those in the education community who would be interested will know what the programs are. 
   Let me summarize. For those on the other side of the aisle who want to talk about education as if we are debating the funding of public schools in America, let's put it back where it belongs. We are debating funding 7 to 8 percent of the public education in America. That is all we provide. One would not guess it from the rhetoric about what we ought to get done with that 7 or 8 percent. 
   We will hear speeches that we ought to totally perfect the education system and take care of every child in America. What is the responsibility for the 93 percent of the dollars that come from the State or the county? They are doing that with that money. 
   First, we will say, if you want to keep the system, keep it. It is almost hard to understand how the other side and the President can get so worked up they won't pass this bill. Really, they could say to their constituents, we are so sure our programs of the past are good, we will vote for this bill and you can choose to go with a program of the past. The bill says that. If you want a program from the past, you can have it. 
   That is the debate. They want the programs of the past reiterated but we say, no, no, let's give you that choice and give you a few other new choices. The choices are exciting because we may find by entering into a multiyear student achievement agreement 
    called accountability, where some flexibility is provided, that 7 or 8 percent might make a difference. It might be such that at the end of 5 years, using it that way by choice, you might really have an impact. 
   If we continue the way we are, we will produce a bill, or no bill, if the President insists on getting what he wants. I have not argued 1 second today about who will put the money in the program. We are probably going to put as much money in the program as the Democrats in the appropriations process. We will fund at very close to the same amount of dollars. Let's not get off on the side that the Republicans don't want to pay for education. We want to try a different approach. 
   There are some who will say to be different we want to offer a whole bunch of amendments for the Federal Government to do new things. We will tell them how to do things. We have been doing that and every 5 years we have another list, but it is the Federal Government's list of how to fix up our kids. However, if you look back, it isn't working. It is not the Federal dollar that is not working. We are just a little bit of the money. We ought to try to figure out how our little bit of the money can be the most helpful to those spending all the money--93 percent of the dollar in some cases. How can we help them do a better job? I think it is a shame if this bill and this concept gets defeated in the Senate because we don't want to try a new approach, or if we want to add to it a variety of measures not relevant to this education bill. 
   These are issues that must be debated. Some Members want to put them on this bill to either kill it or make us vote on issues not part of this. Whoever does that, the final judgment will be simple. If you kill this bill with this innovative approach of different items on the menu for our schools in America's sovereign States, if you kill that either by nonperformance or an outright vote against it and kill it, you have decided the Federal Government in all cases knows best and we ought to continue to tell our educators, superintendents, and commissioners of education precisely how they can help  their children with our dollars. No more, no less; do it our way. 
   I frankly believe, although I hate to say this in political tones, I think for the first time, in the case of this Senator--and I have been here awhile--we can debate this any way we want. We won't lose this debate. We win this, unless we let somebody pull the wool over our eyes about what we are trying to do, what we have been doing and just how much of the Federal money is involved versus the State and cities that we don't control-- 
   States, counties and school boards. I think everybody will understand we ought to permit innovation, not rigidity by dictating specifically how moneys ought to be used. 
   That is a little lengthy for tonight. Some people know it is not so lengthy for me. But it is the second speech I made today. I spoke about nuclear power with as much energy and enthusiasm as I did on this bill. 
   I am saying, as I leave the floor of the Senate, there are some very good Senators who will take over and I am satisfied will close out the day with some pretty good remarks about where we ought to be trying to move in lockstep with those who really want to change education at the local level, instead of walking along, kicking at them, telling them do it our way. I think we ought to walk along in some sort of lockstep by letting them have some real choice. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. As I indicated a while ago, I was planning to leave the floor. But my friend caught my attention when he, it seemed to me, wanted me to stay around. I have been around long enough to hear his kind remarks about me, and I thank him. Before I make a speech as I did tonight, I do try to understand what I am talking about. Sometimes I go back to my office after hearing something down here, or watching it, and say, I'll wait a week and really know something about this. But I think I do know something about this. 
   I was a teacher once. I can tell you things have changed very little. You talk about the disparity in the preparation of children. The one year I taught I had one class in mathematics. One half of the class could not add or subtract, and the other half of the class was doing algebra. This was a long time ago. I was 22 years old, so that is how long ago. Sunday I will be 68. We still have the same thing. We have a difficult job for teachers. 
   I think the Senator is correct. He is the one who offered the first bill to provide some choice instead of rigid, bound-up programs where, instead of walking together, we were kicking them to do it our way or not use our money. You were the starter, the charger of that, along with Senator BILL FRIST of Tennessee. A little bit of that expertise came about by accident out of the Budget Committee, on which you both serve. We had a task force, the Senator may recall. We asked the GAO--a very significant number of them worked with your staff and his staff on the Budget Committee and told you about the programs that were out there hanging around, but they wondered what they were doing. You provide the first opportunity to pull some together and collapse the rigidity. Right?

   Mr. DOMENICI. I can also remember when you first thought about this idea. We were walking down one of the halls here and 
   you were saying you didn't quite understand how you could get around all the opposition to trying something different. I think I pulled on your arm and said, ``Why don't you give them the option to leave it like it is?'' 
   You are pretty quick. You never asked me again. But that has become the cornerstone, from your bill to this bill. For those who think what we are doing is really good and really right, that we are not trying to take it away. Right? Those people who say that is not enough, what must they be saying?

   Frankly, that is thought by some to be a very good argument against the bill, right? I think it is a very good argument in favor of it, I would think, if what we are doing is so good that under all circumstances a significant portion of the school districts and superintendents and commissioners of education would go down the same path for another 5 years.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation, the Nuclear Weapons Complex Conversion Act of 2000, to dramatically improve our programs that deal with non-proliferation risks associated with the Former Soviet Union. My legislation will also significantly enhance our ability to consider future arms control agreements. 
   Today, we face challenges involving the warheads, materials, and expertise developed during the days of the Cold War. With that War behind us, arguably the greatest global security challenge involves containment and management of proliferation threats--many of which are in danger of being fueled with former Soviet capabilities. 
   Congress has repeatedly demonstrated frustration with the Administration's progress in this key area. A significant part of this concern arises from today's wide range of uncoordinated programs, all dealing with non-proliferation issues. Programs aren't integrated into one coherent thrust led by a focused and committed Administration. Our non-proliferation programs resemble a patchwork quilt designed and executed by several artists. 
   The net effect of our non-proliferation programs is far less than it could be and needs to be. These programs are begging for coherent oversight and inter-agency cooperation. To address this need, which is far from new, the 1996 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation called for appointment of a new-level non-proliferation czar. 
   This Administration never acted on this law. Without this coordination, inter-agency turf fights remain unresolved, potential synergies aren't exploited, and redundancy and inefficiency can run rampant. My legislation therefore expresses a Sense of Congress that the time is long overdue for this coordination. 
   My legislation also deals specifically with the largest unmet challenges of the former Soviet Russian nuclear weapons complex. That complex contains three main challenges: weapons production capacity, materials for those weapons, and people. 
   Programs associated with the materials, where goals and progress are easier to define and measure, are demonstrating credible progress. But, the other areas present more complex challenges. 
   The ``brain drain'' issue reflects a concern that scientists and engineers with critical knowledge might sell their knowledge to rogue states. The weapons production issue raises concern about Russia's ability to rapidly reconstitute forces that could invalidate future arms control agreements. These twin issues then, non-proliferation and the credibility of future arms control agreements, urgently need improved approaches. 
   We already have a Nuclear Cities Initiative within the Department of Energy, but it has barely begun to scratch the surface in dealing with the problem of their cash-strapped and over-sized nuclear complex. To date, NCI has not garnered enough Congressional support to have stable and realistic funding, largely because it hasn't set goals and milestones against which progress can be documented and measured. 
   The concerns on weapon production capabilities highlight very large asymmetries. The U.S. has significantly reduced the size of our nuclear weapons production complex. These reductions were accomplished openly, and are transparent to Russia. Russia, in contrast, has barely started to downsize its complex. Their complex is still sized at Cold War levels. 
   Little information about the Russian complex is shared, and ten of its most sensitive cities remain closed. Although the Russian Federal Ministry of Atomic Energy has announced its intent to significantly downsize its workforce, it has been slow in accomplishing this goal and any progress is very closely held.  
   The current Nuclear Cities Initiative was established to assist Russia in creating job opportunities for employees who are not required to support realistic Russian security requirements and to facilitate conversion of the production facilities. It has focused on creation of commercial ventures that provide self-sustaining jobs, primarily in three of the closed cities. The current program scope, progress, and funding are not consistent with the scale of the threats to us. 
   I want to significantly advance our progress in the nuclear cities. However, to gain sufficient advocacy for a major funding increase, the program must demonstrate rapid progress in downsizing and an ability for the U.S. to track progress against verifiable milestones that support a Russian complex consistent with their future 
   national security requirements. 
   My legislation substantially increases the funding and scope of our programs with the Russian nuclear weapons complex to assist the Russian Federation in restructuring its complex, but does this conditioned on a commitment from the Russian Federation to measure progress against realistic, transparent milestones. Without their commitment, and without an ability to track progress against such milestones, it is simply not appropriate for us to continue to fund programs within their complex. 
   My legislation supports the ongoing commercialization programs in their complex. In addition, however, it authorizes the federal government to contract for research in support of United States agencies in cases where the Russians have unique capabilities and facilities. 
   My legislation demands that funding for this expanded program, for the 2002 fiscal year and beyond, be contingent on making significant measurable progress on key issues of strategic interest to both countries, including: 
   Demonstrable conversion from military to civilian activities at the four cities participating in the FY 2001 program. 
   Development of a ten year plan by the Russian Federation for a nuclear weapons complex downsized to reflect the changing national security needs of Russia. This plan should reflect a production capacity consistent with future arms control agreements. 
   Increased transparency of Russian production capacity and nuclear materials inventories to eventually match that of the United States. 
   In addition, my legislation authorizes funding for educational initiatives both in the United States and in the Former Soviet Union focused on developing new non-proliferation experts. There are now few people who can assist in these difficult downsizing processes while, at the same time, minimizing the threat presented by residual weapons material or expertise. 
   Significant cooperation from the Russian government must occur for milestones to be set and met. That won't happen unless they concur that these steps are also in their best interests. From interactions with senior levels of their Ministry of Atomic Energy, I've learned that they share the view that progress in this area is in the best interests of both nations. 
   It is certainly in our mutual interests to accomplish the transition of both nations' nuclear weapons complexes with as much care and as little proliferation risk as possible. It is also in each nation's interests for the other to maintain a sufficiently credible complex to support realistic national security objectives. To the extent that we can take these steps in a mutually transparent way, we should be able to assure each other of our future intentions. 
   Mr. President, this legislation can significantly impact our non-proliferation and future arms control national security objectives.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the marriage penalty is the extra tax a couple pays as a result of being married. When a couple says ``I do'' they  are really saying ``IRS, we will pay.'' The tax code has 63 provisions that penalize couples for being married. There are more than 20 income phase-outs and each is a marriage penalty. The two biggest marriage penalizers are the standard deduction and the tax brackets. Fairness would dictate that the standard deduction for a couple should be twice what it is for a single taxpayer. Fairness would dictate that the tax bracket income cut-off points for a married couple should be twice that of a single taxpayer. That is not the way the current code is structured. This bill would restore fairness. 
   About 25 million married couples annually are adversely affected by the marriage penalty. Average marriage penalty is $1,400. If we eliminated the marriage penalty, the typical family would have an extra $1,400 to pay the electric bill for nine months, pay for three months of day care, pay for a five-day vacation at Disneyland or eat out 35 times. 
   There wasn't always a marriage penalty. Prior to 1948 the tax code taxed individuals, but today, the marriage penalty has infiltrated the entire tax code. It didn't matter when most women stayed at home, but now that so many women work it is indefensible to have the marriage penalty in our law. A working wife often works to support the federal government, more than she works to help her family, because the first dollar she earns is taxed at the highest rate her husband's income is taxed. Some economists call this the ``second earner bias'' because the income of the secondary earner is stacked on top of the primary earner's income resulting in a relatively high marginal rate. 
   Of the 27 OECD countries 19 countries taxed husbands and wives separately so there is no marriage penalty. The biggest culprits are the standard deduction and the tax brackets. 
   The standard deduction for two individuals filing single returns is not twice what the standard deduction for a married couple filing a joint return is. It isn't but, it should be. 
   Marriage penalty hits low income workers. Eligibility for the earned income credit is the same for single heads of households and married couples. Combining two incomes on a joint return may push a couple into the phase-out range of the EIC and reduce the size of their credit. 
   As I mentioned, a growing number of tax provisions--credits and deductions--are phased-out at certain income ranges. Any tax provision that has an income phase-out contributes to the marriage penalty. Few of us probably ever stop to think about the marriage penalty when we vote for tax provisions with income phase-outs. Some phase-outs start as low as $10,000 of income. The dependent credit, the elderly credit and earned income credit have phase out ranges that compound the marriage penalty for the working poor. 
   Several provisions have phase-outs in the $50,000 to $75,000 in income range which add to the marriage penalty of the two income middle class families. The dependent credit, the Hope education credit, the elderly credit, adoption credit; the IRA deduction and the Education loan interest expense deductions. Itemized deduction threshold, personal exemption, all get ``marriage penalty-ed'' out of existence for many married couples with modest incomes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on our side, I do not intend to yield back time until Republican Senators have indicated to me they do not want any time. I do not know why we need a full hour and a half on our side, and I do not know why they need a full hour and a half plus 1 hour, which is 2 1/2 hours on their side. 
   I yield myself time off my hour and a half. 
   I noted a minute ago that present on the floor was Senator SNOWE. While I wish to discuss a number of issues, I want to say to her, and to those who supported her, that because of her diligence, this budget resolution has a reserve fund of $40 billion to be used for Medicare prescription drugs and Medicare reform. 
   Frankly, I note that the House, at least on the majority side, is already discussing what they would do. Clearly, this $40 billion will go to the Finance Committee of the Senate because Senator SNOWE, Senator WYDEN, and Senator SMITH in the committee worked very hard to get it done. I will say what has changed so I will not, in any way, overstate the case as to what Senator WYDEN did. 
   But essentially because of OLYMPIA SNOWE's dedication, we put $40 billion in a reserve fund. That means the Finance Committee can go to work on a bill, and the money is waiting for them to do a bill that meets the mandates or the qualifications of this reserve fund. We have, as she requested, up to $20 billion for prescription drugs and up to $20 billion for reforming the system so that it will do a better job and a more efficient job while we are adding some new benefits. 
   I think everybody who has looked at it thinks that is what we ought the do. 
   In committee, there was a mandatory date by which this had to be done. In conference with the House, that was refused. So we won half the battle. We got the $20 billion and the $20 billion, as I have described, which is $40 billion, but we did not get the mandatory date. We are going to have to rely upon the impetus that will accrue over the ensuing days because of the House action and the desire of this body to have our Finance Committee produce a bill. I have every confidence that they will. 
   Having said that, I yield myself about 10 minutes to describe where we are. 
   If, in fact, we adopt this budget resolution this evening, I say we are getting better all the time at getting our job done. The occupant of the Chair will be pleased to know we have had a Budget Act for a long time, since 1974. For all those years, if we produce this budget tonight, we will have produced three budget resolutions on time. That means April 15 had come and gone most years, and we could not get our job done because it was so contentious and so difficult. It will mean that 2 years in a row--last year and this year--for the first time in history, we adopted a budget resolution on time, by April 15. 
   That speaks for itself. It means, however, that we can get started on the work that must be done to implement this work. We can get started sooner, earlier. With the hard work that is going to be done predominantly by the Appropriations Committees, and the Finance Committee in our body, we may very well get most of our work done in a very timely manner and be able to leave here before our respective conventions with the people's business having been accomplished. 
   I think that would be a pretty good achievement. I will agree that it has been a very hard job. I will also indicate openly, it was very difficult for me. This work is about as difficult as any I have done in getting something accomplished. Again, it is partisan. We produced it with Republican votes. That is the way it normally is on a budget resolution. Then we will proceed to try to implement it. We will do our best. 
   Let me summarize, so everybody will know what this 
   resolution does. Then, in due course, we can hear from the other side as to what they think it does not do and what they would like to do. 
   But I say to the Senate, I have seen an atmosphere that indicates the theory which I adopted--starting last year when we had a big surplus--that we better take a little bit of this money and allocate it to the taxpayers is resonating every day, with more and more assurance that if we do not, there will not be any surplus. 
   I know the occupant of the chair is a fiscally responsible person. He has his ideas. I see new bills being proposed because, indeed, we have a surplus. People have not done anything for 40 or 50 years, and they are introducing a bill that would cost anywhere from $2 to $5 billion, and all of a sudden it becomes expedient that we do it, and we must do it now. 
   We hear about all kinds of new bills that are now big-need items in America. Let me suggest, for those who say it is too early to have tax relief, if we do not do it pretty soon, there will be no surplus left for the taxpayer. 
   Our budget resolution says: If you can, Senate and House, produce some tax relief. It says if you cannot, all that money, over 5 years, goes to the debt, I say to my good friend, Senator GORTON. 
   But let me suggest that we are right; we ought to put in money to have some tax relief. I will give you the paramount reason for that. On this floor, immediately prior to the consideration of this budget resolution conference report, what were we discussing? We were discussing the marriage tax penalty reform--meaning married couples in America, including the couples married this year, when they file that April 15 tax return early next week, they are going to be penalized, on average, $1,400 because they are married. 
   Why should we wait around for another decade, when there are the kind of surpluses we have seen in this budget resolution, to provide tax relief for the American people? 
   The Democrats have been arguing: The Republicans are going to enhance the rich of America with their tax bill. They are going to use this relief and give it all to the rich people. 
   It should come as no surprise that 50 percent of the tax relief we are talking about--$64 billion; almost 50 percent--is going to go to cure the marriage tax penalty. There may be some who will get up and say that is helping the rich. But I am saying, it is something most Americans do not believe is American law. Most Americans say: Are you kidding? Are we punishing two people who are married, who work, who file joint returns? The answer is yes, and we want to fix it. 
   For those who say wait until we fix Social Security, wait until we fix Medicare, wait until we fund all these programs we now see as desperately needed, wait until we fund the President's programs--I say to Senator GORTON, that is a 14-percent increase in domestic spending--just fund it, there will not be any money for Social Security. If you do that 3 years in a row, there is no money for tax relief, and you are using the Social Security surplus, which is for 3 years of domestic funding at the level of the President. 
   So what is risky? They say it is risky to have marriage tax penalty relief provided for in this bill. I say it is not risky; it is absolutely necessary. It is urgent. 
   America must show we are concerned about married couples. There is a very longstanding belief in America and in the world, that we ought to try to promote family life, if we can, and married couples trying to struggle through it. 
   It is not too early. It is the right time. But if we do not do it, I can see it coming between all the new needs that are going to be prescribed for this budget that we have not done in the past, that we are going to have to add to this huge Federal expenditure called the budget, and there will be nothing for marriage tax penalty relief or any kind of tax relief. 
   So once again, this budget says, over 5 years, $150 billion can be used in tax relief. Right off the bat, when somebody on the other side says it is for the rich, I want everybody to understand  almost half of it is for the marriage tax penalty reform. 
   Second, we don't touch a nickel of Social Security. We have Senator ABRAHAM's part of this resolution which for the next year says the lockbox applies and makes it part of the budget resolution that you need 60 votes to touch or use the Social Security surplus. Then to make it even more logical, we put $170 billion against the public debt this year, the biggest installment on the debt in the history of the Republic, $1 trillion over the next 5 years. This is an enormous payment on the debt. Nothing similar was ever assumed 5 years ago or 10 years ago or, I imagine, for the last three or four decades. 
   In addition, because of Senator SNOWE's initiative, we provide $40 billion on Medicare and prescription drugs. 
   On the tax relief--just to show the equity of it all--we put $170 billion on the debt, and we have $13 billion in tax relief in the first year, between 12 and 13. The ratio is about 12 to 1, almost 13 to 1 of debt reduction versus tax relief. Over the 5 years, it is about 8 to 1 in debt reduction versus tax relief. That is pretty good fairness, since we are talking about tax fairness in this budget resolution. 
   All spending will increase $212 billion over the next 5 years. That includes the $40 billion for prescription drugs. There will be NIH, science, funds for military, funds for health, funds for military retirees, veterans and other high-priority items. 
   Frankly, I hope we pass this resolution and proceed to prove we tried to try to do this. We think this is the right budget for our time. If we don't hold down spending, except for high-priority items such as defense, education, science, NIH and the like, then the married couples of America can say goodbye to any tax relief as it might affect them and make their commitment to the institution of marriage and family life a little less difficult. After we have done marriage tax penalty relief, we will do something on the tax side for small business, which is the cornerstone of our great success in the last 6 years. We will talk about that later. 
   With that, unless one of my Republican Senators wants part of my time, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I thank the Senate for its attention.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished ranking minority member would agree with me on a request. Senator GORTON is going to preside at 4 o'clock. He wonders, if he arrives on the floor 4 or 5 minutes before having to preside, if he could speak on my time for 5 minutes.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes in rebuttal. Then I will be glad to yield time to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
   First, let me explain what we have done on Medicare. 
   Before any tax relief is provided in terms of dollar numbers, we have already used $40 billion of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. That is waiting for the committee, at which time it is assigned to them. We are not gambling. We are saying that is it. As a matter of fact, we are saying if you do not do it, it goes to the debt. 
   What do we provide with the $40 billion? There is a little, tiny bit of difference between the way we and others see it. And we think there will be a majority for this view when the bill finally gets considered. We say there is $40 billion. We say if you do no reform of the program, there is $20 billion. Let me repeat that. If you do no reform, there is $20 billion for prescription drugs. If you do some reform to stabilize the program, you can use the whole $40 billion for prescription drugs. 
   That is what Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE of Maine had as the underpinnings of her approach. She wanted some reform. But she wanted to make sure, even if we could not do that, we started a prescription drug program with $20 billion. 
   If the committee does something like the Breaux-Frist--that is a bipartisan approach--with some reform in Medicare, you understand the Medicare program will be insolvent in about 13 years. I don't think seniors want us to add a benefit that will make it run out of money sooner. I think they would be asking us to see if we could fix it and make it more responsive, more modern, to give them more money for prescription drugs. 
   Let me repeat that we are not taking this money from anyone. It is aside and apart from the tax relief we are asking for, such as the marriage tax penalty reform that the other side has been delaying here on the floor. 
   We are saying $40 billion is set for Medicare, and it has two purposes. If you do not reform and make the program more modern so it has a chance of surviving longer, you can use $20 billion of it. It says so in the resolution for prescription drugs. But if you do something such as the Breaux-Frist reform, which is fixing the program, you can use the $40 billion of new money for prescription drugs. 
   Frankly, I think it is a responsible way to handle a very difficult problem because if you do not ask for some reform to get the full $40 billion, we are going to have $40 billion, and the program next year is not going to be any better off. Then seniors are going to ask: Now what happens? We have prescription drugs, but we are still not going to have any money to pay our regular bills in about 13 years. 
   I think we are pushing both at the same time. 
   Let me make my last observation with reference to the difference between the two parties. 
   All of them are going to vote against this. It really says you cannot pass the marriage tax penalty which is going to cost the Treasury about $64 billion over 5 years in the name of fairness to married couples. You can't pass that, they say, until you have done all of these other things that Government wants done for the Government. And there will never be a time when we are going to have a surplus to give to the hard-working people of this country, in particular, relief items such as the marriage tax penalty. There is not going to be any money around. Don't kid anyone. There is a very big difference. 
   I ask that you take a visual inventory with me about the announcements of late by the administration, the Secretary of Energy, and many others: We have new programs on which we have to spend money. 
   It isn't enough that the President already provided a 14-percent increase in domestic discretionary. There are all the new needs. 
   What money will they use for the ``pay fors''? Does anybody have any idea? Is the money coming from heaven? New manna in the desert? Of course not. It will be the surplus we think ought to go back to the taxpayer in the form of tax relief after we spent money to increase government. 
   We have money to increase government, but how much is enough? I think there is enough money available to leave a little bit. I rechecked my notes, and the tax relief in this first year is $11.6 billion; the debt reduction is $170 billion. How can anyone say we are not reducing the debt when that is the largest payment on the national debt in the history of the Republic? This resolution says: Don't touch Social Security. You will reduce it by $1 trillion--hardly a number we can understand--and still have a little bit left over for such things as tax relief for married couples in America. 
   That is the big difference. They want to wait, we don't know how long, but perhaps until we solve every problem we have in government with reference to Medicare and everything else. Don't give the taxpayer back even this little tiny amount. 
   I hope the Republicans will support this. I am very proud of the difference. 
   They would not have put more than $40 billion in for Medicare if they were producing their own resolution. That is about the right number on which they could get consensus on their side of the aisle. They would not put 50 or 60 or 80. If you put 40 in, there is money left over for the taxpayer. That is the truth of the budget resolution. 
   There will be a historic debate on education reform in a couple of weeks. I am very pleased to know we have probably had something to do with precipitating that reform debate. There is enough money to increase education. It is obvious to this Senator the Republicans are not going to go for an increase in education money if it is status quo for education, if we are going to do more of the same, because more of the same isn't good enough. We need to do something very different in education and spend more money doing it. We are going to have an opportunity to have that discussed. 
   This conference report assumes $45.6 billion in 2001 for the Department of Education. That is overall, for everything--a $10 billion increase. Not exactly for what the President wants but overall in this function. That is what is provided. 
   This is an election year. The administration and Secretary Richardson have the latest idea to take care of anyone who worked in a nuclear facility over the last 50 or 60 years. I know they are good sounding bills, but it is also an election year. 
   I say to the taxpayer and to married couples of America, beware of an election year. In this country, an election year means they want to spend all your money and try to convince you that is right, leaving nothing to repair problems in tax law such as the marriage tax penalty. Beware. They will have more spending programs than you ever  heard of, including a 14-percent increase in domestic discretionary spending by the President in his budget in an election year. 
   The Republicans say: We want a change; we don't want the huge add-ons to government. We think in the scheme of things, 
   over the next 5 years, the taxpayer ought to get a little bit of relief. 
   That is the difference in the two bills. I think it is a good difference. When they say rich people are going to get the benefit of the tax relief on the marriage tax penalty, that is unfair. We want to fix it. How many want to do that? We win that. We have to use some of the surplus to pay for that kind of reform. That money doesn't grow on trees. That money has to come out of the coffers of the United States. It doesn't belong to the Government. 
   I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to Senator GORTON, and then I yield back to the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator BOXER on the floor. I have 45 minutes remaining and I will take a few minutes to discuss Senator KENNEDY's remarks. 
   Mr. President, fellow Senators, nothing could be further from the truth than this budget resolution and this budget conference does not provide for Medicare prescription relief for senior citizens. 
   Let me state what I think the triggering mechanism would have ultimately done. It would work in favor of those who don't want a bipartisan solution because they could have stonewalled this until the date arrived and then produce a partisan solution to Medicare on the floor of the Senate. But nobody should deny the work and the authenticity of what is in this budget resolution as suggested in our Budget Committee by the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator SNOWE. 
   Senator SNOWE recognizes seniors don't want a prescription drug added to a Medicare program that is going bankrupt. We provide in this budget resolution if there is some reform in this program, $40 billion in new money can be used for prescription drugs. I don't want to let my voice grow any louder because I have on different occasions wondered whether talking extremely loud helps with one's case or not. I have no illusions but that I am speaking to myself and I will speak very moderately about this. The truth of the matter is, the Finance Committee of the Senate is challenged by this budget resolution to produce a bipartisan solution to the issue of prescription drugs. Some in this body do not want a bipartisan solution because it will have some of the good points of experts on our side about how to fix this, including the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. FRIST the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, a Republican, and many others. 
   Let me repeat, this budget resolution says whatever you do on taxes or tax relief, such as the marriage tax penalty, there is in addition to that, $40 billion for Medicare. 
   That is $40 billion that can be used for prescription drugs. If the committee in charge of this wants to use it all for prescription drugs, they have to provide some reform to the system. 
   Frankly, there is a big split over whether that is what the bill ought to do. But the Budget Committee opted, in this budget resolution, to try to be on the side of pursuing a bipartisan solution in the committee of jurisdiction, which has had 14 hearings, and is going to do something. The House is going its way. Before the year is out, we will have a bipartisan solution on this floor. That is precisely what would be good for seniors. We will take the politics out of Medicare, and we will put money into prescription drugs. That is really what we want to do in this budget resolution. 
   Some may call it irresponsibility. I call it the height of responsibility. I believe to do otherwise is an invitation to election year politicking about Medicare prescription drugs that is, in the end, apt not to help with the Medicare program which everybody wants to try to fix and add prescription benefits. 
   I want to repeat, the reason we have tax relief in this budget, and tell the committee to produce it, is the very issue we debated 4 hours ago on this floor called marriage tax penalty reform. It will cost, if we do it right, somewhere between $50 and $65 billion. Where will we get that relief for the millions of married couples? We will get it in this budget resolution and get $40 billion for Medicare, prescription drugs, and reform. 
   If the seniors understand the two positions, they will say let's go try this; let's have Senators on that committee of finance, Democrat and Republican, working on a solution that belongs to everybody. It will probably be a right solution for the trust fund if it is a bipartisan solution. 
   So I repeat, there is money for prescription drugs and there is money for tax relief, such as the marriage tax penalty reform that must be adopted. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time I have on the resolution.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Chair inform me how much time remains?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't intend to use the entire time I have. I would like to make sure I understand where they are going on the other side. If we are going to make an effort to vote earlier, I will be yielding back some of my time. I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   First, let me identify the occupant of the chair. The occupant of the chair is one of our new Senators, Mr. SMITH, from way over on the West Coast. I am very proud to have him in the Senate, but I am more proud that he is on the Budget Committee. There are people talking about what happens in this budget resolution, such as the distinguished Senator, Mrs. MURRAY, talking about a sense-of-the-Senate resolution as if it were binding on somebody. It is nothing more than what it says. It doesn't affect anything. To the extent we dropped some of her provisions, there were scores of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions in this budget that we did not take. 
   What we did keep was something for which the distinguished occupant of the chair fought hard. I am told there are so many people watching C-SPAN. Sometimes I wonder how many times they want to hear the same speech, but I believe, when it is given again on that side, I have to say a few words. 
   I repeat: Because of the distinguished Senator who occupies the chair, working in concert with the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, helped by Senator WYDEN from the same State as the occupant of the chair, we have a real provision we did not drop that has to do with Medicare prescription drugs and Medicare reform. I was so pleased to hear a freshman Senator, the occupant of the chair, say he wanted to support the Snowe amendment for $40 billion and that we might as well face up and get a bill. It says we can use the whole $40 billion for prescription drugs, and it is not crowded out by tax relief. It is separate and distinct; it is available. 
   We have said if you do some reform to preserve the well-being of the Medicare system, you can have $40 billion in new money for prescription drugs. Now, if you choose to only do prescription drugs and do nothing to Medicare, it gets $20 billion to go ahead and add some prescription drugs. Frankly, I believe the Senator occupying the chair, Senator SMITH of Oregon, was on the side of a very large majority of Senators. I think so long as we keep it bipartisan there is going to be an effort to repair the Medicare system for the senior citizens, which is going broke, and we can say we reformed it and modernized it and at the same time we have added $40 billion for prescription drugs. 
   No matter how many times the other side repeats it--and I don't know that I am going to answer it again today--I will tell you what I know is in the budget resolution. If I had to read the words, you would see I am paraphrasing the words quite accurately. With reference to education, we can continue to hear specifics, that we didn't provide classroom teachers. Let me repeat, the only time we are going to find out what we really do for education is when the Appropriations Committee, headed by Senator SPECTER, produces an appropriations bill, because anything we say in this budget resolution about specifics on education are only assumptions. 
   Many times, if not most of the time, the Appropriations Committee decides what they are going to spend on education, which programs they are going to fund, and whether it is going to be less children per classroom or more. That is not going to be decided by this resolution. What is going to be, or could be, decided is how much is available for education--not specifics but education. 
   I say that this conference report assumes $45.6 billion in the year 2001 for the Department of Education--a $10 billion increase, or 30-percent increase, over last year's level. Over the next 5 years, most interestingly, assumptions on education are $21.9 billion in new money, additional money, which is essentially what the President asked for. 
   Now, whatever they want to say in the next hour in repetition, I don't know that I will answer it again. I am trying my very best to say that these specific things Senators bring to the Senator floor and say there is a sense of the Senate on it and that would have gotten it done, I want to be kind; I don't want to say what I might say. But the fact that it is in, or not, doesn't mean very much. It is what the Appropriations Committee does with the money. Then there is going to be a bipartisan debate, for which I am grateful, on whether we should have the status quo on education programs or whether we should have reform. 
   Essentially, for anybody interested in what is going to determine where we spend the money and how we spend it, it may be that we are going to leave all these categorical programs--money for more teachers and less students per classroom and all the other specifics that some people think are important--it may be that we will let the schools keep doing that. We are probably going to give them an option not to do that; in a way, that is more accommodating to them, with flexibility and accountability. 
   That is essentially what we set up. We don't preclude that debate and its conclusions, which I understand from the majority leader will occur before this year is out. It is historical because it is coming out of committee of 
   jurisdiction. It is not going to be done on the floor. It is headed by Senator JEFFORDS. Nobody thought there would be major reform. There is major reform, and it comes out to the floor to be debated. 
   I don't know that I can do more on the issue of debt reduction other than to tell the Senate that this budget resolution has over $1 trillion in debt service over the next 5 years. It is most interesting that, all of a sudden, there is a difference between reducing the debt held by the public through Social Security surpluses and reducing it with other surpluses. Let me say, dollar for dollar, it is the same debt reduction, or reduction held by the public. It doesn't matter whether it comes out of the Social Security surplus that we don't spend or whether it comes out of the surplus that is on budget. We have a different way of accounting for them. 
   We think there is a lot of money available during the next 5 years. In fact, we think over a freeze there is $400 billion in non-Social Security surplus. There is already a basic budget. Looking at this chart, we think it is $400 billion. Interestingly enough, that is over freezing everything. The Democrats assume what they call a freeze in real spending, that would bring the spending way up to here because they add inflation every year and call it automatic. It is not spending new money. We said let's start over. So we put $212 billion in domestic programs--domestic and defense. We put $150 billion in tax relief, which we ask today, how many more times do we have to hear that our tax proposals are for the rich? The biggest tax proposal is the marriage tax penalty. Is that what they are saying is a typical Republican effort to help the rich? I hope all the married people in America listen to that argument. 
   In addition, we take that surplus and we put $40 billion of it in this non-Social Security on the debt. I don't believe the argument is about debt reduction. It may be today, but the argument is: Let's spend that tax relief money. Let's spend this. That is what the argument is about. I repeat, if we don't get tax relief, all this money, $150 billion, goes to debt reduction for the debt held by the public, adding to the $1 trillion I have just told you about that is in this. 
   I will conclude by thanking the Budget Committee. The Republican majority produced this format. Obviously, from the newest Senator, to me as the most senior Senator on our side, we followed the lead of OLYMPIA SNOWE on Medicare and the leadership of my friend who is occupying the Chair, in getting a real Medicare proposal and that will drive a bipartisan solution. Let me repeat, in an election year, praise the Lord, if we can get a bipartisan solution to Medicare because it will be the right one if it turns out to be a partisan solution. I am afraid it  will be a political solution, and I am not sure the Medicare trust fund for our seniors is going to come out very well. So that is why I think this is a good approach. 
   My last observation is that the Appropriations Committee has to take all this money and decide what to do with it. Senator TED STEVENS is the chairman and that is his principal responsibility. I assure those who voted for this and who will vote for it today, it depends on how you allocate the money among priorities. But if they happen to be priorities we have been expressing today and that we expressed in this resolution, there will be plenty of funding for education, plenty of funding for the National Institutes of Health, plenty of funding for 
   Medicare--and that is not an appropriated account--and we will have plenty of money to prepare our defense for this new 100 years we are entering where we need to make up some lost ground. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to respond to the Senator for 1 minute, and then I will have remarks about the Senator from New Jersey and our relationship. 
   I say to the distinguished Senator who spoke about the National Institutes of Health and what we are going to do and not going to do, everybody should know when and by whom the NIH increased in the most dramatic manner in its history. 
   In the last 3 years, when Republicans controlled both Houses, we increased the National Institutes of Health--cancer, AIDS, all those diseases--let me give the numbers to my colleagues. Since 1998, NIH has increased 40 percent: In 1998, $13.7 billion; in 1999, it was $15.6 billion. That is a 14-percent increase. In 2000, it went up 13.8 percent, one of the largest domestic program increases in this whole budget. In 2001, this conference report, NIH funding is going to $19.3 billion. That is an increase of 8 percent. We are doing pretty well trying to find cures for serious ailments, thanks to the Republicans who in conference and elsewhere pushed so hard for it. 
   I ask that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when Senator LAUTENBERG of New Jersey came to this committee, I do not know if he was like me, but I never thought I would be ranking member, much less chairman. I am not sure he had a plan to be ranking member, especially when he had to put up with me. 
   It has been not only a joy, in terms of getting our committee work done, but it has been healthy from the standpoint of adversaries who believe  strongly about their position but understand the other fellow can have a different opinion and it is all right, they are OK. That is how I feel about him. He has different views than I, but he brought a lot of stability to this committee. The minority ought to be very grateful for the way he handled matters. They all had a chance to contribute. 
   Today is his last effort on the floor of the Senate as ranking member. I thank him. I hope the whole Senate understands what he has done.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was listening to Senator MACK. And I really wish all Americans could hear his concerns and message because I don't think the message he is sending today is getting out to people. I really believe most people think this is just a technical issue, it is automatic, it is what ought to happen. 
   I think what the Senator from Florida shared with us indicates that this is not an ordinary situation. It is very unordinary. Cuba is not an ordinary country. It is a very unordinary country, in the manner and in the ways the Senator from Florida described it, and more. 
   I thank him for coming here and asking the President and the Attorney General in a senatorial way--he made no threats, and there were no connotations in his voice. He clearly said, I ask that you consider the other side of this coin.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Palace of the Governors Annex Act has passed the Senate. 
   In conjunction with Hispanic Heritage Month, I introduced the Palace of the Governors Expansion Act last October. The palace is a symbol of Hispanic influence in the United States and truly shows the coming together of many cultures in the New World--the various native American, Hispanic, and Anglo peoples who have lived in the region for over four centuries. 
   Since introducing this bill last October, the situation has become an emergency. Walls are crumbling, water pipes are leaking, plumbing is backing up threatening priceless documents. 
   The bill would authorize the construction of the Palace of the Governors' Annex. It would preserve a priceless collection of Spanish colonial, Iberian colonial paintings, artifacts, maps, books, guns, costumes, photographs. The collection includes such historically unique items as the helmets and armor worn by the Don Juan Onate expedition conquistadors who established the first capital in the United States, San Juan de los Caballeros, in July 1598. It includes the Vara Stick, a type of yardstick used to measure land grants and other real property boundaries in Dona Ana County, NM. 
   We have all heard of Geronimo. The collection includes a rifle dropped by one of his men during a raid in the Black Range area of western New Mexico. 
   We have all heard of Pancho Villa. His activities in the Southwest come alive when viewing some of the artifacts included in the Palace of the Governors Collection. The Columbus, NM, railway station clock was shot in the pendulum, freezing for all history the moment that Pancho Villa's raid and invasion began. It is part of the collection, but you wouldn't know it because there is no room to display it. 
   Brig. Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny was posted to New Mexico during the Mexican War. He commanded the Army of the West as they traveled from the Santa Fe Trail to occupy the territories of New Mexico and California. As Kearny traveled, he carried a field desk which he used to write letters, diaries, orders, and other historical documents. It is part of the collection, but you can't see it because there is no display space for it in the Palace of the Governors. 
   Many of us have read books by D.H. Lawrence, but none of us has seen the note from his mother that is part of the collection. 
   There are more than 800,000 other historic photographs, guns, costumes, maps, books, and handicrafts. 
   Where are these treasures that Teddy Roosevelt wanted to make part of the Smithsonian housed now? 
   Where is this collection designated as a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation kept? 
   In the basement of a 400-year-old building. 
   It is a national travesty. 
   This legislation would right this wrong by authorizing funds for a Palace of the Governors Expansion Annex. The entire project will cost $32 million. The legislation authorizes a $15 million federal grant if the museum can match the grant on a 50-50 basis. 
   The Palace of the Governors has acquired a half block behind the current palace. Obtaining this valuable real estate is evidence of the ingenuity and  commitment of those involved in preserving the collection. Real estate near Santa Fe's plaza is seldom for sale at any price, much less an affordable price. 
   The Palace of the Governors has been the center of administrative and cultural activity over a vast region in the Southwest since its construction as New Mexico's second capitol by Governor Pedro de Peralta in 1610. The building is the oldest continuously occupied public building in the United States. Since its creation, the Museum of New Mexico has worked to protect and promote Hispanic, Southwest, and native American arts and crafts. 
   I hope the House will act expeditiously on this legislation to save this important collection.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the upcoming Tenth Annual Arms Control Conference taking place in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In recognition of this Tenth Anniversary, I wish to emphasize the tireless efforts of this conference's founder, coordinator, and inspiration, Dr. James Brown. 
   Dr. Brown's career has long emphasized arms control. Not only has Jim Brown devoted himself to this conference for the past decade, but he has also been a practitioner. He served in several different capacities at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, where he helped develop verification regimes for implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. He also worked in the Pentagon as a special assistant to the Deputy Undersecretary for Planning and Resources. 
   His academic r&#233;sum&#233; is also impressive. Jim was a professor at Southern Methodist University, and a visiting professor at Air University. He was a founding director of the John Tower Center for Political Studies and co-taught courses with Senator Tower for eight years. Jim Brown was also selected as a senior Fulbright Scholar at the University of Ankara. Most notably, he has authored and edited nine volumes of scholarly work and 35 articles on Arms Control. 
   Dr. James Brown has dedicated many years of his professional life in pursuit of international understanding as a fundamental prerequisite to progress on arms control and disarmament. Every year this conference reflects the culmination of his personal commitment. It is important to acknowledge the unique contribution that this conference has made and continues to make toward achievement of global peace and stability. 
   The disarmament and non-proliferation work of Sandia National Laboratories and the Cooperative Monitoring Center are greatly enhanced and supported by the annual Arms Control  Conference. This event should serve to underscore Sandia Laboratories' staunch commitment to a safe and stable international security environment. 
   The success of this annual event owes itself to Jim's reputation, his integrity, his personal relationships with a broad range of policy makers throughout the global arms control community and their trust in him. Jim's diligence has enabled the Albuquerque conference to grow even more in stature each year bringing credit on Sandia, the Department of Energy and the State of New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, New Mexico is fortunate to have Dr. Brown as a citizen.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today the Senate will continue to vote on the remaining amendments to S. Con. Res. 101. Needless to say, votes are expected to occur throughout the morning with an expectation of voting this afternoon and perhaps into the evening, if we are not able to resolve some of the pending sense-of-the-Senate amendments and other amendments. 
   There are 2 minutes of explanation on amendments prior to each vote. To make this process as smooth as possible, I ask that Senators remain in the Chamber between votes. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. 
   We will be talking with various Senators about amendments. So that everybody will know, there are 75 amendments filed by Republicans and 36 by Democrats. We are going to work with our Democratic minority whip and the ranking member of the Budget Committee to see if we can encourage a number of Senators to accept sense-of-the-Senate proposals and let us accept them on both sides. We will be working diligently at that. If we don't have success, then looking at this, I say that probably we would not finish before 6 o'clock tonight, or even later. We will work very hard. If Members will help us, we can do better than that.

   Mr. DOMENICI. We will carry the Senator's message to the majority  leader. Right now, we have 10 votes that we are willing to proceed with, 5 on each side. The first one is the Santorum amendment on military benefits; followed by Conrad on 
   lockbox; Abraham on Social Security lockbox; Johnson on veterans; Ashcroft on Social Security investment; Mikulski on digital divide; Senator Bob Smith on prescription drugs; Graham of Florida on education; Voinovich on reconciliation instruction and taxes; and Kennedy on Pell grants. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is almost comical that this is called a Medicare lockbox because it has nothing to do with Medicare. The Social Security lockbox at the Social Security trust fund actually puts those away. This amendment never references the Medicare trust fund. It says we are to run on-budget surpluses equal to a third of the Congressional Budget Office surpluses, using the most recent baseline projections. I don't think we ought to do that. We have priorities set up in the budget. It violates the Budget Act. 
   I make a point of order that it is not germane to provisions of the Budget Act. I therefore raise that point of order.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the reconciliation instructions. What we have said in our budget resolution is, if we don't get any tax relief, the money will go to reducing the debt. I believe the budget resolution needs to have a reconciliation instruction if we are going to give a fair chance at the tax reforms that are proposed--any size, from $10 billion to $75 billion or whatever can be done. Without the reconciliation, we would get none of it done. 
   Therefore, I oppose it and hope it will be defeated. I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the Budget Committee, there was an amendment offered to raise the Pell grants in this budget to the exact level the President of the United States requested, up to $3,500. That is what the President asked for. That is what is in the budget. I do not think the President of the United States, the education President, would be underfunding Pell grants. He has increased them in his budget, and it seems as if it is never enough. 
   What we have done is right and fair and leaves some room for other education programs. We do not use up all the money doing that extra add-on the Senator is asking for, but we do increase it up to the level of the President. I do not believe we should add to it at this point. I hope Senators will reject the amendment. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not believe we ought to take the HI trust fund off budget. That is what this amendment does. In the budget resolution, we have $40 billion for Medicare and we do not accept the President's cuts for Medicare. I think we have done right by Medicare. If we can incorporate these numbers in a bill this year, I think we will be on the right track. This just won't work. Medicare is not a trust fund like Social Security. I am grateful that Senator ASHCROFT is trying to do this. He has been a leader in protecting Medicare and Social Security. I do not think this will work. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment is not germane to the budget resolution.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a full substitute. It is a so-called Democrat budget, and essentially the big difference between the two budgets is that over time this Democrat budget will give back to the American people 4 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. We think over time we should give them back 11 percent. The difference is the Democrats spend 22 percent and we spend 17 percent of the surplus. 
   We think this is not the time to grow Government that much but, rather, leave a little bit more than 4 percent for tax relief for the American people. There are many other differences, but this essentially is the difference.

   Mr. DOMENICI. As good as this idea sounds, we ought not do this. This is taking a major appropriation, a program we fund in appropriations every year, and making it an entitlement. 
   There are a lot of great education programs. What if we start taking every appropriations bill that has exciting ideas for Americans and we say we don't want to appropriate them anymore; we will just turn them up as if they are Social Security, entitled to automatic funding. 
   It is not the right thing to do, no matter what the program is. It is our responsibility to pay for IDEA, and special ed, not an entitlement against the American people without anybody voting on it again. 
   It is not the right thing to do. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this will use $31 billion of the surplus. It will eat it up with a brand new entitlement, and it will take jurisdiction away from the appropriators in the normal course of allocating what America's Government ought to be doing. 
   I repeat, the sense-of-the-Senate amendment establishes this as the highest priority, but we should not be  setting a $31 billion entitlement program in motion today for a piece of education. Because we did not do our job on this, we should not make an entitlement to make up for our deficiency in not funding it properly.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is an incorrect statement. The NIH can go up the amount the Senator desires if he and his subcommittee, which will be receiving a 14-percent increase under the allocation we have made--and I would not be surprised if this got more than a 14-percent increase by the time allocations are completed. In other words, the subcommittee with NIH in it is already going up about 14 percent. NIH is going up to a huge sum of $19 billion. 
   But the Senator who chairs the committee can decide he wants to spend more than $19 billion. He will have to look at that myriad of programs--you know, $100 billion in that subcommittee --and decide whether he can find money to increase NIH even more. We increased it $1.1 billion in this budget. 
   That is our recommendation. Frankly, all we are doing here is spending more money. It really doesn't have anything to do with NIH. It is raising the amount of money available to be spent on domestic programs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It says that the Senate, if it votes for the Domenici substitute, is saying to the Appropriations Committee, within that $100 billion or more you are going to have to spend on labor, health, and human services, the highest priority shall be given to the National Institutes of Health. That is what this amendment says. If that isn't enough of an instruction, saying how we feel, I don't know how we can do it. But we don't have to increase the overall spending by the amount requested by the distinguished Senator. We can just say find it within this 14-percent increase that is going to his subcommittee to be spent on labor, health, and human services in this country.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator BYRD, first, I appreciate the kind remarks he made about the Senator from New Mexico, but on a budget resolution, we are dealt what we are dealt. It just happens that a Parliamentarian had ruled that all these sense-of-the-Senate amendments are in order on a budget resolution. The Senator from West Virginia knows as well as I know that many of them are not going to do anything, but if a Senator wants to offer them, not as legislation or law--they will not be that, no matter what we do; even if we kept every one in conference, they would not be law. 
   We have worked our best to let every Senator who had an amendment who wanted a vote--the Senator raised the issue of why don't we vote on these. I make the point that every Senator who had an amendment and wanted a vote got a vote. 
   I do not think you had any of the sense of the Senates here, but every Senator whose amendment I read agreed that they did not need a rollcall vote. It is not like they want a vote. They do not want a vote. They want to do it this way.

   Frankly, we can stop and the leaders can decide where we go next. But these sense-of-the-Senate amendments that we are adopting here should not really hold up the budget because they do not affect the budget. They are sense of the Senates that have to do with how we  feel about things and what we want to make people think about the Senate with reference to the subject matter of the sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. 
   But you have every right, and you exercise it with dignity, although for many of us it is a pretty tough pill. Even your dignity makes it a tough pill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. There are a lot of people I am certain I should thank, but I think they all know how much I appreciate their efforts--the majority staff, the minority staff--and hard work and long hours on a difficult product with very difficult procedures. 
   I hope before too long we will find a way to have these procedures streamlined so it is not so difficult and it is easier to understand and so we are not burdened by scores upon scores of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions when we are talking about numbers in a basic budget. 
   I thank by name Senator LAUTENBERG, who will not be here when we do a budget resolution in the future because he will be leaving the Senate. I thank him again for the way he conducts himself and the way he asks his staff to conduct themselves in relationship to the majority and in relationship to his duties. 
   I believe this was a pretty rare achievement, a very hard budget, with very different philosophical and ideological points of view. I think we accomplished on our side what we wanted to do. It does not take a long explanation. 
   We did protect Social Security. We did strengthen Medicare by putting $40 billion in a reserve fund for Medicare, including prescription drugs. We reduced the national debt substantially. We provided some tax fairness for the American people. For those who are very worried about putting enough money toward the national debt, this will be the largest installment against the national debt in the history of the Republic; $177 billion will go to the debt. Most of that is by not using the Social Security trust fund. 
   I am very grateful it has finally come to pass that the ideal which I conceived immediately after the President suggested 62 percent of Social Security should be saved, and I said why not 100 percent, looks as if it is going to come to pass. We are locking up 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund. That means there will not be big swings in expenditures in our Government, there will not be huge swings in tax reform, because we are setting aside for the senior citizens what is theirs and not spending a nickel of it. 
   Overall, this is a good budget for this year. We are in a Presidential election, and somebody next year, a new President, will tell us what changes they want. If it is a President of the Republican Party and his name is Bush, he will recommend a brand-new budget that will be very different, in which case the tax reform we seek and the tax relief we seek will be part of his budget. He did not seek any tax relief until 1 full year from now, so that it would be time for him to be in office and work on things. 
   Having said that, let me close saying to all the Senators who worked with Senator LAUTENBERG, Senator REID of Nevada, myself, and our respective staffs to get on that long list of agreed-upon amendments, some Members have hard feelings tonight because they agreed and worked with us; having done that, Members did not get an opportunity to offer their amendments. 
   I don't think we had any other way to do it tonight. We would not have finished this budget resolution for a very long time had the majority leader not suggested the regular order following the objection of Senator BYRD to our agreed-upon list. 
   My last praise goes to Senator REID, the minority whip, for spending a lot of time on the floor on every bill. He was 
   tremendously helpful and instrumental in getting the Senate where we are. 
   Obviously, on my side, I thank the majority leader for helping get the budget resolution completed and all the others who helped. A hearty thanks from this Senator. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just verify, as the one who is working with these amendments, Senators should not assume it is very likely that we finish tonight. I reported that to the leader earlier this morning. I do not know how many amendments are pending on the other side. We are working with our people who have about 31 amendments, most of them sense-of-the-Senate amendments. I will give my colleague that list soon and see if he can help us. I will work at it and talk some Senators into understanding they would not have to offer them; they could offer them some other time when the Senate is considering another matter. 
   If you just look at 8 1/2 hours plus whatever it is going to take for half those amendments in vote-arama, I assume we will be in tomorrow.

<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-13-20000406</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make a point to the Senator, and I thank the Senator for yielding. Presidential candidate George W. Bush had three of the best economists in America working with him on this tax proposal. Interestingly enough, they made economic assumptions different from the Congressional Budget Office, or the OMB, for the next 5 years. 
   Interestingly enough, the assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office and the OMB have been wrong, and most of the time they have been wrong by underestimating the performance of the economy. They have underestimated the growth in the economy, underestimated the revenue stream, and each year, we have come along later on and had to make adjustments to it. He is entitled to use his economic assumptions, which I have read and are very  realistic. And that makes a very big difference if one has slight economic assumptions of a positive nature higher than one would assume in our budget.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I am bound by the rules of the Senate to use the CBO. The President doesn't, however. He uses OMB. Frequently, we are different. As a matter of fact, over the last 3 years, we have gone to the President's numbers, and we have gone back to CBO's numbers because we are trying to find out which is more apt to be right. So there is nothing precise about this. One is entitled--just as President Clinton did when he ran for office--to use his own economic experts as he puts his plan together. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-16-20000406</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely, except they are not markedly different, but they are different. There is only one Bush plan, as far as the Senator from New Mexico knows. It is December 1, 1999. I have a copy of it in front of me. What has been offered in the Senate is not the Bush plan. Nonetheless, I don't want to argue that exclusively. I can let everybody know that it isn't the Bush plan. 
   I think what is more important is that soon-to-be-President Bush is entitled to put a budget and a tax plan together, and he is entitled to use his best economic advisers. Let me suggest something. I honestly believe that if George W. Bush were the President instead of Bill Clinton being the President, there would be a couple of huge changes this year that would make it a lot easier to achieve the Bush tax plan. 
   First of all, we would not have a President recommending that domestic spending grow at 14 percent a year. That is what we are fighting with here--not with a President who is trying to have small Government so he could give some relief to the taxpayers. We are arguing with a President who has the largest increase in discretionary spending since the Jimmy Carter years. That is a lot, when you can beat one of those years with inflation in double digits. This year it is 14 percent. That is what he is asking for. We have to compete with that in our budgets. We can't just do what a Republican President, who isn't elected yet, would recommend as to how we spend money. 
   As a matter of fact, I have already said that I believe this budget resolution is kind of a holding budget resolution because I believe either man--Bush or Gore--when elected, will ask us to dramatically change this budget. I know George W. Bush will because he will find ways to consolidate and change the priorities of domestic spending in a significant way. When he does that, I have no doubt that he will be able to recommend to the Congress a very good tax plan. 
   Frankly, if we wanted to debate the value of a tax plan and its worth in society, its soundness, we could have a debate on his precise plan. It is a pretty good plan. Frankly, it does a lot of things that a huge majority of this Senate would like to see done to the Tax Code of the United States. 
   So we will have a vote on this amendment. Everybody should understand that it is not really the Bush plan. Everybody should understand that Bush will do his own plan. He will do his own plan on taxes, and he told us what it probably will be. He will do his own budget. It is very important we understand that. It won't be this budget because we have to work off a President's budget with increases of the type I just explained to you. He will have his own budget to work off of. I believe he didn't start his tax cut until one year later because he wanted the opportunity to work on a budget and a fiscal plan for this Nation along with a tax plan. 
   At some point in time, we will either have a vote in relationship to the Durbin amendment, or we will have a second-degree amendment to it. If he insists later on, he can have a vote on his. That is ultimately the way the rules work. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

As a matter of fact, if we took President Clinton's budget and adopted it--and it has a 14-percent increase in nondefense discretionary spending; that is, 13 appropriations bills less defense and military construction. It has a 14-percent increase. I believe it was the Senator who found that is the highest increase in domestic discretionary spending since the years of Jimmy Carter's Presidency when inflation was rampant.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have heard an interesting political discussion today. The idea we should be debating the Bush tax cut on the Senate floor is totally political. It brought a political answer. So we are now engaged in a Presidential election instead of a budget. 
   The truth of the matter is, we do not have before us a Bush budget. What we have before us is the budget of the President of the United States. For those on the Democrat side who are talking about Bush's budget, let me say they have never offered the President's budget. Nobody has dared offer it because it is so bad that even they know they would not get the votes for it. 
   That is not the kind of budget we are going to get next year, if George Bush is President. He is going to give us a budget that calls for less Government but priorities in Government. There is going to be sufficient money left over in his budget to have a tax cut, tax relief for the American taxpayer, and take care of the Social Security trust fund. There is no doubt in my mind he will present that kind of budget. 
   We can argue all we want today about what fits in this year's budget. We are operating against the competition of a budget from the President. We are not working with a President who wants to have tax relief. As a matter of fact, this President's budget sets the way to increase taxes in the first year, not decrease them, and to increase them over the first 5 years, not decrease them. As a matter of fact, it is a tax increase budget. We have to compete with that and try to get our business done, having to work with him in the appropriations process. Now we have somebody coming down here telling us Bush's budget does not fit in ``your'' budget. Of course, it doesn't fit in our budget because we have not yet seen what President-elect Bush would submit to us to do with all these duplicative programs. We heard there are  342 programs in economic development. He is not going to leave those around. He is going to provide a completely different tone, a different kind of budget with high priorities in education and the issues he has described. 
   I want to close by saying it is somewhat of a lark to come down here and talk about how big the deficit got following Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan had to take over an America whose military had gone right down the drain, an America that had an economy that was dead weak. He had to sit there and let the inflation come out of that and then, yes, build back defense and provide some tax relief for the American people. That was a great economy. He took over when it was a basket case. 
   If we want to debate things past, I will conclude by saying: Does anybody believe this robust economy of America was made robust because Bill Clinton and the Democrats increased taxes $293 billion? Does anybody really believe that? I am certain a majority of American economists would say it was coming back strong, we plunked this on top of it, and it didn't break the economy; it just let it go ahead. It probably would be stronger if we had not adopted the $293 billion. That is my guess. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes relative to the following amendments be scheduled to occur at 2 p.m. in the sequence listed, with no second-degree amendments in order, where applicable, prior to the votes, and there be 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, and all votes after the first vote in the sequence be limited to 10 minutes. The amendments are as follows: Reid amendment No. 2985, which I understand is a Durbin amendment, essentially--is that correct, Senator?--and then Gramm amendment No. 2973--and Senator Gramm is here. it is the same amendment to which he has been speaking--and then Durbin amendment No. 2953, as amended, if amended. 
   I also ask unanimous consent that following the allotted 1 hour of debate, the pending amendments be laid aside until the stacked votes. It may be that there is no time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. 
   We will try to stack this vote, if it is all right with the Senator. We are going to have the three votes. 
   I commend Senator MCCAIN. I hope what he is suggesting on the floor happens, because the truth is, the U.S. Department of Defense is making it very difficult for this to happen. We have worked with them on a number of occasions. You would actually be shocked at some of the correspondence I have received. 
   I want to quote one piece of correspondence. When I said, why don't you tell us how to take care of the food stamp problem, this is what the Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Edwin Dorn, wrote to me: It would be a mistake to give higher pay to military personnel who had ``a larger family than he or she can afford.'' 
   You can see why that becomes part of the issue, as the Senator from Arizona understands. We have an all-volunteer military that we have asked to stay on for long periods of time. It is not like draftees who spend 2 years in uniform. They have families. They have children. In fact, we have not quite figured it out. Maybe the Senator from Arizona can figure it out in his committee. With this targeting of money today--not a lot of money--we will start solving the problem with those who are not earning much. That is the intent of the proposal of the Senator from Arizona. 
   But essentially it is very difficult for the military to come up with a conclusion that we have to make sure we don't penalize big families in the military. I never heard of any implication that we had an all-volunteer military and we were going to start by saying to them: Don't have too many children. 
   I believe the Senator from Arizona would join me in saying that is an absurd policy. What if they have five children? I think that is all right. If they want to serve 30 years in the military with five children, we ought to give them the benefits they deserve. Because they have that many children, we ought not to cause them to be on food stamps. That is the basic problem we have. 
   I want to put in the RECORD letters I wrote in 1996, the response I received from Edwin Dorn and from Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen.

Let's not sit around and say families within the military are too big. Let's fix it.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, even though Senators REID and DURBIN have been talking about it for a couple of hours, and Senator GRAMM and I spoke on it for about a half hour, essentially, the tax plan George W. Bush has is not part of the President's proposal, but it will be part of President-elect George W. Bush's budget. So we wait for him to deliver his budget, which will indeed accommodate his tax cut. All this is a political scuffle here today in advance of his budget. He hasn't even had a chance to give us one and tell us what kind of Government he wants. 
   They want us to adopt this while we are fighting over a Clinton budget that increases spending beyond anything President George W. Bush would do. I commend soon-to-be-President-elect Bush for suggesting a major tax reform. When the American people actually see it, they are going to think it is good for America. It will fit in his budget. That is an important time. 
   I move to table the Reid amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not think anybody objects to this amendment. This is an effort to say to the Department of Defense we want them to fix the problem of food stamps in the military. It adds a small amount of money over the years to target the solving of the food stamp problem in the military. 
   That is essentially the McCain amendment. We should adopt it. He wants a rollcall vote. I believe the yeas and nays have been ordered.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use my 2 minutes to express to the Senate--referring to no singular Senator but all of us--this budget resolution idea has become preposterous. Any kind of sense of the Senate is in order, including one to instruct the committee that is in conference. We are going so far overboard that we are making this floor much like a circus. Actually, I am hopeful it won't be too long from now that the Parliamentarian will reverse himself. I don't know how we will do it. Maybe we will instruct him to do it himself. A Parliamentarian ruled that senses of the Senate were in order on budget resolutions even if they did nothing to the resolution. 
   Now we are dreaming them up. We have a gun amendment on a budget resolution. We have instructions to a committee in conference on a Budget Committee. I don't know what kind of points people are making, but if anybody thinks they are effective just because they win one of these sense of the Senates, let me say, constituents and politicians don't believe they are effective because they do nothing. 
   So if you want to run a TV ad that you got something passed in a sense of the Senate, I hope the other guy is smart enough to say that is baloney; it did nothing. We would be out of here if we didn't have these--out of here as far as substantive amendments. It is getting worse, not better, on both sides. On our side, we have 20 sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. I am going to ask them to file them pretty soon and see how many have the courage to call them up and have votes on those. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me suggest that this modification is supported by Senator STEVENS, Senator DOMENICI, Senator GRAMM, and Senator WARNER, and I understand on the Democrat side Senator INOUYE has told Senator STEVENS he supports it. 
   We are obviously trying tonight to complete our work and get a budget resolution that we can take to conference with the House of which we are proud. 
   Frankly, we came out of committee with $595.6 billion available in program authority for defense and domestic accounts. 
   In addition, we said in that budget resolution that we were reinstating what we had used for 3 years: The first 3 years of the balanced budget agreement between the President and the  Congress--to wit, a firewall--so the defense money couldn't be used for domestic spending or vice versa. 
   In this amendment, we retain that, but we have added $4 billion in program authority to defense. 
   There will be no mingling of that money with domestic and no mingling of domestic money with defense. 
   That firewall stays in this modification offered by Senator STEVENS on behalf of himself and other cosponsors. 
   In addition, the budget resolution had a 60-vote point of order for emergencies. 
   With this amendment, we have returned to the law as it was before this budget resolution; that is, last year we had in the budget resolution that 60-vote point of order which would apply to domestic spending. That is retained, not modified, and it is not expanded to include defense. 
   In addition, the House of Representatives adopted in the budget resolution a limitation on advanced appropriations, a technicality often used but not always used by Presidents and Congress as they complete their appropriations work. It is a legitimate tool of appropriating. The House, in their resolution, has $23 billion as the maximum amount allowed in program authority to be advanced. 
   Then there is a point of order, if you do more. We are agreeing here to do what the House did. 
   Senator STEVENS has negotiated with us, and we are going to the House level on that number. That means for those who are concerned, we are keeping some very rigid discipline, but we are going to the House number, and the number that was very much discussed in the Budget Committee, we are back to that number. 
   Senator GRAMM of Texas has agreed with their compromise, and he was one who wanted to lower the number. 
   We are beginning to develop a package that looks to have consensus on our side. I wasn't sure any Democrats were going to vote for our budget resolution. I hope they do with these modifications. We have Senator INOUYE agreeing with these modifications. It doesn't mean he is committed to the budget resolution. 
   There are no nondefense delayed obligations except for those listed in the budget and those that are ordinary and historic. 
   Senator STEVENS made two commitments to us. Frankly, I have committed to him. We worked together. He is going to make every effort to stay within the limitations in this budget. 
   That means there is $289 billion in budget authority, and $327.6 billion in outlays for the nondefense part of this budget. 
   Depending on how you figure it, it is anywhere from a 3.35-percent increase--looking at it another way, it may be as much as 6, or 6 1/2 , depending upon a couple of things such as a $4.3 billion budget authority that is going to be made available when we pass a certain bill that was required by the Budget Act of 1997. 
   The distinguished chairman is committing to do everything in his power to live within the budget resolution. That is all anybody ever asked. He has agreed not to violate the $23 billion in advanced funding. There would be no reason to put it in the budget resolution if we weren't going to do it. 
   I express my extreme gratitude to the distinguished Appropriations Committee chairman for working with me, working with Senator GRAMM, and working with Senator LOTT and others on our side, and the distinguished Senator WARNER who carved out this budget enforcement compromise. I think it is an excellent one. 
   I think we ought to adopt it. 
   From what I can understand, all segments of the Republican Party that had diverse views on this budget resolution ought to be in concurrence on this. I believe it does precisely what most of us would like. 
   I remind those who are thinking about domestic spending that we have increased the advanced appropriations amounts from $13 billion to $23 billion. That is a pretty good one that will allow flexibility of management, which is what the appropriators are looking for. But it is not too high because the House has accepted it also as something they can live with based on this year's levels and the levels of last year. 
   I think overall it is a good compromise. It is now the pending business, as Senator STEVENS indicated in his submission to the desk as a modification of his original amendment. 
   We still have some additional time. The distinguished Senator from Texas, who is a valued Member of the Senate and of the Budget Committee, with whom I worked very hard to carve the budget resolution, is here. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I say to the Senate, I am not sure I will have a chance later tonight to summarize this budget resolution that I hope sometime tomorrow we are going to adopt, with an amendment that the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and others put together, that we have been discussing and of which I was a part. 
   Let me first say this budget resolution has the right priorities. It increases defense at the same time it increases spending for such things as education--at least the equivalent amount of increase the President has. 
   We leave how the education program is to be structured up to the appropriate authorizing committees and the appropriators, but we give them plenty of resources to have an increase. With some reform, we may be able to do better at education than we have done in the past. 
   In addition, we have extra funding for the National Institutes of Health--not as much as some people would want but a very substantial increase--$1.1 billion. I know some would like more than that, but I remind everyone, for the last 3 years we have increased the National Institutes of Health more than they have been increased in their entire history, year over year. That is why they are doing such remarkable things and that is why in a few more years of increases we may find breakthroughs in cancer and many other diseases that beset mankind. 
   In addition, we have reduced the debt of the United States in this budget resolution by $177 billion. It was not too many years ago, perhaps Lyndon Johnson's budget, that the whole budget was $177 billion. This year we are reducing the deficit--the debt owed to the public--by $177 billion. 
   For those who think our tax relief in this budget is too much, let me remind you: In the first year, if we accomplish them, they are $13 billion. That is $13 billion compared to $177 billion in debt reduction. It is pretty good, Americans, pretty good. If we end up in that way for the next 7 or 8 years, we will indeed leave a stronger and better America with more prosperity than we have today. In addition, if you take the whole 5 years, we have eight times as much debt reduction, to wit, $1.1 trillion debt reduction, $8 for every $1 in tax relief. 
   The tax relief we dream of, and we hope the Finance Committee will enact--and we can do nothing more than give them our best advice; they will do what they want in the public interest, and it will be right--we have the marriage tax penalty. Married couples, new ones and those who have been married for a 
   long time, will not have an average penalty of $1,200 to $1,400 for having been married and working and filing one return as a husband and a wife. They are now punished. We say reform the Tax Code now--not 10 years from now. We are putting plenty of money on the debt. We ought to put some money on reforming the Tax Code for the marriage penalty, for small business changes, and a few other things such as that. That is what this budget is going to provide for Americans, so I am proud we have it here. 
   For the appropriated accounts, all the rest of Government, when you take the fact that there were $9 billion last year in items that are not recurring, and you take the increase that we have in this budget, and $4.1 billion they will get when they pass another bill that we ought to pass because it is in the balanced budget amendment with reference to Social Security and veterans--it merely changes pay dates as required by the balanced budget agreement--they will have a rather significant increase that can be done in this very difficult political year. 
   I wrap my argument up by saying it will be tough, appropriators and all of us, because the President has submitted a political budget. Why is it political? Because it is a 14-percent increase in domestic spending. Really, nobody thinks you can do that big an increase. He put it in. It could only be for one reason--to present us with a political budget. Then we are going to have to have to match our wits with getting something done while he tells the Americans he did more. 
   Of course you do more, but if you added 14 percent every year on this budget on only domestic spending, you would consume all of the surpluses that are accumulated and you would dip into the Social Security trust fund to a huge extent, just by adding the amount the President offered as an increase this year. So he clearly must not have intended it to go on forever. So what was it? It was a submission to try to either embarrass us or make us spend precisely what he wants, which is way too much.  
   So we will be busy doing that. It will be tough. But if we can get out of here tomorrow, leave the Senate and say we did some good work, we have a budget resolution, let's go to conference--we are pretty close with the House--then the appropriators can start their work. 
   My final comments go to Senator STEVENS. Senator STEVENS and I have become friends. I have been here a long time. He has been here longer. I am chairman of the Budget Committee; he is chairman of Appropriations. I think neither of us thought--at least he waited a long time for his chairmanship. Might I say, I believe when we are finished today everybody will be thankful he was willing to sit down with us and work this out. 
   I thank the distinguished majority leader for his help, Senator LOTT, and I thank the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, and all Members who have participated in getting us this far. 
   There are many more amendments, there is no doubt about that, in the vote-arama and otherwise, but I think we will come out with a budget resolution we can confer upon that will be very close. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

We have passed very large emergency appropriations for agriculture. In fact, I think it might have been as much as $8 billion. Nobody raised a point of order. There was no point of order voted upon. 
   We had hurricane assistance; we had Y2K emergency assistance, all of which fell within the purview of meeting 60 votes. Nobody raised it. Had they raised it, it would have gotten 60 votes. 
   I don't believe what is being predicted will happen. I believe when there are real emergencies, they will get adopted on the floor of the Senate and nobody will even raise that 60 votes. If they do, they will get 60 votes. 
   My last observation is we have lots of 60 vote points of order in the Budget Act, some of which the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has supported in the past. We entered into a 5-year agreement with the President, bipartisan, both Houses, with a firewall on defense for the first 3 of the 5 years. We lived with it in exactly the way that has served the distinguished Senator tonight. But it succeeded. The cap on defense was high enough for defense, and none of the defense was used for domestic for the first 3 years of the agreement to balance the budget. 
   I think it will work again, especially with the modifications we have added tonight. 
   I yield whatever time I had remaining.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to speak with my colleague regarding this issue. This reserve fund will accommodate legislation recently reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that will correct a very large problem for counties across the  country which have historically shared receipts taken in by the Forest Service and BLM. The decline in those receipts over the last ten years has had devastating effects on many rural school districts, especially in the rural West, and the Budget Committee has provided $1.1 billion over the next five years to stabilize the flow of resources to these counties.

   Mr. DOMENICI. As we are considering this resolution, I cannot say for sure that the reserve fund would accommodate Senator BINGAMAN's bill, since the estimate of the budgetary impact of the recently reported legislation is not yet complete. It is my hope, however, that when we convene the conference on this resolution, we will have estimates on the impacts of both bills. It is my intention to move in that conference that the House recede to the Senate position with an amendment to accommodate both the Forest Service receipt stabilization legislation, and the mineral receipt sharing legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The Chairman of the Armed Services Committee has crafted an important provision that can improve retention in our Armed Services. The cost effectiveness of the provision is particularly notable. It is regrettable that the Administration's lack of compliance has caused the delay of an entire year in the effective date of this provision of last year's Department of Defense Authorization bill. Servicemen and women have lost out because 
   of the Administration's failure to act. 
   I understand that you also have a problem with moving forward on legislation that permits military personnel to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan because deferred revenue or a ``revenue loss'' is attributable to such legislation and this makes the legislation potentially vulnerable to a Budget Act point of order. 
   As my friend from Virginia knows, our budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 101, as well as the budget resolution passed by our colleagues in the House of Representatives, H. Con. Res. 290, last week, provides for up to $150 billion in revenue reductions over the next five years. It is my understanding that the revenue loss in the form of deferred revenue associated with your TSP provision is $10 million in 2001 and $321 million over the next five years. 
   Let me assure my colleague, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that the revenue assumptions in the budget resolution can accommodate the revenue loss associated with your TSP statute. Moreover, let me say that I will happily make it clear in the statement of managers on the conference report on this year's budget resolution that the revenue assumptions will permit your TSP provision to move forward and to be implemented without the threat of a Budget Act point of order.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
   This amendment has very little to do with Medicare. The budget resolution takes care of Medicare, thanks to a bipartisan understanding. 
   I call to the attention of millions of newly married couples and all of the married couples who are filing tax returns this year that this amendment says you can't have the marriage tax penalty that Senator HUTCHISON recommends on the floor of the Senate, for the adoption of this amendment in the name of not having any tax cuts knocks out the marriage tax penalty provision. I don't think that is what Americans want. 
   Speaking about what Americans want, they want us to get rid of the marriage tax penalty and get rid of it quick. If you adopt this amendment, that is gone. All of Senator HUTCHISON's work in trying to get us to vote on this is out the window because we will have decided that is not in order. The Senator's amendment will not be in order. Reconciliation cannot include her marriage tax penalty. That is the issue. 
   I believe the Senate will overwhelmingly support Senator HUTCHISON and deny Senator ROBB because there is already Medicare in this budget resolution--$40 billion worth. Democrats crowed on how good it is and all of a sudden went to the White House and invented a new thing. 
   We have taken care of Medicare in this budget resolution. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes, reserving 2 minutes. 
   First, wherever the distinguished Senator from New York referred to the Senator from New Mexico, it is more fair he say the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, because I do not want credit for something of which I am not in favor. 
   I want to make three quick arguments: First, for those who are listening and those in American education who think we are going to decide in detail how the money in this budget is going to be used for education, I assure them the appropriations subcommittee headed by Senator SPECTER and the Senate is going to determine how the money in this budget resolution is spent in education. 
   We can come to the floor and talk about all the problems in education and say the Bingaman amendment takes care of these things. The truth of the matter is that is a wish list. That is what somebody hopes will happen. What will happen is what the appropriators decide. Anybody who has a wish for education can come down here today and say the Senate budget resolution is going to take care of this problem in education, and if those listening believe it, then wait around for 3 months and see what the appropriators do. 
   My second point is that there is a lot of talk about whether or not we cut the President's budget. I have a Congressional Budget Office analysis of our education numbers. This is what they say: The Senate's budget is $47.877 billion in budget authority, program authority; the President's is $47.228 billion, a difference of $600 million more in the pending resolution than that for which the President provided. 
   The baseline from which we start this year is $43.3 
   billion. Everybody can do the arithmetic. We have added more than the President to this function. Where it goes will be determined by the appropriators. 
   My other observation is that while in office, this President has called himself the education President. He has bragged that he has gotten Congress to go along with him on education. There are Members coming to the floor saying these are Republican education numbers while, as a matter of fact, the President is bragging they are his over the last 5 years. I do not know whom to believe, but I think we have increased education significantly over the last 6 years while we have been in power in the Senate. 
   My last observation has to do with whether or not the new bill that is going to be reported out of committee and come to the floor is going to do away with categorical programs. To those who love the 300 or 400 categorical programs we have and think they must be helping education, I say that is why it has not gotten any better in the last 10 years. If they think that is what the bill says, let me tell them it  is going to have three menu items. One is if schools like what we have now, they can keep it. They can keep that program everybody thinks is so great or they can opt to take a lump sum with strings attached that mean performance and accountability. If they take that, they have to account for it; they have to be accountable, and they receive a bonus if their accountability is on the plus side. If not, they do not get a bonus. 
   Actually, we are going to let the schools decide which way they want to go. Republicans are already in the field trying out this idea. To the amazement of some Democrats, school leaders, school boards, superintendents, and principals are opting our way, saying: Give us a chance instead of putting all these strings on our education money. 
   We have done enough. We do not need the Bingaman amendment. I hope it is tabled later in the day. I commend my colleague for his interest in education. We have done enough when we do more than the President this year. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for Senator ALLARD and all those who are supporting him on this amendment. But I surely did not want the debate to end today without talking about what we have already done and what this budget resolution does. 
   In the last 2 years, we have reduced the debt held by the public. I hear people talking about both kinds of debt on the floor. But did I hear Senator VOINOVICH say he was quoting from somebody who stated the best thing we can do is reduce the debt held by the public when we have a surplus? We have already reduced it by $355 billion. This budget resolution--so everyone will know--will reduce the debt by an additional $1.1 trillion. 
   Frankly, I am going to give an estimate, but I think I will be close. If we stay on this path, the interest on the national debt will have been reduced between $100 billion and $130 billion. 
   I ask, how much is enough? 
   There is an argument being made that since this money is Social Security trust fund money, it does not really reduce the debt because we may have to use it someday. Right now, as we sit in this Senate, and as I stand and talk, there is less interest being paid because the Social Security trust fund money is not being spent; it is being saved, which means we have that much less IOUs to the public. 
   We are going to have $1.1 trillion more over the next 5 years, making the total, in a period of about 7 years, of almost $1.5 trillion. 
   I think that on my side of the aisle, the same Senators who are concerned about whether this is real, because someday we have to fix Social Security, in my mind's eye I think they are all for personal accounts as a solution to the Social Security problem. I suggest that if we do personal accounts, then we will not spend this money. In fact, it will turn up on the side of the ledger as having been saved rather than having been spent. So it is too early to predict what kind of reform will occur, and when it will occur, if it occurs, on Social Security. 
   What we have to look at is right now and the next 5 years in this budget resolution. Some would make it sound as if $1.1 trillion applied to the debt--a portion of which is from the on-budget surplus--isn't enough, that we ought to do more. 
   Let me suggest, what is left over after doing that, over the next 5 years, is about $390 billion. That is what is left over in new money, off a freeze. 
   You have to take care of defense with that, which I think a fair guess would be that by itself it is going to grow at $20 billion a year at a minimum. What about all the rest of Government? Are we literally going to say we are not going to have a single increase in the rest of Government? Of course, we are going to have some. 
   What about a tax bill of some type? Sooner or later both 
   sides of the aisle--and we are going to get a new President, but we are going to have some tax relief. That all has to come out of the remaining money, some portion of which they keep saying: Put more on the debt. They can argue whichever way they want. Part of it will come out of the tax relief in the future; part of it will come out of spending in the future; maybe part of it will come out of defense in the future. 
   But I do not believe this Budget Committee did anything but the right thing in assuming that about $1.1 trillion out of a surplus that is probably totally, for both kinds of surplus, about $1.5 trillion, is put on the debt. 
   Everybody claims they want to do more. Everybody quotes Alan Greenspan. My friend, Senator GRAMM, once said: Quoting Alan Greenspan is sort of like quoting the Bible. It depends on whether you are reading John or Matthew; you can get a quote in one of them that faith alone gets you to Heaven, and you can quote the other one that faith and a little work gets you to Heaven. Choose whichever you like. But you can quote either one. 
   I am going to say--to quote Alan Greenspan to my way of thinking--the best thing you can do is put a surplus on the debt that you owe to the public. But then he says, if the next choice is between spending it and tax relief, unequivocally, tax relief; and, third, the worst for the economy is to spend more. 
   Frankly, I am amazed that we have Republicans complaining about not having enough on the debt when all we have left over is used for two things: $150 billion, spread over 5 years, in tax relief, unless we do not do it. If we do not have tax relief at all, it all goes on the debt. That is right in the budget resolution. That is binding. So if you do not do tax relief, it goes on the debt. The rest goes to contemplated increases in defense and a very small amount for the myriad domestic programs that we have in our Government. 
   We have to be both realists and theorists. We have to be philosophical and we have to apply it with some benchmarks to reality. 
   To tell you the honest truth, and to share with my fellow Senators, never in my life--25 years of which was spent with great deficits--did I ever assume we would be applying as much as this budget resolution contemplates against the debt. Our interest is going to decline--I am corrected here--from about $224 billion a year to about $166 billion by the year 2005. That is with the tax relief we have and with the defense increases we have. Then, if you want to go out the next 5 years, it comes down precipitously thereafter. 
   Frankly, this generation of Americans, and those working and trying to make a living, are all out there saying: We are putting part of our taxes into debt relief. They are asking: How much is enough? Are you going to have any left over to give us a little tax relief? Are you going to have any left over so we can have an adequate Defense Department? Or are you really going to put it all on the debt? 
   I understand I am exaggerating when I say ``all,'' but how much more can we do? 
   I do not believe we ought to go beyond what we have in this budget resolution. Democrats will claim maybe $75 billion more ought to go on the debt. Senator ALLARD has it in some formula 
   by the year we ought to have more. I think they both ought to lose. I hope, before we are finished, they will both lose because the right thing to do is just about what the Budget Committee agreed to: about $10 billion, or so, a year out of the on-budget surplus; and the entire Social Security surplus going unused, staying in the fund. 
   When I ask, How much is enough? I suggest that the most significant fiscal policy change made to this point--to the benefit of Americans of the future--is something that came from our side of the aisle, and in particular that I thought up one day; and that most significant fiscal change of events is that all the Social Security surplus stays in the Social Security fund. 
   Ask Dr. Greenspan, looking over the last decade, and from what he can see in the future: What is the most significant fiscal policy change to the betterment of America? He will say that one, if you live by it. We are living by it right here in this budget resolution, and somebody is suggesting that isn't enough. Somebody such as Dr. Greenspan thinks it is a whopping amount. I imagine if he could write it down on a piece of paper, he would say: I really never thought Congress would ever do that. If they do it for another 5 or 10 years, what a plus will occur, what a positive thing to happen for American consumers, the American worker, and America's future. 
   I will just summarize by stating a rather unbelievable fact: By the year 2005, interest expenses will have decreased from 13 percent to 8 percent of the Federal budget. That is the only significant portion of the budget that has declined, from 13 percent of the budget down to 8 percent by 2005. Pretty good work, Congress, pretty good work.

But this amendment prejudges everything that we need for the next 5 years, and perhaps 5 years after that. Assuming we know right now about everything we need--and we ought to use his number, which is 4 percent for defense and everything else--and decide all the rest goes on the debt, then budget committees will start with those ground rules in the future. Pretty soon, we will just write a budget right here on the floor like this. We don't have to meet. Nothing happens any differently every year. We just determine this is exactly how much will be left over, and all the rest goes to the debt.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to provoke a long argument about who did the most to cause America to have these years of prosperity. I will summarize what I think. 
   Frankly, I do not believe it is rational to say the Clinton tax increase of $290 billion is what caused this American economy to go buoyant and produce strong growth rates for the last 7 years. Essentially, that is what happened in that first year. Some say it added some credibility. To the extent it added credibility, it probably should have been taken off after the next year we had credibility. 
   In any event, I want to talk about what we are doing here. I do not know why it is, with the surpluses we have, that we cannot get to the point where those on the other side of the aisle--at least almost all of them. They really do not want to have very much tax relief, if any, for the American people. When we boil it right down, the difference is not paying off the debt --there is a slight difference there--but the difference is spending, and that is it. They want to spend more, and we say let's give back more to the American people in tax relief. 
   This is about as dramatic as I can give it, and it is a pretty honest interpretation of the Democrats' budget--that is what the Senator alludes to--versus our budget. 
   The committee's resolution has 11 percent of the surplus going to tax reductions. They have 4 percent. In the committee's resolution, spending gets 17 percent of the surplus--this is the total surplus--and we put 72 percent of that surplus on the debt. The Democratic plan says let's do 4 percent in tax relief and 22 percent in spending. 
   If one wants to quote Alan Greenspan correctly--as I said, it is like the Bible: It depends on how one wants to read him. But Alan Greenspan would say: Do not spend any of it; put it all on the surplus. And if you cannot put it all on the surplus, do not spend it; put it on tax relief. That is what we did. 
   Essentially, when the argument is finished, for some reason, even though we get our tax relief down to a small amount--$1 in tax relief for $13 in debt reduction in the first year; over 5 years it is $1 in tax relief for $8 in deficit reduction--that is not good enough. We cannot even give back to the taxpayers $1 out of $9--8 plus 1; $8 in reduction of the debt. Here is the difference: We would spend 17 percent; they would spend 22 percent. It seems to me we are following the admonition of the distinguished Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and they are not. 
   On the other hand, we can argue all day who is closest to what he says. The Republicans are being realistic. Out of these huge surpluses, we ought to give a little back to the American people sooner or later, and if we spend it, we do not have it to give back. That is just the way it is. That is the difference between the two. 
   I do not believe I will need all of my half hour. I assume I have used 5 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have anybody else here? 
   Mr. President, I said about as much as I can say about the difference between the budget resolution and Senator CONRAD's approach. I think it is shown right behind me on this chart. Essentially, it does not have very much to do with who brings the debt down quicker. It has more to do with who wants more money for spending? 
   I want to repeat that I am firmly convinced that, for some reason or another, the other side is not frightened by the idea of spending the surplus but somehow they are very frightened about giving some of it back to the citizens of the United States. I know Senator CONRAD has a tax plan also. He is on the Finance Committee. 
   But I submit, if we were to adopt his amendment, any realistic change in the marriage tax penalty over the next 5 years to make it more fair, so millions of newlyweds will not come into April finding out they are paying an average of $1,400 a year more in taxes because they are married than they would if they were single, filing separately--we think that will cost, over 5 years, somewhere between $60 billion and $65 billion. 
   There is some education tax relief that has passed with rather substantial margins. That is about $8 billion. There is health care tax relief that is about $13 billion. 
   That leaves small business provisions for which both sides have voted. They are very good provisions for small businessmen, such as one that says anyone who works for an employer that does not have insurance, if they buy their insurance as an employee, they can deduct it. Isn't that something? I assume Americans thought that was the case already. But unless your employer deducts it, employees cannot. So two people working for different employers, neither of whom has health care, if they pool their resources and buy a health care plan for themselves and one child, they cannot deduct a nickel of it. 
   But there is some relief we propose here on the floor of the Senate that ought to get done, and a number of small business provisions. 
   The minimum for those kinds of reforms is somewhere between 
   $100 billion and $130 billion. We are led to believe we are going to grant all kinds of tax relief to the rich people of America, when the plan encompasses these ideas because that is what we have been talking about. That is what the Finance Committee is going to consider. 
   If you take that much of the surplus and say, we are going to put that much more on debt, you cannot accommodate these kinds of tax relief measures. 
   Last but not least, I repeat, how much debt reduction is enough? 
   Frankly, I would like to get rid of the whole debt. But we accumulated it over 30 years. How in the world we expect one generation of Americans to pay that whole debt down is beyond me. I think the $400 billion we have already done plus the $1.1 trillion in this budget resolution in the reduction of debt is pretty good. 
   As a matter of fact, I think we will substantially reduce interest payments. That ought to permit lower interest rates in this country. Although Dr. Alan Greenspan insists on raising interest rates to solve other problems, maybe it will not have an impact for some time.  
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me use 3 minutes of it. 
   I say to Senator KENNEDY, I am not arguing with your CBO or OMB numbers. I could not tell which it was. You said CBO and then said OMB. I do not know which it is. 
   Look, I am not arguing about that because that is a total function. That is not education. There are other things than education in that function. 
   Here is the education part. I will put in the RECORD what is in this budget resolution because it is supported by the Congressional Budget Office. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-57-20000405</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. If we are speaking about education--not AmeriCorps; that is not part of education; some might think it is, but it isn't--according to the CBO, our budget resolution provides $47.877 billion for education. The President had $47.228--slightly less, $600 million less. What we are spending this year is 43.3. 
   To get up and say all these groups support this--of course, if we ask them, do you want more money, they will say, of course, we want more money. Right? I don't think anybody in the education field, whether it is at the State level, the district level, or the national level will not affirmatively answer a questionnaire, will you support more money for education? 
   The question is, Are we treating it with the priority that it deserves in this budget? There are two parts to ours. One is the sense-of-the-Senate language that says we need reform in education, not only more money. We don't need to try the same old things we have been trying, the so-called status quo, more targeted programs telling them precisely what to do, such as we did with special education. Then we didn't even fund special education to the amount we promised them, and they had to take it out of their regular budgets. We set the standard and we told them how to do it. I guarantee you, they would say, give us more funding in that program. They would answer yes across America. And we do provide more funding. In fact, since the Republicans have been in leadership, we have been trying to play some catchup on special education funding for the schools across America. 
   Everyone should know our history has been for many decades, the cities, the States, and the counties pay for education essentially, not the Federal Government. So to make this out as a debate on what happens to public education in America is to ignore the fact that for most of our history we have paid between 6.5 and 8 percent of the total cost of kindergarten through 12, somewhere between 6.5 and maybe 8.5 percent. The rest is paid by whom? The taxpayers of the sovereign States of America. 
   We are suggesting that a new program ought to come into being where they have more say-so, rather than less, about how our money is used, more flexibility and accountability. We have both suggestions in our budget resolution. 
   I will take 1 additional minute. In every function in this Government, even the Economic Development Administration, where we understand there are 334 different activities in the Federal Government, they want more, not less. In a buoyant economy, growing with less than 5-percent unemployment, America putting money into economic development so people can run around acting as if they are creating jobs, of course they want more money. But the point is, don't the American taxpayers in a surplus of this size deserve some consideration? Shouldn't they be given an opportunity to say maybe we ought to get a little tax relief such as the marriage tax penalty. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is very interesting; the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts says this is going to show our priorities. We have more than the President of the United States in education. So one would think that he would have more money available for tax reduction. But guess what. He found there are a lot of other priorities. So he has a 14-percent increase in domestic programs, all with high priorities equivalent to education--increase them all. Actually, in truth, the difference is, do you want to spend more money on the domestic programs of America, even though we are increasing education more than the President, do you want to spend more and not even give the taxpayers a shot as to whether or not they should get some tax relief via the marriage tax penalty, some small business help and those kinds of things? 
   That is essentially the difference in priorities. We think ours are very good priorities. There is a lot of money in here for education. To the extent the Federal Government can be helpful, I believe we will be helpful.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is not often that we are on the floor in this mode, where I am opposing my junior Senator's request. On this one, I am in opposition and will shortly move to table. 
   I suggest the Congress of the United States is going to have an opportunity before the year is out to vote on a new Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That act, as passed, plus the appropriations decisions made by Senator SPECTER and his Democratic minority member, approved by the appropriations in the Senate, will determine  where the specific money goes--not what we are saying on the floor that we assume is in our number. 
   I believe we are going to reform the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and it is not going to be filled with targeted programs as it is now, or at least the States will have an option to do otherwise, to approach this from ``we will receive the money, we will sign an accountability agreement, and let us decide where our priorities are.'' 
   One shoe doesn't fit every school district in America in terms of aid. In fact, sometimes we tell them to do the things they don't want to do. 
   I don't believe this is a debate over the enumerated tools Senator Bingaman says he is adding. The issue is, are we adding as much as the President to a budget of last year, which was $43 billion. The answer is, yes, we are. We are going to decide, as the Senate and House, how it is spent. We are not deciding that tonight, whether the Bingaman amendment is adopted or not; It is going to be up to another series of votes. 
   I don't know whether we are going to fund the programs that he thinks are great programs. Somebody else is going to decide that. We are doing as much as the President in program authority; of that, I am confident. 
   With that, I move to table the Bingaman amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I will shortly move to table the amendment. I want to show you a chart that simply depicts the difference in priorities between the two sides. Alan Greenspan suggested we should put our surplus against the debt, unless we intend to spend it, in which event we should reduce or reform or give relief to the taxpayer. A big difference between the two is exemplified by this. They would give 4 percent of the surplus to the taxpayers. 
   The difference is very easily depicted. They give 4 percent of the surplus to tax relief for the American taxpayer; we would give 11 percent. They would spend 22 percent of the surplus; we would spend 17 percent. 
   That explains it. Alan Greenspan suggests instead of spending money, we ought to give it back to the taxpayers. That is what we are doing--but a very small amount. As a matter of fact, $150 billion over 5 years, if we pass it, means $13 goes to debt reduction for $1 in tax relief in the first year; 8-1 over the 5 years. 
   How much is enough? It seems to me the taxpayer deserves a little bit of it. We shouldn't be spending it. We should give it back to them. 
   I move to table the amendment. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. First of all, Mr. President, I am sure this amendment violates the Budget Act because it is not germane. I will make that point of order shortly. 
   But I am afraid that if we adopted this amendment, it could, over time, preclude the kind of defense spending we need and the kind of tax relief in which we might be interested. I believe we are doing plenty to reduce the debt in this budget resolution: $177 billion in the first year, $1.1 trillion over 5 years. The ratio of tax relief to debt reduction, over 5 years, is 8 to 1. In the first year, it is 13 to 1. That is a pretty good game plan. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order that this is not germane to the provisions of the budget resolution.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to explain to the Senate why I am supporting this. The actual sense of this resolution says:  
   It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in the budget resolution do not assume the reduction of any Federal gasoline tax on either a temporary or permanent basis.  
   I might say to the Senate, that is already true. The Senate budget resolution does not--does not, in the functional totals. So I am delighted to support it. There is some language saying: Within the tax provisions. The tax committee can do a lot of different things. One thing suggested was temporary repeal of the gasoline tax. I am pleased to have an opportunity to vote on whether or not the Senate would like that to remain even contemplated. Whether they will be precluded because of a vote, I do not know, but I think we ought to vote tomorrow on this issue. I support the sense of the Senate that is proposed. 
   I ask Senators how many more want to speak on this resolution because we have two others?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to argue in two parts. 
   My first part has to do with the highways and byways and freeways of America and our home cities across this land. I think there is no one in this Chamber who has not been home to their State and found that people somewhere in their State are frustrated because we do not have adequate roads to handle the traffic. 
   No, I am not suggesting I know how to do that in terms of these very heavily congested areas. But there is no doubt, we are way behind the curve in terms of supplying highways, freeways, and arteries in our cities. 
   You are not going to tell the American people they can't have their dream. I mean, their dream is to own a house and own a car or cars. One of their big dreams is to have that place where they want it. We are just never going to succeed in telling the American people: You cannot live 5 miles from your employment, as they did in Russia. They had it all figured out: They all worked; they all got on one train; and they all went to work. In fact, they told them in high school what they were going to be. 
   That is not America. So we are behind. In fact, I am not sure in most places we are gaining on the congestion and traffic. Frankly, I could come down here and say I am pretty satisfied that repeal of the 4.3-cent tax would not hurt next year, but in 7 years actually it would hurt. 
   The truth of the matter is, we should not deceive anybody. The problem we have is the problem that America uses more crude oil and crude-oil products than we are now producing. 
   Frankly, we have an American policy, I regret to say--especially since President Bill Clinton has been in office and Vice President GORE--of taking more and more of America, the public lands, out of production that you cannot use; you cannot get on it to find oil, even if it is there, all under some mystique that on ``public domain'' we should not be looking for oil, that we ought to be saving it for something. 
   Then tonight we are going to have a debate, I say to the Senator. I am not sure where everyone is going to be on it. But actually one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Arctic wilderness, called ANWR, one one-hundredth of 1 percent is a little strip of land that they are trying to say: Why don't we try to find out if there is oil there? 
   You know what they think might be there? Sixteen billion barrels of oil. Pretty much. It is as much as we will import from Saudi Arabia over the next 5, 6, 7 years. That would be the amount. That is pretty good. That is a pretty large amount of oil. All of it would be owned by Americans. All of it would be drilled by Americans. Americans would have jobs. 
   Instead, we say it is just going to ruin that wilderness. Somebody who is neutral ought to pass on that, not somebody who wants to save this wilderness, including one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the land surface. 
   If I had my notes from my desk, I would tell you how much we have taken out of production in America. We have taken lands on which people could find oil, and we have said: You cannot get on it to find oil. 
   We have regulations, through the Department of the Interior, that instead of saying, hey, get out here and find your oil, they make it tough. It is sort of like: Boy, do we have to put up with you? It is not like: Boy, I hope you find oil. 
   It is American oil. It is sort of like: Maybe it is OK, but it is just too bad that we have to do this. What is too bad about it? We are going to buy this oil someplace. We have less American oil, fewer rigs producing oil, and we are getting more dependent. 
   The last point is, according to the independent institute within the Department of Energy, the one that is supposed to do analysis of supply, they tell us--I hope they are wrong--they cannot find out how much the production of the world is. That sounds incredible. If they cannot, somebody in our Government should. We should not be surprised all of a sudden if somebody says: You know, they are producing 4 million barrels less. We are hurting. 
   We ought to know; there is no way to keep this a real secret. If we set out to find it, I am sure we could. In fact, I think there are probably some parts of the American Government we do not know about that might already know that. But that is very important. 
   To summarize, my last point is, we need to build more roads for America's congestion, not less. Secondly, we need to take a positive approach. If the President does not want to, we will not get it done for a while. But we have to decide what are our goals as Americans in terms of producing energy? How much should we be conserving? Let's get serious about it. 
   This will not happen with a bunch of Government regs. This will happen when the marketplace of America is opened up to oil and gas production. I am even wondering whether the largest supply of natural gas is offshore in some parts of America. We have said: No more offshore drilling. 
   It isn't environmentally dangerous. In fact, I submit to the Senate, it is more dangerous to increase our reliance and thus bring more tankers into American ports than it would be to seriously consider doing more offshore drilling. 
   But, of course, for some people what I am speaking about is kind of radical. I think it is really kind of common sense about America's growing dependence. I am not ashamed or embarrassed about saying I would change it drastically. I would recommend that somebody change it dramatically. Tell the world we are going to try. We are not going to give in. 
   We currently think it is an American energy policy to send the Secretary of  Energy--one of New Mexico's sons; my friend--around to make a deal. That is America's energy policy? Have you ever heard of anything like that being the policy of America? What if they said no? 
   In this case, they started asking a few questions and said: Maybe we don't want to hurt your economy. Kuwait does not know what we want of them. We saved them from the invasion. They do not know whether we want to dance on a barrel of oil or what we want. They already said: Look, America, you send us so many signals, we don't know what to do. But we are on your side. 
   I think we ought to be very clear, it is not this 4.3-cent tax. What it is, we do not have a policy to produce more and tell the world we are growing more independent rather than dependent. 
   Whatever time I have, if I have any, I yield back.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. From the first knowledge we had that the OPEC cartel plus their friends had dramatically decreased production, thus having this terrible impact on American energy costs, Senator MURKOWSKI has been trying every day, every time he could, to tell us we are doing things exactly the opposite of what we ought to be doing for America's future. I compliment him. He has a lot of people wondering about what we are up to. Frankly, I would like to add a little bit to that. 
   While the United States grows more dependent upon foreign crude oil, we have an administration that, from the first day they went in office until today, has been engaged in seeing to it that the United States produces less oil--not more--from our own lands by overt, conscious acts of withdrawing real estate that we own as a nation on which to explore for oil and gas, to a constant insistence that we cannot solve the little, tiny problem of what do we do with nuclear waste, which every country in the world except America has solved. They have solved it at least for 50 to 100 years. 
   We sit around acting as if we can continue to be dependent upon the very limited sources of energy for this great country's future. I will give a couple of facts about what has happened to the American energy economy, the production of oil in America, by Americans for Americans. In 1990, there were 405,000 jobs in America in the exploration and production of oil and gas. As of last year, there were 293,000, a 27-percent decline in people employed in the exploration and production of oil and gas in America. When you reduce the number of people involved in oil and gas exploration by 27 percent, there has been something consciously 
   happening that says we will produce less in America. 
   Ten years ago, there were 657 rigs working on oil exploration in the United States. Everybody understands what that is. Now there are fewer than 175. We did something wrong. Somebody would stand up from the administration and say: The cartel had something to do with that; they lowered the price of oil. But we didn't have a policy that said to our companies, in spite of that, we will help you explore for more. As a matter of fact, we had the opposite policy. 
   New refineries in the United States: It used to be, if you could have an oil refinery and attach to it all the refined products that go with it, you would be delighted. It would employ your people. They are high-paying jobs. Guess what. In the United States, while we grow dependent, here we are with not a single new refinery built in the United States since 1976. That means we have decided other countries ought to produce the refined products we need and we ought to have such strict requirements that it is impossible for Americans to build them with American money and American workers to produce more refined products in our country--the opposite policy we ought to have. 
   If we had another time and another day, we could discuss why Americans will not invest in oil refineries in the United States. I can tell you one of  them, and I will use three initials for starters--the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States. Unreasonable restrictions, costing billions of dollars, that any neutral party would say are unreasonable, we impose them. When they can pay for them, they do; when they cannot pay any longer, they say: We will not refine anymore; we will do it somewhere else. 
   There are Federal lands available for exploration. I suggest we have done it exactly the wrong way since this President has been in office. We have taken lands out of production because we have this kind of whimsical idea, if they are public lands, we sure don't want to find an oil rig out there. In fact, it is an attitude. We have to put up with oil rigs, but we really don't want them, even though it is ``black'' money for American workers. It is oil for American cars. It is America's investment. But it is like public domain. Man, we ought to just save that and forget about this dirty business of producing oil. That is America's policy today. 
   I wish I could share with you, although I don't have the notes, how many thousands and thousands of acres we have taken out of production, out of development, because of what I have been explaining for the last 3 or 4 minutes. 
   That leads us to tonight. In the past, I have heard Senators on the floor of the Senate talking about their States with great enthusiasm, great concern about what is happening to their States. I will tell you why FRANK MURKOWSKI and Senator TED STEVENS are concerned. If we were to produce oil in ANWR on one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the land, 2,200 acres is what we would need to explore for oil in a modern way and produce it in ANWR. 
   That would produce 16 billion barrels of oil, produced by Americans, American workers, American oil for Americans. What does that mean in dollars? It means one-half trillion. Think of that, I say to the Senator from Wyoming. In the State of Wyoming, we have oil locked up. It is worth half a trillion for your workers, for your companies, for your businesses, and we are locking it up for the reasons Senator MURKOWSKI stated, that we wanted to lock up Prudhoe Bay. 
   We found none of the predictions about Prudhoe Bay were true, and none of them will be true about this one either. But it is as if we are kind of economically arrogant. We are so powerful and so strong that we do not have to worry about American oil for American people, produced by Americans, used for American cars. We just have to say this little tiny piece of property, just a strip of ANWR that you could go and explore to find out if it is there and then insist they advise the Congress if there is any environmental damage--they will not let us do that. 
   I submit we ought to vote on this. I also submit anyone who votes no on this ought to be asked: What do you think America's future is? More oil from the cartel or less? 
   With that, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Alaska. I thank him.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Could I say to the distinguished Senator from Alaska, there are only two ways I can think of that he could save his time: We could close up shop right now, and we are not going to do that, so there is an hour on each side. You could get consent, and you tried and haven't gotten that. So anybody offering an amendment tonight has an hour on each side if they want to use it. If they want to yield it back, they can yield back. Any amendment to an amendment has a half-hour, and we go that way until we finish tonight. 
   I can tell you, I think you made as good an argument tonight as you can make. I don't think there are many votes going to be changed. I already complimented you immensely. I do it again. 
   There will be 2 minutes before the vote. They will be in your control.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have an announcement. Today, the Senate will begin consideration of S. Con. Res. 101, the budget resolution. Amendments will be offered throughout the day. Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes occurring during today's session. Those Senators who intend to offer amendments should work with the chairman and ranking member on a time to offer and debate their amendments. 
   As a reminder, votes will occur throughout the week in an effort to complete action on the budget resolution no later than the Friday session of the Senate. If we are diligent, we might finish Friday night, although we do have a total of 50 hours of debate and there are certain conditions that make that a little bit longer than 50 hours in terms of adding up time on the floor. 
   As a further reminder, the Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 today to accommodate the weekly party conference luncheons. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I have brief opening remarks, after which time I will be pleased to yield to either the minority whip or the ranking member. 
   First, a couple of observations. We are now on the budget resolution. It is now pending before the Senate. Before I summarize the resolution as reported by the Budget Committee last week, let me cover a couple of housekeeping or managerial items. For those Senators and staff here, and those who might be listening, I remind everyone that the procedure for considering a budget resolution in the Senate is unique compared to other legislation and other legislative items that we debate and amend on the floor. 
   First, a budget resolution is privileged. That means proceeding to its consideration as we have done this morning could not have been delayed by a Senator by filibuster or otherwise. 
   Second, the underlying law, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act--not the resolution--effectively establishes the rules for considering this resolution. The first of the rules is that there is a time limit for considering a budget resolution. That time limit is 50 hours. Less time can always be taken. While it has never been used, a nondebatable motion to reduce debate time is always in order. The 50 hours does not count the time in the quorums immediately preceding a vote, nor does it count the actual voting time. Fifty hours is evenly divided between the sponsor and the opponents of the resolution. 
   An amendment or amendments in the first degree to the resolution are limited to 2 hours evenly divided between the mover of the amendment and its opponents. Additional time can be yielded off the overall resolution by  the manager or the ranking member, or their designee, if such time is still available under the 50-hour rule. Amendments to amendments are limited to 1 hour, again, evenly divided between the mover and the opponent. As before, if overall time exists on the resolution, Members can add time to the debate on the second-degree amendment. 
   The next discussion is where it gets a little bit difficult. Senators who may want to amend this resolution should note there are very particular rules that apply. First, the committee-reported budget resolution forms the basis of germaneness. 
   There are four types of germane amendments: One, an amendment to strike language or numbers, which is germane per se; second, an amendment to change dates or numbers; third, an amendment adding sense of the Senate for matters within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee; and fourth, an amendment that limits some power in the resolution. If not germane, it will take three-fifths of the Senators' affirmative votes to waive the point of order. If not, the amendment will fall. 
   I emphasize these procedures so Senators and their staffs will not be surprised if a germaneness point of order is raised on their amendment. 
   Later in this debate we will follow the rules the act laid out for us considering a budget resolution, and we will try to finish it in an orderly manner before the week is complete. I will briefly summarize the reported resolution before us today. 
   First, let me say this annual exercise further strengthens my resolve to bring to the floor changes to this process, to change it into a biennial budget and biennial appropriations process. But we are charged with reporting an annual budget, and until the law is changed, or if it is changed, the committee-reported resolution abides by the current law. 
   I acknowledge that whatever fiscal policy we outline in any budget resolution the Senate considers this year, that resolution will be constructed in the heat of a very political year and it will, in truth, be ministered over by a new President and new Congress next year. So this resolution can only be a broad blueprint for fiscal policy. It allows us to complete our work expeditiously, if at all possible, this year. It recognizes the need for reform in many areas and that those reforms will undoubtedly have to wait until the next Congress and the next President. 
   While we now have the luxury of budgeting in a world of possible surpluses, that does not mean reform in Government is not necessary. Reforms to the process are needed, and this committee's resolution begins down that path so we can replace some cynicism that was built up about the Federal budgeting process with some minor but new enforcement tools. Some may not like them, but we are trying very hard to answer a call from many Senators that the budget resolution be enforced and that we understand precisely what we are doing and look to the resolution itself for how much we can spend and where we are going. 
   Reforms are needed to ensure the long-term solvency of the Social Security system, not simply placing more empty IOUs on future generations. We cannot reform the Social Security system without a President who is willing, and thus far we have not had such in the White House under the administration of President Clinton. 
   Reforms are needed in the Medicare program, not simply promising more politically popular benefits to a system in which, in 2010, the outgo will exceed income. In this budget resolution, we have provided $40 billion in two installments of $20 billion and $20 billion to do reform and add some prescription benefits, if that is what Congress decides to do. 
   Major reforms are needed to our Tax Code. We all know that. While the resolution before us proposes to make room for tax reductions, I acknowledge that until the unfairness of this system and its complexities are addressed, real tax reform waits. 
   Finally, reforms to government programs are broadly needed; there is no doubt about that. As GAO and the Congressional Budget Office have pointed out to us earlier this year, we really do not need 342 Federal economic-development-related programs. We really do not need 12 different agencies administering 35 different laws on food safety. It would seem one agency would be sufficient. 
   I am not sure we need over a dozen postsecondary education programs and 224 elementary and secondary education programs administered by the Department of Education with their overlapping, duplicating, inefficient delivery of Federal funds to States. Perhaps this year we will consider on the floor of the Senate some dramatic reforms that might alter the education 
   system I have just described. 
   So when critics say this resolution does not provide enough for the discretionary accounts, both defense and nondefense, I have to respond: Not if you assume that everything the Government does today is done efficiently and effectively. But I am realistic, and reform of these programs will not come in the 70 days left in this Congress. 
   So the resolution before us is not everything an outgoing administration wants because, quite frankly, they are not going to be around to administer what I consider their bloated budget request. But it is a responsible step for the short amount of time left in Congress. 
   Let me conclude with some key points on this resolution. 
   No. 1, it protects Social Security. Not one penny of the Social Security surplus is touched. 
   No. 2, it balances the budget every year, not counting the Social Security surplus. In other words, even though we have not been able to adopt a lockbox, we have followed the premise and philosophy and substance of a lockbox; that is, none of the Social Security money surplus is being spent. 
   It retires debt held by the public, nearly $174 billion this year alone, and over $1.1 trillion over the next 5 years. 
   It sets aside $8 billion in non-Social Security surpluses for debt relief this year alone. In other words, that $8 billion could be spent without us touching the Social Security trust fund. We could still live up to that promise. But we have taken $8 billion of the surplus outside of Social Security and put that on the debt also. 
   It rejects the President's proposed cuts in Medicare. It strengthens Medicare and sets up a $40 billion reserve for a new prescription drug benefit immediately, with reform coming later. 
   Expenditures for the Department of Education would increase $4.5 billion this year, special ed would increase nearly $2.2 billion, and Head Start funding would be up nearly $255 million. 
   Funding for our national security would increase nearly 4.8 percent next year, up to $305.8 billion, nearly a $17 billion increase. 
   Funding for WIC, section 8 housing, National Park Service, highways and airports, all would increase next year, as would Head Start. 
   We provide immediate emergency assistance to depressed agricultural sections in the form of nearly $5.5 billion in income support needed this year, not next year. 
   And, yes, we provide $150 billion in tax relief for American families, for fairness and equity in the form of the marriage penalty, for small businesses and startups, for education and medical assistance. Remember, the President did not provide any tax relief for the next 5 years. 
   I believe this is a fair beginning. I am very hopeful we can have a lively debate about this on the floor of the Senate. For every $1 in tax relief, since there are those who continue to say the tax relief we seek is too big, too much, too risky--this resolution devotes $13 to debt reduction. For every $1 in tax relief, this resolution devotes $13 for debt reduction; 13-to-1 is the ratio in the first year. It is down to about 8-to-1 for the entire 5 years. 
   I believe it is a fair resolution. It is not a risky resolution, as some will claim. I contend that increasing spending for domestic programs nearly 14 percent next year, as the President would do, is much more risky to the future of 
   Social Security and debt reduction than a modest tax reduction. 
   Let me explain. If you increased domestic discretionary spending by 14 percent a year, it would only take 3 years until you would have to use the Social Security surplus to pay for domestic spending. What does that mean? It means either the President sent us a one-time political year 14-percent increased budget or he is serious that we  need that amount every year to meet the so-called needs of domestic programs. In either case, it is not the right thing to do. 
   If it was sent up here as a one-time political budget with everything in it but the kitchen sink, then it should be denied. If it was sent up here to set a pattern for 3 or 4 years, then it truly would be an injustice to senior citizens and the Social Security trust fund. 
   But even if the tax reductions we plan for do not become law, we make sure every penny of that which would have gone to tax reductions is returned in the form of debt reduction, not new spending. So for those who say there will be no tax reduction or tax relief this year, and for the President who says even though Republicans will try, he will not let it happen, then obviously we will put another $150 billion, or some substantial portion of it, on the debt, which only adds to the numbers I have already discussed with you with reference to tax reduction in this budget resolution. 
   It is a resolution that will allow us to get our work done. I say to the Republicans, my side of the aisle, this budget resolution cleared the committee on a party line vote with every Republican voting for it and every Democrat voting against it. I do not know how it will turn out 3, 4, or 5 days from now, but I do hope Republicans will consider that what they want to change in it may, indeed, change whether or not we can adopt a budget resolution at all on the floor. 
   I hope Republicans will consult and talk with the chairman and manager of the bill as we consider this resolution so that our end product will be that we will pass a budget resolution and go to conference with the House and let our appropriations committees start their work. 
   I do want to say at the beginning and, obviously, I will at the end, that it has been a pleasure working with Senator LAUTENBERG. This is his last time managing the budget resolution because he will be leaving the Senate. 
   We started off not knowing each other very well, maybe being a little guarded about how we would think about what each one said, whether we would be cynical about it, whether we would believe it. I compliment him. His job has become very important to him, and he has become very important to this job. It will be a pleasure working with him for the next 4 or 5 days. I very much thank the Senator from New Jersey for what he has done. I thank everyone for listening. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Illinois wants to speak. I will not interrupt as far as speaking. But I want to say to Senators on our side that we would like very much for anyone who has remarks on the budget to come down before we recess. Then we will start. We will not take any amendments until after we come back from that recess so that Democrats have a chance to talk in their caucus and we have a chance to talk in our policy luncheon. 
   If you want to speak about the resolution with general statements, we will be here until 12:30. Both sides are going to apply the same rules, according to Senator LAUTENBERG. There will be no amendments until after the 12:30 luncheon.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, somehow, I guess because the President is pretty good at coming up with words, we hear that what we are attempting to do is risky. That is a nice word, ``risky.'' I submit that if the American people knew how much the President was increasing domestic spending for next year's budget, they would say: Mr. President, that's too risky. 
   A 14-percent increase in the domestic programs of this country is what the President has in his budget this year. I want to talk about what that really means. 
   Either that is a one-time event and the President does not think we have to do it again in the next year, the year after, or the year after--just one time; it happens that one time in an election year--right now--if you think it is just an election year number, you ought to discard it and decide what you really need. That is what we tried to do. We think it is a political budget. 
   Let me flip the coin and say why I am entitled to believe it is a 1-year budget phenomenon in a political year. I think I have to say perhaps it is not. Perhaps it is what Democrats think we ought to spend--a 14-percent increase. 
   I have a chart that shows what will happen to the surplus and the Social Security surplus if we increase domestic discretionary spending 14 percent a year for 3 years. We will start to use up the entire surplus, and we will begin to use the Social Security surplus. That is how important it is that we keep spending under control. 
   With a 14-percent increase in discretionary domestic spending--that is the 13 bills we do each year, less the defense bill--this chart shows the on-budget surplus spent and the money raided from Social Security in the gray and yellow. 
   Just look at the chart. The total surplus is shown by the red line. Look at what begins to happen to the surplus as we increase this budget 14 percent a year just on the discretionary domestic accounts. By the year 2003, it gets very close to our starting to use the Social Security surplus, and by 2004 we are. Clearly, by 2005, we will have used the Social Security surplus. We will have begun to use all of the surplus because of the 14-percent increase. 
   Frankly, I think that sort of tells the tale. Obviously, I do not believe that is going to happen. The 14-percent increase is unparalleled, other than in 1 year under President Jimmy Carter. I do not think, even at the President's behest, we are going to do anything like that. 
   But I have two other points I would like to make. One, my good friend, Senator LAUTENBERG, and the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, keep referring to how much we are going to reduce Federal expenditures. They keep using the word ``real.'' Everybody who is in earshot of this floor debate should understand that the word ``real'' has a technical meaning Republicans have decided we will not use. 
   If you want to look at what is spent by our Federal Government every year in the appropriations accounts and you want to say it is entitled to ``real growth,'' that means every single solitary account of the Federal Government grows each year by the rate of inflation. 
   I do not think the average American assumes that if you do not let it grow at the rate of inflation every year, you are cutting things. Many people live with a frozen budget; they do not have any more the next year than they do this year. 
   We start with the assumption that everything is frozen, and 
   then we decide what to add back. We have done that for a few years because it is a huge increase in Federal expenditures when you assume every account in Government will go up by the rate of inflation every year. We call that a nonincrease. We call that a neutral budget. We call that a budget that does not spend any new money. Everybody knows it spends new money over the previous years to the extent that you add inflation to every single account, bar none. Frankly, everyone knows you do not have to increase every account in this Federal Government by the inflation rate of every year. 
   So what do we do? We start with: Let's freeze it and see how much we have left over. To my amazement, and contrary to the numbers that have been talked about here on the floor by the other side, if you do that and say to Americans, we are going to start at zero and we are going to add back, we have a surplus of $400 billion over the next 5 years. 
   Of that, we are going to spend $230 billion. In other words, our budget, in the next year and the succeeding years, adds $230 billion to a base of about $570 billion. We have a $400 billion surplus. We are going to spend $230 billion. We are going to say: If Congress can, and the President will, we will have tax relief of $150 billion. We will have debt reduction of an additional $20 billion. Essentially, that is a pretty fair allocation of our resources. If, in fact, we do not get the tax reductions, every bit of it will go on the surplus. 
   There is no difference between the Democrat budget they will propose and ours on debt reduction. We are both about $1 trillion over the next 5 years. But our budget, the one for which we ask the Members to vote, has $174 billion in debt reduction--$174 billion in the first year, $1 trillion over the 5 years. 
   Let's get back to the tax relief. Mr. President, $150 billion over 5 years; $13 billion in the first year. The ratio in the first year of tax relief to deficit reduction is $13 of debt reduction to $1 in tax relief. 
   How much is enough? 
   Should the ratio be $50 to $1? Should it be $40 to $1? It is $13 to $1 in the first year. Over the 5 years, it is $8 in deficit reduction for $1 of tax relief. I think that is pretty good. 
   I repeat, if we start with a freeze and add back, rather than starting with the budget that adds back inflation to everything and calls anything we reduce from that a cut, we will be spending $230 billion over those 5 years, increasing our national defense spending and our domestic discretionary spending.  
   If we just averaged them per year and took 5 into $230 billion, what would that be? Five into $200 billion would be $40 billion a year. About $46 billion to $50 billion each year in new spending is available under this budget resolution. If we start with the premise that everything is at zero, and we add it back, we are going to add $230 billion over 5 years, which is somewhere between $45 billion and $50 billion a year. 
   How much is enough? 
   I believe what we have just described is plenty. We can improve and enhance the accounts in our Government, such as education, military, National Institutes of Health, things we all know should go up substantially, but we do not have to increase every single program in Government. 
   As I said in my opening remarks, if we only had the gusto and enthusiasm to reform the discretionary accounts, we have a litany of things the Government Accounting Office says are duplication of effort. There are 342 different programs spread in five Departments for economic development. These things can be put together in a way that we will spend less, save the taxpayers dollars, and, yes, provide them with some tax relief in areas such as the marriage penalty, affordable education, patients' rights, and a small business package. If you add those up, nobody thinks those are the wrong things to do. Everybody thinks they are on the right track. We make room for the Finance Committee here and the Ways and Means Committee in the House to do it. 
   I will comment just for a moment on Medicare. In this budget resolution, we have $40 billion for Medicare reform and prescription drugs. The President wants to make a political issue out of Medicare. I think with this budget resolution he is finished. The President cut Medicare by knocking down the providers. Then the net amount he provided for Medicare prescription benefits and reform was $15 billion. 
   Nonetheless, we will hear them say we are not doing enough. I am sure they will find a way to say we are not doing enough. This budget resolution has $40 billion. It was provided by an amendment by Senator SNOWE of Maine and Senator WYDEN, who cosponsored it, and Senator SMITH of Oregon was a principal proponent, and it was accepted by the committee. There were no negative votes. 
   Incidentally, just as an aside, while to me it doesn't make that much difference, the Democrat members of the Budget Committee offered a total substitute, and their Medicare additions were less than what is in the Republican budget resolution, so I don't know that they have any room to complain. They had $35 billion in theirs; we had $40 billion. So I think we are within the parameters of getting something done that is bipartisan. I hope it is led by reform and efficiency. We should not add big benefits to a program that is going to run out of money until we get some reform.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to insert in the RECORD--because we speak of the President's budget and Medicare and, frankly, the President talks about how much he wants to spend for prescription drugs. But hidden in the budget are cuts in the program that he assumes will go toward prescription drugs and reform. 
   I just want everyone to know I don't believe a bipartisan committee in the Senate, or the House, would approve of the President's cuts in this health care program. Hospital cuts in the cycle of this budget for 5 years are $6.8 billion; $2.1 billion is reduced in terms of what is going to be allowable from cancer treatment clinics and other outpatient clinics providing certain kinds of drug treatments that are already covered by Medicare, and a $3.7 billion reduction from the Medicare Choice health plans, including plans in low-cost States, such as Oregon, New Mexico, and Minnesota.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I once again say if any Senators would like to be heard prior to our 12:30 luncheon, I am here to yield time to them. We won't have amendments until after our respective policy and caucus lunches. Since nobody is here, I will make a couple of observations about the American economy. 
   There are some things about the American economy we continue to call phenomenal. We continue to look at the American production machine, which is a sum total of all the efforts of American workers, American business, American investment. Our gross domestic product, the sum total we have available, is growing and growing. It has reached a very high level of about $9 trillion. 
   The world looks at us and wonders how in the world are we doing this. We don't have very much inflation. We have the highest level of employment we have had in decades. We have annual growth that is still shocking the economists who were quite sure we could not sustain the kind of growth we have. We have Europe looking at us and saying maybe we had better get over there and invest, start buying into their companies. We have a country we all were frightened of named Japan. Many people used to come to the floor and say, ``Why don't we follow Japan and have a planned economy?'' I am very glad nobody chose to do that in America. And look at what happened to the respective competitiveness and growth and prosperity of the two nations. I wish them the best, obviously, but we are doing rather well. 
   I suggest there are three or four things that make this work. I think we should look at them very carefully because what is going on in the other capitalist countries and democracies in the world is very different. We have been committed to the proposition that America prospers on low taxes. Now I understand that most of us think the percent of the gross domestic product that goes to taxes is too high. There is no question that the percent of our gross domestic product that goes to Federal taxes is the highest it has been since the Second World War. But, in essence, when you compare America's taxing of itself and its activities and its people and its workers, we are a low-tax nation. 
   I believe if we do not continue to keep it a low-tax nation but, rather, succumb to a high-tax status such as those competitors we have in the world, we are going to end up being exactly like them. A high-tax country, such as Germany, lives with 10, 11 percent unemployment because they have imposed on all their employers to pay for the welfare benefits of their nation. Yet, on top of them, they have to keep very large taxes. They wonder why it doesn't work. We sit over here saying, thank God we are not taxing like them. We haven't yet decided to impose on our businesses, beyond what they ought to be sustaining on their shoulders so they can invest and grow. 
   Secondly, while we declare regulations, I think the time will come--perhaps with a new President--when we will look carefully at the overregulation in certain areas of the economy, including whether environmental laws are reasonable or unreasonable in many areas, to compare with those competing with us. We don't have regulations that stymie small business and stymie growth. 
   It is almost impossible for small business to grow in Europe as it does in America because right off the bat their rules and regulations make it practically impossible. We are very fortunate. We have less regulation. We need to have less of a burden of regulation if we want to continue to prosper and grow. 
   Last theory: Innovation and high productivity are now natural parts of the American economy. We are not sure how all that happened. I believe we are underestimating productivity growth because I don't think we quite know how to do it in a service-oriented economy built on computers and modern technology. But I believe that because of innovation, improving technology, and lowering of prices for technology that productivity is growing at a very high rate. It is higher than we are estimating it. 
   When you add low taxes and less regulations than our competitors have, urging that we do better in both, that we stick to these lower taxes by putting in a tax reduction in this bill, tax relief that will keep us on that path, and waiting for somebody to occupy the Presidency that will reform our regulatory system and continue not to stymie employers with reference to their workforce, mobility, and so forth, we are going to have great sustained growth for a long time. 
   I don't choose to lay the credit on who did it, but it is clear that a lot of people are responsible. Congress has done a whale of a job in the last 7 or 8 years in reducing entitlement spending and reducing overall expenditures of Government. It is something of which we can be very proud. 
   In addition, we entered into a bipartisan agreement that balanced the budget, that had a very significant effect on lowering the cost of Government over that period of time. We should stick to that and not go with something such as the President is asking for, to increase domestic discretionary spending by 14 percent, a risky proposition, I would call it, in light of  the prosperity and how we are going to get it. 
   What else is new? I have to say the most significant new dynamic is the commitment on the part of the Congress and the President not to spend the Social Security trust fund. 
   I am very proud I was among the first to challenge the President by saying his idea of saving 62 percent of it was inadequate; let's save 100. I am very proud that I came up with the ``lockbox'' idea of locking away the Social Security trust funds. 
   This is the new dynamic I believe over the long run will keep America prosperous because it will continue to pay down the national debt way beyond what anybody ever thought we could. As a matter of fact, if we stay on that path, sometime into the second decade of this century we will totally get rid of the national debt. Most of that is because of the lockbox. Most of that is because of the new dynamic that says don't spend Social Security trust funds. 
   We are very proud of that. We are glad it is hugely bipartisan now. We take great credit in getting that started and challenging the President, who, for the first time this year, submitted a budget that does not use any of the Social Security money for general government and, I say to my friend, Senator GRASSLEY, the first budget of the President that recognizes the principle that we 
   will not touch Social Security surpluses and locks it up. We still need a vote on a lockbox because that requires 60 votes to breach that line to not use any of the money from Social Security for Government. 
   When you add all of this up, I believe it is easy to say to Americans that we want to spend more. We want to give you more. The Government should be spending more than the Republicans have in this budget resolution. But I believe we are on the right track. 
   I think when we put every penny of Social Security money into the trust fund, and then add about $7 billion or $8 billion out of the non-Social Security surplus, we are being cautious. We are saying we are not going to spend that non-Social Security surplus. We are going to also put it into the debt. 
   In closing, the next President has a big job--I hope it comes from our party--because I believe he will find a Government loaded with duplication, loaded with programs that are 30 years old and are not the programs of today, and he will have to find a way to put many of those into a place they should have been for a while; that is, totally removed from the budget of the United States. We will have some real priorities that we have been discussing in our budget resolution talking about where the American people would like to spend more money. It is not on the myriad thousands of Federal programs, many of which should not be around. 
   With that, if anybody would like to speak, I will yield to them. 
   Again, at 12:30 we are going to our caucuses. We will be ready for amendments at 2:15. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from Iowa needs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRASSLEY, not only for his kind remarks but for his observations, which are totally accurate. I think that was a very good summary of where we are, where we have been, and what we are trying to do in this budget resolution for the farmers in this country.  
   I think the Senator knows. He was here, giving this few moments of reflection, anticipating somebody will always want more, and we will be confronted with that, even on this budget resolution. I thank the Senator for his statement. I will be using it later on, within the next 2 or 3 days. 
   Senator SPECTER wants to speak. I will yield to him as much time as he would like from our side, if I might first make two observations. 
   First, I wish to summarize the tax situation to which I alluded, in terms of taxes on America imposed by government. The total tax burden today--that is, State and local and Federal--has never been higher. Second, the Federal tax burden has never been higher, except at the end of World War II. Those who talk about rates and who pays and talk about the article that was in the Washington Post a few days ago, ignore some things about middle-income Americans I will address later. But actually the total amount of money the Federal Government takes, as a portion of the productivity of America, has never been higher since the Second World War as a percent of the gross domestic product. 
   Third, the U.S. is in a period of budget surpluses, which are projected to grow, for certain over the next decade and maybe for decades beyond that. So, in a sense, we are beginning to define the surplus. We Republicans say that except for that which is Social Security, some portion of the surplus should go back to the taxpayer because it represents overpayment. When you have an overpayment, you do not immediately run to spend the money; you want to do something to recognize it is more than you need. In this case, we want to give some back. The President has a difficult time even recognizing that in his budget. He cannot find a way, in a bona fide manner, to support a tax cut for the American people. He talks about cuts but he raises taxes more than he cuts. He cannot seem to come to the conclusion that a little piece of that surplus should go back to the American people. 
   I yield the floor. I yield to Senator SPECTER as much time as he desires.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if I may speak for 2 minutes, I don't have any big charts to show you, but I want to put this up. It may be the best way to explain our budget. It is very simple. 
   The non-Social Security surplus total for the years 2001 through 2005 is $400 billion. That is the amount of surplus that will be available during the next 5 years, locking up Social Security in a lockbox. Don't use it. That is $400 billion. 
   That $400 billion, as we see it, will be spent using $230 billion for new spending, $150 billion for tax reductions and tax relief and debt reduction, with an additional $20 billion to go along with the Social Security money. That is going toward the debt.  
   Frankly, the other side will not have a chart such as this because they will assume we have to spend $230 billion to increase every function of Government, by inflation, for each of the next 5 years, and that it is automatic. They don't call that ``spending,'' they call it ``automatic.'' Everybody is entitled to that. 
   We start with a real zero. We start with no growth and say how much we put back. We put back $230 billion. If my arithmetic is right, that is about $46 billion a year of new money appropriated. 
   In addition to what we are already spending to start with, we are already spending this amount. There is $46 billion more a year for each year. That comes out of this surplus. 
   We have tax relief of $150 billion, which is only $13 billion in the first year, and then we have an extra $20 billion going on the debt. 
   I think that is a pretty fair approach. In fact, Democrats keep saying they are doing what the American people want. I think if the American people understand ours--and they will--they will say that is plenty of new spending; some of this overpayment we ought to get back. That is what we provide. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I need. 
   I was here for most of Senator BYRD's remarks. I do not choose to discuss the history of 10, 12, or 14 years ago. That does not mean there is not a different version to his well charted speech. There is another version. 
   All I want to talk about is right now and what we plan and how we see things a little differently in terms of what we are going to do with the surplus that does not belong to Social Security. 
   Remember that we already have established a new dynamic, and it is probably a very salutary one and maybe, as the Federal Reserve Chairman has said, the most significant fiscal policy change if we follow through for a decade or so. That is, if all of the Social Security surplus goes to debt service, that means we do not spend it and the debt owed to the public that we have out there in Treasury bills that banks have bought, that countries have bought, that we really have to pay interest on every year, all this money from Social Security reduces that. 
   I believe when the President suggested we only save 62 percent of the Social Security surplus, that was the first time we ever invented and used the budget for longer than 5 years. He wanted to do 10 years then. Almost everyone thought: How in the world will we do 15 years, and why? I can tell my colleagues why. 
   One starts with a proposition that if we only put 62 percent of the Social Security money into a fund that belongs to Social Security, we have to tell the American people that sooner or later we are going to pay all the Social Security money back. It took 15 years to do that. It just happened almost miraculously. So the President drew up a 15-year budget. After the fifth year, it was pretty irrelevant. In the 7th, 10th, 14th, and 15th years, it got to be speculative. Nevertheless, it kept showing a very big and increasing surplus. 
   I got the idea, as all of us heard the 62-percent speech, why not 100 percent? I am very proud that as to the new dynamic to which I was just alluding, that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve says is positive thinking and a positive approach to the future, I said  why not 100 percent of the Social Security fund? Then we thought up the idea of a Social Security lockbox. Whether one likes the lockbox or not, it is pretty descriptive. We make it darn hard to get the money out of the lockbox. We put it in there every year. 
   This budget does that again. For the next 5 years, it says every penny of Social Security surplus goes to the debt; it cannot be used for anything of a general government nature. That turns out to be a very large number. I will give you the number in just a moment. 
   Believe it or not, for the next 5 years, in addition to that big number, the surplus that goes to Social Security, there is another big number, and it is a surplus that does not belong in Social Security. I share with the Senate and with my friend, Senator BYRD, how big the on-budget surplus is, that which does not belong to Social Security. It is $400 billion over the next 5 years--$400 billion. 
   The point is, we are deciding what ought to happen to that $400 billion. The Democrats would say there really isn't $400 billion--I am not saying where Senator BYRD would be, but I think his speech indicates this is a fair statement. They 
   would say there isn't $400 billion because, each of the years, all of the accounts of Government must grow by inflation. They say anything above that--that is, $171 billion--is all that would be left over out of the $400 billion if you give every account in Government an inflation increase every year. 
   We said that is not quite what we think the American people want to measure us by. So we said: Let's start at zero. Let's not have any additions, and then let's go to the $400 billion and put it back in the budget and put it back in other places. What we did, I say to my good friend, Senator BYRD, is we put $230 billion of that $400 billion back into the domestic and defense accounts. 
   That may not be enough for some, and who knows, the prediction that before we are finished it will not be enough, I do not know about that. But to get the votes to bring a budget to the floor, there is essentially $230 billion in new money on top of inflation divided by 5, which is $46 billion a year--if one does it on an average--$46 billion that we can add to the freeze and see where it turns out. 
   We think it turns out with almost a 6-percent growth in defense spending this first year and almost 4-percent real growth in the appropriated accounts--I should say growth in each instance. We do that, and there is some money left over. 
   Frankly, we believe that money ought to be looked at very carefully because it is the American people who are overpaying their taxes. That is why we have a surplus. We decided that over the whole 5 years we would provide a tax reduction of $150 billion, spread out over 5 years. In the first year, it is $13 billion. 
   Do my colleagues know how much the debt reduction is in the first year? 
   It is $174 billion. What is the ratio? It is $13 billion in debt reduction for $1 of tax relief. 
   Would the American people say: That's unfair? We ought to spend more of that money? We said: Over the full 5 years, the debt of the American people will be reduced by $1.1 trillion--a huge reduction. We put that alongside of $150 billion in tax relief; and the ratio, over the 5 years, is $8 in debt reduction for $1 in tax relief--a pretty fair ratio. 
   The whole difference is, when you have $400 billion in surplus, what should you do with it? Some would say: Inflate every account of Government by the rate of inflation for each of the next 5 years, and don't even worry about that. They say: You make that automatic. 
   We do not make it automatic. We add back each year. As I indicated, if you did it, on average, you could almost add $50 billion a year to a base of about $500 billion. That is the combined defense and nondefense. That is pretty good. 
   Will it be tough? Of course, it will be tough because in the last 5 years, the tendency was to significantly reduce expenditures in the first 3 years of that 5 years, and then in the last 2 years to start spending it, maybe a 7-percent or 8-percent or 6.5-percent-per-year increase. 
   I close by saying there is a stark difference between the President of the United States and the Republicans. Believe it or not, the President of the United States would increase domestic discretionary spending in the first year--the year for which we are doing the budget, next year--by 14 percent. 
   The 14 percent includes inflation, plus a whole bunch more. In fact, that is the biggest increase since one of the years of President Jimmy Carter when there was super inflation. 
   We say that is too much. In fact, they say there is something bad about $150 billion in tax cuts. But I say, if there is anything that is risky, it is to spend the surplus. A 14-percent-a-year increase, if kept for 3 years, will spend the entire non-Social Security surplus, and we will start using up some of the Social Security surplus. Just think of that. 
   Why does the President offer $14 billion in 1 year? In fact, I do not even think his loyal minority on the Democrat side has anything like a 14-percent increase in mind. He does because it is an election year, and you get to do it one time on your way out the door; the next administration has to live with what you have left. 
   But we decided not to do that. We decided we would do it the way we just described: $230 billion in spending over a freeze for the next 5 years, $150 billion in tax relief, and an extra $20 billion in debt reduction besides the Social Security money. 
   Frankly, why would the President offer such a huge increase in the last year of his Presidency? I would think one of two things is possible: It is a political budget. He would like to make hay out of bean for almost everything or, secondly, he really thinks that is what we ought to spend. 
   I do not know that there is any other reason in between. If he thinks it is what we ought to spend, then he ought to stop saying we will not spend Social Security money because you cannot increase the budget 14 percent a year and not use Social Security money. 
   What I know is, we have sound fiscal policy today for which a lot of people can take credit. There are a lot of things which happened that caused it to be this way. But it surely is 
   not solely and significantly because the President offered a proposal that all of his party voted for, and we did not, to raise taxes $195 billion. That happened. Clearly, that cannot be the singular item that caused this 7 years of growth. 
   In fact, we are very proud that once the Congress became Republican we started really reducing the amount of Federal expenditures per year, year after year. We made a bipartisan deal in 1997 of which we are very proud. It reduced all parts of Government significantly, including some entitlements that we are going back and looking at, such as Medicaid, Medicare, and home health care. 
   So that, plus the Federal Reserve Board acting prudently--I do not know whether the last increases in the interest rate are as prudent as the previous ones by the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, but he and his Board deserve ample credit for this fantastic growth. But ultimately the growth is because we turned loose American innovation. They changed things. They brought equipment and technology into the marketplace that saves human effort by the thousands of hours per week per business. Thus, more profit is made and more pay can be made. The gross domestic product can grow without inflation. That is where we are today. 
   We think our budget will keep us there. We think it is too risky to spend more money, especially when we have provided more than adequately, with some discretion to pick and choose between accounts of Government. 
   The approach of allowing inflation to be added to every account, and that unless you start with that you are cutting something, is an acknowledgement that every one of the 2,800 programs of America--some 30 years old, some 40 years old, some in the Education Department that the Presiding Officer has seen as duplicative, where there are 20 or 30 of the same kind--deserve an increase equally and none deserve to be restrained. 
   We say many of them should be abolished. If that is what it takes the appropriators to do to live within these numbers, that would be pretty good for America. 
   Those are my observations. I do not know that we are going to be able to  reach an agreement on amendments. But I am going to now ask the distinguished minority leader what he would like to do next, and we will proceed.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am just without words about such an argument that we did something really wrong. We did nothing wrong. The staff of the minority had an invention in their mind. They kept it quiet. 
   Have you ever hunted quail? You know that they spread after you shoot. They hunker down and hide and don't want anybody to hear them. 
   They had in mind knocking this whole budget resolution out because of this issue right here. If we had not made the technical change that is in this resolution, indeed, they would have made the whole thing die and we wouldn't have a budget resolution. 
   Let me tell you, their budget resolution would fail on the same grounds. The President's would fail on the same grounds. And the truth of the matter is that I sought and received, with a quorum present before the final vote, unanimous consent to make technical amendments. I asked for that. I received consent. And the technical changes are very clear. The language of the chairman's mark made it clear that the caps would be met. That is $540 billion, and an adjustment would be made of nearly $60 billion. We don't cut anything. We say the first appropriations bill will lift the caps, and a $60 billion fund that is in title 14 will become operative. 
   That is not untoward. It is not making shambles of the budget process. If people want to know what makes a shambles with it, I can stay here for a month and talk about it. But this isn't one. 
   As a matter of fact, this Senator has been a very loyal supporter of getting things done right. I am absolutely amazed 
   that he would read such language from a piece of paper--that this particular technical change has wreaked havoc. 
   I would like to meet with both sides to talk about how to fix the budget resolution. Let me tell you, we will meet with both sides. He can be present, and I will be present. We will have a list of 50 items before we ever get around to technical changes that are harming the budget process. 
   It is absolutely clear to everyone what we are doing. If we were trying to deceive anyone and were really in some way cutting $60 billion out of this budget, and in some clandestine way we were going to do it, then I would be here saying I did something that is untoward. I didn't do that. That is not the case. 
   There is no objection to this budget resolution based upon what I did and the unanimous consent that was granted. There is no question about it, in my opinion. I wouldn't have done it if there were any question. 
   Soon I would like to suggest we get on to a couple of amendments. But I don't have them ready yet. So I will sit down and let the minority speak.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes just to answer the distinguished Senator who just spoke with reference to Medicare and the budget resolution. 
   To Senator REED, I would like to suggest that things are a little bit different in the budget resolution regarding Medicare and prescription drugs, to which he has alluded. First of all, in  the budget resolution there is $40 billion of new money for Medicare. It is put in a reserve fund and it is said it can be spent for two purposes: $20 billion for prescription drugs and $20 billion for reform. So, in a sense, we have done what he says he would like, and that is for there to be prescription drug money separate and distinct from reform money. That is the Snowe amendment, cosponsored by Senator WYDEN--actually, the suggested modifications made by SMITH of Oregon, that passed the committee without a dissenting vote. 
   I believe we have all the Medicare prescription drug language necessary for the Congress to get started. Frankly, I think it is a very good start and we are headed in the right direction. 
   I am going to propose a unanimous consent request. I believe it has been cleared. 
   I inquire of Senator REID, the minority whip, if the Senator from Texas can send her amendment to the desk, after which time we will propound the unanimous consent request which centers on that.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank all the Senators for not taking any more time. There is more time tomorrow. There are events planned by the leadership for tonight. Senators, if they wanted to listen to us, could go on to their events and still have heard what we have to say. I wish to make one observation and then I will agree to the rest. It will just take me 1 minute. 
   I, first, want to remind the Senate and anybody listening, in the Senate Budget Committee, regarding the reserve fund of $40 billion for Medicare and prescription drugs, the cosponsor of that was a Democrat Senator named WYDEN who was praised in our committee by Senators LAUTENBERG and CONRAD as doing the right thing for Medicare. I think we have done the right thing. 
   Our budget says: Do prescription drugs first. That was because of the language offered by the distinguished occupant of the Chair, which said by September 1 we would have to have a package on the floor or we could offer it on the floor. And, incidentally, it then says taxes would be considered on the 22nd day of September, almost a month later. So our approach was Medicare first, tax cuts almost a month later--about 17 days later. I think that is the way it ought to be. 
   The Robb amendment is nongermane and is unnecessary, but we will make that case tomorrow before we vote. I am going to leave the floor. I thank everyone again for the discussion. I thank Senator ROBB for the way he has handled the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank the Senator for his good remarks. He is right on. I think he should add to his arsenal of words and discussions about the energy crisis the following: The United States of America has the greatest intelligence organization. We spend so much on intelligence and information gathering. We have an agency within the Department of Energy that is independent. We put a lot of money in it. They call themselves the ``analysts of energy.'' They are supposed to know everything you can know about crude oil. Tonight, as the cartel and its member countries concluded a meeting and said, this is what we are going to do, 
   the United States of America has no way of finding out whether they have or have not. We do not know how much they are producing, how much they are exporting. That may come as a shock to you, but I can guarantee you what I am telling you is right. We don't know. 
   Now isn't this something? We are now sending diplomats, such as my friend and former colleague from New Mexico, to go over and kind of beg these countries to consider our economy and worry about our future and that we are in this together, we are bosom buddies, and we bailed you out of a few wars; don't do us in so bad; put a little more oil on the market so the price will go down. We don't know, unless they choose to tell us, day by day how much they are putting in the market, how much is being exported to the world communities. We sort of know how much the world needs. Our chairman of the Energy Committee has reported over and over again what that number is. But if you ask the person from the energy agency of the United States, Do you know how much they put on the market months ago?--give us the month and tell us how much--they will tell you: We don't know. As a matter of fact, they will tell you they lost 500 million barrels somewhere. I don't mean that it sank underground in a big hole and depleted away; they just lost it in transit, didn't know what happened to it. 
   I submit that we ought to worry about all the things you are talking about, but we had better get our heads together and find out who we are going to assign the responsibility of finding out how much of this international oil is being put on the market. After all, we ought to know. We are paying the money for it. Our future is dependent upon it. If they cut down the spigot and we don't know for 6 or 7 months what they did, shame on us, don't you think? We have to know that.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before I conclude on this subject, after which time I want to make a short speech about TED STEVENS, my friend and everybody's friend here in the Senate, I want to talk about this administration for a minute. 
   Nobody will deny that President Bill Clinton is about as articulate and as smart a President as we have ever had. He can get on television and tell us things, and people believe him. When in fact we are doing things, it is good to have a President like that because people find out what we are doing. 
   As I look back on this administration now, I used to say there are two difficult things--because I am a budget man, a fiscal policy guy; that is what I have been doing around here. I used to say there are two major problems left for America. If we solve them, we have our fiscal policy house in order like we never thought we would. We are going to be on the path of surpluses, of low taxation, which is when America does well, when we are taxed at low levels. That is one of the most significant differences between our country and its business success and production of jobs and employment and those who compete with us. We tax business low, not high. We let business pay money to employees, not to welfare programs. This is pretty exciting stuff. 
   One of the two things we never fixed is Medicare, which is in no better shape today than when the President walked into the office. In fact, it is closer to bankruptcy. No major reform. No prescription drugs. I used to say that. Then I would say the other one that is major is Social Security--this gigantic program that has taken so many seniors out of poverty, and we all have to be proud of that. I used to say, if this President would leave us a permanent solution to that, he would leave a great legacy. But he has ignored the two big problems of the country. 
   Tonight, as Senator VOINOVICH was on the floor talking, I was reminded that there is a third problem America has that this President has not touched, which is America's dependence on crude oil from foreign countries to operate our cars and use in our daily lives, almost to the point that we could not survive without it. What has happened? Growing dependency. It used to be that I thought when we got to 50 percent, I would join Senator Bentsen, or someone, on the floor saying put a program out. The prediction is that we will be at 65-percent dependency in the next 10, 15 years. 
   It is not so important that we are 65-percent dependent, but when you are that dependent, if somebody decides to cut your supply by just a million or two out of the 65, the prices go up. That is what is happening right now. The world needs X amount, and they are producing about X minus 2.5 or 2.7 million barrels a day. Look at what happens to the prices. 
   So we became vulnerable during this administration, which kind of happily moved along saying: Isn't it neat? We have cheap oil, and it's feeding this magnificent economic growth, and, boy, aren't we on the gravy train? 
   Tonight, we are talking about the fact that that is not a gravy train. We are really in big trouble as the world's most powerful nation, and not a constructive thing has happened, unless one concludes it is constructive to have Secretary Richardson going to all these nations--some of them twice, some three times, I assume--urging that they can't hurt their friend America by continuing to underproduce oil. We have to produce more so the price will come down. That can't be an energy policy--to go out to those big countries and rely on your friendship to get some relief; that is not an energy policy. 
   How can we, as a great nation, say to our children and grandchildren: That is the legacy we are leaving you? Boy, we hope we have a great Secretary of State and a great Secretary of Energy in about 8 or 10 years, so they can meander around the world and know all these leaders and go there and have dinner with them and talk about being their great friends. What if it turns out that in a few years they are up to here with us? 
   Some are already saying it. We have been so inconsistent with Kuwait, our business friend, that they are asking publicly: What is it America wants of us? 
   They have been trying to be helpful. We saved them. Incidentally, while we saved them, they paid an awful price in terms of dollars to pay for that war. America didn't pay much for that war. Between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and others, they paid almost every penny for the cost of that war. It was the slickest thing you ever saw. I was sitting with the man who worked with the President and who set all of it out in a formula for how these countries would pay. They paid it. We were thrilled to have those countries go out and pay for that war. They paid for it. They went into hock and mortgage to pay for it. 
   They are wondering: What do you want of us, America? We are trying to do everything you are asking of us. But we don't know what to do. 
   That is pretty tough stuff to come from one little country. It is little. But for a small country, it has more barrels of oil under each square piece of its earth than any other similar piece of soil in the world. That is Kuwait. It is small but hugely laden with oil supplies. 
   I am delighted that the gas tax pumps Senator VOINOVICH up enough to come to the floor and not only talk about that gasoline tax which pays for our highways. No matter what it was for when it was passed, it is now in our highway trust fund. It is part of the formula that we used. 
   I will tell you, if you temporarily repeal it for 1 year, it will not hurt the allocations for the year 2001. Everybody will get what they currently plan on getting. But that means we have to eventually put the money back in. 
   We are running around talking about trying to pay for future military needs and trying to take care of some new Medicare needs, if we can get reform, and, frankly, we ought not to be cavalierly talking about these billions that we are going to have to take out of the general fund. 
   I want to say for the record so everybody will know when they hear about their gasoline tax that the rule of thumb is for every penny of tax for roads and the like, the U.S. Government gets $1 billion. That is a pretty rough calculus. If it is 4.3, it is about $4.3 billion. If it is 18 cents that is repealed temporarily, or otherwise, it is about $18 billion. That is per annum, per year. The rule of thumb still applies. It applied a few years ago. Nobody has changed it, to my knowledge right now. It might change as the price goes up. We may see some change. But I don't think so because these are not percentages. They are pennies per gallon.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks about a friend of mine. I will have been in the Senate at the end of this year for 28 years. When I arrived, a Senator was already here named TED STEVENS from the great State of Alaska. He was strong, articulate, and he was tough. He was moving up in the ranks. 
   There are approximately 6 billion people alive on this Earth right now, and only 619,000 of them are living in Alaska. After a long process, it was decided that Senator STEVENS should be the ``Man of the Century'' for Alaska. 
   We have all attended banquets and events for the ``Man of the Year'' or the ``Woman of the Year.'' But Alaska did it up right. They found one of their own, and said: If you look at the century--for part of which they certainly were not in the United States--who is the man of that century? And it was  our own TED STEVENS, currently the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   It is phenomenal how people more times than not find reality. They find out what gold is, what is really important, and what is big, strong, and sturdy. It is clear that when it comes to stature, he might not be a tall or big man, but he matches Alaska's mountains; no doubt about it. He is a mountain of a man. I am very grateful to be able to call him my friend. 
   Other Senators have already put in the RECORD all of the things he has done around here in his years as Senator and how many times he has had to run. A few times he was Senator for only a couple of years, and then he had to run again. He has run more times than the number of years of service would directly yield for a 6-year term, as the occupant of the chair and I serve. 
   When you add it all up, Alaska has done it right. They have concluded that when you look back on the people of Alaska, even long before there was statehood, they are really saying there has not been a man like him. Alaska hasn't had a man like TED STEVENS. He is unique. 
   I want to say on the floor tonight that I am a few days late. I had left town when I found out about this last week. I am glad to have the opportunity tonight. 
   I want to say I am thrilled to have him as my friend. He has a tough job. So do I. I do the budget, and he helps me. He does appropriations, which has to be done every single year with the claims all the Senators put upon him, and with all of the claims others place in behalf of the people of this country for new programs and new expenditures. He has an awful lot of that on his shoulders. 
   I say to him that we are lucky we have him here. We are thrilled that he came from Alaska. If I were an Alaskan, I would have joined them in voting for him as the ``Man of the Century.''

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, after months of negotiation, we have reached an agreement and completed work on the Aviation Investment and  Reform Act of the 21st Century, the so-called AIR-21. 
   AIR-21 is a fair bill. It reflects a compromise on many of my concerns about the budgetary treatment of our federal aviation accounts. It also reflects some of my commitments, one of which is to increase investment in aviation programs. I am a strong proponent of safety, and this bill increases funding for safety programs, including funds for air traffic control modernization. In addition, and very important to the State of New Mexico, many of the programs within this bill focus on and support small or rural airports. Finally, each of these accomplishments are realized while budgetary discipline is maintained. 
   In 2001, a total of $12.7 billion is authorized for aviation programs. This represents an increase in budget resources of $2.7 billion over the 2000 levels. This is extremely generous to the FAA. In fact, it exceeds the President's 2001 budget request by $1.5 billion. Over the 2001 through 2003 time period, AIR-21 authorizes nearly $40 billion. 
   Before I outline the budgetary compromise, I would like to thank all the Conferees--I especially appreciate the work and support of Senators STEVENS, GORTON, GRASSLEY, BURNS, LOTT, and LAUTENBERG on the budget issue. In addition, I applaud the leadership that Senators GORTON, LOTT, and MCCAIN took on this bill. 
   One very controversial issue had to do with the correct budgetary treatment for aviation programs. The provision contained in AIR-21 represents a compromise--both sides had to come together for this deal. 
   Similar to my offer last fall, AIR-21 guarantees annual funding from the Airports and Airways Trust Fund equal to the annual receipts deposited into the Trust Fund plus annual interest credited to the Trust Fund, as estimated in the President's budget. 
   Based on the President's FY 2001 Budget, $10.5 billion will be appropriated from the Trust Fund in 2001 for aviation programs. In addition, just over $2 billion can be provided from the general fund. For 2001 through 2003, over $33 billion will be guaranteed from the trust fund for aviation programs, and more than $6 billion can be provided from the general fund. 
   Further, the budget compromise provides that the Trust Funds will first be available to fund the capital accounts--for airport improvement program grants and facilities and equipment, including the air traffic control modernization programs. 
   Before I finish, let me take one minute to discuss what this bill doesn't do. AIR-21 does not take the Airports and Airways Trust Fund off-budget. AIR-21 does not establish a budgetary firewall between aviation programs and other discretionary programs. Further, it does not lock-down general fund tax receipts for aviation programs. Finally, it does not put FAA funding on auto-pilot and take the appropriators out of the process. 
   In this way, budgetary discipline has prevailed and appropriate congressional oversight is maintained. This is good policy for the American people and the flying public. 
   Finally, this bill contains essentially, for the next three years, a Federal mechanism not entirely unlike what has existed since the Airports and Airways Trust Fund was established in 1972. As we move into this new century, it may be that this funding mechanism and the current government structure is not the most efficient or effective way to provide the investments and services for this industry in the future. 
   For example, at least 16 countries have taken action to respond to the pressures that increasing enplanements have had on a system already stressed by capacity constraints and increases in and longer delays. These countries realized something that was made clear in a joint Budget and Appropriations Committee hearing on February 3--that increased funding levels will not solve the problems of our outdated air traffic control system and will not make the system efficient. 
   Recognizing this, these countries have fundamentally reformed and restructured their air traffic control systems. Most recently Canada created a very successful nonprofit, private air traffic control corporation sustained by user fees. Reformed air traffic control systems have been successful. They have brought about major gains in efficiency, reduced flight delays, reductions in operating costs, and progress in technological upgrades. All of this was accomplished without compromising safety. 
   Although this bill provides funding for FAA for three years, it is my hope that we will continue to seriously evaluate and consider whether services can more effectively and efficiently be delivered with a change in structure--so that the gains realized in Canada, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, and New Zealand can be achieved in the United States.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements of Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through March 6, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 68). The budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted to the Senate to reflect funding for emergency requirements, disability reviews, adoption assistance, the earned income tax credit initiative, and arrearages for international organizations, peacekeeping, and multilateral banks. 
   The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $10.3 billion in budget authority and below the budget resolution by $2.3 billion in outlays. Current level is $17.8 billion above the revenue floor in 2000. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $20.6 billion, which is $5.7 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 2000 of $26.3 billion. 
   Since my last report, dated February 1, 2000, the Congress has cleared for the President's signature the Omnibus Parks Technical Corrections Act of 1999 (H.R. 149). This action has changed the current level of budget authority and outlays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to announce that I intend to vote to confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. Judge Paez has waited four years for this vote, and I believe that the time has come for the Senate to perform its constitutional duty to advise and consent on this nomination. 
   I have reviewed Judge Paez's record, including some of the issues which have proven controversial over the last four years, and am satisfied that he has adequately responded to the concerns raised by some in this body about his fitness to serve on the Ninth Circuit. 
   Particularly, Judge Paez has expressed his regret about commenting publicly about two California ballot initiatives while he served on the federal bench. Affirmative action and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants are two issues which inspire passion in many people on both sides of the political aisle. While I understand, but do not necessarily agree with Judge Paez's comments and concerns about these two initiatives, I think he also knows that he made a mistake. That mistake should not prevent his elevation to the appellate court. 
   I also have reviewed several of Judge Paez's more controversial opinions. While I cannot say that I agree with some of his legal conclusions, I do believe that he has a well-deserved, bi-partisan reputation for fairness, and for being a thoughtful, scholarly jurist. His fifteen years as a municipal and federal district court judge will serve him well on the Ninth Circuit. 
   Mr. President, Judge Paez has earned bi-partisan support from a variety of sources. Not only is he universally supported by the Hispanic community, but he also has received the endorsement of law enforcement officials, district attorneys and the business trial bar in California. I believe we have taken enough time to study Judge Paez's record on and off the bench. Despite the fact that Judge Paez and I come from opposite ideological positions, I am ready to join a majority of this body, Democrats and Republicans, in support of his confirmation. Thank you and I yield the floor.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Larry Ahrens, a man who has become an institution in Albuquerque. This week he celebrates his 20th anniversary as morning host on 770 KOB, one of the best-known radio stations in New Mexico. Larry's radio career has spanned much of my own Senate career, and we have developed a wonderful friendship and working relationship over the past two decades. 
   There is something comforting about turning on the radio and hearing the same recognizable voice welcoming the day. For thousands of New Mexicans, Larry has become that reassuring deliverer of news, commentary and other interesting and entertaining information. It hardly seems like 20 years have lapsed since Larry first addressed KOB listeners and endeared himself to us with his level-headed take on life in Albuquerque and the Land of Enchantment. 
   Larry Ahrens took over New Mexico's most high-profile radio job as  morning host on 770 KOB on March 3, 1980. But he began his career in his native southern California. 
   A job offer in Roswell brought Larry to the New Mexico airwaves in late 1972. Apparently his talent was clear even then, as an El Paso station owner traveling through Roswell heard Larry on the air and ended up offering him a job. Ahrens spent two and a half years in El Paso before coming back to New Mexico to begin his long run as host of KOB's morning show. 
   Over the years, I've observed that a lot of radio personalities come and go. Larry has been a steady and reliable fixture on KOB, which I attribute to the fact that his show mirrors the community. He has served New Mexico with integrity, opening his mike to air the views of the day--whether they come from young mothers on Albuquerque's West Side, retirees in the Heights, or even the occasional politician. 
   Part of Larry's appeal is linked to the fact that his job is more than sharing with New Mexicans between 5:30 and 10:00 a.m. Like so many others, I appreciate Larry as an active member of the community and a key supporter of important civic causes. One example is Larry's annual golf tournament for the University of New Mexico's academic scholarship program, now in its 18th year. He has raised more than $600,000 to give scores of New Mexico students an opportunity to continue their education. 
   Larry and the morning show he hosts play a welcome role in the day-to-day lives of many New Mexicans. Where once I could only enjoy Larry's broadcasts when in New Mexico, I am pleased that technology is now so advanced that I can listen to his show live on the Internet. It's almost like being home. 
   Times may have changed since Larry first took to the airwaves, but his presence has remained constant for 20 years. Today, I think it would be fair to say Larry reigns as the premiere morning show host in Albuquerque. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate Larry Ahrens on this career milestone, and salute his contributions to New Mexico throughout his impressive career. Finally, I add my voice to those thousands and thousands of New Mexicans who look forward to tuning into the radio to hear Larry's show for years to come.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased today that the Senate has confirmed New Mexican Sylvia Baca for Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals Management. I have been working hard to see this day, and I am glad the Senate has finally confirmed this worthy individual. 
   Ms. Baca is a native New Mexican who has worked for the Department of Interior for over four years, and has been Acting Assistant Secretary since November of 1998. Since January of 1995, she served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management. 
   Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management has direct supervisory responsibility for three principal bureaus of the Department of the Interior: The Bureau of Land Management, the Minerals Management Service, and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. In 1997, she served as Acting Director for the Bureau of Land Management. in such capacity, she was responsible for direct management of 10,000 employees, a budget of $1.2 billion, and the maintenance of 270 million acres of public lands and 570 million acres of subsurface minerals. 
   Ms. Baca previously served the state of New Mexico with distinction as a Senior Fiscal Analyst for the state Legislative Finance Committee for five years. Ms. Baca served as Director of Finance and Management for the City of Albuquerque immediately before leaving for Washington, D.C. Some of you may know that I served as what was then the equivalent of Mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city. I can assert that administering the operating budget and administering city employees is a big job. 
   Sylvia Baca has a tremendous tie to the land. Sylvia, whose New Mexico ranching family history dates back to Spanish colonial times, is one of the many distinguished New Mexicans who have served the Interior Department. I am sure she will continue to work with distinction and serve well managing our federal public lands. Based upon her experience and commitment, I trust she will do a good job for the people of the United States. She has demonstrated that she has the administrative skills and experience needed to do this job well.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to spend a little time talking about what has transpired with the U.S. budget over the last 35 years, and I will focus mostly on the last 5 years. 
   I think everyone knows that next month we begin the process of producing a congressional budget plan for the fiscal year that begins this coming October. The Senate Budget Committee, which I have been honored to chair, will complete its hearings next week on the President's budget which was submitted to Congress earlier this month. Before we begin the task of producing that budget blueprint, I thought it might be of interest to some of my colleagues and some of those who might be watching to briefly review some facts surrounding the Federal budget. 
   One can provide different interpretations of numbers, but a number is a very stubborn thing. It is what it is. Using the help of some charts, I will provide a very brief historical overview of the Federal budget today. 
   Chart No. 1 is the total budget surplus and deficit over the last 30 years. After nearly 30 years of Federal deficit spending--and my colleagues can see the surplus/deficit excluding Social Security is in green and the total budget surplus is in red. The green, as one can see, starting back in 1965 and going all the way to 1998, is constantly below the line, meaning we have been in deficit for that whole period of time. 
   We finally reported a balanced budget, under the unified budget process in 1998, of nearly $70 billion. Last year, in 1999, we once again successfully achieved a unified budget surplus of $125 billion. But more importantly--noting the green line on this chart--we will be able to balance the budget not counting the Social Security surplus. The red line is the total budget surplus and the green is Social Security balances. 
   Here is the way the budget goes. We now have a surplus above zero in both the Social Security and in the non-Social Security accounts of our Government. Last year, we actually achieved a surplus--not very much--of $1 billion, and certainly that is substantially better than when we were approaching $300 billion in deficits. 
   For the current fiscal year, we expect a surplus of $176 billion, and, of that, nearly $23 billion excludes the Social Security moneys, meaning we have some money left over in surplus after we put all the money in the Social Security trust fund that is required by law. 
   Projections for the near future remain positive. Of course, depending on what policies we enact relating to taxes or spending, the Social Security surpluses will continue to accumulate over the next decade, and the rest of Government also is expected and projected to see surpluses as far as the eye can see. 
   By the year 2005, the Congressional Budget Office expects the surplus to be between $270 billion and $300 billion. One thing that this job has taught me is to be very careful in statements about the long term. I could spend some time suggesting that these long-term surpluses are very reliable and credible, but I will do that at another time. Today, instead of statements about the long term, what I want to do is talk about--rather than pontificating about the future and what we might expect--about what has passed, just so there will be an understanding of whether or not Congress and the Senate and the Budget Committee and the appropriators and everybody in this body ought to be proud of what we have accomplished in terms of controlling the spending of our National Government. 
   So here is chart No. 2. It has a lot of things on it. I just put it up because it shows, in five intervals over the last 30 years, the major components of the budget. We can clearly see that total Federal spending has increased, to where this year the Federal Government is likely to spend $1.8 trillion. 
   In terms of the totality of the budget--in all of its components: Military, entitlements, the 13 appropriations bills--it has been going up every year. Now we are at about $1.8 trillion. That is an interesting number because if there is a $4 trillion surplus--just to compare--that means we will have more than 2 full years of the Federal budget in surplus during the next decade. That is a rather profound and major change in things over the past 35 years. 
   The country has grown over the last 30 years, and it has grown faster than Government spending. So while we reached a peak of nearly 23 percent of our gross domestic product in 1985, today it has declined almost 5 full percent; that is, we are now at 18.5 percent of our gross domestic product in the total spending of the American Government, including interest on the debt, entitlements, Social Security, and 13 appropriations bills--and, obviously, one of those is the defense bill. 
   This bar chart points out a phenomenon of which I think we are all aware. Let's just look at it for 1 minute. Entitlement spending today represents 55 percent of all Federal spending. If we add paying the interest on our national debt as another entitlement--and it might be that, so let's add it in--then 77 percent of what we spend every year is either mandatory spending or an entitlement. 
   I did not go back in history to equate the percentages under other Presidents, but suffice it to say, not too long ago, in the era of, let's say, President Kennedy's tenure, clearly, about 40 percent of the entire Federal budget was entitlements; and now we are up to 77 percent. 
   Let's look at the third chart: Growth in Total Outlays. This is very important. For those who wonder about how poorly we do or how well we do when we finally finish all our work--it might not look pretty; it may take too long; there may be a lot of scuffling on the appropriations bills--I would like very much to make sure we all take a good, careful look at this chart and see what we have really been doing that has contributed to the great fiscal policy of this country and to our position today of low interest rates and sustained economic growth. 
   This is a very dramatic chart. It is very simple but very dramatic. The blue on the chart is what is called nominal growth, and the red is real growth. The nominal growth includes inflation, plus the growth beyond inflation. It is very interesting what we  have done. Because we think it makes the most sense, we have gone back to 1965 and done this on 5-year intervals. So we have taken 5-year intervals and then taken the average for that 5-year interval. 
   It is rather dramatic to see what is shown on the chart, without any explanation--the dramatic reduction in the percentage of growth in actual total outlays year after year. It was not long ago we were talking about deficits as far as the eye could see. Now, as this chart shows, as the reality of the years 1995 through 2000 has become true, we are beginning to see rather large surpluses. 
   I might add, by way of taxes--with which I do not think we did much in these charts--even though taxes, for certain 
   Americans, may be lower than 15 or 20 years ago, but the percent of our gross domestic product that goes to taxes is the highest since the end of the Second World War. So it is obvious, if your taxes are the highest and your growth in Government is the lowest, you begin to develop a rather good surplus. It is kind of easy to see that much of that surplus is because we are taxing the American people at a higher percent of our total production than we ever have since the Second World War when we had all kinds of taxes. 
   Let's just look at this chart and take a couple of years. Growing at an annual rate of nearly 12.2 percent in the late 1970s, the total Government spending right now that we can tell you already occurred--as I said in my opening remarks, we are not predicting. Numbers that are behind us are hard to throw away. 
   For the years 1995 to 2000, the total amount of growth in our Government, including appropriated accounts, is 3.1 percent; and of that, the real growth--that is, noninflationary growth--is 1.3 percent. 
   Just compare that quickly with other periods of time shown on the chart. Pick any interval you like. From 1980 to 1985, the nominal growth was 9.9 percent, the real growth was 3.6 percent--almost three times as much in real growth as it was from 1995 to the year 2000. 
   If today I sound as if I am trying to convince somebody of something, I address this to a number of Senators because there are some who say we are overspending everywhere and some who say the appropriated accounts are out of control. My friend, if they are out of control when they are part of a Government growth that is 1.3 percent in real growth, what were they when it was 5.8 percent? It was unexplainable. There is no word for it. 
   If we are out of control now--and for those who are interested, the years 1990 to 1995 were not too shabby either. In fact, from 1990 to 1995, it was 1 percent real growth and 3.9 percent for a combination of real growth and inflation. That is just slightly higher in its totality than the period from 1995 to 2000. 
   I remind Senators that for the period 1995 to 2000--the occupant of the Chair knows this; Senator HOLLINGS knows this--we had a lot of emergency money we put in. We had an agricultural emergency 3 years in a row. We had some military emergencies where we got into wars, and we had not funded them, so we put them in as emergencies. They can be whatever you want, but when the year is finished they are part of the total outlays. If, in fact, you allocated the money, and put it in an appropriations bill, it would eventually be spent, whether it was an emergency or whatever, and that is the reason we talk about total outlays. 
   The fourth chart only shows the red, which depicts real growth. For some people--not me at this point; I am not sure everything should increase by the rate of inflation every year--but some people think that should be the policy of our Government. 
   What we are looking at here in each of these years is: What was the real outlay growth, on average, over the 5-year intervals, meaning without inflation? It is pretty simple. If we took the 35-year average, and we drew a line--looking at the years 1965 to 1970, it was almost 6 percent--but the average for the 35 years is 3.1 percent. Looking at the last decade, 
   real growth for the years 1990 to 1995 was 1 percent; from 1995 to 2000, it was 1.3 percent. 
   Frankly, somebody did something right. If we are talking about restraining expenditures of Government so as to produce a fiscal policy that puts us in balance and ultimately creates a surplus--I know my dear friend, Senator HOLLINGS, is here and his and my definition of ``surplus'' may differ, but I think anybody who looked at this would say we are surely moving in a direction different from what we did for most of the last 35 years. 
   In terms of how much we are letting Government grow, the fifth chart shows major components of the entitlements and other mandatory programs. The 35-year average annual rate of growth of Government spending has been about 3.1 percent.

   Mr. DOMENICI. This chart shows the various entitlement spendings. It is over 55 percent of all Federal spending today. Three-quarters of it is just three programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
   Let's move on to the Growth in Entitlements and Mandatories. Many of us are of the impression that it is the entitlement programs that are out of control. I admit, looking at this chart, one would see where it wasn't too long ago when they were out of control. Let's take 1970-75. The growth was 18.5 percent nominal growth. In 1980-85, it was 9, and in 1985-90, it was 6.9. In 1990-95, it was 5.5. Here we are in 1995-2000, in entitlement programs, 4.5 percent nominal and, without inflation, the growth was 2.6 percent. If we can continue growth in this manner, which is principally predicated upon controlling the costs of health care, which the Government pays for partially or totally, we can keep our government under control and the costs can continue to come down. 
   National defense is something we ought to be concerned about because we have thrown some numbers around and some percentages. The facts are before us, and they don't look too good. The truth is, since the 1985-90 era, everything since that time has been no growth in defense rather than growth. If you are looking at the chart turned upside down, when it comes to the last decade, defense spending starts to come out on the negative side, meaning year after year the outlays for defense have gone down rather than up, and these are the numbers. We are doing a little better in the 5 years of 1995-2000 than we did in 1990-95, but it is clear that if, in fact, we think we have been really increasing defense in terms of outlays, as we finally get them accounted for, it is obvious we have a long way to go if we are going to say we have increased defense spending. I am not saying we must. I am merely giving some facts as they show up here. 
   In summary, the data suggests to me that we have been successful in controlling the rate of Federal spending. And while we must continue to be vigilant and very careful, in this time of projected budget surpluses, to avoid returning to an era of expansive Government spending, I do not think we should dismiss what these charts show. We have been successful in controlling Government spending, and we have been most successful in the last decade, very successful in the last 5 years. There are many institutions, entities, and people who can take some credit for what has happened to the American economy, but I believe it is fair to say that the Budget Committee of the Senate, not always under my chairmanship but under the chairmanship of others, has been part of a decade of tremendous pressure to reduce the expenditures of Government and thus create a surplus. 
   If the surplus is good--and, frankly, it looks as if the American people have understood loud and clear that the debt is not good. I would assume if the debt is not good, they must think surpluses are good. Indeed, we do. Much of the surplus is going to that accumulated debt. As a matter of fact, I close by saying, while the two parties and the President disagree on many things, it is good for America that we have agreed on one thing; that is, the Social Security surplus is going to the Social Security trust fund, not into the general coffers of Government to be spent. That alone will dramatically reduce the debt we owe to the public. 
   As a matter of fact, if we continue for the next decade to apply the Social Security surpluses, which I am rather confident will continue to occur, then  we will have in a decade reduced the debt of the American people by somewhere around 70 percent, which is not very shabby, if you talk about one decade, one group of people reducing the debt that much. 
   I thank the Senate for permitting me to speak. I will come to the floor at a later time and express why I am convinced the surpluses are for real and that, as a matter of fact, they are apt to be more rather than less over the next decade because of what is happening in the American economy. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by my colleagues JEFF BINGAMAN and MAX BAUCUS  in introducing legislation to preserve precious dollars allocated by the Congress and the President for construction of Indian reservation roads. 
   There is no doubt that the Indian reservation road system is the poorest in our nation, and every federal dollar allocated for improving this situation should be directed to our nation's Indian reservations. The lack of adequate roads and bridges is a chronic problem on Indian reservations, where unemployment averages 35 percent and more than half of American Indian live in hard poverty. 
   Since 1982, when my Senate amendment added Indian roads to our federal highway trust fund accounts, all funds allocated for Indian roads have been used for that purpose. In ISTEA, which preceeded the enactment of the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) program reached a level of $191 million per year. 
   Many of us in Congress worked hard to increase this IRR funding to $225 million in the first year of TEA-21 (FY 1998), and $275 million each year thereafter, through FY 2003. Unfortunately, a little noticed provision for Federal Lands Highways, placing an ``obligation limitation'' on the IRR program, has resulted in the transfer of funds intended for Indian reservations to be transferred to the 50 states. 
   In FY 1998, the amount deducted for this transfer to states from the IRR program was $24.2 million. In FY 1999, it was $31.7 million; and in FY 2000, the obligation limitation resulted in a loss of $34.9 million that could have been used for Indian reservation road building. 
   In all previous enacting legislation since 1982, federal funds intended for IRR programs have been used for IRR purposes. Only in TEA-21 was this changed due to the application of the obligation limitation to Federal Lands Highways and the IRR program. 
   Our bill will simply exclude the IRR program from this annual deduction that has totaled, in the past three years, more than $90 million. This money, while helpful to many states, is more badly needed on Indian reservations and should be preserved for that purpose. By excluding the IRR program from this obligation limitation provision, we will be increasing federal funds for Indian roads without increasing the cost of the total program. We will be focusing the funds for Indian roads on Indian roads, as we have intended since the IRR program first became part of our federal highway trust fund in 1982. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in redirecting funds intended for Indian road construction to be dedicated to that purpose.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the legislation before us. This legislation is only one of many important steps required to counter the greatest threat to U.S. security in this era--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   I am not being an alarmist. I am being a realist. The proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological technologies and the means to deliver them present a growing threat to U.S. security. This is a threat which we have only begun to address in the changed security environment of the 21st century. 
   Mr. President, I would like to mention three important aspects of the problem as stated by George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence early in February. 
   First, Russia and China no longer represent the only missile threat to the United States. The missile threat to U.S. interests and forces from other nations is here and now. 
   Second, South Asian nations are establishing doctrine and tactics for the use of their missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The nuclear rivalry between India and Pakistan steadily intensifies. The potential for miscalculation, misperception and escalation of the conflict in Kashmir is high. 
   Third, the countries we previously considered technology importers are now assuming roles as ``secondary suppliers.'' This compounds the proliferation problem and confounds our ability to control or defend against it. 
   As outlined in the most recent Intelligence Community assessment of Ballistic Missile Threats, by the year 2015 the U.S. will not only face the ongoing challenges of large-scale missile threats from China and Russia. U.S. cities will also confront a real threat from other actors--North Korea, probably Iran, and possibly Iraq. 
   One must mention that Intelligence Community's estimate excludes the possibility of social or political changes in those countries that would change the calculus. Also, the missile arsenals of these nations would be much smaller, limited to smaller payloads, and less reliable than Chinese or Russian capabilities. 
   At the same time, these remain a lethal and less predictable threat. Acute accuracy is not required for missiles tipped with nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads. And the U.S. cannot bank on rational actions from dictators like Saddam Hussein or Kim Chong-il. 
   At the same time that the threat increases, global changes make non-proliferation efforts even more difficult. Three specific aspects in the current international security environment will impede U.S. efforts to control or minimize this threat. 
   First, Russia--hard currency starved and heavily indebted--is a willing merchant--most notably of conventional defense items, but the U.S. Russian sales are not limited to this. This legislation attempts to address this aspect through creating incentives for the Russian government and others to implement and enforce stricter export controls on private actors or institutes in their dealings with Iran. 
   Second, North Korea and their No-Dong missile sales are altering strategic balances in the Middle East and Asia. While the administration's new strategy for engagement with North Korea may retard developments that require testing, such as reliability of long-range missiles, many suspect that the North Korean missile program continues and that its role as a supplier of medium-range missile technology has not been addressed. 
   Third, technology advances and rapid international economic integration alter and confuse the means by which the United States can control military advances of other nations. The list of potentially threatening dual-use technologies continues to grow. This is especially true of information technologies--command, control, communication, and information technologies, C-31, now comprise about 75 percent of a modern military's capability. But potential dual use is also true of nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile technologies. 
   The proliferation threat will remain our Nation's No. 1 security challenge in the 21st century. At the same time, the United States will be most vulnerable to this threat. As George Tenet, our head of the CIA, also noted, U.S. hegemony has become a lightning rod for the disaffected. 
   As Americans enjoy unprecedented prosperity, many in the world remain disaffected. These disaffected represent a group who resent our power and our prosperity. Our success fuels the intensity of their claims and their feelings.  The same forces aligned against our nonproliferation objectives apply to terrorist organizations as well, whether state sponsored or not. A disaffected Iran, despite some moderating trends, remains an active state supporter of terrorism. 
   Terrorist groups will continue to increase their destructive or their potential for disruption through rapidly evolving and spreading technologies. Again, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents offer cheap means to achieve highly lethal terror. Acquisition of information technology may not only greatly improve a terrorist group's means for organization and coordination and attack, these technologies offer increasing potential for massive, possibly crippling, disruption of U.S. information infrastructure. 
   This legislation is a small step, but a good one, in addressing the problem of supplying WMD technologies to Iran. But we have much more work to do. We must prevent, when prevention is possible, such as providing safeguards for nuclear materials in Russia and controlling access to technology and know-how as best we can and in as many cases as we can. 
   We must also find the most effective means to defend against such threats, such as training and equipping policemen and firemen to respond to these attacks and pursuing the best technological solutions to defend against them. 
   I believe the United States is not pursuing with sufficient vigor the means of greatest potential against missile threats. For example, directed energy technologies represent the next revolutionary step in military technologies. Laser technologies in particular dramatically alter U.S. potential to counter a missile attack. Missile defense at the speed of light will improve effectiveness and efficiency, substantially reducing the cost-per-kill ratios. 
   Despite this understanding, the budget of the President cut the airborne laser program $92 million. In addition, the defense budget reduced science and technology spending, 
   according to our first estimates, by more than $1 billion. It is not easy to understand. The administration proposes sacrificing the potential of real defense against proliferation threats, although it seems very clearly to be a shortsighted approach. 
   I have been working as hard as I can, and in some instances at the forefront, on some prevention efforts, especially with respect to proliferation threats from Russia. I hope this year for stepped up measures of prevention, especially regarding the threat of nuclear proliferation in the form of the brain drain from Russia. At the same time, where I can, I will put on a full court press to improve the science and technology budget for the Pentagon, especially as it pertains to the most promising means of missile defense and directed energy. 
   I hope my colleagues will join in ensuring that every means of proliferation prevention is pursued. I also invite my colleagues to join in increasing the means of our military laboratories to provide for our national defense. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday, I commented on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments. I thought then, and I think today, there are a few remarks that I probably ought to make aside from complimenting the distinguished Senator for his untiring efforts to address nuclear waste in a logical and sensible way. 
   Mr. President, I rise to compliment Senator MURKOWSKI's leadership on the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. I appreciate his efforts to enable progress on the nation's need for concrete action on spent nuclear fuel. 
   I find it amazing how fear of anything in this country with ``nuclear'' in its title, like ``nuclear waste'', seems to paralyze our ability to act decisively. Nuclear issues are immediately faced with immense political challenges. 
   There are many great examples of how nuclear technologies impact our daily lives. Yet few of our citizens know enough about the benefits we've gained from harnessing the nucleus to support actions focused on reducing the remaining risks. 
   Just one example that should be better understood and appreciated involves our nuclear navy. Their experience has important lessons for better understanding of these technologies. 
   The Nautilus, our first nuclear powered submarine, was launched in 1954. Since then, the Navy has launched over 200 nuclear powered ships, and about 85 are currently in operation. Recently, the Navy was operating slightly over 100 reactors, about the same number as those operating in civilian power stations across the country. 
   The Navy's safety record is exemplary. Our nuclear ships are welcomed into over 150 ports in over 50 countries. A 1999 review of their safety record was conducted by the General Accounting Office. That report stated: ``No significant accident--one resulting in fuel degradation--has ever occurred.'' For an Office like GAO, that identifies and publicizes problems with government programs, that's a pretty impressive statement. 
   Our nuclear powered ships have traveled over 117 million miles without serious incidents. Further, the Navy has commissioned 33 new reactors in the 1990s, that puts them ahead of civilian power by a score of 33 to zero. And Navy reactors have more than twice the operational hours of our civilian systems. 
   The nuclear navy story is a great American success story, one that is completely enabled by appropriate and careful use of nuclear power. It's contributed to the freedoms we so cherish. 
   Nuclear energy is another great American success story. It now supplies about 20 percent of our nation's electricity, it is not a supply that we can afford to lose. It's done it without release of greenhouse gases, with a superlative safety record over the last decade. The efficiency of nuclear plants has risen consistently and their operating costs are among the lowest of all energy sources. 
   I've repeatedly emphasized that the United States must maintain nuclear energy as a viable option for future energy requirements. And without some near-term waste solution, like interim storage or an early receipt facility, we are killing this option. We may be depriving future generations of a reliable power source that they may desperately need. 
   There is no excuse for the years that the issue of nuclear waste has been with us. Near-term credible solutions are not technically difficult. We absolutely must progress towards early receipt of spent fuel at a central location, at least faster than the 2010 estimates for opening Yucca Mountain that we now face or risk losing nuclear power in this country. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI's bill is a significant step toward breaking the deadlock which countries to threaten the future of nuclear energy in the U.S. I appreciate that he made some very tough decisions in crafting this bill that blends ideas from many sources to seek compromise in this difficult area. 
   One concession involves tying the issuance of a license for the ``early receipt facility'' to construction authorization for the permanent repository. I'd much prefer that we simply moved ahead with interim storage. An interim storage facility can proceed on its own merits, quite independent of decisions surrounding a permanent repository. Such an interim storage facility could be operational well before the ``early receipt facility'' authorized in this Act. 
   There are absolutely no technical issues associated with interim storage in dry casks, other countries certainly use it. Nevertheless, in the interests of seeking a compromise on this issue, I will support this Act's approach with the early receipt facility. 
   I appreciate that Senator MURKOWSKI has included Title III in the new bill with my proposal to create a new DOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. This new Office would organize a research program to explore new, improved national strategies for spent nuclear fuel. 
   Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing away with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be recycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting additional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., and Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but also to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms. 
   Now, I'm well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically desirable now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, it must only be done with careful attention to proliferation issues. But I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for a future evaluation that may determine that we are too hasty today to treat this spent fuel as waste, and that instead we should have been viewing it as an energy resource for future generations. 
   We do not have the knowledge today to make that decision. Title III establishes a research program to evaluate options to provide real data for such a future decision. 
   This research program would have other benefits. We may want to reduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public concerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and want to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products at that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize the storage potential of a future repository, and that would require some treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition. 
   Title III requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent fuel be studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. As we do this,  I'll encourage the Department to seek international cooperation. I know, based on personal contacts, that France, Russia, and Japan are eager to join with us in an international study of spent fuel options. 
   Title III requires that we focus on research programs that minimize proliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires that we study the economic implications of each technology. 
   With Title III, the United States will be prepared, some years in the future, to make the most intelligent decision regarding the future of nuclear energy as one of our major power sources. Maybe at that time, we'll have other better energy alternatives and decide that we can move away from nuclear power. Or we may find that we need nuclear energy to continue and even expand its current contribution to our nation's power grid. In any case, this research will provide the framework to guide Congress in these future decisions. 
   Mr. President, I want to specifically discuss one of the compromises that Senator MURKOWSKI has developed in his manager's amendment. In my view, his largest compromise involves the choice between the Environmental Protection Agency or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to set the radiation-protection standards for Yucca Mountain and for the ``early release facility.'' 
   The NRC has the technical expertise to set these standards. Furthermore, the NRC is a non-political organization, in sharp contrast to the political nature of the EPA. We need unbiased technical knowledge in setting these standards, there should be no place for politics at all. The EPA has proposed a draft standard already, that has been widely criticized for its inconsistency and lack of scientific rigor--events that do not enhance their credibility for this role. 
   I appreciate, however, the care that Senator MURKOWSKI has demonstrated in providing the ultimate authority to the EPA. His new language requires both the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences to comment on the EPA's draft standard. And he provides a period of time, until mid-2001, for the EPA to assess concerns with their standard and issue a valid standard. 
   These additions have the effect of providing a strong role for both the NRC and NAS to share their scientific knowledge with the EPA and help guide the EPA toward a credible standard. 
   The NRC should be complimented for their courageous stand against the EPA in this issue. Their issuance of a scientifically appropriate standard stands in stark contrast to the first effort from the EPA. Thanks to the actions of the NRC, the EPA can be guided toward reasonable standards. 
   Certainly, my preference is to have the NRC issue the final standard. But I appreciate the effort that Senator MURKOWSKI has expended in seeking compromise in this difficult area. 
   By following the procedures in the manager's amendment, we can allow the EPA to set the final standard, guided by the inputs from the NRC and NAS. Thus, I will support the manager's amendment. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank Senator MURSKOWSKI for his superb leadership in preparing this new act. We need to pass this manager's amendment with a veto-proof majority, to ensure that we finally attain some movement in the nation's ability to deal with high level nuclear waste. 
   We hear so much in the United States about how dangerous nuclear power is, how dangerous these fuel rods are that come out of the reactors, how dangerous nuclear reactors are, and I thought I might share with whomever is interested a bit of information about how safe nuclear powerplants are. 
   In this country, when we talk about moving some of the nuclear waste from one State to another, people get up in arms and they want to march down the streets because they are frightened to death that something is going to happen if this nuclear waste moves down the streets, the roads, the highways, or whatever. I thought I might share a series of facts with you that might make you think a little bit. 
   First, the U.S. Navy launched the first nuclear-powered submarine in 1954. We put a nuclear reactor in a submarine and we sent the submarine all over the oceans of the world, and nothing ever happened to anyone. Since then, the Navy has launched 200 nuclear-powered ships, and about 85 are currently in operation. In other words, 85 of the U.S. Navy's best and biggest warships are on the high seas with a nuclear reactor--in some cases two reactors--on board. Were something to happen, it would permeate and go right through the water. But guess what. Nothing has ever happened to anyone. Guess what else. Every major port in the world accepts America's Navy ships with nuclear reactors on board generating power to run that ship. Nobody seeks to say: You better keep these away from our port because there are a lot of other ships around here. 
   Why is that, I wonder? Why are we on the floor of the Senate almost whipped up to a lather of fear about moving high-level waste from some State in middle America to some State in western America and we have 85 nuclear-powered U.S. Navy ships, from battleships on down, moving around the high seas and docking at various ports everywhere? Nobody has a sign up. Nobody is frightened. Nothing has ever happened. And guess what. Because it was too good to be true, somebody said to go out and find out something about them; they must be hurting people with all these nuclear reactors. 
   So the GAO went out and did an extensive and exemplary study about what they had done and not done. Guess what they found. This is a 1999 review. ``No significant accidents. One resulting in fuel degradation has ever occurred.'' For an office such as the GAO that identifies public problems with Government programs, that is a pretty impressive statement. 
   Our nuclear-powered ships, I say to Senator MURKOWSKI, have traveled over 117 million miles on the high seas of the world. Nobody has said we don't want them on the high seas because they have a nuclear powerplant in them because they are safe as safe can be. Yet when it comes to us here in America we wonder whether we can transport some nuclear waste 200 miles. If we aren't technically sound enough, if we are not smart enough, if we are not engineered and qualified to be able to move something such as this 200 or 300 miles when the Navy has been moving reactors on the high seas 117 million miles--they have commissioned 33 new reactors in the 1990s. Just think of that. That puts them ahead of the civilian power by a score of 33 to 0. Because we have frightened ourselves to death, we will not even license a new nuclear powerplant in the United States. 
   We surely are proud as proud can be when we see a great big American battleship or aircraft carrier floating on those high seas with all those Navy guys on board. What do they have? Some of them have two nuclear powerplants in the hull loaded with the same kind of waste product about which we are so worried. The distinguished Senator from Alaska is saying: Why don't we just move that and put it in a place where it can be stored? No one else in the world who is involved in nuclear power has tied the future of nuclear power and nuclear use to the ultimate disposition of the high-level waste residue in a permanent underground facility from whence it can never be extracted and for which the technical requirements are so severe in terms of making sure it lasts for 100,000 years--or whatever the number is--that we are never going to get it done. It is amazing. It is just amazing. 
   The country of France gets 87 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. They still do not have a plan to put the nuclear waste away permanently because they are not frightened about it. They trust their intelligent, enlightened leaders, who currently have it in gymnasiums about the size of high schools. That is where it is stored. You can walk on top of it where it is stored and nobody is worried about anything. Here we are debating whether we could have a temporary storage facility--as the country that invented it, as the country that engineered it, as the country whose great nuclear physicists invented the notion and came up with the idea of how to power-generate it, and we sit, except for the U.S. Navy, letting the rest of the world just pass us by. 
   The Senator from Alaska will never get the credit he deserves for trying to get this little site, this temporary facility. He will never get the credit.  People are thinking we are trying to pull something over on them; we might be hurting people; we are just trying to get it out of one site and hide it someplace else. 
   There are 85 U.S. Navy ships, I remind everybody one more time, of all sizes, including battleships, aircraft carriers, and some with two nuclear powerplants on them. As we stand right here, they are floating around on the high seas where the water is all fissionable. If you are in this part of the 
   Atlantic, the water will eventually end up over here miles away, and nobody is lodging serious complaints. They may say we don't want the U.S. Navy around for some other reason. And thank God we have them. But they are in ports everywhere. They don't take the nuclear powerplant out before they come into a port. Right? They don't have three kinds of motors around. They may have a couple of auxiliary motors. But the nuclear powerplants are right there on board. 
   I thought I would just state that part of my statement which I put in the RECORD yesterday because it is so obvious to me that we are being so foolish in tying the ultimate disposition of the high-level waste generated by 20 percent of our electrical powerplants, which are nuclear, to a policy that says unless and until we find a place to put that underground at Yucca--wherever it is in Nevada--forever we will not continue with nuclear power. 
   I believe it is so shortsighted and based on such an insignificant set of scientific facts that it is almost as if America just wouldn't do something such as that. But we are doing it. There were letters circulating yesterday that the proposal of the Senator from Alaska would not be helpful; in fact, it would hurt people. I don't think I have to repeat. I think I have made the case. 
   What would the world be doing if in fact nuclear reactors were that unsafe and U.S. Navy ships want to dock to let their Navy men go on shore for a while and then get on with something else? I do not believe they would be saying: Have we found a place to put the nuclear waste that is coming in on that new battleship that you are generating? Have you found a place to put it away forever? I think they would say: Gee, there is no risk at all involved. It is a pretty good venture. We are glad to have you. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President I rise today to salute the 150th Security Forces Squadron and the 150th Civil Engineering Squadron of the New Mexico Air National Guard. 
   Federally recognized on July 7, 1947 as the 188th Fighter Bomber Squadron, the ``Tacos'' have contributed significantly to U.S. military operations in Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, and are scheduled to deploy to Turkey next January as part of Operation Northern Watch. During their 52-year history, the Tacos were the first Air National Guard unit to be converted to the F-100 aircraft in 1958 and the A-7D aircraft in 1973. Since 1970, when the 150th Fighter Wing evolved into a joint support force, the Tacos have been utilized by every branch of our Armed Forces except for the Coast Guard. 
   The Tacos are characteristic of the many exceptional units that comprise our Nation's Reserve and National Guard, and I have no doubt that they will continue to ensure the success of our military missions both domestically and abroad. I would ask that my colleagues join me in thanking them for their dedicated service.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to compliment Senator MURKOWSKI's leadership on the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. I appreciate his efforts to enable progress on the Nation's need for concrete action on spent nuclear fuel. 
   I find it amazing how fear of anything in this country with ``nuclear'' in its title, like ``nuclear waste,'' seems to paralyze our ability to act decisively. Nuclear issues are immediately faced with immense political challenges. 
   There are many great examples of how nuclear technologies impact our daily lives. Yet few of our citizens know enough about the benefits we've gained from harnessing the nucleus to support actions focused on reducing the remaining risks. 
   Just one example that should be better understood and appreciated involves our nuclear navy. Their experience has important lessons for better understanding of these technologies. 
   The Nautilus, our first nuclear powered submarine, was launched in 1954. Since then, the Navy has launched over 200 nuclear powered ships, and about 85 are currently in operation. Recently, the Navy was operating slightly over 100 reactors, about the same number as those operating in civilian power stations across the country. 
   The Navy's safety record is exemplary. Our nuclear ships are welcomed into over 150 ports in over 50 countries. A 1999 review of their safety record was conducted by the General Accounting Office. That report stated:  
   No significant accident--one resulting in fuel degradation--has ever occurred.  
   For an Office like GAO, that identifies and publicizes problems with government programs, that's a pretty impressive statement! 
   Our nuclear powered ships have traveled over 117 million miles without serious incidents. Further, the Navy has commissioned 33 new reactors in the 1990s, that puts them ahead of civilian power by a score of 33 to zero. And Navy reactors have more than twice the operational hours of our civilian systems. 
   The nuclear navy story is a great American success story, one that is completely enabled by appropriate and careful use of nuclear power. It's contributed to the freedoms we so cherish. 
   Nuclear energy is another great American success story. It now supplies about 20 percent of our nation's electricity, it is not a supply that we can afford to lose. It's done it without release of greenhouse gases, with a superlative safety record over the last decade. The efficiency of nuclear plants has risen consistently and their operating costs are among the lowest of all energy sources. 
   I have repeatedly emphasized that the United States must maintain nuclear energy as a viable option for future energy requirements. And without some near-term waste solution, like interim storage or an early receipt facility, we are killing this option. We may be depriving future generations of a reliable power source that they may desperately need. 
   There is no excuse for the years that the issue of nuclear waste has been with us. Near-term credible solutions are not technically difficult. We absolutely must progress towards early receipt of spent fuel at a central location, at least faster than the 2010 estimates for opening Yucca Mountain that we now face or risk losing nuclear power in this country. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI's bill is a significant step toward breaking the deadlock which continues to threaten the future of nuclear energy in the U.S. I appreciate that he made some very tough decisions in crafting this bill that blends ideas from many sources to seek compromise in this difficult area. 
   One concession involves tying the issuance of a license for the ``early receipt facility'' to construction authorization for the permanent repository. I'd much prefer that we simply moved ahead with interim storage. An interim storage facility can proceed on its own merits, quite independent of decisions surrounding a permanent repository. Such an interim storage facility could be operational well before the ``early receipt facility'' authorized in this Act. 
   There are absolutely no technical issues associated with interim storage in dry casks, other countries certainly use it. Nevertheless, in the interests of seeking a compromise on this issue, I  will support this Act's approach with the early receipt facility. 
   I appreciate that Senator MURKOWSKI has included Title III in the new bill with my proposal to create a new DOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. This new Office would organize a research program to explore new, improved national strategies for spent nuclear fuel. 
   Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing away with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be recycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting additional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., and Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but also to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms. 
   Now I am well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically desirable now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, it must only be done with careful attention to proliferation issues. But I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for a future evaluation that may determine that we are too hasty today to treat this spent fuel as waste, and that instead we should have been viewing it as an energy resource for future generations. 
   We do not have the knowledge today to make that decision. Title III establishes a research program to evaluate options to provide real data for such a future decision. 
   This research program would have other benefits. We may want to reduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public concerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and want to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products at that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize the storage potential of a future repository, and that would require some treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition. 
   Title III requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent fuel be studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. As we do this, I will encourage the Department to seek international cooperation. I know, based on personal contacts, that France, Russia, and Japan are eager to join with us in an international study of spent fuel options. 
   Title III requires that we focus on research programs that minimize proliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires that we study the economic implications of each technology. 
   With Title III, the United States will be prepared, some years in the future, to make the most intelligent decision regarding the future of nuclear energy as one of our major power sources. Maybe at that time, we'll have other better energy alternatives and decide that we can move away from nuclear power. Or we may find that we need nuclear energy to continue and even expand its current contribution to our nation's power grid. In any case, this research will provide the framework to guide Congress in these future decisions. 
   I want to specifically discuss one of the compromises that Senator MURKOWSKI has developed in his Manager's Amendment. In my view, his largest compromise involves the choice between the Environmental Protection Agency or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to set the radiation-protection standards for Yucca Mountain and for the ``early release facility.'' 
   The NRC has the technical expertise to set these standards. Furthermore, the NRC is a non-political organization, in sharp contrast to the political nature of the EPA. We need unbiased technical knowledge in setting these standards, there should be no place for politics at all. The EPA has proposed a draft standard already, that has been widely criticized for its inconsistency and lack of scientific rigor--events that do not enhance their credibility for this role. 
   I appreciate, however, the care that Senator MURKOWSKI has demonstrated in providing the ultimate authority to the EPA. His new language requires both the NRC and the National Academy of Sciences to comment on the EPA's draft standard. And he provides a period of time, until mid-2001, for the EPA to assess concerns with their standard and issue a valid standard. 
   These additions have the effect of providing a strong role for both the NRC and NAS to share their scientific knowledge with the EPA and help guide the EPA toward a credible standard. 
   The NRC should be complimented for their courageous stand against the EPA in this issue. Their issuance of a scientifically appropriate standard stands in stark contrast to the first effort from the EPA. Thanks to the actions of the NRC, the EPA can be guided toward reasonable standards. 
   Certainly my preference is to have the NRC issue the final standard. But I appreciate the effort that Senator MURKOWSKI has expended in seeking compromise in this difficult area. 
   By following the procedures in the Manager's Amendment, we can allow the EPA to set the final standard, guided by the inputs from the NRC and NAS. Thus, I will support the Manager's Amendment. 
   I thank Senator MURKOWSKI for his superb leadership in preparing this new act. We need to pass this Manager's Amendment with a veto-proof majority, to ensure that we finally attain some movement in the nation's ability to deal with high level nuclear waste.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a front page article in yesterday's New York Times announced an agreement that will halt Russia's production of plutonium from spent fuel used in its civilian power reactors. In exchange for a Russian moratorium on plutonium reprocessing, the United States will provide a $100 million joint research and aid. I strongly support these efforts and believe that this proposal will help to reduce the threat of proliferation from nuclear materials in Russia. 
   However, as we pursue new initiatives to better safeguard Russia's civilian plutonium, we must not waver in our support for the more urgent task of disposing of their weapons plutonium. The 50 tons of military-grade plutonium that Russia has agreed is surplus could fuel more than 6,000 modern weapons. I'm pleased that the Administration is also recognizing that the lower-grade, civilian, plutonium presents some risk--but we must continue to place our highest priority on their military materials, which represent a significantly higher risk. 
   Currently, Russia possesses 30 tons of separated civilian plutonium at Mayak and continues to accumulate 2 tons per year from reprocessing at that facility. This is in addition to the 150 or more tons of weapons plutonium in the Russian complex. 
   First, we must ensure that these materials are safeguarded. Second, any burn capacity Russia has should be committed to first eliminating military-origin plutonium as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. Until the threat from weapons plutonium is eliminated, Russia has no use for this reprocessed fuel, and its continued production represents a proliferation risk, albeit less then the risk from weapons-grade materials. This agreement will help address immediate needs. 
   As part of this agreement, the United States will contribute $45 million to improve control and accounting of civilian-grade plutonium already stored at the Mayak site and build an additional large dry storage facility elsewhere in Russia. Another $30 million will ensure adequate safeguards--protection, control and accounting--on the existing materials. The balance of U.S. contributions--$25 million for research on proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and permanent geological storage--is conditioned on Russia ending its sales of nuclear technology to Iran. 
   Mr. President, while I support this new initiative to temporarily halt Russian extraction of plutonium from their spent nuclear fuel, I want to be sure that my enthusiasm is not interpreted as support for stopping reprocessing on a global scale. Some nations, like Japan and France, have decided that reprocessing of spent fuel is key to their nuclear power plans. By this reprocessing, they not only recycle plutonium back into reactors, they mitigate the hazard associated with their nuclear wastes. 
   In contrast, the U.S. has stuck to an old, 1977, decision to simply bury our spent fuel--plutonium and all. That not only increases the health risk from our spent fuel relative to that in France or Japan, it also means that we are proposing to bury a significant energy resource that our own future generations may need. The origin of the 1977 decision, fear of proliferation of reactor-grade plutonium, is certainly not without validity. But reprocessing can be done, as the French and British have demonstrated, with sufficient care to ensure that proliferation does not occur. 
   Reprocessing is not something that the U.S. should embrace today--it really wouldn't be economical with today's cheap uranium prices. But I've worked with Senator MURKOWSKI to introduce provisions into his current Nuclear Waste bill to require that we study advanced reprocessing and transmutation systems that would both minimize proliferations concerns related to spent fuel, and also study technologies that minimize hazards from spent fuel for the public and for workers. I will encourage that Russia continue to study these same technologies, because they have great expertise in these areas. Sometime in the future, we may need to use reprocessing to regain use of the energy content in spent fuel. 
   Thus, I believe we should keep future options for civilian fuel reprocessing open even as we focus attention in Russia on burning military-origin plutonium. Certainly for now, any attempt to burn civilian-origin plutonium in Russia only delays progress in decreasing Russia's excess weapons plutonium stockpile. 
   Let me return briefly to the more urgent matters associated with military-grade plutonium. As the Chair of the Senate Plutonium Task Force, I have pushed hard for completion of a U.S.-Russia agreement on military plutonium. In 1998, I led the charge to appropriate $200 million for implementation of such an agreement. 
   I understand that negotiations for this plutonium agreement are very near completion. This agreement will outline a framework within which the U.S. and Russia will dispose of 50 tons of excess weapons plutonium. This framework will address timetables for progress, rates of disposal, and reciprocal verification of compliance. This agreement will turn the U.S. and Russian political commitments regarding irreversibility into a physical reality. 
   However, I've been dismayed that the Administration has recently chosen to remove $49 million from the $200 million set aside for disposition of weapons-plutonium to fund other priorities. That is very short sighted reasoning. The full $200 million has served to keep pressure on the negotiating teams to finalize the disposition protocols. We send a completely inappropriate message when funds are withdrawn from that account. I intend to work in the next few months to restore this $49  million. Furthermore, I will continue to oppose any future use of these funds by the Administration for anything other than their intended purpose. 
   The Administration's new initiative can work in tandem with the efforts focused on military plutonium. I urge the Administration to make quick and quantifiable progress on both of these fronts. The threat of proliferation from the Russian nuclear complex continues to grow. And it continues to be one of the greatest threats to U.S. security today.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator BINGAMAN in introducing legislation to help resolve whether the federal government inadequately implemented the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hildalgo in New Mexico. Today is the 152d anniversary of the signing by the United States of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo with Mexico. Under this 1848 treaty, the United States acquired the territory that is now California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. Unfortunately, the potential failure of this country to meet its obligations under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hildalgo has been a source of continuing controversy, and many New Mexicans claim they were illegally deprived of property rights by the federal government. For example, in California, about seventy-three percent of land grant claims have been confirmed compared to only twenty-four percent in New Mexico, which raises questions as to whether adjudications in New Mexico were equitably and fairly administered. 
   We must take the opportunity to reverse the heritage of ill-will between the Hispanic people of New Mexico and the Federal government. Hispanic descendants in our state have been waiting over 150 years to get the federal government to fairly look into the community land grants issue. In 1848, land grant claimants were led to believe that their property rights would be honored and protected, but they have repeatedly been frustrated by government officials. One Surveyor General for New Mexico has been described by historians as ``steeped in prejudice against New Mexico, its people and their property rights.'' Other opportunists used long legal battles to acquire empires that extended over millions of acres--all at the expense of local Hispanics. 
   In 1891, the Surveyor General was replaced by the Court of Private Land Claims, but the court's procedures heavily favored the government. The Court of Claims required that claimants prove that the Spanish or Mexican granting official had the legal authority to issue the land grant. The claimants did not have access to necessary documentation, and often did not speak English. Consequently, the court rejected two-thirds of the New Mexico claims presented before it. Ultimately, by one account written by Richard Griswold del Castillo, only eighty-two grants received Congressional confirmation. This represented only six percent of the total area sought by land claimants, leaving a bitter legacy. 
   In the 105th Congress, Congressman Redmond was able to pass a bill out of the House of Representatives creating a Presidential Commission to evaluate the community land grants located in New Mexico. I was proud to introduce a companion bill, including a few changes based on the lessons I learned from talking to the heirs of some of the land grants; from reviewing the history; and from talking to scholars, historians and land grant lawyers. 
   After hearings and continuing dialog with land grant heirs, we realized that the natural first step in the process was determining whether the grantees' rights had been violated under the Treaty. It became clear that adequate time for a thorough study of the issue was needed. Documents had to be gathered. Resolution of the dispute must take into account intervening legal rights. 
   Last year, Senator BINGAMAN and I originally proposed that the Attorney 
   General, acting through the Assistant  Attorney General for Civil Rights, should investigate whether the United States properly implemented the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo which pertain to the protection of valid land grant claims in New Mexico. If that investigation found that the federal government needed to rectify past abuses, the President would submit a proposal to Congress to resolve those claims. The Senate supported our desire last fall to include in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill the requirement that the Justice Department conduct such a study. However, the Justice Department objected on the grounds that it could not be a neutral examiner of the legal obligations of the United States in this situation. 
   The General Accounting Office (GAO) was recommended by House appropriators as an alternative, and language directing GAO conduct a study was included in the original conference report for Department of Justice appropriations. However, that provision was written in the waning hours of the conference, without time for consultation with the GAO, and while the focus of the conference was turned to other matters. Consequently, we believed that language was inadequate to serve New Mexico's needs. At our request, the appropriations conferees removed the inadequate study language from the final version of the CJS conference report. 
   I must say that I respectfully disagree with the Justice Department's contention that they could not properly conduct such a study. What better arm of the government should investigate whether the United States properly implemented the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo which pertain to the protection of valid land grant claims in New Mexico? 
   Nonetheless, after meeting with top-level representatives at the Department of Justice, Senator BINGAMAN and I met with GAO's General Counsel Robert Murphy and Principal Assistant Comptroller General Gene Dodaro to craft language that more closely reflected the needs of New Mexico, and the capabilities of the GAO. We have formally asked GAO to review how the United States implemented the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo which pertain to the protection of community land grant claims in New Mexico. 
   The GAO will submit an interim report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate, and to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and to the President of the United States, by the end of this year. A final report will be submitted by the end of 2002. This will allow the GAO adequate time to investigate this complicated issue. 
   The report will include a description of the legal obligations of the United States to protect the rights of community land grants and its actions in carrying out the provisions of the treaty, an assessment of the issues raised concerning the implementation of the treaty provisions, and identification of potential methods of resolving any failure by the United States with regard to community land grant claims. The GAO shall also discuss the potential effects of resolution options on intervening legal rights and on Tribal land claims. In no event should any identification of remedies include divestiture of private property rights. 
   The bill we introduce today directs that if the GAO concludes that the obligations of the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo regarding the protection of the community land grant rights do not appear to have been met, the Department of Justice shall prepare for the President a list of alternative methods to remedy the problem. The President will then submit to Congress recommendations to resolve these claims within six months of the submission of the GAO report. Again, we also wish to ensure that no recommendations include the potential divestiture of private property rights. We do not wish to transplant one potential injustice with another. 
   Trying to do justice 150 years after the fact is complicated. I am hopeful that this bill can address what has been, for too long, a tale of land loss and bitterness between the United States and some of its New Mexico citizens.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through January 27, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 68). The budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted to the Senate to reflect funding for emergency requirements, disability reviews, adoption assistance, the earned income tax credit initiative, and arrearages for international organizations, peacekeeping, and multilateral banks. 
   The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $10.3 billion in budget authority and below the budget resolution by $2.3 billion in outlays. Current level is $17.8 billion above the revenue floor in 2000. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $20.6 billion, which is $5.7 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 2000 of $26.3 billion. 
   Since my last report, dated September 28, 1999, the Congress has passed and the President has signed the following acts: Veterans, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-74), Agriculture and Rural Development Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-78), Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-79), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (P.L. 106-102), an Act Making Consolidated Appropriations for FY 2000 (P.L. 106-113), Veterans' Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117), an act to convey property in Sisters, Oregon (P.L. 106-144), an act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint various commemorative coins (P.L. 106-126), Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-169), and Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-170). These actions have changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues. This is my first report for the second session of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation important to the energy security of our country. This legislation entitled the ``Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization and Improvements Act of 2000'' not only includes provisions authorizing the annual funding for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but makes essential amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will assist the NRC in its efforts to achieve greater efficiencies and eliminate outdated restrictions within our nuclear energy sector. As mentioned, this legislation includes several amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, including the following: 
   Eliminating provisions in current law that preclude any foreign ownership of power and research reactors located in the United States. These outdated provisions are a significant obstacle to foreign investment or participation in the U.S. nuclear power industry and its restructuring. No valid reasons exist to prohibit investors from countries such as the United Kingdom from participating in the ownership of nuclear plants in this country. The provisions in current law that protect U.S. security interests are unchanged by my legislation. 
   Eliminationg the current statutory requirement that the NRC conduct an antitrust review in connection with licensing actions. Other federal agencies already have comprehensive responsibility to enforce antitrust laws affecting electric utilities. Requiring the NRC to do independent antitrust evaluations for licensing actions is redundant, time-consuming and unnecessary. 
   Simplifying the hearing requirements in a proceeding involving an amendment to an existing operating license, or the transfer of an existing operating license. The amendment provides that the Commission should not use formal adjudicatory procedures in such cases, but rather should comply with the informal rulemaking requirements contained in the Administrative Procedure Act. 
   Giving the NRC the authority to establish such requirements it deems necessary to ensure that non-licenses fully comply with their obligations to provide funding for nuclear plant decommissioning. This includes jurisdiction over non-licensees, i.e., those who have transferred their license but retain responsibility for decommissioning. 
   The proposed package also includes legislative provisions sought by the NRC. The foreign ownership and anti-trust review changes just mentioned were included in the NRC's legislative proposals last year. Other provisions requested by the NRC should serve to enhance nuclear safety and physical security, increase efficiency, and enhance the economic use of Commission resources. 
   These changes are necessary to ensure that nuclear energy remains part of our nation's energy portfolio. Nuclear energy is a vital ingredient for providing U.S. base load capacity based on economic, environmental and electricity needs. 
   Mr. President, I am sure everyone is aware of my strong commitment to nuclear energy. This conviction is well-founded. One need only consider a few simple facts to find justification for my position. 
   Ensuring diversity and reliability in our nation's future energy portfolio is a critical national security concern. As just one example, our increasing dependence on imported fossil fuel is a cause for concern. Last year oil imports accounted for 54% of U.S. oil consumption. This dependence could create a national security crisis. This dependence may also contribute to an environmental crisis. 
   Similarly, although we continue to invest in renewable energy resources, the hard facts demonstrate that renewables alone cannot obtain sufficient energy generation to meet future needs. 
   An article by Richard Rhodes and Denis Beller in the most recent edition of Foreign Affairs argues the case for nuclear energy in detail. Mr. President, allow me briefly to review some facts found in this article that address some very important questions. These repeat the same points I made in a speech at Harvard in October of 1997 and have made many times since. 
   First, what estimated energy demands will the world face? 
   A 1999 report by the British Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering estimates that the consumption of energy will at least double in the next 50 years and grow by a factor of up to five in the next century. 
   The OECD projects 65% growth in world energy demand by 2020. 
   How can nuclear energy play a role in meeting future energy needs? 
   The anti-nuclear groups are dead wrong. Nuclear power is neither dead nor dying. France generates 79 percent of its electricity with nuclear power; Belgium, 60 percent; Sweden, 42 percent; Japan 34 percent; and the United States, 20 percent. The United States remains the largest producer of nuclear energy in the world, and the U.S. nuclear industry generated nine percent more nuclear electricity in 1999 than 1998. In order to sustain economic growth, China has plans for as many as 100 nuclear power plants, and South Korea will more than double its capacity by building 16 new plants. 
   Nuclear power's advantage is the ability to generate a vast amount of energy from a minute quantity of fuel. For example, whereas one kilogram of firewood can produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity and the ratio for oil is one-to-four, one kilogram of uranium fuel in a modern light-water reactor generates 400,000 kilowatts of electricity, even without recycling. 
   Nuclear safety and efficiency have improved dramatically in the last decade. For example, the average U.S. capacity factor in 1998 was 80 percent, compared to 58 percent in 1980 and 66 percent in 1990. The average production costs for nuclear energy are now at just under two cents per kilowatt-hour, while electricity produced from gas costs almost three and a half cents per kilowatt-hour. Most importantly, radiation exposure to workers and waste produced per unit of energy have hit new lows. 
   What about the risks from radioactivity? 
   Good evidence exists that exposure to low doses of radioactivity actually improves health and lengthens life  through stimulation of the immune system. Unfortunately, U.S. standards, in particular those established by the Environmental Protection Agency, rely on a theory--the ``linear no-threshold'' theory (LNT)--that predicts exposure to trivial levels of radiation increases the risk of cancer. One should keep in mind that the levels argued to increase risk of cancer by this model are considerably less than preexisting natural levels of background radiation. Furthermore, this theory is by no means accepted by the entire scientific community. 
   According to recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health, a 1,000 megawatt coal-fired power plant releases about 100 times as much radioactivity into the environment as a comparable nuclear plant. However, the same standards for radioactive releases do not apply to coal and nuclear plants. And, experts on coal geology and engineering have concluded that ``radioactive elements in coal and fly ash should not be sources of alarm.'' 
   Can we not place more reliance on renewables? 
   Even if robustly subsidized, renewables will only move from their present 0.5 percent share to claim no more than five to eight percent by 2020.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to talk about the Senate passage of the Veterans' Millennium Health Care Act.  
   I am extremely pleased the act contains a provision that will extend the useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. I also want to thank Senator SPECTER for his assistance in making passage of this Bill possible. 
   The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces have made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and liberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The service of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and the sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be forgotten. 
   These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be buried at a National Cemetery of their choosing. Unfortunately, projections show the Santa Fe National Cemetery will run out of space to provide casketed burials for our veterans at the conclusion of 2000. However, with Senate passage of this bill we are ensuring the continued viability of the Santa Fe National Cemetery. 
   I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National Cemetery that has grown from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. The cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was designated a National Cemetery in April of 1875. 
   Men and women who have fought in all of nation's wars hold an honored spot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. Today the Santa Fe National Cemetery contains almost 27,000 graves that are mostly marked by upright headstones. 
   The Senate's action today guarantees the Santa Fe National Cemetery will not be forced to close next year. A provision in the bill passed today allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for the use of flat grave markers that will extend the useful life of the cemetery until 2008. 
   While I wish the practice of utilizing headstones could continue indefinitely if a veteran chose, my wishes are outweighed by my desire to extend the useful life of the cemetery. I would note that my desire is shared by the New Mexico Chapter of the American Legion, the Albuquerque Chapter of the Retired Officers' Association, and the New Mexico Chapter of the VFW who have all endorsed the use of flat grave markers. 
   Finally, this is not without precedent because exceptions to the law have been granted on six prior occasions with the most recent action occurring in 1994 when Congress authorized the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for flat grave markers at the Willamette National Cemetery in Oregon. 
   Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator SPECTER for his assistance and state how pleased I am with the final passage of this important bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will pass S. 1515, an important bill to make some much needed changes to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. I am pleased to join my colleagues, including the Chairmen of the Senate Judiciary and Indian Affairs Committees, in support of this legislation. 
   Mr. President, my home state of New Mexico is the birthplace of the atomic bomb. One of the unfortunate consequences of our country's rapid development of its nuclear arsenal was that many of those who worked in the earliest uranium mines became afflicted with terrible illnesses. 
   I noticed this problem more than twenty years ago, when I learned that miners had contracted an alarmingly high rate of lung cancer and other diseases commonly related to radiation exposure. 
   Many of the miners were Native Americans, mostly members of the Navajo Nation, with whom the United States government has had a longstanding trust relationship based on the treaties and agreements between our country and the tribes. Some 1,500 Navajos worked in the uranium mines from 1947 to 1971. Many of them have since died of horrible radiation-related illnesses. 
   All of the uranium miners, including the Navajos, performed a great service out of patriotic duty to this country. Their work helped us to win the Cold War. Unfortunately, our Nation failed to fulfill its duty to protect the miners' health. After hearing of the problem, I began the effort the miners' health. After hearing of the problem, I began the effort to see that the miners and their families received just compensation for their illnesses. 
   Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize a person who has been a champion in the hearts of uranium miners and their families throughout the Colorado Plateau. This person, a former uranium miner himself, has worked tirelessly in advocating many of the reforms we have established within this bill. 
   Mr. President, Paul Hicks of Grants, New Mexico deserves a large amount of credit for bringing attention to this legislation in the United States Senate. Paul is President of the New Mexico Uranium Workers Council and he has spearhearted the grassroots effort that is responsible for several of these much needed reforms. 
   Paul was a uranium miner for over twelve years in New Mexico. He later worked as a lead miner, a shift boss, and ended his mining career as a mine foreman. But as Paul will tell you, ``it takes about ten years to make a good miner, but only ten minutes to make a good foreman.'' Mr. President, Paul Hicks is and will always be a miner at heart. 
   Paul has fought this effort for the miners of the Navajo nation, Acoma Pueblo, Grants, New Mexico, and Dove Creek and Grand Junction, Colorado. Paul Hicks is truly a hero in the heart's of the many people along the Colorado Plateau that have been adversely affected by exposure to uranium. 
   Unfortunately Mr. President, Paul is now facing another battle. That is fight against cancer. Paul was diagnosed last week with bone cancer and now, he must endure massive radiation treatments for the next six weeks. It will be a tough fight, but one I know he'll win. Simply, because I know Paul Hicks. 
   Way back in 1979, I held the first field hearing on this issue in Mr. Hicks' hometown of Grants, New Mexico to learn about the concerns and the health problems faced on uranium miners. In later years, I traveled to Shiprock, New Mexico and the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation to gather more information about the uranium miners and their families. 
   Twelve years after I introduced that first bill, President Bush signed RECA into law. At the time, RECA was intended to provide fair and swift compensation for those miners and downwinders who had contracted certain radiation-related illnesses. 
   Since the RECA trust fund began making awards in 1992, the Department of Justice has approved a total 3,135 claims valued at nearly $232 million. In my home state of New Mexico, there have been 371 claims approved with a value of nearly $37 million. For that work, the Department of Justice is to be commended. 
   The original RECA was a compassionate law which unfortunately has come to be administered in a bureaucratic, dispassionate and often unfair manner. Many claims have languished at the Department of Justice for far too long. 
   Miners and their families, particularly Navajos, often have waited many years for their claims to be processed. Many claims were denied because the miners were smokers and could not prove that their diseases were related solely to uranium mining. In other cases, miners faced problems establishing the requisite amount of working level months needed to make a successful claim. Native American claims by spousal survivors often were denied because of difficulties associated with documenting Native American marriages. 
   This bill makes some important, common-sense changes to the radiation compensation program to address the problems I have outlined. First, it expands the list of compensable diseases to include new cancers, including leukemia, thyroid and brain cancer. It also includes certain non-cancer diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Medical science has been able to link these diseases to uranium mining in the 10 years since the enactment of the original RECA. We now know that prolonged radiation exposure can cause many additional diseases. This bill uses the best available science to make sure that those who were injured by radiation exposure are compensated. 
   The bill also extends eligibility to above-ground and open-pit miners, millers and transport workers. The latest science tells us that the risks of disease associated with radiation exposure were not necessarily limited to those who worked in unventilated mines. 
   Most importantly, the bill requires the Department of Justice to take Native American law and customs into account when deciding claims. I have heard countless stories about the inequities faced by the spouses of Navajo miners who have been unable to successfully document their traditional tribal marriages to the satisfaction of the Justice Department under current law and regulations. This bill will change that, and make it easier of spousal survivors to make successful claims. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to support this important legislation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost close to $1 billion over the next 21 years. That is far less than some of the other proposals floated in the House and Senate during the past few years. This is a common-sense approach, which addresses many of the problems with the existing program, without unnecessarily expanding the scope of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has done a fine Job crafting this bill and I have been pleased to work with him in that regard. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, I say to Senator ROTH. 
   I might say, on the bill that we are speaking to, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, I do not know how many Senators have ever had a disabled person who is holding a job and getting a paycheck. Come and see them. A disabled person who is holding a job and just got a paycheck--and you get to visit with them--they are glowing. They are filled with pride that they are able to work. Actually, it is the best therapy in the world for a disabled person to have a job. 
   I happen to know that from personal experience in my own family. But I have seen it in scores of faces of people who come and tell me as disabled people that they are working and they are getting a paycheck.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to take a few moments to thank a few people and summarize the budget bill that we are going to pass this evening, hopefully. 
   I want to thank the White House for their cooperation in coming to an agreement with reference to the appropriations bill and all of those things that are in the so-called omnibus package. 
   In particular, I want to thank the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Lew. The last evening  when we were about to depart and part company and say we will go our own ways, they asked me if I would meet with Mr. Lew, and if we could see if we could work something out. We are here today with a bipartisan bill because we did work something out. 
   I thought it was the very best thing we could do. Frankly, I am proud of it. I wish it could have been done sooner. I am hoping that next year we will get the appropriations bills done perhaps 6 to 7 or 8 weeks sooner than we did this year. But I want to start by quoting from the New York Times, not necessarily a newspaper that thinks what Republicans do is necessarily good, as I do, but they said in their editorial, on their editorial page, the following thing about this budget bill that we are going to have before us: 
   There are modest spending increases in some of the President's priority areas like education but over all the Republican approach 
    of spending restraint has shaped this budget.'' 
   I am very proud of that. I think that is true because what we have done is we have kept the faith with those who want a balanced budget. This budget proposal ensures a balanced budget without using Social Security trust fund money. 
   I ask parenthetically for those who still doubt that because they do not have a Congressional Budget Office letter that says it, if the President of the United States would be asking Democrats to vote for this measure if he and his OMB Director thought it was using Social Security trust fund money? I think the answer is no. They know it does not. I know it does not. And I can promise the Senate, come February or March, when you reestimate everything, it will not be using the Social Security trust fund money. 
   I think that is the new discipline that has been imposed on our economy and our fiscal policy. It is a brand new event to say we are not going to spend Social Security money, and it is the best thing we can do for the American economy because, Senator MOYNIHAN, to the extent we do not spend it, we reduce the public debt. So for those who are wondering about the public debt, the public debt is reduced dollar for dollar when you leave Social Security surpluses alone year by year as they accumulate and do not spend them. 
   Now, let me tell you a dramatic statement about our current fiscal policy. Who would think a budget chairman could stand on the floor and say to the Senators who are listening, we will pay down the publicly-held debt by $130 billion? Think of that--$130 billion. If that does not mean that as soon as we saw surplus we did not run out and spend it, then I do not know what it means. 
   Frankly, I think my good friend, Senator GRAMM from Texas, is correct; in about 30 or 40 years, when they look back on this period in time, they are going to say: Incredible. With the kind of surpluses that existed, not a single new entitlement program of major proportion was started, and not a single new American spending program was started because the accumulations went into the Social Security trust fund instead of being used to pay for more Government. 
   I am proud of that. I think it is the best medicine for growth and prosperity in the future. 
   It holds Government spending, as we calculate it overall, to about 3.3 percent this year over last year--that includes entitlements and appropriations--a very interesting number. 
   In the 1970's, it was 11 percent growth. 
   In the 1980's, it was 8 percent growth. 
   For those who in editorial comments across this land call this a bloated budget, let me suggest, the fiscal policy of the United States which has the Government growing less than the economy is growing is not bad fiscal policy. That is about where we are now under the culmination of this budget process for this year. 
   In the meantime, when we passed the budget resolution in April of this past year, we said we wanted to do some very important things. 
   First, we wanted to increase the flexibility in education programs. It does not matter how much the President or others claim that the President won the education battle. The truth of the matter is, Republicans put more money in education than the President asked for. 
   For the first time we have flexibility. Twenty percent of the money that was going to go to teachers directly, and targeted and for nothing else, can be flexibly used by school districts. And the philosophical battle of the future will be flexibility of education funds with accountability versus the targeting and direct aid in very numerous and numbers of targeted mandates that Government says one size fits all. You all use it this way, or you cannot use it at all. 
   We suggested in our budget resolution that we should put more money into research on the dread diseases that affect our people 
   and mankind. We increased NIH $2.3 billion, which is $2 billion more than the President asked for, for dreaded diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and the whole list.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Allergies--all kinds of things. 
   We believe the breakthroughs will come in the next the millennium from this kind of investment. We are proud of it. We increased national defense--if you take out emergencies--by $13.5 billion, and increased the pay for the military at a very significant rate, which was long overdue and much needed. 
   In addition, also in this bill, we have taken care of the shortcomings in Medicare that came from the Balanced Budget Act. And $16 billion goes into that in the next 5 years, including $2.1 billion to replenish skilled nursing home payments. Also, the therapy caps have changed. There are slower reductions in payments for teaching hospitals, and a long list of changes.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Yesterday (November 18), House Rules Committee Chairman DAVID DREIER introduced H. Res. 396, a resolution expressing the sense of the House that biennial budgeting legislation should be enacted in the second session of the 106th Congress. 
   Notably, this resolution has 245 cosponsors, significantly more than a majority of that body. Those sponsors include the entire House Republican leadership, 25 members of the House Appropriations Committee, including the Chairman, and 45 Democrats. 
   Critics of biennial budgeting often point to lack of support in the House as a reason why the proposal will never be adopted. That hurdle seems now to have been swept away, as significantly more than a majority of the House has been convinced by the inescapable logic and numerous advantages of a biennial budget process. 
   This year, we have yet again been faced with a numbing repetition of the all-too-familiar appropriations end game. Annual appropriations have been stalled because of a handful of controversial policy and funding issues. 
   While the vast bulk of appropriations are routine and are funded from year to year with only incremental change, they nonetheless are held hostage to these controversial and often unrelated budget and policy debates. This is unnecessary and counterproductive. 
   A biennial budget process would restore the integrity and effectiveness of the appropriations process, would reinvigorate the tradition of separate Congressional authorization and oversight, and would give Federal departments and agencies badly needed time to carry out and evaluate Federal programs more effectively. 
   Many Senators of both parties have long acknowledged the need for a biennial budget process. A majority of House members now concurs. Both President Clinton and Vice-President GORE support biennial budgeting, and recently Governor George W. Bush voice strong support for the idea. 
   All sides now agree that biennial budgeting is the right thing to do. Now is time to go forward. We have studied, talked, and debated enough. Let's now resolve to act on this important bill as soon as possible when we return from the congressional adjournment.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and honor that I rise today to introduce a bill to create a National Veterans Cemetery in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
   The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces have made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and liberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The service of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and the sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be forgotten. 
   These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be buried at a National Cemetery with their fellow comrades. However, the Santa Fe National Cemetery, which serves the Northern two thirds of New Mexico, is rapidly approaching maximum capacity. 
   Unfortunately, even though the Senate has already passed my legislation to extend the useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery by authorizing the use of flat grave markers the life of the Cemetery will only be extended to 2008. Consequently, I would submit that it is not too soon to being planning or the day when Santa Fe will no longer be available. 
   Before I continue, I would like to take a moment to talk about the Santa Fe National Cemetery. I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National Cemetery that has grow from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. 
   The cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was designated a National Cemetery in April of 1875. Men and women who have fought in all of nation's wars hold an honored spot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. 
   With that said, I believe now is the right time to begin looking for another  suitable site to serve as the last resting place for those New Mexico veterans who gave of themselves to protect the American ideals of liberty and freedom. The need to begin planning becomes even more pressing by virtue of the fact that more than half of New Mexico's 180,000 veterans live in the Albuquerque/Santa Fe area and internments are expected to peak in 2008. 
   Consequently, I am introducing legislation today to create a National Veterans Cemetery in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I also want to compliment Congresswoman Heather Wilson who offered this far-sighted legislation in the House of Representatives last week with the knowledge that there is only a finite amount of space available over the long term at the existing national cemetery in Santa Fe. 
   The Bill simply directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery in the Albuquerque metropolitan area and to submit a report to Congress setting forth a schedule for establishing the cemetery.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator BINGAMAN in introducing legislation authorizing the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study regarding water supply on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation in New Mexico. There are major deficiencies with regard to safe water supplies for residents of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, since the federally owned municipal water system is severely dilapidated. 
   The United States has a trust responsibility to ensure that adequate and safe water supplies are available to meet the economic, environmental, water supply, and public health needs of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation . Today, the House of Representatives passed identical legislation to help resolve this problem. 
   The Jicarilla Apache Tribe is a federally recognized Indian nation in northern New Mexico, with over 3,000 citizens. In the 1920s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) constructed a water delivery system to serve federal facilities on the Reservation. In the 1960s, the system was extended to serve tribal facilities and members, but for the last 20 years this federal owned and operated water system has been deteriorating due to inadequate federal funding for regular maintenance and improvements. 
   No capital improvements have been made to the system for at least ten years. Currently, the system is not in compliance with Federal safe drinking water standards or pollutant discharge standards. 
   In October of 1988, the inlet system collapsed and caused a devastating five-day water outage on the Reservation. That catastrophe required emergency assistance from the National Guard. A home burned to the ground without necessary water to fight the fire. After that experience, the Tribe expended its own funds to make some repairs, and began a large-scale evaluation of the system. The Tribe has discovered serious problems with the system. 
   Line breaks are common and frequent, and existing supply facilities are near or at maximum capacity. The Jicarilla Apaches have had to ration water for the last seven summers. 
   According to a recent EPA report, the water system on the Jicarilla Reservation is the third worst system operating in a six-state region. In addition to being out of compliance with federal drinking water standards, the sewage plant has been operating without a federal discharge permit, exposing the BIA to fines up to $25,000 per day. 
   Sewage lagoons are operating at 200% capacity, and wastewater spillage threatens not only the Jicarilla Apaches, but down-stream communities in New Mexico and beyond. The Jicarilla Apache Tribal Council has enacted a resolution declaring a state of emergency due to the continued operation of these unsafe water systems. 
   The Tribe has been forced to expend their own funds due to the serious health threats posed by the unsafe system. In addition to the severe health threats that these systems pose, their inadequate and unsafe condition has virtually suspended social and economic development on the Reservation. 
   The water deficiencies have forced the Tribe to place a moratorium on new projects, including housing, school, senior center, post office, and health care facility construction. These projects cannot be completed, even though many are already funded, because the existing infrastructure cannot support any further development. While the federal government is entirely responsible to maintain and operate the federal water systems which serve the Reservation, the BIA lacks the resources improve the system. 
   The water system on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation is one of only two or three such systems still being maintained by the BIA. The BIA does not even own equipment necessary for routine sewer cleaning. While the BIA has continued federal responsibility for these systems, BIA no longer budgets for water delivery systems. 
   In fact, Kevin Gover of the BIA referred the Tribe to the Bureau of Reclamation for assistance. The Bureau of Reclamation has the needed expertise to help, having experience in providing water to Native Americans through irrigation projects, as well as providing water supplies to other rural communities. 
   The Tribe wants to eventually own and operate the water system, and wishes to enter into a relationship with the Bureau of Reclamation for completion of rehabilitation of this project. This legislation will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study to determine the best method for developing a safe and adequate municipal, rural, and industrial water supply for the residents of the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation in the State of New Mexico.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the selfless men and women who have sacrificed so much in order to secure and protect the freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today. Volunteering one's body and mind without thought of consequence in order to safeguard the ideologies our country holds dear, is the utmost act of patriotism. Today we recognize the importance of the hardships endured by our Nation's veterans to preserve peace and freedom. 
   As a Senator from New Mexico, I take great pride in the fact that New Mexico has among the top ten highest per capita military retiree populations in the Nation and honor the prominent contributions they have made towards the preservation of our great Nation.  
   During World War II, members of the 200th and 515th Coast Artillery, better known as the New Mexico Brigade, repelled Japanese attacks for 4 months before being overwhelmed by disease and starvation. Following the ensuing capture, the survivors of the battle were subjected to an 85-mile ``Death March.'' These men were then held for more than 40 months in Japanese prisoner of war camps. Of the 1,800 men in the New Mexico Brigade, less than 900 returned home and a third of those who did died within a year of returning to the U.S. The bravery exhibited by the New Mexico Brigade is characteristic of the men and women that comprise our Armed Forces. 
   As a nation, we have an obligation to provide for those who have risked everything to the benefit of all. I am pleased that this session of Congress has produced legislation which will increase funding for veterans health care by $1.7 billion to a total of $19.6 billion for fiscal year 2000. However, we need to remain vigilant in our commitment to provide for those who are charged with the considerable task of defending this country from potential adversaries. 
   Today I would like to pay tribute to our veterans and I am sure that my colleagues will join me in honoring these valorous men and women for their dedicated service to our great Nation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the truth of the matter is if schools want the new teachers, under the proposal of the distinguished chairman who just took to the floor to explain the obstinacy of the President, they can have the money for teachers. That is what he is saying. It is up to them. If they want all the money that comes from this appropriation used for teachers, they can have it. If they say, we don't need them, we don't want them, he is saying there is a second priority. 
   Frankly, I think that is excellent policy with reference to the schools of our country. I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania makes a good point. For the President to continue to say we are not going to get this bill unless we do it exactly his way leaves us with no alternative. We have some prerogatives, too. The fact is, if you read the Constitution, he doesn't appropriate; the Congress does. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts that I can yell as loud as he. But today I won't do that because I believe we have a great bill and a great position. 
   The Republicans do support the minimum wage. In fact, they are going to vote for the minimum wage that I propose. That is, instead of a dollar coming in two installments, it will come in three, of 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents. Frankly, there will be an overwhelming vote in favor of that. 
   In addition, we took the opportunity to give small business and some other absolutely necessary situations that need it tax relief. We chose in this bill to do that. Those have been explained fairly well. I will take a minute at the end of my remarks to explain them one more time. 
   I suggest that the Democrats are living in an era that has passed. 
   If they were here on the floor in the 1930s, they would have a case. They would have a case that the minimum wage is going to affect poor families supporting their children. That was the issue in the 1930s. But I suggest the best research today says that day is gone in terms of who is impacted by the minimum wage. It is more likely to impact a teenager than it is the head of a household. The fact is, 55 percent of the minimum wage applies to people between the ages of 16 and 24. The overwhelming number of those are teenagers in part-time jobs, working in McDonald's-type restaurants across America. They need these jobs. They don't even stay in the minimum-wage position very long, according to the research we have seen. If they work well and choose to follow the rules and the orders and do an excellent job, they are raised above the minimum wage rather quickly. 
   To put it another way, to show that the arguments about who benefits from the minimum wage are passe 1930 arguments, two-thirds of all minimum-wage people are part-time employees. The fact is, the argument that these are women heads of households is absolutely dispelled by reality. The best we can find out is that 8 percent of the minimum-wage employees in America today are women heads of households, not the numbers or the tenor and tone of the argument about the slap of the hand we are giving to those who work in America. Quite the contrary. 
   Our minimum wage reflects a sufficient increase to match up with inflation, and we permit many people an opportunity to get into the job market. In fact, we make permanent one of the best taxes we have, which is now there on an interim basis. It says if you hire minimum-wage workers out of the welfare system, and you want to take a chance because they aren't capable of doing the jobs and you need to train them, you get a credit for that. That is a very good part of the Tax Code. We make that permanent so it costs something and it uses up some of our tax money. 
   As to the argument of how big this tax cut is, it is 12.5 percent of the total tax package that the Republicans offered, which passed here and the President vetoed. It tries something very new and exciting. It says to Americans who want to buy their own insurance--because their employers don't furnish it--for the first time, they are going to be permitted to deduct the entirety of their health insurance. Heretofore, they were punished if they tried to buy it, penalized because they didn't get to deduct it while everybody else did. We also made permanent the allowance that the self-employed can take the insurance deduction. We raise that to 100 percent. Everybody knows that is good. Everybody knows that helps with the problem of the uninsured in America, and that is good. 
   So, for all the talk, the Republicans have come forward with a very good bill. I am very pleased that I suggested to the Republicans the basics of this bill, that we ought to do it in three installments. Some wanted to make it longer. Actually, I think this is exactly the right length of time. Add to that the kind of tax relief we have provided versus the tax increases on that side, and it seems to me there is no choice. 
   While everybody is clamoring to do something about the estate tax because it is a very onerous tax, as if to try to punish people, in a minimum-wage bill they raise death taxes and inheritance taxes. I don't care what kind of American they impose it on. We don't have to do that when we are reforming that system because it is somewhat confiscatory. I could go on, but if anybody has any doubt, the gross tax increase under the Democrat package is $12.5 billion over 5 years, and a $28.9 billion tax increase over 10 years. What in the world are we increasing taxes for at this point? To pay for a minimum-wage bill? Of course not. It is because they want other tax relief and they choose to raise taxes to give the benefit to someone else. There is sufficient surplus. This is a very small tax cut in our package--12.5 percent of what we perceived was adequate and what we could do about 4 months ago with the surpluses we have. The President proposed $250 billion, $300 billion in tax relief. In this bill, they raise taxes rather than take advantage of what we know is the right thing; that is, to reduce taxes in these economic times. 
   I reserve my remaining time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator KENNEDY for a good debate. It was pretty exciting for so early in the morning. The Senator is pretty energetic even at 9 o'clock. 
   However, let me close by saying our amendment saves small business and gives them an opportunity to grow and prosper and energize this economy; at the same time, it gives every opportunity for the young people in our country to get into jobs wherein they break into the marketplace, that first-level job, and get those kinds of jobs in sufficient numbers to be helpful for whatever they are doing. There are even high school students doing this. They are 50 percent of the minimum-wage people in this country. 
   I have nothing against them. I have eight children; six of them worked in restaurants before they went to college and saved enough money because I didn't have enough money to put them through, having that many children. I understand that. They worked hard. They got promoted. 
   Nothing could be further from the truth that we are trying to hurt young people, whatever their status. We want them and their employers to continue to have a mutual opportunity--mutual for the small business to energize the economy and mutual for job opportunity at the first level of employment in the American system. 
   If Members are speaking of women heads of households, they are not talking about the minimum wage today; they are talking about the minimum wage 30 years ago. Eight percent of the minimum-wage earners in America today are women with full-time jobs--not 30, 40, or 50; 8 percent. 
   Clearly, we are trying to give everybody an opportunity to get better training and move ahead in job opportunities in the United States. 
   I move to table the Kennedy amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Republican bill does the following: It raises the minimum wage $1 in three installments instead of two. It gives great opportunity to small businesspeople and others who have been denied relief under the Tax Code of this country. 
   Let me explain so everybody will understand the basic ones we try to help in this bill. One, we help workers pay for health care. For the first time in history, workers in the United States, many who work for small businesses, can buy their own health insurance and deduct every penny of it. Heretofore, they could not do that. We have a 100 percent self-employed health insurance deduction. That should have been the case 10 years ago. We finally have it in this bill. 
   We made permanent the work opportunity tax credit, which is to help employers, mostly small businesses, hire those who cannot get jobs, and they get a credit for it. We made that permanent. That is good for America since we have reduced the number of welfare recipients in America by 48 percent; and we need to make permanent the incentive to hire them. 
   We have reduced the Federal unemployment surtax. As I said, we have made permanent that work opportunity tax credit I just told you about. 
   In addition, there is no question that the Democrats decided to raise taxes to pay for their wage increases. So they raise taxes almost $13 billion in the first 5 years, which is not necessary with the kind of surpluses that we have. We have used merely 12.5 percent of the tax cuts we had proposed 5 months ago. So 12.5 percent of them are in this bill. 
   This is the right thing to do. 
   Let me close by telling you, 55 percent of the minimum wage earners in America are young people; two-thirds are part-time workers; and 8 percent are women who are heads of households working full time. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in Northern New Mexico there is a truly unique working ranch on an historic Mexican land grant known as Baca Location No. 1. The ranch is currently owned and managed by the Baca Land and Cattle Company, and it comprises most of a collapsed, extinct volcano known as the Valles Caldera. The Valles Caldera is a beautiful place with rolling meadows, crystal-clear streams, roaming elk, and vast stands of Ponderosa pines. I am very proud to announce we are introducing legislation today that will authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire this property which is a truly unique 95,000 acre working ranch in New Mexico. 
   For Senator BINGAMAN and I, and a few others working on this issue, this is a not-so-instant replay from last year. Last year around this time, Senator BINGAMAN and I announced that we had reached agreement with the President on a comprehensive plan to acquire the Baca Ranch and, at the same time, to provide for disposal of designated surplus land from the Federal inventory. Those two concepts, embodied in Titles I and II of last year's bill, have survived in this new bill. 
   Title I provides for an innovative trust structure to manage this ranch, when it is purchased by the Federal Government. Title II provides a process for compensating citizens who await Federal payment for land trapped within vast areas of Federal land, so-called ``inholders'', and the orderly disposal of Federal land that has already been declared surplus by the Federal Government. 
   As you may recall, Senator BINGAMAN began this process with his purchase bill in 1997. The process of purchasing the Baca Ranch for the public was jump-started last summer when President Clinton and I, flying on Air Force One to Washington, reached an agreement on the concept of an innovative trust arrangement to manage the Baca, if it were to become part of Federal land holdings. The President's response led to a number of rounds of negotiations between representatives of the Administration and our offices. 
   Finally, after literally thousands of hours of discussion at all levels, agreement was reached, we introduced the bill and a similar one was introduced in the House of Representatives. And, in what I frankly admit was almost miraculous, we were able to persuade Congress to provide $40 million in last year's appropriations process as earnest money for any Baca Ranch purchase that might be authorized by Congress. 
   Then, unexpected disaster struck. The owners of the Baca Ranch decided not to sell the land after all. I said to many of you then that I thought the purchase was dead. 
   However, like Lazarus the Baca Ranch purchase lives again. I must thank Senator BINGAMAN for his leadership in this matter, Congresswoman WILSON for her extremely effective work behind the scenes in the House to promote the purchase, and the new Congressman from Santa Fe, Mr. UDALL, for his support. And, I must thank the Administration for its commitment. 
   This kind of cooperation has brought us to this day of good news. Today, Senator BINGAMAN and I again introduce a bill to authorize both the purchase of the Baca Ranch by the federal government and the orderly disposal of surplus lands in order to pay for debts the government owes to ``inholders.'' I understand that Representatives WILSON and UDALL will introduce companion legislation in the House. 
   Now, let's talk for a moment about the $l0l million price tag the Baca Ranch purchase carries. The $40 million that we won last year from the Appropriations process had been spent. The President didn't ask for it in his budget, logically, since he thought the ranch was no longer for sale. And, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate failed to appropriate the $40 million for the same reason--it seemed that the purchase was dead. 
   However, the President recently announced a $101 million purchase agreement between the federal government and the Dunigan family, the current owners of the Baca Ranch. Quickly, we jumped to action, and in October, the New Mexico delegation succeeded in restoring the $40 million originally approved last year for the purchase. As a member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I have been involved in talks between congressional negotiators and the White House over several issues in the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. Those talks have led to a tentative agreement to provide an additional $61 million, on top of the $40 million restored in October, for the Baca Ranch purchase. If the $101 million appropriation becomes law, its release would be subject to congressional authorization of the land acquisition, as well as a review of the ranch appraisal by the Comptroller General of the United States. 
   This is a terrific development and could very well help in moving this authorizing legislation through Congress next year. The drive to bring this beautiful ranch into public 
   ownership has helped gain this funding. As important as the money, however, is retaining the dual nature of this legislation. This bill contains two major titles: one to authorize purchase of the Baca Ranch, which draws most of the headlines; and the other to begin a major reform in federal land management. The President has signed onto both; we have signed onto both. Both Titles must eventually become law in order for the Baca Ranch purchase to proceed. 
   I have visited the Baca Ranch, and I can tell you that it is one beautiful piece of property. The Valles Caldera is one of the world's largest resurgent lava domes. The depression from a huge volcanic eruption over a million years ago is more than a half-mile deep and fifteen miles across at its widest point. The land was originally granted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca under a settlement enacted by Congress in 1860. Since that time, the property has remained virtually intact as a single, large, tract of land. 
   The careful husbandry of the Ranch by the Dunigan family provides a model for sustainable land development and use. The Ranch's natural beauty and abundant resources, and its proximity to large municipal populations could provide numerous recreational opportunities for hiking, fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting. The Baca is a unique working ranch. It is not a wilderness area, and can best be protected for future generations by continuing its operation as a working asset through a unique management structure. This legislation provides that unique management under a trust that may allow for its eventual operation to become financially self-sustaining. 
   Mr. President, because of the ranch's unique character, I am not interested in having it managed under the usual federal authorities, as is typical of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, or the National Park Service. Under the current state of affairs on our public lands, Forest Service and BLM management is constantly hounded by litigation initiated by some of the same groups that wish to bring this ranch into government ownership. The Valles Caldera National Preserve will serve as a model to explore alternative means of federal management and will provide the American people with opportunities to enjoy the Valles Caldera and its many resources. 
   The unique nature of the Valles Caldera, and its resources, requires a unique management program, dedicated to appropriate development and preservation under the principle of the highest and best use of the Ranch in the interest of the public. Title I of this legislation provides the framework necessary to fulfil that objective. It authorizes the acquisition of the Baca Ranch by the Forest Service. At the same time, it establishes a government-owned corporation, called the Valles Caldera Trust, whose sole responsibility is to ensure that the ranch is managed in a manner that will preserve its current unique character, and provide enumerable opportunities for the American people to enjoy its splendor. Most importantly to me, however, the legislation will allow for the ranch's continued operation as a working asset for the people of north-central New Mexico, without further drawing on the thinly-stretched resources of the federal land management agencies.  
   I would like to emphasize that both portions of this bill are milestones in federal land management. This legislation independently addresses the acquisition of this unique property for public use and enjoyment, while solving current land management problems related to surplus land disposal and the acquisition of inholdings from owners who truly want to sell their land. 
   Currently, approximately one-third of New Mexico's land is in federal ownership or under federal management. These public lands are an important resource that require our most thoughtful management. In order to better conserve existing national treasures for future use and enjoyment, we have devised a good plan to dispose of surplus land through sale or exchange into private, State, or local government ownership. 
   In many cases, it is just too costly to keep this unneeded land under federal ownership, and it can be more effectively managed in other hands. Title II of this bill, the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, calls for the orderly disposition of surplus federal property on a state by state basis, and provides land managers with needed tools to address the problem created by ``inholdings'' within federally managed areas. There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately owned land trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management units, including national parks, national forests, national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. 
   In other cases, however, landowners who want out have been waiting generations for the Federal Government to set aside funding and get around to acquiring their property. This legislation directs the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to reach out to those property owners who want to sell their land. It also instructs the Departments to establish a priority for the acquisition of these inholdings based, in part, on how long the owner has been waiting to sell. 
   An issue related to the problem created by inholdings is the abundance of public domain land which the Bureau of Land Management has determined it no longer needs to fulfill its mission. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the BLM has identified an estimated 4 to 6 million acres of public domain lands for disposal. 
   Let me simply clarify that point--the BLM already has authority under an existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell lands out of Federal ownership. Through its public process for land use planning, when the agency has determined that certain lands would be more useful to the public under private or local governmental control, it is already authorized to dispose of these lands, either by sale or exchange. 
   The sale or exchange of this land would be beneficial to local communities, adjoining land owners, and federal land mangers, alike. 
   An orderly process for the efficient sale or exchange of land identified for disposal does not currently exist. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act addresses this problem by providing that a portion of the proceeds generated from the sale of these lands will be used to fulfill all legal requirements for the transfer of these lands out of Federal ownership. The majority of the proceeds generated would be used to acquire inholdings from those who want to sell their land. 
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will schedule hearings to address the many issues regarding Federal purchase of the Baca Ranch in the near future. Congress has tried to resolve the difficult challenges in acquiring this property before, and failed; cooperation among the parties may bring success this time around. I want to thank everyone who has helped in this 18-month-long effort. I believe that in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the American people that we truly have accomplished two great and innovative things with this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I am confident that if we get an Interior appropriations bill, the money will be in it. Everyone should know that it is subject to two conditions: A full authorization bill being passed and signed and subject to the General Accounting Office reviewing the procedures for the appraisal of the property and assuring the Congress of what they have done, in a sense with the expertise that is consistent with what must be used in order to satisfy Congress that there is a fair purchase price involved in the agreement. 
   I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   I am very pleased to introduce a minimum wage amendment on behalf of myself and many other Senators. With reference to the minimum wage, this coming January under the amendment Senator KENNEDY introduced, minimum wage goes up 50 cents; 12 months  later it goes up 50 cents again. Under the proposal which I offer today, it will go up 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents each March 1. It is also a $1 increase in minimum wage. It takes 12 months longer, so this will be completed in 2002. At that point, it will be $6.15. 
   I think Senator NICKLES made a point. If the economy, or if training people for jobs, or if employers being able to pay for the services employees render, if none of that was relevant, then everyone would like a minimum wage bill that might be higher than either of these two. That is what we would wish for everyone. 
   Up front, I remind everyone the best economic advice we have is 50 percent of the minimum-wage jobs affected have to do with teenagers. Half of the minimum-wage jobs we are talking about are the young men and women who are working while they are attending school--afterschool and in the summer months--at either the McDonald's drive-ins or various places across America. 
   It seems to this Senator, a minimum wage that applies to 50 percent of the minimum-wage earners in America, who are students, and that goes up 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents, respectively, over the next 26 months, since it far exceeds inflation, it is good for the teenagers of America, good for those who hire them, and an excellent way to make sure that portion of the American population in their first entry jobs in our marketplace-oriented economy get a chance to earn that money, to learn what it is to work, and at the same time make that large group of young American men and women a part of the marketplace. 
   If we make it too high, businesses won't be hiring them and they will be looking to others to fill the jobs. We still need in America a place for people to start. 
   If we had a minimum wage bill and that is all we did, knowing what we know about welfare reform, we would not have a very good bill. The work opportunity credit, where employers give welfare men and women a job, is now a temporary work incentive credit; we make that permanent. That means as we have reduced the assistance for welfare in the United States by 48 percent, down to 2.7 million people, we want the employees of America to make a living wage. We want them to have a chance, but we also want to encourage them to be hired, even if there is some additional training and some skills that have to be added along the way. 
   We are increasing opportunities for the young people, and we are increasing many of the welfare-related jobs with this additional minimum wage we are adding. Many in this body worked hard on the work opportunity credit. I can recall back in the 1970s when I first came here, we started that as a work incentive program for the disadvantaged, disabled, and others by giving a tax credit. It was highly abused later. People wanted to get rid of it, but the idea remained to give American small business an opportunity to hire people who may need a little extra help, a little more guidance, a little more skill and training. We give them credit for that. We have done that. 
   We have two provisions in this amendment directed at health care. One of them is a very dramatic change from the way we have treated health care in the past. It is not going to cost very much because we are not so sure how many people will understand it. We are going to say to American men and women if they are not getting health insurance on their job, we give them an opportunity to buy their own health insurance and they can deduct every single penny of their health insurance from their pay before paying income tax. 
   Heretofore, we were letting them pool those expenses along 
   with other health care costs and if that exceeded 7.5 percent of the income, they could deduct it. There are many people who work for small businesses and others would don't furnish insurance, and perhaps they could buy their own insurance. But right now, they don't get to deduct the premiums. We add that to the basket of opportunities for health insurance. 
   Then, there are the independent employees who work essentially for themselves. Under this bill, we finally make the health care costs 100 percent deductible. I think health insurance deduction is very important for the self-employed. 
   We increase the small business expensing, which means there are certain items they can deduct, up to $30,000 under this new law in the year of the expanse rather than having to charge it off over time, which is desired by small business that will bear the brunt of this added minimum wage. 
   We reduce the unemployment surtax, and we make permanent the work opportunity tax credit. A number of pension plans are reformed in this legislation so that more of the small businesses in this country will be able to take maximum advantage of their employees creating pension plans under the auspices of their employer as we currently have them in numerable places in the Tax Code. 
   We can talk about how this affects our individual States. I will have for the record how the Domenici plan will affect New Mexicans on the tax side once we have it figured out, as well as on the minimum wage side. 
   In summary, we will increase the minimum wage in the Domenici amendment--which the occupant of the Chair is a cosponsor, and I thank him for that--increase it $1, but it will take 12 additional months before we get to that. It will be 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents. Senator KENNEDY does it in two installments. Senators have to decide which best fits the needs of our country. 
   If we were wishing and hoping, we would pay everybody a lot more. I repeat, half of the minimum wage earners in America are young people who are in part-time jobs, such as afterschool and summer jobs. 
   We believe the 3-year installment increase, which far exceeds inflation annually as it applies to the current minimum wage, is probably good for the teenagers of our country, good to keep them employed, get them that entrance job and not have so many owners looking around for other employees who have more experience, which they will if we make the minimum wage too high. 
   In addition, many of those getting off welfare--and we know there are thousands--they need some training and some extra skills preparation and the like. We are hoping they will get jobs. We are increasing their take-home pay so they can, indeed, have a better chance of succeeding off the rolls and move up the employment chain and get better and better jobs. The other things I mentioned in the health care field will be welcomed by millions of Americans, and in particular millions, millions of self-employed business men and women across America. 
   With that, I know there are others who would like to speak, if not tonight, we obviously will share time with them tomorrow. 
   I yield the floor.

As a matter of fact, I do not believe he would. We have not only the minimum wage, but these are the right kinds of tax cuts to go along with it, and they are very desirable for the American economy right now.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I note Senator LANDRIEU is here from Louisiana. I won't take that much time, and I will yield back the remainder so she may proceed in morning business, if that is her desire. 
   Let me just say, it is absolutely amazing that some group proposes that the minimum wage should be increased because the poor families in America, who are out there working at jobs, are the ones it will help, only to find that every study reveals that isn't the case. 
   I am going to talk a minute about CNN. They proceeded with a very intense analysis of their own, and they have been running it on television. It is sort of shocking to hear what they find versus what we are hearing in justification of a $1 increase in the minimum wage in the next 13 months-14 months. 
   First, let me start and read the dialog that occurred on CNN with reference to their research and who is helped and not helped by the minimum wage:  
   Highlight: Next week, Congress will be raising the minimum wage by $1 to $6.15, which could benefit perhaps 10 million low-wage workers. A look at who a minimum wage increase would benefit. Body of the report: Jim Moret, anchor. There were fewer Americans out of work last month. The jobless rate dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest it has been in 3 decades. Also in the Labor Department's report, average hourly earnings rose by only 1 penny last month to $13.37. That is the average per hour. Next week, Congress considers a minmimum wage of $1 which could benefit perhaps those 10 million low-wage workers. 
   But who are they?  
   Our Brooks Jackson has some answers that may surprise you.  
   He says:  
   Who would be helped if the minimum wage went up to $6.15 cents?  
   The answer is:  
   Not these workers.  
   The ones they have been talking about.  
   Bob Seidner, owner, Classic Auto Salon: I wouldn't even consider paying somebody that level, because we're not going to get the level of employee. 
   Jackson: In today's hot job market, Bob Seidner says he has to pay $8 an hour to get an experienced car washer in Maryland. And in his Atlanta restaurant, nobody stays at the minimum wage for long.  
   They all move up rather rapidly.  
   Greg Vojnovic, Restaurant owner: If you look at the economy today, there is so much pressure on the labor marketplace that you can't pay anybody a minimum wage for any period of time. Our typical dishwasher, who is typically the lowest position, is making [more than the minimum wage today. In fact, he is making] $7 an hour. 
   Jackson: So who would be helped? Experts say fewer than one worker out of every ten, most of them part-time workers, and mostly not in poverty.  
   Let me repeat that:  
   So who would be helped? One out of every ten, and most of them are part-time workers and mostly not in poverty.  
   I am going to jump away from this for a minute and say, who do you think those part-time workers are? They are the teenagers of America who are working in restaurants, drive-ins, and all the kinds of places where they want to get jobs to learn how to work. Let's be honest about it; it would be nice if we could give them a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage in January and 50 cents the next year. But let's also be honest that they are not the poverty people of America; they are teenagers breaking in at their new job. And it is most interesting, for these comments and others that I have read say that even they are getting paid more than the minimum wage these days.  
   Teenagers like Sara Schroff, a 19-year-old student making $5.15, but only the start. She'll be promoted in a week. 
   Even McDonald's offers more than the minimum wage.  
   Says another who has looked out in the job market.  
   In fact, teenagers make up 28 percent of those who would gain, and only 23 percent of the gainers are the main earners in their families. 
   Opponents say there's still a good reason to raise the minimum wage.  
   And the Economic Policy Institute says:  
   It's true that while the increase is not perfectly targeted, most of the benefits do go to lower-income working families. Fifty percent of the benefits, of the gains from this next increase, will go to families whose income is $25,000 or less; that's lower middle income....... 
   Those working poor households would get only 17 percent of the gain from raising the minimum wage.  
   Frankly, we have heard all kinds of numbers on how many minimum-wage people we have in America. I am just going to be 
   rebutting their comments for a moment, and then I will tell Americans about our bill. 
   To get to the 10 million they are bantering around here on the floor, let me tell you where that comes from. Minimum-wage earners are 1.6 million of this 10 million that is being bantered around. Workers making between the present minimum wage and the new wage of $6.15, under these amendments, are 5.9 million. Workers making less than the minimum wage and who are not going to be affected by the minimum wage because they are tip people, or the like, are 2.7. 
   So, in summary, 1.6 million are really minimum-wage earners working under the minimum wage as a means of recompense for an hour's work. Nonetheless, we have an amendment that I believe is far superior to the Democrat amendment. I am very pleased to have been part of putting it together. We want to raise the minimum wage to keep steadily ahead of inflation, and it will be raised 30 cents in January, 35 cents the following January, and 30 cents the following--$1 in a period of 26 months instead of a period of 14 months. 
   In addition, very simply put, we change some provisions in the tax law, which I now hear we should not do because it cuts taxes. Well, does anyone seriously believe that with the kind of surpluses we have projected in the United States, we are not going to give the taxpayers back some of that money? I can say, with surpluses that are approaching $3.4 trillion, does anybody believe there is a better time to give the American people a tax reduction, give them back some of their money? If we can't do that now, I ask you, when can we? These are the largest deficit, largest surpluses we could have predicted in the best of times. 
   The budget is under control. It is growing at the lowest rate in all categories in the past 40 years on an annual basis. We take some credit for that. The President deserves some credit for that. But that is success. That is building a surplus. In the last year, we have not spent one penny of the Social Security trust fund money--in the year that just passed. The Congressional Budget Office says, as a matter of fact, we have a surplus of a billion dollars. That has not occurred in 40 years. We want to say to the Social Security trust fund, you keep all that is yours. That is about $2 trillion. What do we do with the other $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion? Do we leave it around here so we can spend it? 
   Does anybody doubt, if we don't make appropriate tax cuts, or tax reductions, that it won't be spent? We  have already heard that the worst thing to do with the surplus is to spend it. The best economic advisers that our country has say the worst thing you can do is spend it. So we have, in the first 5 years, $18.5 billion in tax relief, mostly for small businesses so they can continue to be the driving force behind America's growth. 
   I am going to just quickly, in a moment, tick off three or four of those tax proposals that I think are very good. Somebody said this is a waste of effort because if the Republican package passes--and I hope it does because I think it is a very good package--the President will just veto it. Well, I am not too sure of that. Let me make sure the Senate understands that the tax package included in this Domenici, et al., proposal is 12.5 percent of the tax package we passed some months ago. It is 12.5 percent--not 50 percent of it, not 75, but 12.5. If you can't get that through, what can you get through? I believe the President would sign it in a minute because it does the kinds of things that even he has talked about as being necessary for American business to retain its energizing effect and its competitive qualities. 
   For a moment, let's quickly go through the amendments we have attached and put in the tax amendments in this package. 
   One: For the first time, we really help workers in America pay for health care insurance. Heretofore, if a worker bought his own insurance, he could not deduct it. He would have to put it in a large pot called health expenditures. 
   Only if it exceeds 7.5 of his income could it be included in the deduction. We have said let's try this out. Let's see what would happen if workers who buy their own health insurance--for whatever reason--deducted the whole thing the same as a company today deducts the whole thing under an exclusionary rule that we have established by precedent around here, and then we made it part of the rule of law. That is in there. 
   Self-employed men and women have had a raw deal on health insurance. Everybody in this Chamber knows it. If we have a surplus, we ought to make that right. Let self-employed Americans deduct 100 percent of their insurance costs--not some percentage. That is built in with a rather rapid curve where they will be able to deduct the full amount. 
   This is a work opportunity tax credit. Almost everybody in this Senate wanted that when we put it in before and made it temporary. It runs along with welfare reform. We have reduced welfare by 48 percent, and we cry out to business to hire welfare trainees. Yet the credit they get for doing that is temporary. We want to make it permanent. So a welfare trainee is more apt to get a job if the employer can get some incentives up front while they are training them and helping them. 
   Who can be against that? Will the President veto that? I can't believe it. 
   There is an item where small business can do an expensing of certain capital improvements. But we have a limit on it. Otherwise they have to depreciate it over time. We have increased that to $30,000 a year. It will be marvelous for small business to deduct those kinds of expenses that are encapsulated in that amendment. It will make their businesses grow and prosper. There are two or three others that go with this. 
   But essentially, I believe when you put that package together you are saying there will be fewer minimum-wage workers in the future, small business will have a chance to profit more, and they will pay higher wages because the marketplace will force them to. In the meantime, we also increase minimum wage by $1. We just take 12 months longer to do it. 
   I believe it is a good package. I hope the Senate passes it tomorrow. We will have a few more minutes of debate tomorrow before the vote. In the meantime, I hope everyone looks at the package in their offices and will get briefed on it because it is a very good package. I not only yield the floor, but I yield back any time that I had on my amendment.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I wish to say I wasn't present in the discussion about clean air and the ambient air standards, as they might pertain to nuclear power in America and what might happen to the nuclear power we have, the powerplants, and what might happen in the future. But I know, even without being here, that it was a very enlightened discussion about the fact that if you are looking for a cleaner world and for the ambient air of the world and in America in the future, to sustain economic growth, for it to be clean and livable, anybody who leaves nuclear power off the map and doesn't even talk about it is absolutely missing the greatest opportunity we have to accomplish what all of those who want clean air set out to do. In fact, I think the Senator shares this observation with me. The Kyoto agreement, with all of its preamble work--the whereases--was totally void of a reference to nuclear power.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I discussed that report with one of the most eminent physicists in the world. What he said to me was: I looked from cover to cover, and since I could not find one word on nuclear power, I put the report down and said it cannot be one that is really objective and realistic. 
   Now, that is better than I can say it. I think that is what the Senator has been saying and what my friend from Alabama, who has regularly talked with me about nuclear power and clean air, has said. It is amazing, if we can just come to the floor and talk about the other sources of energy and what they have done to human life in terms of deaths in mining, the deaths on the trains that have carried coal, and all of the other things related to producing energy that we use willfully and without great concern about the danger and the risks, and then put that up alongside nuclear power from its origin, it will look like a big giant heap of coal versus a little tiny package of salt over here that will represent the harm we have caused to people and the environment with nuclear power. They are not even in the same league in terms of damage to people, deaths to people, and the like. It has been a very safe industry, and in the United States, it has been truly miraculous that with this kind of engineering we have had two accidents and neither were fatal.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I came down to make a few remarks about a bill that is in conference, a subject matter we have been talking about for some time, and that is the Balanced Budget Act and what kind of impact it had on skilled nursing homes, on rural hospitals, and other parts of the entire health delivery network in the United States. While I won't take very long today, I do come because I think it is very urgent to the conferees on what we have been calling a ``Medicare replenishment'' bill--a bill that goes back and says let's make a few adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act as that Budget Act sought to restrain the cost of health care in three, four, or five areas. 
   Particularly, I want to talk about the House and Senate and the ultimate compromise on the legislation to increase payments for the nursing home patients and proprietors and owners of skilled nursing homes and that industry. In fact, the problems in the nursing home industry are as severe, if not more severe, than in any other part of the health care system in the United States. To talk about hospitals as if they are more important than skilled nursing homes, and that we should worry more about hospitals and less about skilled nursing homes, is not to address the issue properly, for there are literally hundreds of thousands of Americans, men and women, predominantly women, in the skilled nursing homes across this land. Some are Ma and Pa owners of one or two units; some are corporately owned, where hundreds of these particular skilled nursing home facilities are owned by a company. 
   A couple of weeks ago, a very large nursing home company with headquarters in my home State filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That was a second nursing home chain to file for bankruptcy protection in the last 2 months. These two nursing home chains own hundreds of facilities all over the country. So every Senator  should be concerned about what is happening to this industry and to these facilities and their ability to care for our senior citizens. 
   The Senate Finance Committee, which got input from many Senators and many parts of America's health delivery system, reported out a very good bill in the area of skilled nursing homes and, likewise, in the other delivery components of American health care. In it, there are two provisions which are particularly important. First, it provides, over the next 3 years, for $1.4 billion in higher payment rates for skilled nursing facilities. These increases are targeted at what everyone agrees is the problem--that current rates do not cover the high costs of medically complex cases. In other words, skilled nursing homes and the population of these homes have changed rather dramatically in the last 15 years, and there are more and more very sick people in the skilled nursing home facilities, and we call these medically complex cases. The reimbursements we are now giving skilled nursing homes do not cover the care for the medically complex cases. Secondly, it put a moratorium--that is, the Senate bill--on the $1,500 therapy caps that have been so disruptive to care to many seniors. 
   Quite frankly, one of the messages I would like the Senate to hear today is that the House bill is completely inadequate in this area. In fact, the House bill puts only $100 million--one-tenth of $1 billion--directly into the payment rates to correct the problem of high cost cases. That is $1.3 billion less than the Senate bill. Obviously, there is a problem, or there isn't a problem. If there is no problem, then the House is right. Fund it with $100 million, which is almost nothing. But if there is a problem, obviously $100 million over 3 years will not solve that problem. The Senate is more apt to be right at $1.3 billion for skilled nursing homes. 
   The House bill tries to salvage the concept of putting caps on therapy services, which is the wrong way to be approaching and controlling the costs in this area. 
   The Medicare relief package reported by our Finance Committee--I give the Finance Committee great credit and Chairman BILL ROTH extraordinary credit--includes other provisions: $1.8 billion for teaching hospitals, all hospitals $2.5 billion more than today's plans, and for home health, $1.3 billion to delay a 15-percent cut. 
   Many of us have looked at all of these and think they are needed and should be supported. But certainly to go to conference and tragically leave out of the package anything significant for skilled nursing homes, I tell you that we will rue the day. It will not be 6 months to a year when there will be closings across this land, and we will have sick senior citizens unattended in nursing home after nursing home across this country. 
   Even if the other provisions survive the conference and the nursing provisions do not, let me repeat that I think we will have failed the No. 1 problem in the delivery system right now, especially for those who can do nothing for themselves. They are the very sick seniors in nursing homes. 
   I don't know any other way than to say that the Senate voted overwhelmingly for these provisions. I hope that means they will carry this message into this conference and will insist that the House concede when it comes to skilled nursing home parts of this bill and put substantially more into reimbursing provisions; that is, the two that I have mentioned here today. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference agreement before the Senate today. There are few bills Congress has completed in my time here which will have a more profound impact on our economy than this legislation to modernize and harmonize the various segments of our financial services industry. 
   I think this historic legislation will result in lower costs of financial services for American consumers, and enhance the competitiveness of United States companies in the global financial marketplace. 
   At the outset, I want to congratulate Chairman GRAMM and the members of the Senate Banking Committee for all of their hard work on this issue. As Chairman GRAMM knows, it has been no easy task to get the banking, securities and insurance industries, as well as the Administration, the regulators and community groups to agree on what shape this law should take. It is a testament to Senator GRAMM's tenacity that he was able finally to hammer out this agreement. 
   As we move into the 21st century, the United States continues to maintain capital markets which are the envy of the world. Bank consolidations and rapid expansion of new global markets have meant phenomenal growth in our financial services sector in recent years. The wave of bank mergers in the late 1990's has led to a situation where the assets held by the five largest banks in the United States now total $2.1 trillion. Five years ago, the top five only had $753 billion in assets. 
   In 1998, for the first time in many years, a U.S. bank is one of the top 10 largest in the world based on assets. From 1997 to 1998, U.S. banks in the top 100 in the world saw their assets grow by 23 percent, their capital base grow by 48 percent and their revenues increase by 36 percent. The United States has 8 of the top 10 securities firms in the world and 4 of the top 20 insurance companies. 
   With all of this financial strength consolidated in the United States, some may wonder why we need this historic new law. With the advent of the European Monetary Union, the combined gross domestic product of the nations in the Union is already equal to that of the United States. When the U.K. joins the Union, the combined GDP will be 10 percent greater than the GDP of the United States. United States firms need to be more flexible, more efficient, and able to offer more products if they are to compete successfully in these new markets. 
   Currently, European laws are much more flexible, allowing financial services firms across the Atlantic to be better integrated than United States firms. Our laws need to keep pace. This conference report will allow our various banking, insurance and securities firms to combine through financial holding companies so that they may be even stronger competitors in the increasingly international financial services marketplace. 
   This enhanced efficiency is not only good for the United States' competitiveness in the international market, it is good for consumers. The Treasury Department estimates that every 1 percentage point decline in the cost of financial intermediation could save U.S. consumers $3.5 billion a year. 
   This new law will allow consumers to enjoy cheaper access to capital and one-stop shopping at financial services superstores. Americans who want to borrow to buy a new car or a home, purchase insurance to protect that car or home, or invest in securities for the future, will for the first time under this new law be able to do all of that at one time, in one place and at a lower cost. 
   I want to commend the chairman and conferees for the way in which they have resolved two major issues which concerned me when we debated this bill in the Senate. Those issues are whether the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department should be the primary regulator of the new financial holding companies, and what to do about abuses of the Community Reinvestment Act of CRA. 
   First, I have great respect for Treasury Secretary Summers and his predecessor, Robert Rubin. They are two of the finest economic and 
   financial minds in the world. But I simply believe that it is more appropriate for the Federal Reserve, a nonpolitical entity also headed by a pretty good economic and financial mind in Alan Greenspan, to serve as the primary regulator in this new age. Regulation of our financial system should not be subject to the ups and downs of the political process, as would be the case if a political appointee, in this case the Secretary of the Treasury, had control. 
   I believe that this bill makes the proper policy decision by designating the Federal Reserve as the umbrella regulator of financial holding companies. The bill provides a mechanism for coordination between the Fed and the Treasury in approving new financial activities for financial holding company subsidiaries. The Treasury Department, through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will maintain its functional regulatory authority over the banking activities of affiliates and subsidiaries of national banks. This is a good compromise and I salute the chairman for his work. 
   Second, I commend the chairman for his diligence in attempting to address the abusers related to the CRA. This bill does not go as far as I know the chairman would like, but it is a good start. And for those concerned community groups out there who have not abused the CRA, let there be no confusion: when this law is signed by the President, there will still be a CRA and there will still be robust community lending across the United States. In fact, the law itself states that nothing in the conference agreement repeals any existing provision of the CRA. 
   What the bill does is provide regulatory relief to small banks which demonstrate that they have achieved at least a satisfactory CRA rating in their most recent audit. This will reduce the burdens related to CRA exams for 82 percent of all banks. And for the larger institutions in cities like Albuquerque, the CRA will continue to apply in the same manner as it does today. That is an eminently reasonable approach. 
   Finally, the bill allows a little sunlight to be shed on all CRA agreements between banks and community groups. Over the next ten years, banks have promised $350 billion in loans and payments to community groups under the CRA. This law will require full public disclosure of those agreements, and an annual accounting of how the money and other resources promised in the agreement were utilized. The public has a right to examine the costs and benefits associated with CRA agreements, and this will provide that public accountability. 
   Mr. President, I want to commend all of those who have worked so hard to finally get Congress to the point where this bill can become law. I am happy to support this bill, and look forward to the President signing it into law.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing the Bisti PRLA Dispute Resolution Act, which will resolve a conflict regarding coal mining leases in New Mexico. A coal company and the Navajo Nation have been deadlocked within the Department of Interior appeals process regarding preference right lease applications (PRLAs) in the Bisti region of northwestern New Mexico. When enacted, this legislation will resolve a complex set of issues arising from legal rights the Arch Coal Company acquired in federal lands, which are now situated among lands which constitute tribal property and the allotments of members of the Navajo Nation. Both the company and the Nation support this legislation to resolve the situation. 
   There are many reasons the solution embodied in this bill achieves broad benefits to the interested parties and the public. It will allow the Navajo Nation to complete the land selections that were made in 1981 to promote tribal member resettlement following the partition of lands in Arizona. It also guarantees that Arch Coal, Inc. will be compensated for the economic value of its coal reserves. An independent panel will make recommendations to the Secretary of Interior regarding the fair market value of the coal reserves, gives the company bidding rights, protects a state's financial interest in its share of federal Mineral Leasing Act payments, and allows the Navajo Nation full fee ownership in their lands. 
   The Secretary of Interior will issue a certificate of bidding rights to Arch Coal upon relinquishment of its interests in the PLRAs. The amount of that certificate will equal the fair market value of the coal reserves as defined by the Department of Interior's regulations. A panel consisting of representatives of the Department of Interior, Arch Coal, and the Governors of Wyoming and New Mexico will help determine fair market value. While the Interior Department is authorized to exchange PRLAs for bidding rights, the Department has not done so, largely because of the difficulty it perceives in determining the fair market value of the coal reserves. The panel method in this legislation will promote the objectivity of that process. 
   Upon the relinquishment of the PRLAs and the issuance of a certificate of bidding rights, the Department of Interior will execute patents to the Navajo Nation of the selected lands encompassed by the PRLAs. This is a win-win situation for all parties involved; is endorsed by the affected parties, and is a fair resolution to this on-going problem. I hope for prompt action on this legislation early next year.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to commend a group of New Mexicans who are achieving some phenomenal results. In fact, they're currently batting .500 and more. If they were baseball players they would be acclaimed on every sports page. 
   But instead of baseball, this group has discovered half of the comets that are currently visible through telescopes. One of their latest comet discoveries may be bright enough to see with binoculars next year. And it's probably safe to guess that the brightest of comets attracts an audience well in excess of those watching major league baseball. 
   Instead of baseball bats, they are using a telescope at the north end of White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. This Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project is run by Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of technology. A second telescope at the site started operations in the last week--that may boost their discoveries still further.  
   The project grew out of an Air Force study involving space surveillance. Now space surveillance isn't a new subject, but in this project they're using a new automated system with a highly sensitive electronic camera. It's a great tool for discovering objects that move in the heavens, like comets and asteroids. The performance of their system exceeds any competitor by at least ten times. Today, both the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA provide the funding for this project. 
   Their asteroid batting average even exceeds their comet batting average. Since the first telescope started operation in March 1998, the project has accounted for about 70 percent of all the near-Earth asteroids that have ever been located. That's especially impressive since astronomers have been searching for such objects for over 60 years. 
   As they find these asteroids, they also project their future path through the heavens and explore any possibility for an impact with the Earth. In the course of their work, they've found four asteroids that might possibly approach Earth--but so far, careful evaluations of their probable future trajectories have shown that each of these objects should miss us. So, while the dinosaurs may have become extinct after an asteroid impact, so far our coast looks clear. 
   The project team is headed by Dr. Grant Stokes, a 1977 graduate of Los Alamos High School and a New Mexico native. Dr. Eric Pearce directs the team at White Sands. This team has truly revolutionized the art of finding comets and asteroids. I want to commend Dr. Stokes and Dr. Pearce along with their supporters at the Air Force and NASA. This large group of New Mexicans deserves the title of the world's best comet and asteroid hunting team.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not repeat what has been stated, other than generally to say most of the social programs in this bill, from Meals on Wheels to student aid to everything else in between, even after the .97-percent cut, are substantially higher than last year and, in almost every instance, higher than what the President of the United States asked for in his budget. 
   If doing that amounts to cutting a program, then, frankly, I don't understand what it means to increase a program and increase them as dramatically as we have in this bill. The best friend the National Institutes of Health has ever had is a Republican Congress. We are increasing National Institutes of Health because people such as CONNIE MACK and a few others have said double it in the next 5 years. In this bill, we had in NIH $2.3 billion more than the President; with the across-the-board cut, we are $2 billion in appropriations more than the President. 
   Essentially, there has been a lot of talk about saving Social Security, and we have used some OMB scoring where we think it is appropriate. There are those who still come to the floor and act as if they actually know we have infringed on the Social Security surplus. Let me repeat for the Senate, in March, April, or May of next year, I predict with almost absolute certainty that a budget comes out close to this budget produced by Senator STEVENS and the appropriations bill and will not take any money out of Social Security. 
   They can argue that the President's numbers wouldn't have taken any out--CBO's numbers might. But essentially, when the bell tolls and we do the reevaluation, we are going to be able to say to the senior citizens we didn't touch Social Security. The .97 is important to that solution.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator BINGAMAN to introduce legislation that will compensate our veterans who fought at Bataan and Corregidor and were later held prisoner. 
   I do not think words can fully describe the bravery of these veterans and the horrific conditions they endured, but I think a quote from Lt. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright provides an insight into these men:  
   They were the first to fire and last to lay down their arms, and only reluctantly doing so after being given a direct order.  
   The 200th and 515th Coast Artillery better known as the New Mexico Brigade played a prominent and heroic role in the fierce fighting that took place in the Philippines. For four months the men of the 200th and the 515th held off the Japanese only to be finally overwhelmed by disease and starvation. 
   Today every student in his or her history class learns about the tragic result of the Battle for Bataan. The survivors of the battle were subjected to the horrors and atrocities of the 65 mile ``Death March.'' As if this were not enough, following the infamous march these men were held for over 40 months in Prisoner of War Camps. 
   Sadly, of the eighteen hundred men in the Regiment, less than nine hundred returned home and a third of  those passed away within a year of returning. I simply cannot imagine what it must have been like for these men. 
   I would now like to briefly discuss the Bill we are introducing. This legislation offers long overdue compensation to a select group of men who served in the Philippines at Bataan and Corregidor during World War II. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay $20,000 to any veteran, or his surviving spouse, who served at Bataan or Corregidor, was captured and held as a prisoner of war, and was forced to perform slave labor as a prisoner in Japan during World War II. 
   There is one final point that I want to make as a matter of simple fairness. I believe that in the upcoming months the federal tax implications should be examined. It may be necessary to provide that the $20,000 payment should be excluded from federal income taxes. 
   Without an exclusion, the interaction between a lump sum payment, the social security income tax earnings limitation could subject some of the survivors of the Bataan death march to one-time exorbitant tax rates in excess of 50 percent. We don't want the federal government to give the compensation with one hand, only to have it taken away by the IRS. 
   Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to speak exclusively on the issue of Social Security and the President's proposal. But before my good friend from Nebraska leaves, I wish to make a couple of comments. Then I would like to share with the Senate some very optimistic information with reference to our fiscal house and how well we are doing in terms of growth of government. 
   I suggest Republicans did a good job when they came up with the idea of locking up these Social Security trust funds so they wouldn't be spent. Frankly, even as short a time ago as last year, nobody thought we could quickly come upon a year when we would not spend a bit of the Social Security trust fund money in paying for our Government and would even have some left over to start a pay-down of Social Security. But in the year just passed, that actually happened. Things changed so much for the positive that last year we did not touch Social Security trust fund money and we accumulated $1 billion in surplus on budget, and it has nowhere to go except to pay down the debt--which helps with Social Security. 
   Frankly, I do not quite understand why, in the waning moments of this year, over the weekend in his weekly radio address, the President came up with a new idea about Social Security. I speculate maybe the idea of the lockbox and not spending any Social Security money was beginning to take hold and, of course, his new proposal takes 15 years, not 10 years, to get his job done that he perceives to be in the interests of Social Security solvency. 
   I remind everyone, if in fact the President has a way, with no new taxes, which none of us want, no benefit changes, no increases in what each particular citizen of the United States who puts money through the payroll account--they don't have any share of the profits and the increases that come, either from Wall Street or from investing in debt--somehow the Wizard of Oz came upon us and all of a sudden we can do this by just investing IOUs. As my friend from Texas said, you just take them as a piece of paper, walk them across the street, put them in a cabinet, and say: We have given them to the Social Security trust fund. 
   The President has one better. At a point in time way out there somewhere he is going to say: That is not the only thing I am doing. I am going to credit the Social Security account for the interest that was saved on the national debt by us putting those IOUs in that box. 
   Over the weekend I had a chance to discuss this. I look forward to seeing some details. I cannot believe what I am hearing. But I nicknamed this proposal and I think it is so. I think it is the ``Godzilla'' of all gimmicks. That is the way I would classify it, for those who are wondering about gimmicks. 
   I am not going to talk much more about that. But I will say to the President, if you have a little time left before you leave, and if you would like to fix Social Security, then engage in a bipartisan way, with Senators on both sides of the aisle, who would like to do something that would help make Social Security a better investment for the millions of Americans who are having this money taken out of their payroll and put in an account that yields them little or nothing. 
   If you had sitting in front of you a group of 22-year-olds, 25-year-olds, just starting out their work years in the American marketplace, and you said to them: For all of you, what is one of the worst investments you could make, in terms of putting money away until you are 65 and then drawing on it? anybody looking at it would have to say it is the Social Security system. 
   It is one of the worst investments you could make because you do not get anything on your investment. Sooner or later, somebody is going to come into the Presidency--if this President would like to do it, he ought to change his mind again and come to the party--and say we have to make that a better investment. By making a better investment, you enhance the value of the trust fund and thus make it more solvent over time. 
   Republicans invented the Social Security lockbox; Democratic Senators oppose it. Republicans support locking away every penny of the Social Security surplus--we have made that clear repeatedly to the President. In fact, we came up with the idea of the Social Security lockbox and have tried to pass legislation in the Senate on at least five occasions. This lockbox would stop the President and Congress from spending any of the Social Security surplus. Unfortunately, Democratic Senators have filibustered the lockbox. 
   The President wants to spend Social Security Surpluses. Congress has nearly completed action on all 13 appropriations bills, and we will do it without touching Social Security. But the President and his staff are demanding that we spend more on scores of government programs, including foreign aid, but they have yet to provide any credible proposals as offsets. Republicans and many Democrats have made it clear that we will not raise taxes to support the President's spending programs. If the President persists in demanding new spending without specifying a credible offset, I can only conclude that he wants to tap Social Security for his programs. 
   The President's proposal for Social Security solvency is the ``Godzilla'' of gimmicks. The President proposes no  changes whatsoever in the structure of Social Security, and yet he wants the American people to believe he has made ``tough choices'' to save the program. It is simply not credible. In fact, for all the talk about gimmicks, it seems to me that this is the ``Godzilla' of gimmicks--a $34 trillion gimmick. The President's plan is nothing more than paper transfers from the general fund of government to Social Security, amounting to a cumulative $34 trillion in new IOUs in Social Security between now and 2050. At some point, when Social Security needs those IOUs to pay benefits, a future President and a future Congress will have to raise taxes to meet those obligations. So, in effect, this proposal is a $34 trillion tax increase on America's future. 
   There is bipartisan opposition to this gimmick in the Senate, including Senators BREAUX, KERREY, and ROBB, all of whom are on the Finance Committee with jurisdiction over Social Security. 
   Let me read some quotes from the experts: 
   David Walker, Comptroller General GAO, in testimony before Senate Budget Committee, February 1999:  
   [President Clinton's Social Security proposal] does not come close to ``saving Social Security''. 
   Under the President's proposal, the changes to the Social Security program will be more perceived than real: although the trust funds will appear to have more resources as a result of the proposal, nothing about the program has changed.  
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in Q&A before Senate Banking Committee, July 1999, when asked if he supported using general revenues to shore up Social Security--which is the basis of the President's SS IOU scheme--the Chairman said this:  
   I would very much prefer that we did not move in the direction of general revenues because in effect, once you do that, then you've opened up the system completely and the issue of what SS taxes are becomes utterly irrelevant. And I'm not terribly certain that serves our budgetary processes in a manner which I think is appropriate.  
   Federal Reserve Board Member Edward Gramlich and Chairman of the 1994-1995 Social Security Advisory Council, in testimony before Senate Finance Committee, February 1999:  
   During the deliberations of the 1994-1996 Social Security Advisory Commission, we considered whether general revenues should be used to help shore up the Social Security program. This idea was unanimously rejected for a number of reasons ..... there are serious drawbacks to relaxing SS' long-run budget constraint through general revenue transfers.  
   The Concord Coalition, in a press release, September 27, 1999:  
   ..... we do not agree that [the President's] plan to credit Social Security with new Treasury IOUs representing interest savings from presumed debt reduction does anything to save the program ..... All it does is simply paper over Social Security's looming shortfalls.  
   Gene Steuerle, senior fellow, Urban Institute, in testimony before Senate Finance Committee, February 1999:  
   My own assessment is an additional transfer from the government's left hand (Treasury) to its right hand (Social Security) ..... tends to mask too much. The simple fact is that future taxpayers must cover the cost of the interest and principal on any gift of bonds from Treasury to Social Security.  
   The President could have had a legacy if he had shown leadership. The President spent most of 1998 telling the country he would show true leadership on Social Security. If he had proposed real reform, many in Congress were ready to work with him. Unfortunately, he chose this non-reform, dooming his chances of any real legacy in Social Security.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The reason I did not understand the Senator's question is that sometimes we use 5 years. The President came along early this year for the first time in history and used 15 years. Thus, we said 15 is too long; let's do 10. But I am not sure where we are going to be on a permanent basis because we are looking at this to see what makes sense. I think what the Senator just said is absolutely right.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. 
   I want to take a few minutes and look at this simple chart. We have been engaged for many years--in this Senator's case, 26 years--in talking about getting the expenditures of our Government down so we do not continue to incur huge deficits that force our children in the future to pay for our bills. We got to the point where that was something being spread across this land and everybody understood it. They said: Let's stop spending more than we take in. 
   Have we succeeded? Are we really doing something about how big Government was growing, and have we taken it by the horns and said we are going to do something about it or not? 
   This is a simple bar graph which shows in 1970-1975, the combined growth in Government for all of the entitlements--military and discretionary spending--was almost 11 percent. In  1975-1980, it was up even from that. It grew 12.2 percent. From 1980-1985, looking at this chart that has it in detail, all spending grew at 10 percent. From 1985-1990, all spending grew at 5.8 percent. It kept coming down. 
   Guess what it is for the last 5 years, I say to my friend from Tennessee. The combined growth of Government--entitlements, domestic and military--is now down to an annual spending of 2.8 percent, and that is made up of defense spending at 1 percent growth and nondefense discretionary at 1.4 percent annually. 
   I know we get into arguments on the floor and those who are worried about spending try to outdo each other as to how much we are going to save and make arguments of every single proposal that comes along in terms of cutting more--let's take some out of this program. All of those are good ideas. We are governed by a majority, so eventually whatever ideas you have, you have to get at least 51 votes. 
   Success in terms of getting Government down in size so we can live with it and do not have to incur significant deficits every year has occurred most significantly in the last 5 years. I remind everyone, throughout all these other years, we have had either a Republican President and both Houses Democrat, a Democrat President with both Houses Democrat, or a Republican President with one House Republican. And guess which combination has been most effective in getting spending down. It is when the Congress has Republicans in the House and Senate. 
   For 5 1/2 years, we have had the lowest growth in Government at every level since 1970. It is pretty revealing. I share with anybody who wants to go through it--and we can talk more about how it has happened--but when people think the Congress did not do much, we were not big players in getting us a balanced budget, I submit this is a pretty big part of it. If those went back up to the levels that were here 15, 20 years ago, we would sure be looking around wondering, are we ever going to stop spending Social Security money to pay for the expenses of our ordinary Government? 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in an era of deregulation, it is imperative that we focus on the public health and safety concerns that may surface in the rush to eliminate excess costs in energy production. 
   One such concern involves the decommissioning and decontamination (D&D) of retired nuclear power plants. The nuclear industry confronts not only the difficulty of providing a competitive energy source in a changing regulatory environment, the funds accumulated to date to cover D&D costs are not sufficient to ensure proper cleanup unless measures are put into place that continue fee collection for the duration of each plant's service life. 
   This bill establishes a framework to ensure adequate fee collection to cover nuclear decommissioning and decontamination costs in a changing regulatory environment. 
   Today, nuclear generating units provide almost a quarter of the country's annual electricity generation. Over the next twenty years, a substantial number of these nuclear power plants reach the end of their 40-year licenses. Some will apply for a license renewal, which should be a straightforward and expeditious process. 
   All plants, at some point, however, will face retirement. Whenever retirement occurs, decommissioning follows--this requires safe dismantling and disposal of all irradiated components. 
   Upon acquiring a license to operate a nuclear power plant, licensees also commit to decommission the plant upon closure. Utilities are required to set aside funds for decommissioning. 
   In the past, State regulators generally allowed fee collection for decommissioning obligations through rates over the entire service lives of the nuclear power plants. This method spread the costs of decommissioning the plant to all the customers served by the plant over the entire course of the plant's service life. 
   As the electricity market moves toward deregulation, the nuclear industry confronts a profound problem. First, fee collection was structured such that accrual of sufficient funds required the full life of the plant, and regulators often undercut the amount of fees collected in order to keep energy prices down. 
   Second, under funding also results from escalating decommmissioning costs due to expanded regulatory requirements, lower than expected growth due to loss of load and customer exodus, rate settlements, and the lag in collecting funds due to ratemaking delays. 
   Lastly, decommissioning cost recovery for most utilities, including nuclear, is ``back-end loaded.'' Meaning, cost recovery is designed to generate much larger contributions to the fund in latter years. 
   In short, the funding of decommissioning has not kept pace with the aging of the units.  
   For example, today, a nuclear plant licensee of a 15-year-old plant would have collected only approximately 5 percent of the funds necessary to meet decommissioning obligations. In addition, these nuclear plant licensees currently have no means of ensuring that they can continue to collect fees from consumers to ensure decommissioning obligations are met. 
   The magnitude of the potential shortfall in cost recovery for decommissioning obligations is staggering. On an aggregate basis, utilities' decommissioning trust funds currently are funded at approximately 25 percent of the estimated costs--about $9 billion. Nuclear plants, however, are approximately 43 percent through their expected service lives. Total projected D&D costs will exceed $35 billion, leaving a current shortfall of about $26 billion. 
   The monumental size of this problem is underscored by the following comparison: FERC allowed recovery of $10 billion of total stranded costs during the restructuring of the natural gas industry. the nuclear industry's current dilemma is two and a half times greater. 
   Two recent publications underscore the critical need to provide assurance that decommissioning funds can be collected and are adequate to cover costs. A study which I chaired by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) entitled The Regulatory Process for Nuclear Power Reactors addressed this issue. 
   The CSIS report stated, ``Restructuring of the electric utility industry could exacerbate the problem of adequate decommissioning funding and could threaten the ability of nuclear power plant owners to recover funds for decommissioning and for nuclear waste disposal in electric rates.'' The June 1999 report Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning Under Utility Restructuring by the National Conference of State Legislatures strongly urged a ``review of current decommissioning legislation, especially if considering or passing deregulation. 
   The legislation I am introducing today creates a backstop to ensure that decommissioning fees can continue to be collected regardless of forthcoming changes in the regulatory environment. Because full, safe decommissioning is vital to public health and safety, this legislation is required to ensure that adequate funds for decommissioning are available to power plant licensees upon closure of their nuclear plants. 
   Let me briefly describe the mechanism established in this bill to ensure that adequate funds are collected. 
   First, nuclear power plant licensees are allowed to petition the NRC for determination of adequacy of their nuclear decommissioning trust funds. This petition process allows a full review of licensees' decommissioning costs and available funding. The petition process allows full public notice and comment. 
   In other words, the NRC will determine each licensee's current and ongoing revenue requirement necessary to ensure adequate funds are accumulated in the trust fund at the appropriate time. 
   Second, the Act amends the Federal Power Act to enable licensees to apply to the FERC, in the case of wholesale rates, or state commissions, for retail rates, for an order establishing rates or charges for collection of revenues necessary to meet NRC determined requirements. 
   Depending on the consumer base served by the nuclear licensee, either the FERC or the state PUCs will be required to incorporate the NRC determined decommissioning cost and revenue requirements in their rate structure. 
   This translates into a negligible fee added to consumers' monthly bills that will guarantee adequate cleanup upon closure of the nuclear plants that met their energy needs. This measure is simple, pragmatic, and safeguards our safety and health needs. 
   We must act now to ensure adequate funding for the safe decommissioning of nuclear units. The awkward jurisdictional position of this issue--caught in a gap between federal agencies and state regulatory authorities--creates a situation in which inconsistent regimes interfere with federally mandated safety measures. 
   This situation presents an unacceptable uncertainty and risk for the health and safety of the citizens and for the economy. As a matter of public policy, to protect public health and safety, as well as to preserve sound energy and economic policy, adequate funding of decommissioning obligations must be assured. 
   This act addresses this concerns and creates a practical mechanism to ensure the decommissioning funds will be adequate to safe closure of nuclear plants in the future.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today for a few words about Senator JOHN CHAFEE, our wonderful friend who left us early this morning. 
   I happened to be privileged to know both he and his wife Virginia very well. My heart goes out to her today. I have not been able to contact her because it is pretty difficult. The phone lines are busy, and she is busy. But my wife Nancy and I extend our sympathies and hope we will see her very soon. 
   As I think about JOHN CHAFEE, I see this mild-mannered person; but then I read about him, and there is a great paradox. If you look at what he did as a patriot, he was a great war hero. He served with the U.S. Marines in Iwo Jima, a very gruesome life experience. Clearly, he had to do some things that aren't so consistent with what we see in a very mild-mannered person. 
   Believe it or not, after law school at Harvard, he volunteered and went a second time. He went to Korea. Then you would think such a talented man would probably want to be in the front office with generals and admirals. But he was head of a rifle team on the ground. That was JOHN CHAFEE. Yet you could hear him regularly, when he made decisions on foreign affairs issues, talk about our country in a way that you absolutely were sure you knew where his heart, conscience, and mind were. It went way beyond that. 
   So if anybody were striving to match him, they would have to take a look at the next one, which is his fantastic public service. We all knew him in his last public service career. But many people knew him in the earlier stages, when he was a representative and head of the minority party in the House of Representatives in his State and Governor twice. 
   I remember vividly when I was elected to the Senate 26 years ago, there were four Senators on the Republican ticket across America who were expected to win. I remember getting a visit in my State then from Richard Nixon, and he had gone to Rhode Island, which was where JOHN CHAFEE was running, who had been Secretary of the Navy and was supposed to be elected; Senator Bartlett of Oklahoma; Senator McClure of Idaho; and myself. He lost. 
   So he was 2 years younger than I am. It took 2 years for them to realize it, but then they finally elected him. He was here ever since. I can quickly state the legacy I see after all these years, as can others who have been here 10, 15, 20 years. He had such a variety of things he did that I am not sure the two things for which I know him best will be his true legacy; maybe both will be. 
   Senator CHAFEE followed in the footsteps of great environmental Senators such as Ed Muskie when he became chair, on our side, of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I do believe, even though most of the legislation for clean air, water, and the like had already been accomplished before he went on, at least the policies were in place, as the occupant of the Chair readily knows in his distinguished career. He quickly became known as a real environmentalist who understood and was practical yet stern in his beliefs. When it came to clean air and clean water, pollution in general, and certainly conservation of open space, there was no peer during his years as chairman and even before that. 
   Everybody will get up and speak, I am sure, about his distinguished efforts on the health care side. He happened to be on the Finance Committee. When you say the Committee on Finance in the Senate, many people don't think of health care, but they have a lot of health care jurisdiction, including Medicare, Medicaid, and all the tax laws as they relate to health care. There was no stronger advocate for getting more people covered in health care than JOHN CHAFEE and no stronger advocate for the health of our children and the need to make sure we were taking every precaution in getting health care to our children and passing laws that would get it there. He was truly a staunch advocate for healthy Americans and Americans having a better chance to be healthy, to get cured when they are sick, and taken care of when they are sick. 
   I am sure there are other things he has done of which I am not aware. But if we got a chance to look at his record, it would be mentioned. There will be plenty of opportunity. I thought if I found the Senate open, I would drop by and say thank you, Senator CHAFEE, and thank you to his family for all they did for our country and for the Senate; thanks to his wonderful wife for all the sacrifices she and their wonderful family have made. 
   I hope, again, we will get to see that family during the next 2 or 3 days. I hope the Senate will honor him appropriately. I hope we take time off and go to his funeral. I am not in charge, but I hope we do that. I think we ought to do that, wherever it is. Whatever we are doing, we ought to take time off. That is just what we ought to do for a real Senator and a real friend. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to explain the provision, and I thank the Senator for her leadership and diligence in joining with me to fight this clear example of regulatory abuse by a Federal agency. As the Senator knows, Federal law requires that the value of oil from Federal land be determined when it is drawn from the ground, or ``at the lease.'' After decades of following the law and using this method of determining oil value, in 1997 the MMS tried to implement a new system without congressional approval and one not supported by statutory law. The proposal would peg the royalty price of the oil ``downstream,'' that is, after value has been added to it through transportation, processing, and marketing. It was the equivalent of the Federal Government saying that, rather than determine the value of Federal land timber when it is chopped-down, the Federal Government would tax the value of the timber once it was turned into furniture. We fought that plan, and will continue to fight it, as long as the MMS continues to ignore the mandate of the law and of the Congress. 
   But, as the Senator from Texas indicated, we offered a compromise on this issue. Frankly, part of the problem in this debate, and one of the reasons it has been so polarized, is that there has never been a comprehensive, independent assessment of just how the MMS can establish the value of Federal royalty oil in a simpler, more workable way, while following the controlling Federal statutes. Everyone agrees that the process as it exists today is too complex, and too subjective. In fact, I and other Members of Congress have held extensive meetings and hearings on the issue to determine just how we can make the rule easier and more predictable to administer, while ensuring a fair return to the taxpayer for Federal royalty oil. This provision included in the conference report requires a General Accounting Office study. We have directed the GAO to carefully examine the key issues raised by the proposed new rule and report back to Congress before any new royalty valuation rule can go into effect. But to ensure that this is not dragged out too long, we have directed that the GAO's report on the issue be submitted to Congress within 6 months. Finally, the provision requires that any new proposal by the MMS must comply fully with all applicable Federal laws, including those requiring the establishment of oil value at the lease, that is, at the wellhead.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I attend dinners and events to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I have been impressed with the energy that the Latino people are adding to our nation. They are having an impact in the work place, the market place, in politics and in our culture. Hispanics will surpass blacks as our nation's largest minority by the year 2005. 
   For my colleagues who do not understand my own link to the Hispanic people, I would like to remind you, I grew up in an immigrant household. My father spoke and wrote Italian. He was fluent in Spanish and English, but did not write English. His customers and employees were Hispanics, mainly in the Albuquerque area. He spoke Spanish at home and at work. 
   In the downtown area of Albuquerque, where I grew up, my Hispanic friends spent hours at our family home, and I spent hours in their homes. Personally I understand more Spanish than I speak, despite all the credit I get for being Spanish-speaking. My wife and I are enchanted by the Spanish masses in New Mexico. The guitars and singing add a beautiful and clearly Hispanic dimension to a worship service. 
   In my twenty-six years as a Senator from New Mexico, I have only grown in my appreciation for the Spanish influence in my home state. Although New Mexico is surpassed in absolute numbers of Hispanics by states like California, Texas, Illinois, New York, and Florida, no other state has a higher percentage of Hispanic people than New Mexico. Forty percent, or about 680,000 New Mexicans are of Hispanic origin. 
   Because of our unique history, Hispanics in New Mexico are influential in all areas of life. There are well educated Hispanics in our national laboratories, our universities, in the legal and medical professions, and in virtually every business, including ranching and farming. Spanish architecture and culture add a significant depth to life in New Mexico. 
   It is clear to me that Hispanics in every state, not just New Mexico, want to be part of the American mainstream. They want to get ahead and succeed. Hispanics want to own businesses and buy their own homes, and they want their children to get a good education. Recent national surveys confirm that Hispanics want what most Americans want. They want the American Dream. They want to earn good money, buy their own homes, drive nice cars, send their children to safe schools, provide for a college education for their children, and invest in the future. 
   The great majority of Hispanics are working class Americans who work hard. For most Hispanics, the American dream is a reality or approaching reality. About one in four Hispanics remains in poverty, twice the national poverty rate. Recent studies show slight declines in the Latino poverty rates. This is good news, but it could be better, as I will discuss soon. 
   Latinos are forming their own businesses at the highest rates in the nation. The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) reports that the 1.4 million Latino businesses in 1997 represent a 232 percent increase over 1987. 
   Two years later, in 1999, there are more than 1.5 million Latino businesses in the United States, with projections for reaching 3 million businesses by the year 2010. Hispanics were a major force in the California economic recovery, where it is now estimated that 400,000 Latino businesses are established and growing. The most common name of home buyers in Los Angeles is Garcia, followed by Gonzales, Rodriguez, Hernandez, Lopez, and more Spanish names. Los Angeles has 6 million Latinos, more than the total population of most states. 
   In 1997, national Hispanic business receipts were estimated at $184 billion or 417 percent higher than 1987, and employment in these businesses was up 464 percent over 1987. 
   The first Hispanic business in America exceeded one billion dollars in annual revenues this year. This important milestone was accomplished by MasTec Inc of Miami, a large construction firm headed by Jorge Mas Jr. whose father was a Cuban exile leader.  
   As a Time magazine article about Hispanics concluded a few years ago, ``Hispanics are coming and they come bearing gifts.'' In July, of this year Adweek observed in a paraphrase of the Time comment, ``Hispanics are here and they come bearing profits.'' 
   Besides becoming home owners as fast as they can and starting businesses faster than any other ethnic group, Hispanic consumers are also a growing market force. 
   The impact of Latinos in our domestic and international markets is huge. Alert executives have welcomed these new markets and profits by serving the needs of Latino consumers right here in the United States. Adweek recently made this observation about this growing market force, ``Many of the top American companies are already courting the market intelligently and aggressively. Procter & Gamble, Sears & Roebuck, Western Union, Colgate-Palmolive, McDonalds, Allstate and many more are already profiting from the Hispanic market. It's because Hispanics are smart consumers who are loyal to the brands that serve them best and to manufacturers who ask for the order.'' 
   Recent headlines report the impact of Latino activities on the mainstream culture. Major magazines this year have has such headlines such as: ``Young Hispanics Are Changing America'' and ``Latino Power Brokers are Making America Sizzle.'' 
   This month, the Albuquerque Tribune had a story with the headline, ``Hispanic Influence, Power on the Rise.'' Sammy Sosa's home runs are featured in sports headlines, and Ricky Martin and ``La Vida Loca'' win Grammy awards while Latin music is a $12.2 billion industry. 
   There are other major indicators of the growing Hispanic or ``Latino'' influence in our markets, our labor force, and in our schools. Some of these indicators are:  
   --31 million Hispanics now live in America. This is nine million more than the 22.2 million Hispanics reported in the 1990 census. 
   --Latinos account for over 11% of our national population--one in nine Americans is Latino. It is predicted that one in four Americans will be Latino by the year 2050. 
   --Hispanic buying power in America has increased 65% since 1990 to almost $350 billion today, more than the entire GNP of Mexico. 
   --4.3 million Hispanics voted in 1996 and 5.5 million are expected to vote in the year 2000 elections. Over 12 million Latinos are eligible to vote. 
   --Spanish-speaking America is already the world's fifth largest Hispanic nation. In ten years, only Mexico will have a larger Hispanic population. 
   --Spanish-speaking America is already the world's fifth largest Hispanic nation. There are 400 million Hispanics in the western hemisphere. 
   --There are proportionally more Medal of Honor winners among Hispanics than any other ethnic group in America.  
   It is no wonder that George W. Bush and Al Gore are speaking their best Spanish to Latino audiences. Some are even asking, ``Who is assimilating whom? 
   Some say we need ``English Only'' as a protection from the growing numbers of Spanish speakers. I say we need to apply ``English Plus'' other languages like Spanish. Our nation will be better prepared for the future by adding Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, and other languages to our national strengths. I will oppose movements like ``English Only'' that are so brazenly aimed at Hispanics and Hispanic culture. ``English Plus'' is a much more healthy approach to our economic and cultural future. 
   Hispanics are proud to remind us that they are represented among Medal of Honor winners more than any other ethnic group in our country. Names like Lopez, Jimenez, Martinez, Rodriguez, Valdez, Gonzales, and Gomez are among the recipients of our nation's highest military honor. Many are New Mexico Hispanics who were over-represented in the infamous Bataan Death March of World War II. 
   Having surveyed the major indicators of Hispanic growth and economic potential over the past decade and the important prospects for further growth and influence, I must now stress to my colleagues that Hispanic people in America today still face two major obstacles that I see. 
   First, capital is the key to growing business in our great country, and Hispanics do not have sufficient access to capital that their numbers and ideas might indicate. Second, and even more important for our future, the drop-out rate of Hispanics is unacceptably high. Let me elaborate. 
   As Hector D. Cantu observed in his Hispanic Business Column (July 1, 1999) for Knight Ridder News, ``Put Latino entrepreneurs in any room and they soon start talking about capital. Or rather, the lack of it. So many business plans, they might say, and so few banks willing to lend them money.'' 
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in a June 22, 1999, study of small business finance in two Chicago minority neighborhoods, found that ``Black and Hispanic owners start their businesses with less funding than owners in the other ethnic groups. Black and Hispanic owners also depend on personal savings for a higher proportion of their start-up funding and are more likely to use personal savings as their only source of start-up funding.'' 
   This study also noted that with the following baseline characteristics: ``eating/drinking place, high school education, proficient in English, no previous experience as an owner, aged 37 years, male, and business started 12 years ago,'' ``A White owner ..... starts with 167 percent more funding ($54,564) than a comparable Hispanic ($20,414); and Asian owner starts with 32 percent more ($26,921); and an owner in the Other category starts with 49 percent more ($30,479).'' A Black owner in this study started with ``an estimated 46 percent smaller pool of funds ($11,104) than a comparable Hispanic.'' 
   To help remedy situations like this all around the country, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) gave us some good news last month about business loans to Hispanics throughout the nation. They reported that SBA-backed loans (bank loans guaranteed by SBA) have more than doubled from $286 million in FY 1992 to about $635 million in FY 1999. This represents more than 21,000 loans worth about $3.7 billion in loans to Hispanic-owned businesses in this seven year period. 
   Even with these impressive improvements in SBA participation and growth rates of 232% in Hispanic-owned businesses in the last decade, Hispanics still own only about 5 percent of the businesses in the United States. 
   As Hispanic influence is felt in our markets, I will encourage continued SBA support for improving bank lending. I would like to note for my colleagues that, on the private sector side of the ledger, Merrill Lynch is reportedly seeking more Hispanic mortgage lending, economic empowerment initiatives, and small business lending. 
   Merrill Lynch has launched a $77 million pilot called the Southern California Partnership for Economic Achievement. In his article about this on April 8, 1999, Hector D. Cantu (Knight Ridder) noted that a vice president of Merrill Lynch in California made this observation about his company: ``The history of Merrill Lynch has been a company that has prided itself on being one step ahead of the competition and positioning itself where great wealth is being created.'' He noted that after World War II, ``We saw great wealth being created in the suburbs. In the 1980s, we saw worldwide economic explosions. We went to Japan and Europe to be positioned globally as we saw capitalism breaking out.'' 
   ``To this list, Merrill Lynch is now adding the U.S. Hispanic market.'' ``It's not a trend that started last year. It's something that has been decades in the making. We see it reaching critical mass in very specific ways. In small business creation. In home ownership. In pure demographics.'' 
   With this kind of economic future and solid demographics to back the Hispanic markets, there is still a disturbing weakness in the underbelly of these numbers and hopes. 
   As many have noted during Hispanic Heritage Month, education is key to Hispanic success in America. I feel that the break-down in our public education system affects minorities and Hispanics more than others. 
   Federal programs that reach our public schools and universities account for about 7 percent of all their resources. A disproportionate share of these federal resources reaches minority students in such programs as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Yet, the effectiveness of this federal investment is still questionable for many reasons, mainly significant and continuing lags in educational attainment and drop outs. Clearly, these are related.  
   Bilingual education is most often funded with federal support, even though two-thirds of Spanish-speaking Latinos in our country are educated in English only classrooms. The federally funded TRIO programs help to identify and tutor minority students bound for college, and federally subsidized student loans help to keep students in college. 
   In an era when we face competition from countries all around the world like Mexico and China, we need to do all we can to keep our national competitive advantage, especially in the scientific and technical fields. There is no question that the required formal education is now higher for these fields, and it is disheartening to see so many Latinos dropping out of high school. 
   I will personally be looking more closely at successful programs like ``Cada Cabeza Es Un Mundo'' ("Each Mind Is A World") in California and Aspectos Culturales (Cultural Aspects) of Santa Fe, New Mexico. As we debate ESEA reauthorization, I will encourage more locally based efforts to include parents and other role models to participate in improving the educational environment for all students, especially those most likely to drop out. 
   Dropout rates among newer Latino immigrants are the highest among all ethnic groups with the exception of American Indians, who make up less than one percent of our population. Current reports by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) place the drop-out rate for Hispanics who are born outside the U.S. at 38.6%. 
   For first generation Hispanics the drop-out rate is 15.4%. For Hispanics beyond the first generation in America, the drop-out rate is slightly higher at 17.7%. Overall, including foreign born Latinos, the Hispanic drop-out rate is 25.3% compared to 7.6% for whites and 13.4% for blacks. 
   We cannot tolerate drop-out rates like these. 
   As our economy demands higher education, and jobs are not being filled for lack of education or experience, the critical value of achievement in education becomes an issue for all of us in the Congress to note. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) released an important report documenting the strong link between education and employment for Hispanics. It is entitled, ``Education=Success: Empowering Hispanic Youth and Adults.'' 
   We have federal programs that address virtually every aspect of education, from Headstart to advanced degrees in science. Yet too many Latinos are being left behind at a time when we pride ourselves in an economy that is surging ahead. We need to make our great American advancements in mathematics, science, and engineering more available to all striving students, especially Latino students who drop out more often than most students. 
   Bill Gates recognized this problem. He recently announced his recent billion dollar donation to minority education, much of which will go to Latino children. He saw the importance of reaching and inspiring Latinos, Blacks, and other minorities to attain higher degrees in science and mathematics. He put his foundation money behind this idea. 
   It is time to refocus and re-energize our federal efforts to help Latinos and others in need of educational assistance. This is not a time to see more and more Latinos falling behind in school just when more formal education is essential to job market participation. 
   When we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month in the year 2000, I hope to be able to report more progress in private lending to Hispanic businesses and better federal support for Hispanic education. Now that Hispanic Americans have become a new economic, cultural, and political force among us, we need to recommit our efforts to see that our financial institutions treat them fairly and that Hispanics are suitably educated for a future we will all live and prosper in together.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about a crisis going on in our nursing home industry. Today, a very large nursing home with headquarters in my home State of New Mexico filed for Chapter 11, that is bankruptcy protection but it is bankruptcy nonetheless. This is the second nursing home chain to file for bankruptcy in the last 2 months. These two nursing home chains own hundreds of facilities over the country, across it from north to south and east to west. So every Senator should be concerned about what is happening in this industry. 
   Frankly, we could have avoided this crisis if the administration had been more willing to acknowledge and address the problem. We wrote a bipartisan letter to Secretary Shalala in May, signed by 64 Senators, urging her to work with us to address the problem administratively. We have yet to get a response. Now I am here to tell you unless something very dramatic is done, this crisis is not over. We are going to see more bankruptcies and ultimately disruptions in the care for our senior citizens unless we fix this problem. 
   Clearly, one of the major reasons for these failures is the new payment system through the Medicare program for skilled nursing facilities and some of the services they give to their patients. Everyone, including the Health Care Financing Administration, acknowledges that this payment system does not adequately reimburse nursing homes for so-called nontherapy ancillary services; that is, drugs, oxygen, and other costs incurred, which are a very large part of the expenses of taking care of our seniors in nursing homes. 
   To address this problem, I joined with Senator HATCH and others in introducing S. 1500. That would fix the new payment system and it is fiscally responsible. 
   Unfortunately, the package of Medicare provisions released by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee yesterday is woefully inadequate. 
   Hatch-Domenici increased the payment rates in the 15 categories of reimbursement that clearly underpay for those patients with high non-therapy ancillary costs. 
   The Finance Committee package, however, only includes two of these 15 categories. 
   I am told that this is the position that HCFA supports, perhaps based on a contractor's analysis of the problem. 
   But I am also told that the same contractor indicates right up front in the report that patients with high non-therapy ancillary costs are likely to appear in the patient categories covered by the Hatch-Domenici bill. 
   But, it seems to me that there is no higher priority in Medicare than fixing this problem, which is on the verge of disrupting care for millions of seniors in every state. 
   The Finance Committee is working on a bill to help in this area and some others. I have seen the bill as of yesterday. It is totally inadequate to take care of this problem, this crisis across this land. In my State, if this company goes bankrupt, totally bankrupt, it will not only hurt seniors across this land but we will have 700 to 800 people who will lose their jobs. They have been working in this industry for years. 
   I ask the Finance Committee to reconsider what they contemplated yesterday. I will begin working with some of them, with specifics. But I guarantee those who are contemplating a bill to  do some justice and fairness in this area, we are not going to get by with the provisions that were in the bill as of yesterday.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in conjunction with Hispanic Heritage Month I am introducing the Palace of the Governors Expansion Act. The Palace is a symbol of Hispanic influence in the United States and truly shows the coming together of many cultures in the New World--the various Native American, Hispanic and Anglo peoples who have lived in the region for over four centuries. 
   It is appropriate that during Hispanic Heritage Month that a bill should be introduced to preserve a priceless collection of Spanish Colonial, Iberian Colonial paintings, artifacts, maps, books, guns, costumes, photographs. The collection includes such historically unique items as the helmets and armor worn by the Don Juan Onate expedition conquistadors who established the first capital in the United States, San Juan de los Caballeros, in July of 1598. It includes the Vara Stick, a type of yardstick used to measure land grants and other real property boundaries in Dona Ana County, New Mexico. 
   We have all heard of Geronimo. The Collection includes a rifle dropped by one of his men during a raid in the Black Range area of Western New Mexico. 
   We have all heard of Pancho Villa. His activities in the Southwest come alive when viewing some of the artifacts included in the Palace of the Governors Collection. The Columbus, New Mexico Railway Station clock was shot in the pendulum, freezing for all history the moment that Pancho Villa's raid and invasion began. It is part of the collection, but you wouldn't know it because there is no room to display it. 
   Brigadier General Stephen Watts Kearny was posted to New Mexico during the Mexican War. He commanded the Army of the West as they traveled from the Santa Fe trail to occupy the territories of New Mexico and California. As Kearny travelled, he carried a field desk which he used to write letters, diaries, orders and other historical documents. It is part of the collection, but you can't see it because there is no display space for it in the Palace of the Governors. 
   Many of us have read books by D. H. Lawrence, but none of us have seen the note from his mother that is part of the collection. 
   There are more than 800,000 other historic photographs, guns, costumes, maps, books and handicrafts. 
   Today, where are these treasures that Teddy Roosevelt wanted to make part of the Smithsonian housed now? 
   Where is this collection that has been designated as National Treasures by the National Trust for Historic preservation kept? 
   In the basement of a 400 year old building. 
   It is a national travesty. 
   This legislation would right this wrong by authorizing funds for a Palace of the Governors Expansion Annex. The entire project will cost $32 million. The legislation authorizes a $15 million federal grant if the Museum can match the grant on a 50-50 basis. 
   The Palace of the Governors has acquired a half block right behind the current Palace. Obtaining this valuable real estate is evidence of the ingenuity and commitment of those involved in preserving the collection. Real estate near Santa Fe's plaza is seldom for sale at any price, much less an affordable price. 
   Palace of the Governors has been the center of administrative and cultural activity over a vast region in the Southwest since its construction as New Mexico's second capitol in Santa Fe by Governor Pedro de Peralta in 1610. The building is the oldest continuously occupied public building in the United States. Since its creation, the Museum of New Mexico has worked to protect and promote Hispanic, Southwest and Native American arts and crafts.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I said earlier this week, I oppose this treaty for two major reasons: (1) the treaty cannot be considered apart from other major arms control agreements in to which the United States has entered; and (2) Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship has not yet been given enough time to prove whether or not it will give us the assurance we need in the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons without physical testing. 
   However, the vote by the Senate today to reject this treaty was ill-timed and this poor timing could have adverse consequences in the world. No need exists now for a vote; after all, the United States is not now testing and has no plans in the immediate future to do so. This has been recognized by proponents and opponents of this treaty who have asked for delay in the vote. 
   I have attempted, with many others, during the last 2 weeks to help forge some path out of the parliamentary impasse in which the Senate is currently involved. Nonetheless, that has not been successful. We have not found any such path. I think that is unfortunate. Nonetheless, I might say treaties don't really die, even when they are defeated; they are returned to the Executive Calendar of the Senate. Therefore, we will have another chance to debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the next Congress, or years thereafter. It may very well be that, by then, my concerns about the overall strategic arms strategies and their relationship to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty can be alleviated. And if the potential for stockpile stewardship during that decade can be realized, perhaps I will be able to vote for the treaty in the future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my honor today to introduce a Senate resolution honoring a wonderful man and public servant, John E. Cook. The National Park Service recently celebrated its 83rd birthday, and for more than half that time--43 years--John served the Service with distinction, grit and integrity. 
   John E. Cook most recently served as Director of the Intermountain Region of the National Park Service, which stretches from Canada to Mexico and covers eight states, including Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. There he oversaw 87 diverse park units, including national parks, national monuments, national preserves, and national recreation areas. Since I have been a Senator from New Mexico, John and I have worked on various, and sometimes contentious, park issues. I have always appreciated our relationship, and his frankness and competence in dealing with issues. 
   Anyone who knows John would agree he is a great guy. Before starting his work for the National Park Service, he worked as a farm and ranch hand--and I've even heard a few good stories from his days as a rodeo cowboy. John began his Park Service career as a mule skinner at what is now Saguaro National  Park, and he has worked as a fire fighter, laborer, ranger, superintendent, and regional director throughout the western United States. 
   In addition to being a strong manager of people and parks, linking cultural and natural resource management, John has worked diligently to promote understanding of American Indians. Former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall appointed John superintendent at Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona partially because he speaks Navajo. He has received awards for his work in parks around the Navajo Nation, and has taught other park staff on American Indians' connection to lands that are now national parks. 
   The National Park Service owes John Cook a debt of gratitude, and the many honors he has received in his service will not repay what he has done for the parks of the west. I only hope that he will enjoy his extra free time to get in some hunting--a passion both he and I enjoy. I am pleased to offer this resolution, and I thank my colleagues for joining me in honoring this fine man.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there can be no question that this debate and the vote which might occur are very significant and historic events for the United States. I very much want to be in favor of the treaty but I cannot favor the treaty because I believe essentially it jeopardizes U.S. security. 
   I wish every Senator had the opportunities I have had for the last 5 1/2 years. I say that knowing full well my friend from Arizona, while he is not on the committee that funds the stockpile stewardship, is one of the rare exceptions in that he and a few other Senators have learned and worked very diligently to understand what we have been doing since we decided on behalf of the Senate in a Mark Hatfield amendment that we would not test nuclear weapons. 
   What has been the U.S. response to our scientific and nuclear community? 
   Essentially, what we have been busy doing can be encapsulated in the words ``science-based stockpile stewardship.'' One might say, since that pertains to the safety of the weapons system, what we used to do could be called nuclear testing stockpile stewardship. That occurred since the beginning of our nuclear weapons programs. The United States had a formidable, perhaps the world's best, system of underground testing. 
   Testing became very important to those laboratories--there are now three that are principally called nuclear deterrent or stockpile stewardship laboratories. I am privileged to have two of them in my State. When I come to the floor, go to meetings, and talk about the fact this is an important program and these laboratories are important, it hardly ever comes into focus like it is today, like it was in our conference at noon, and like it has been for the last week as Senator JON KYL and others have spoken to the fact that what the United States has been trying to do is develop a science-based system. This system means supercomputer simulation and other techniques and skills to see what is going on in a nuclear weapon without any testing to assure the parts that might be wearing out are discernible and can be replaced and that the weapon, indeed, is safe. 
   Frankly, if nothing else, I pray this debate will cause Senators and Representatives, in particular in the important committees of jurisdiction, to understand the importance of this program if the United States continues on a path of no testing, for whatever period of time--and who knows, we may do that in spite of this treaty not being ratified by the United States. I do not want to engage in a maybe-and-maybe-not discussion on that, but the United States is trying hard. Nonetheless, my principal concerns about this Treaty--and there are many--center around four reasons, and three of them have to do with science-based stockpile stewardship. 
   First, the science-based stockpile stewardship is new; it is nascent; it is just starting. It is not finished. It has not been completed. It is not perfected. As a matter of fact, to the Senators who are on the floor, probably some of  the most profound testimony regarding America's stockpile of nuclear weapons occurred in the Armed Services Committee last week when sitting at the witness table was the Secretary of Energy, surrounded by the three National Laboratory Directors. 
   It goes without saying that our country owes them a high degree of gratitude and thanks for what they do, for they oversee the safety of our weapons under this new approach which is very different for them, and that is, no testing; they must certify that everything is OK without testing. Scientists and physicists steeped in knowledge about nuclear weapons--one of them is a nuclear weapons expert of the highest order--testified, and I will quote in a while some of the difficulties they see with reference to their responsibility. 
   Secondly, I do not know what to do about it, but the difficulty, as they testified, in securing the funding they need without new mandates imposed upon them is very uncertain. The difficulty is real and it is uncertain as to whether they will continually over time get sufficient resources. 
   Third is, and I say this with a clear hope that the Secretary of Energy and the President will listen, the unknown impact of the failure on the part of this administration to proceed with reorganizing the Department of Energy on stewardship efforts. I do not want to belabor in this speech the efforts that many of us went to in streamlining accountability of the nuclear weapons programs within the Energy Department. We called it a semiautonomous agency--so that Department, which is in charge of the nuclear weapons, including the profound things we are talking about with respect to their safety, will not be bogged down by rules, regulations, personnel, and other things from a Department as diverse as the Department of Energy. 
   As a matter of fact, the more I think about it, the more I am convinced they should get on with doing what Congress told them to do instead of this waffling out of it by putting Secretary Richardson in charge of both the Energy Department and a new independent agency--which was supposed to be created so it would be semiautonomous, and he will head them both under an interpretation that cannot be legal--just indicates to me that they are not quite willing in this Department of Energy to face up to the serious problems of our nuclear stockpile and such things as science-based stockpile stewardship. 
   Lastly, and for many who talked on the floor, the most important issue is the ambiguities and threats to our international security at the present time. I will talk about that a bit because some Senators are asking: How can you be against the treaty and at the same time say we ought to put it off? 
   Let me repeat, my last concern is the ambiguities and threats to our international security at present. 
   I will proceed quickly with an elaboration. 
   When the United States declared a unilateral moratorium in 1992, the onus was on the scientists and National Laboratories to design and implement a program that would ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of our nuclear arsenal without testing. This is an onerous, complicated task that has yet to be fully implemented and validated, and I just stated that. 
   Science-based stockpile stewardship was designed to replace nuclear tests through increased understanding of the nuclear physics in conjunction with unprecedented simulation capabilities. This requires a lot of money. In fact, full implementation of the stewardship program is more expensive than reliance on nuclear tests, and I do not say this as an excuse for moving back to testing. The truth of the matter is it proves we are very willing to keep our stockpiles safe, reliable, and sound, even if it costs us more money, so long as we do not do underground testing on the other side of the ledger. 
   There is no question that in addition, the validity of this approach remains unproven, and key facilities, such as the National Ignition Facility, are behind schedule and over budget, and it is supposed to be one of the integral parts of being able to determine the stockpile confidence. 
   This program will attempt to preserve the viability of existing weapons indefinitely. We no longer possess the production capabilities to replace the weapons, and maybe Senator KYL has referred to that. We have already gotten rid of our production facilities. Currently, seven highly sophisticated warhead designs comprise our arsenal. Each weapon contains thousands of components, all of which are subject to decay and corrosion over time. Any small flaw in any individual component would render the weapons ineffective. In addition, because we intend to preserve, rather than replace, these weapons with new designs, aging effects on these weapons remains to be seen. 
   I quote Dr. Paul Robinson of Sandia National Laboratory in his testimony last week:  
   Confidence in the reliability and safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile will eventually decline without nuclear testing. ......Whether the risk that will arise from this decline in confidence will be acceptable or not is a policy issue that must be considered in light of the benefits expected to be realized [if you have a] test ban.  
   Are we ready today to accept a decline in confidence of our nuclear deterrent? Can we today accurately weigh the benefits on either side of the issue? I do not think so. On the other hand, we risk complete collapse of ongoing disarmament initiatives by prematurely rejecting this treaty. That is why I believe it is not inconsistent that I am not for it, but I would not like it to be voted on. 
   There are substantial risks with unknown consequences. Success of the Stockpile Stewardship Program requires recruiting the brightest young scientists. We have to begin to substitute for the older heads who know everything there is about it and contain all of the so-called corporate memory with reference to the science testing and the like. 
   My colleagues all know that I have fought very hard to get the money for the Stockpile Stewardship Program. We came perilously close this year to having this part of our budget cut by as much as $1 billion by the House. I think after weeks of saying we would not go to conference--it is not worth going to conference to fight--it was believed it would be better to stay at last year's level. They finally came to the point where we have a Stockpile Stewardship Program funded, but in an almost irreverent way. 
   Dr. Browne of Los Alamos said:  
   I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing. However, I am concerned about several trends that are reducing my confidence level each year. These include annual shortfalls in planned budgets, increased numbers of findings in the stockpile that need resolution, an augmented workload beyond our original plans, and unfunded mandates that cut into the program.  
   It is pretty clear that it is not what they would like it to be. 
   He also said he was  
   concerned about other significant disturbances this year in the stability of the support from the government, partially in response to concerns about espionage. This has sent a mixed message to the Laboratory that will make it more difficult to carry out  
   the stewardship program. According to this good doctor who heads Los Alamos, the task of recruiting and training the requisite talent is hindered by the current security climate at the laboratories. 
   I strongly believe that the establishment of a semi-independent agency for nuclear weapons activities will significantly enhance efforts to ensure the success of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. At the same time, this reorganization will require many months to accomplish. I ask my colleagues the following question: Should we make an international declaration regarding U.S. nuclear tests in the midst of a complete overhaul of the Department responsible for those weapons? I don't think so. Such an action would be premature. 
   Lastly, today we cannot clearly define the direction the world will take on nuclear issues. This concern speaks both for and against the treaty. Treaty proponents believe that U.S. ratification and the treaty's entry into force will curb proliferation. This treaty, if fully implemented, would enhance our ability to detect nuclear tests and create a deterrent to nations that may aspire to possess nuclear weapons capabilities. 
   However, others say, without question, this treaty is not a silver bullet. The administration has touted it as such. This treaty is only one measure of many that should comprise a solid nonproliferation agenda. For example,  this treaty would be acceptable if accompanied by substantive bilateral commitments with Russia and multilateral commitments among the declared nuclear powers. A framework for international disarmament, nonproliferation, and stability may very well include a Test Ban Treaty, but it should also be accompanied by binding commitments on future disarmament objectives, such as the Fissile Materials Cutoff Regime, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
   We have only one treaty--one facet of a complex picture--before us today. It may contribute to achieving other disarmament objectives, but we are being asked to wager our nuclear deterrent on the hope that formal commitments from other nuclear powers and threshold states will be forthcoming. We sign on the dotted line that we will not utilize testing to maintain our stockpile, and we plead with the world to follow suit. 
   Or we reject the Treaty now and eliminate others' potential hesitation regarding future tests. 
   Only 23 of the 44 nations required for the Treaty's entry into force have ratified it. India, Pakistan, North Korea, Russia and China have not ratified it. Neither India nor Pakistan have even signed the treaty. 
   We should not rush to vote on this matter. 
   Regardless of the vote count, we risk either permanent damage to our non-proliferation objectives or the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Continuing our moratorium on nuclear testing and not acting on this Treaty is the best course of action for now. 
   We have time. Time to observe international changes and formulate a nuclear posture suitable for a new era. Time to evaluate the future of our bilateral relations with Russia and China. And time to first ensure the success of Stockpile Stewardship. 
   U.S. ratification would provide a positive signal and increase our leverage at the negotiating table in our pursuit of many non-proliferation objectives. If the Senate does not ratify this Treaty, which appears highly likely at the present, many of our current foreign policy initiatives will unravel. 
   Most importantly, a negative vote on the CTBT will further erode the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, itself. We secured indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 by committing to lead negotiations, sign and ratify the Test Ban Treaty. There is an explicit link between our Article VI commitments to disarm and the CTBT. 
   Many other steps could be taken to demonstrate a good faith effort toward nuclear disarmament. The Test Ban Treaty is just one element of a comprehensive strategy to reduce nuclear dangers. The U.S. and Russia have already radically reduced stockpiles from their Cold War levels. Progress has been made in the negotiations for a fissile materials cutoff regime. Currently, all of the declared nuclear powers have a moratorium on testing, and two of those, Britain and France, have signed and ratified the Test Ban Treaty. 
   If the Senate votes against this Treaty, we will send the signal to the world that the U.S. has no intent to make good on its earlier commitments. START II will wither in the Duma; negotiations with Russia on START III and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty will most likely falter. We would most likely witness a rash of nuclear tests in response. Killing this Treaty would inevitably also impact upcoming elections in Russia. To the Russians our actions in Kosovo underscored NATO's willingness to engage in out-of-area operations, even in violation of sovereignty. Anti-U.S. sentiments in Russia soared. Not only would a down vote on this Treaty play into the hands of the Communists and Nationalists, U.S. actions would essentially give Russia the go-ahead to begin testing a new generation of tactical nuclear weapons to secure its border against NATO. 
   We risk little by postponing consideration of this Treaty. We put our most vital security interests at stake by rushing to judgement on it. 
   In sum, defeat of this Treaty at this point will have a devastating impact on numerous current foreign policy initiatives that are clearly in the U.S. national interest. We can anticipate an unraveling of initiatives toward bilateral disarmament with Russia, and we will forfeit any remaining hope of preventing a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan. We will open wide the door for China to proceed with tests to validate any nuclear designs based on the alleged stolen W-88 blueprints. 
   At the same time, Stockpile Stewardship is as yet unproven. We still do not fully understand the aging effects on our nuclear arsenal. Such aging effects relate both to the components which comprise the nuclear weapons and the scientific experts who initially designed and tested them. Also, as witnessed again this year, the budget for the full implementation of Stockpile Stewardship is anything but secure. In light of the current situation, ratification of this Treaty may put us at risk. 
   The timing of this debate is such that I have to weigh very carefully between the negative impact of this Treaty's possible defeat and the annual budgetary struggles for Stockpile Stewardship in combination with the scientific community's own doubts about the Stockpile Stewardship program. 
   We should maintain the moratorium on testing and postpone the vote on this matter. 
   It is irresponsible and dangerous to proceed now with the debate and vote on this Treaty. We have nothing to lose by maintaining our current status of a unilateral moratorium and having signed but not yet ratified the Test Ban Treaty. But we have everything to lose regardless of the outcome of this vote. 
   I thank the Senate for listening and the leadership for granting me this time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2000. 
   The conference report provides $68.6 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $48.5 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. Within this amount, $8.7 billion in BA, and $8.3 billion in outlays is designated as emergency spending for farmers who have experienced weather-related disasters, and for additional market transition payments to compensate farmers for depressed commodity prices. All of the discretionary funding in this bill is nondefense spending. When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the conference report totals $73.0 billion in BA and $55.7 billion in outlays for FY 2000. 
   The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) conference allocation totals $73.0 billion in BA and $55.7 billion in outlays. Within this amount, $22.7 billion in BA and $22.6 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending, of which $8.7 billion in BA, and $8.3 billion in outlays are designated as emergency spending. For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all the mandatory savings in the bill, the conference report is at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. It is $8.7 billion in BA and $8.5 billion in outlays above the 1999 level for discretionary spending, $1.1 billion in BA and $1.0 billion in outlays above the Senate-passed bill, and $8.2 billion in BA and $7.7 billion in outlays above the President's request for these programs. 
   I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its 302(b) allocation. I appreciate the committee's support for a number of ongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I am pleased to say I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I have helped Senator BINGAMAN with it. 
   This is a good amendment. We aren't asking for any money. We are not asking that any law be changed. We are merely saying that something is not right for our State. 
   The reimbursement--or some aspect of how we are paying doctors under Medicare--is causing us to have much lower fees than the surrounding States, and as a result two things are happening: One, doctors are leaving. In a State such as ours, we can ill afford that. Second, we are being told it is harder and harder to get doctors to come to our State. That was not the case years ago. They loved New Mexico. They came for lots of reasons. But certainly we cannot be an underprivileged State in terms of what we pay our doctors--be a poor State in addition--and expect our citizens to get good health care. 
   We want to know what the real facts are: Why is this the case? Is it the result of the way the geographic evaluation is applied to our State because maybe rural communities aren't getting the right kind of emphasis in that formula? 
   Whatever it is, we want to know. When we know, fellow Senators, we can assure Members, if we find out it is not right and it is not fair, we will be on the floor to talk about some real changes. Until we have that, we ask Members for help in obtaining a study. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I associate myself with the remarks of my Leader and would also note that there has been much discussion by the proponents of changing the budgetary treatment of the FAA accounts because of the need to spend more from the airport and airways trust fund. I would like to set the record straight--for the last five years, we have spent more on the aviation accounts than the airport and airways trust fund has taken in. In 
   addition, the Department of Transportation has estimated that we have spent in excess of $6 billion more on FAA programs than total receipts into the Airport and Airways Trust Fund over the life of the trust fund.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I note that the Administration strongly opposes any provisions that would drain anticipated budget surpluses prior to fulfilling our commitment to save Social Security. The House bill asks us to do for aviation what isn't done for education, veterans' benefits, national defense, or environmental protection. As important as aviation investment is, it would be fiscally irresponsible of us to grant it a bye from the budget constraints we face with in funding virtually every other program.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. 
   Over the last several years, there has been a lot of talk and support on the House side for the idea of changing the budgetary status of the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. In fact, the House's FAA Reauthorization bill, the so-called AIR-21, would take the Airport and Airways Trust Fund off-budget. Some say the House's real intent is to create a new budgetary firewall for aviation, similar to those created for the highway and mass transit trust funds under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). 
   I've been hearing distant, low rumbles from a minority of my colleagues on this side of the Capitol. They, too, would like an off-budget status or firewall for the Aviation Trust Fund. 
   Let me reiterate my response to these proposals--These proposals are dangerous and fiscally irresponsible. They undermine the struggle to control spending, reduce taxes, and balance the budget. 
   Taking the Aviation Trust Fund off-budget would allow FAA spending to be exempt from all congressional budget control mechanisms. It would provide aviation with a level of protection now provided only to Social Security. Important spending control mechanisms such as budget caps, pay-as-you-go rules, and annual congressional oversight and review would no longer apply. 
   A firewall scenario has very similar problems. A firewall would prevent the Appropriations Committee from reducing trust fund spending, even if the FAA was not ready to spend the money in a given year. If the Appropriations Committee wanted to increase FAA spending above the firewall, it would have to come from the discretionary spending cap, a very difficult choice given the tight discretionary caps through 2002. 
   These proposals would also create problems in FAA management and oversight. Both an off-budget or firewall status would reduce management and oversight of the FAA by taking trust fund spending out of the budget process. Placing the FAA and the trust fund on autopilot by locking-up funding would result in fewer opportunities to review and effect needed reforms. This is very dangerous. There would be little leverage to induce the FAA to strive for higher standards of performance. Now is the time for more management and oversight by both the Authorizing and Appropriations committee, not less. 
   The Budget Enforcement Act and other budget laws were created to keep runaway spending in check. I oppose, as we all should, budgetary changes that would make it more difficult to control spending, weaken congressional oversight, create a misleading federal budget, and violate the spirit of the law. 
   Some of my colleagues object to the building of money in the Aviation Trust Fund. They contend that all of the revenues should be spent on airport improvements. They say that all of the aviation related user taxes should be dedicated to aviation, and should not be used for other spending programs, deficit reduction, or tax cuts. 
   On the contrary, total FAA expenditures have far exceeded the resources flowing into the trust fund. Since the trust fund was created in 1971 to 1998, total expenditures have exceeded total tax revenues by more than $6 billion. 
   This is because the Aviation Trust Fund resources have been supplemented with General Revenues. The purpose of the General Fund contribution is that the federal government should reimburse the FAA for the direct costs of public-sector use of the air traffic control system. The FAA estimated in 1997 that the public-sector costs incurred on the air traffic control system is 7.5 percent. 
   In 1999, a total of 15 percent of federal aviation funding came from the General Fund. Since the creation of the Aviation Trust Fund, the General Fund subsidy for the FAA is 38 percent of all spending. This far exceeds the 7.5 percent public-sector costs that FAA estimated. Therefore, over the life of the trust fund, the public sector has subsidized the cost of the private-sector users of the FAA by $46 billion. 
   Let this Congress not make the fiscally irresponsible decision to insulate aviation spending from any fiscal restraint imposed by future budget resolutions; to make aviation spending off-limits to Congressional Appropriations Committees. Let us not grant aviation a special budgetary privilege, and make it more difficult for future Congresses and Administrations to enact major reforms in airport and air traffic control funding and operations. 
   Taking the Aviation Trust Funds off-budget or creating a firewall--these proposals are not fit to fly! 
   I yield the floor. I thank the chairman for yielding.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 314 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended, requires the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the appropriate budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the Appropriations Committee to reflect amounts provided for emergency requirements.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, some of you will not think what I am going to tell you is even possible. But, believe it or not, before I went to law school, I was a schoolteacher. I taught mathematics in junior high school in the public school system. I loved it. I had a class in the morning that was made up of half the students who didn't know how to add 6 and 6--they were in the eighth grade--and half the students who were ready for geometry. 
   I guarantee that if the U.S. Government, back when we were trying to teach in Albuquerque, NM, in Garfield Junior High, said, We want to give you the same program as we give a junior high school in New York City, do you think I would have jumped to it and said, Give it to me? Of course I would not have. I would have said, What is it for? Then I would have said, Won't you let me use it for what I know the kids need or are you going to tell me what they need? 
   In essence, that little classroom and that little example is a microcosm of this issue. This issue across this land is whether or not the U.S. Government can help a failing education system with more targeted programs--more programs that say, use it our way in every way or you don't use it. It is a presumption on our part that it is the very best way to use the money and it is the best way to make our students achieve more--none of which is true and none of which will bear out in the marketplace of educating young people. 
   What we have today is an effort to use $1.2 billion of education funding by authorizing on an appropriations bill a way of spending that is not now authorized in the law. We will not even wait for a couple of months for the committee that has been having hearing upon hearing to come forth with a bill that puts everything into some perspective as to the small Federal Government's share--and small it is; 7 percent of public education is the U.S. Government. And that is found in this bill, 7 percent. 
   Some people talk as if we are the driving force of education. We would have to be miracle workers for our 7 percent to really make schools get significantly better. But they would take $1.2 billion that is here to be used in a new way under a new law, and they would say: We know best; spend it for more teachers in every school in America. 
   Frankly, it was also said on the floor that every superintendent wanted it that way. I only had a chance to call four--Belen, Artesia, Cloudcroft, Capitan. None of them thought that more teachers was the biggest priority for their school systems and their problems. Some said they would improve themselves with alternative learning. Some said they would improve themselves with math and science. One said they would dramatically improve themselves in science. 
   Frankly, that is what this is all about. Under the guise of saying we know best and, please, under the guise of saying more teachers must be met for everybody, we are going to spend $1.2 billion of hard-earned taxpayers' money by mandating that you use it for more teachers or you can't use it. 
   I would just suggest that in my home city school district--where I taught school years ago when I taught mathematics in the junior high--I am not at all sure they would take this money and put it in more teachers if you gave them the option. They are having a crisis in the school system there. But I don't believe they would be saying the thing they need the most is more teachers. They might need bonuses for 
   good teachers. They might need some bonuses for teachers who are indeed excellent and can't make ends meet because we can't pay enough. They would find all kinds of things and put them on the table. Ask them. 
   If you really said--let's just pick a number, the $20 million you will get, or the $50 million you will get--Albuquerque, you can use it all for teachers or in enhancing the opportunity for achievement, which is our goal, you can use it in other ways and be accountable for it, I doubt very much if they would in my home State all choose more teachers. 
   Don't anybody miss the point. If you vote against Senator MURRAY's amendment, you still vote for the $1.2 billion  to go to our States in the appropriate formula, which nobody is arguing about, to be used where they think it is best to enhance the achievement level of our public school students. 
   There is much that could be said. When the debate ensues on the major American overhaul of education, we will all be here talking about some new reform. But for now, I think in my 5 minutes I have expressed my views as best I can. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. 
   We have before us the Energy and Water Development Act, which is the appropriations bill for the year 2000. Last night, the House passed this conference report by a vote of 327-87, and I hope the Senate will also overwhelmingly support this conference report. 
   Incidentally, while this is a small bill in terms of total dollars in comparison to some of the very large bills, such as Labor-Health and Human Services, and many others, this is a very important bill. A lot of Senators don't know, and a lot of people don't know, that the title of this subcommittee and this bill--energy and water development--is kind of a misnomer because if you wanted to put in the major things that are in this bill that are of significance to America's well-being and security, you would hardly think that an energy and water development bill would have that in it. 
   But this bill funds the entire research, development, maintenance, and safety of the nuclear weapons of the United States. It funds the three major National Laboratories which are frequently called America's treasures of science. One is in Los Alamos, NM. The history of why it got started is well known and why it was selected to be up on that mountain. A sister institution is in California, which is called Lawrence Livermore, and there is an engineering facility that is different from those two. The other two labs are used to design and develop the weapons themselves; that is, the bombs. 
   Incidentally, we are not building any new bombs now. People keep challenging us when we put money in this bill, asking us how many weapons we are building. The argument is that Russia keeps building them and we are not building them. We are not terribly frightened about that. They build them differently, and they have a different philosophy about how to build them than we do. 
   These National Laboratories are engaged in the mission of maintaining these nuclear weapons indefinitely, without underground testing. For all of  the history of the building and 
   development of nuclear weapons, the State of Nevada could be added as the fourth site that was of significance for America to keep its weapons of a nuclear nature safe, sound, reliable, and capable of doing what we expect them to do. That is because we tested these weapons underground, in cavernous underground facilities loaded with all kinds of equipment that did measurements, and that was in the great State of Nevada. Now, those are shrunk because we have adopted a policy, sometimes called the Hatfield amendment, by a vote in the Senate, signed by the President, which says we don't do any underground testing. 
   The question is, If we are not going to do any testing, how do we make sure the weapons are reliable, safe, efficient, and effective? So there is a new concept and these three laboratories, in conjunction with the Nevada underground test site, which does some lesser experiments--not the nuclear blasts--are engaged in trying to prove that our weapons are safe and sound. If parts need to be replaced over time, we are able to know which ones, how, why, and that is called science-based stockpile stewardship--science-based stockpile stewardship--instead of science-based underground testing. 
   So we have to develop new kinds of activities at these laboratories, and it is about a 5-year venture. This is the sixth year of funding. Maybe this year, we will have put it into the lexicon of programs that America has on the nuclear weapons side, where maybe it will be permanent and accepted. 
   As we discuss the international treaty prohibiting underground testing, there will be a lot of discussion about whether this approach is adequate over time to let us sign a treaty that we will never do underground testing again. That will be a separate debate, but it will turn, to some extent, on the credibility and reliability of this science-based stockpile stewardship. So I am very pleased we were able to fund that at a very healthy level, and I am pleased that we have been able to get this bill to this point. The House and Senate passed versions of their respective bills and had very different priorities. I am not critical, but for some time I worried whether we simply would be able to reach an agreement because we were so far apart in terms of the amount of funding for this bill and the amount of money for the nuclear weapons side. 
   However, a very distinguished California legislator who has been in the House a long time is Chairman PACKARD. He chairs the subcommittee in the House. We met 2 weeks ago and dedicated ourselves to a chairmen's recommendation on all items. I will tell you that I have the greatest respect for Chairman PACKARD. He is new at this job, but he is not new at being a legislator. Together, we have overcome differences that, had they occurred between two other chairmen, might have been irreconcilable. 
   I must acknowledge openly that this subcommittee has a wonderful minority leader in the name of the minority whip for the Democratic Party, Senator REID. Senator HARRY REID understands these issues. He is growing, and if he is not already, he will be a national spokesman when we get off track, and don't worry about maintaining this nuclear stockpile until we have a different world or until we have a different policy about what we are going to do with our nuclear weapons and how many we are going to have, et cetera. 
   So in the conference report before you, we have recognized that the Senate is as interested in water projects as is the House, and the conference has provided water projects. We all know 
   what those are. They are in every State. They are flood protection projects, Corps of Engineers projects, dams and the like; they are the dredging of the harbors of America to keep them sound and in an appropriate maintenance of depth and the like. We have moved in their direction by increasing the water projects in our bill $415 million over the level proposed in the Senate. 
   However, as we have done this, we have been very strict about not including newly authorized projects included in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 or any that might be brought to our attention. Even those that were authorized in that act are so numerous and so expensive that, if we started to give one Senator one piece of that, either Democrat or Republican, or similarly in the House, there would be no end to how many projects we would have to fund. 
   So we stuck to our guns in that regard and we did not put any of those projects, and we did not put in any unauthorized projects, which I think many people urged us to do over time, and we are pleased to make that announcement. As I indicated, if we tried to add those, we would be overwhelmed and we probably would not be here today. 
   As we have increased water projects, we decreased funding for some of the accounts the Senate proposed. The weapons activities of the environmental management, science, and energy research accounts have borne a portion of the reduction. I am here to say that we have done quite well, and I believe those programs can continue at a pretty good level, in particular, those centering on science-based stockpile stewardship. 
   Finally, we had to deal with a number of very onerous, general provisions in the House bill, and I believe those issues have been resolved to our satisfaction. I don't believe, on many of them, there is any concern at this point about the way we wrapped them up, be it on power marketing or on the nuclear weapons or the laboratories. I need to address Secretary Richardson's views. 
   First of all, I am very pleased the President of the United States has indicated that he will sign the Defense authorization bill. That is the bill that authorizes the entire funding for the military of the United States, which also bears an amendment that will establish within the Department of Energy a new entity, a semiautonomous agency that will be in charge of all the nuclear weapons activity--the most significant reform in perhaps 28 to 30 years in a department that has grown like Topsy and is filled with programs that don't necessarily relate one to another. We will carve out of it a management scheme that will be far more accountable, reliable, and trustworthy than we had before. 
   Now, obviously, those specifics in that new scheme are not funded precisely, but they are funded in the general sense, and we hope Secretary Richardson and the President will begin quickly to implement that new management scheme so we can show the American people that there is a better way to do it. None of this casts any aspersions on Secretary Richardson. He inherited this department, which has no accountability to speak of, with reference to secret activities. It is very hard to find who is responsible if something goes wrong. 
   In many other respects, it is very dysfunctional in terms of the way it manages things. We have attempted to pursue with vigor some new management projects in terms of major projects. 
   Secretary Richardson in his press release of last night said we did not do well enough, we deny that $35 million in cybersecurity upgrades. I want to address the situation in two regards. First, in response to the problems at the Department, whether cybersecurity or other problems, Secretary Richardson has taken an oversight approach. That means more independent, internal watchdogs, security czar, a counterintelligence czar. 
   As many as my colleagues know, more layering at more levels of management, while well intentioned, can have the opposite effect. Making watchdog groups responsible for safety, health, or security removes that from the day-to-day responsibilities of the Department employees. 
   I want to address cybersecurity in another manner with reference to the specific item the Secretary raised about not funding $35 million in new money. Let me say what we have funded in that regard: Nuclear safety guards and security, $69.1 million, $10 million over the request to protect against physical and cyberintrusions; security investigations, $35 million, $3 million over the request; independent oversight, $5 million to support the new office reporting directly to the Secretary. 
   We believe when those are added up, that is about all a Department can assimilate unless one assumes there is a renewed vigor in security by overlapping of these new pieces of the Department that the Secretary has announced. We believe when they begin  to reorganize this, they will find this is plenty of money to do the security work under the new streamlined agency. We never intended to do anything but fund adequately the notions expressed in the Secretary's letter. 
   He mentioned a project in the State of Tennessee, the Spallation Neutron Source, a new project of high excitement in the science community. It has had difficulty meeting its goals of meeting scheduled attainment of construction, and it may very well be a case of overruns where it will spend more than expected. Nonetheless, it is important we proceed. The House only funded it for $50 million. We funded it for $150 million. I regret to say I could only split the difference--$100 million plus $17 million to operate. Obviously, the Secretary would like $130 or $140 million. I couldn't do it. I hope the project can continue in this scaled-down number. I remain committed. I believe the subcommittee remains committed to it. I think everybody ought to know we will eventually take care of it. It will not be delayed very long based upon underfunding this year. 
   With reference to other matters in this bill, I have worked with the Department on various issues the administration is considering with reference to a possible supplemental request. I suggest it is impossible to fund the Department of Energy request regarding their computers in the weapons complex. They indicate it would cost approximately $450 million next year. That is $150 million per laboratory and $150 million for the production complex. There is no way we could fund that kind of money in these appropriations. We leave it to the administration. If they seek this in a supplemental next year, we will look at it carefully. We stand ready eventually to fund that. It is not possible in a budget of this size to fund this year $450 million for cybersecurity. It is not possible. 
   DOE has also reviewed its fiscal security. I am hearing reports of substantial costs that may need to be incurred in the coming year to improve fiscal security. However, in our conference with the House, it was made clear we have never before been told cybersecurity or fiscal security problems were the result of lack of funding. The problem may very well be more than that and may be a combination of things. We stand ready and willing to help. 
   Senators KYL and MURKOWSKI have proposed, along with this Senator, reform in the Department which I outlined early in my remarks. When that reform is made and we begin to implement the so-called National Security Administration, I will be open to reviewing all costs necessary to ensure our nuclear weapons complex is safe. I am not going to try to resolve this problem solely by putting huge amounts of new money in before we have the new agency beginning to streamline itself pursuant to the new bill which will soon be signed by the President when he puts his signature on the defense authorization. 
   Regarding wetlands provisions contained in the House version, I will summarize the conference agreement which I think is acceptable to the administration. It is a very difficult issue, and it is very dear to many House Members. The legislation contains $5 million for the Corps to fully implement an administrative appeals process for their regulatory reform. This is the so-called 404 permitting of the Corps: The process shall provide for a single level of appeal for jurisdictional determination. 
   The conferees dropped the language proposed by the House which would have made the determinations the final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, thus permitting early appeal to the Federal court system. 
   The conference agreement also includes language proposed by the House requiring the Corps to prepare a report regarding the impacts of proposed replacement permits for the nationwide permit of 25 on the regulatory branch workload and compliance costs. 
   The conference dropped language that would require the report be submitted to Congress by December 30, 1999, and dropped language that would hold matters in abeyance until the report was forthcoming. This part of the bill was worked out carefully with representatives of the executive branch, and I believe it is acceptable to them. 
   I had one other issue I wanted to state here for the RECORD because my colleagues from the State of Arkansas, Senators HUTCHINSON and LINCOLN, wanted to have explained a project called Grande Prairie in the State of Arkansas which is not funded in this bill. 
   The Grande Prairie project in Arkansas, which has an overall long-term Federal cost of perhaps as much as $245 million, will provide ground water protection for agricultural water supply and environmental restoration in rural areas of Arkansas. Funding at $8 million was provided in 1999 to initiate construction. Since the appropriation, the Corps of Engineers has used only $3.8 million, with $5 million being reprogrammed from the project for use in other activities. This leaves about $1.2 million for use in the year 2000. 
   The Corps has been having problems with local sponsors finalizing their cost-sharing agreement which is reviewed before construction can begin. Some local interests believe it is cheaper for them to find other options rather than to come up with their cost share. For the project to proceed, the cost share agreements must be entered into. The attitude of some is, this is complicating efforts to execute a local cost-sharing agreement. 
   We have clearly indicated that the Corps of Engineers has not been able to use the $8 million appropriated and it is unlikely significant funds can be used in 2000. The conference agreement leaves an estimated $1.2 million as carryover funding, and the managers' statement states that the conferees' expectation is that if issues surrounding the project are resolved, conferees expect the Corps to reprogram funding back to the project for construction. 
   I hope that is satisfactory. I have indicated the same in a letter to Senator HUTCHINSON, who inquired about this.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit for the RECORD the official Budget Committee scoring of the pending bill--H.R. 2605, the energy and water development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. 
   The conference agreement provides $21.3 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $13.3 billion in new outlays to support the programs of the Department of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of Reclamation, and related Federal agencies. The bill provides the bulk of funding for the Department of Energy, including Atomic Energy Defense Activities and civilian energy research and development (R&D) other than fossil energy R&D and energy conservation programs. 
   When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the conference report totals $21.3 billion in BA and $20.8 billion in outlays for FY 2000. The conference report is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for BA, and $29 million below the 302(b) allocation for outlays. 
   The conference report is $0.1 billion in BA and $0.5 billion in outlays above the 1999 level. The conference report is $0.3 billion in both BA and outlays below the President's budget request for FY 2000.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments on the other side of the aisle about the management of things around here and how we could not get this bill finished on time and what a mess everything is. I remind Senators, obviously, we are going to have to make some major change beyond the process we have because it might startle some to know that since 1950--that is almost 50 years--we have completed our appropriations bills on time twice--twice. 
   What is all the talk about? Since 1950, that side of the aisle has controlled the Senate three-quarters of the time. So three-quarters of the time since 1950, all the appropriations bills--including Labor, Health, and Human Services--have been completed twice on time and sent to the President. 
   I submit, if my colleagues want to get things done on time, let's change the process and let's not do it every year; let's do it every 2 years. At least if we go over, we will be all right for 2 years rather than have it right back in our laps in 6 months, doing it all over again.  
   In addition, I heard from the other side of the aisle some comments about how difficult it was to meet the caps, how difficult it was not to take any money from Social Security, as if it were a Republican problem. One Senator--I will not use names, but the Senator who mentioned that was a Senator who came to the floor and asked for $8 billion on an emergency basis for the farm problem in America. 
   If my colleagues are wondering how come we have a difficult time, it is because somebody comes down and adds $8 billion that we did not expect to spend and we have to accommodate in some way so we do not use Social Security money, and that does not make it any easier. 
   I am not objecting to that. It will probably come out of the Senate and House before long at $7 billion, $7.5 billion, and an overwhelming number of House Members and Senators will think it is right. I am suggesting it is not always those who are trying to manage things on the majority side who cause the problems that make it difficult to get things done. 
   I do not choose to go beyond that. The President submitted a budget to us that was totally in error of the budget caps. It used Social Security money. And then we are criticized because we are having a difficult time dealing with it. The President had new taxes he added and then spent them in his bill. We have chosen to have a policy of no new taxes to meet our appropriations bills. 
   There are a number of things the President did that we cannot do. Here is one: The President is talking about Medicare, saying we ought to reform it before we have a tax cut for the American people. The President had $27 billion of cuts in Medicare in his budget. He did not tell us about that. We told you about that. It is long forgotten. In fact, the number may be higher. It may be 35. Anyway, it is 27 or more. 
   We had to pay for that in our budget; it was not the right thing to do. The President might have thought so, but nobody in the Congress did. It has not been easy. 
   Nonetheless, we are going to have a pretty good year. We are going to have a pretty good year because when we are finished, we will have dramatically increased defense, and part of it will be an emergency because that is what it is. We will get all the appeals done and some of the advance funding that is legitimate and right. 
   The President had $21 billion in advance funding, and now there are people on the other side wondering what that is, as if we invented it. It has been around for a long time. In fact, there is $11 billion of it in the budget we are living with right now, which means nothing more than, you account for the money in the year in which you spend it rather than the year in which you appropriate it. We will have some of that, too--maybe as much as the President had; I don't know. But how are we going to meet these targets if we are not permitted to do that, when the President is challenging us that we are not doing what he wanted us to do--that is his big challenge. How can we do that? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through September 24, 1999. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Res. 209, a resolution to provide budget levels in the Senate for purposes of fiscal year 1999, as amended by  S. Res. 312. The budget levels have also been revised to include adjustments made on May 19, 1999, to reflect the amounts provided and designated as emergency requirements. The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $0.5 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $0.2 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.2 billion above the revenue floor in 1999. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $56.0 billion, which is equal to the maximum deficit amount for 1999 of $56.0 billion. 
   Since my last report, dated July 19, 1999, the Congress has passed and the President has signed the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act (P.L. 106-50), the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Act (P.L. 106-51), the Water Resources Development Act (P.L. 106-53), and the Global Exploration and Development Corporation Act (P.L. 106-54). These actions have changed the current level of budget authority and outlays.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, for the people of America who are interested in where we are on the tax cuts and the President's message regarding the veto, I thought I might share my version of what has happened. 
   First of all, the main reason the President has given for vetoing the tax bill is we need to take care of Social Security and Medicare first. 
   The question is, When will the American people ever get a tax cut? If we don't ask that question, we don't put anything in perspective as to where we are and where we will be. 
   I will share why I believe the tax cut was right and why I believe what the President is talking about is not right and will probably yield to no tax cut to the American people. 
   First, I might ask rhetorically, how long has the President been President? I guess he has been President almost 7 years. He will then have an eighth year. Whatever legacy he will leave the American people is close at hand. Why have we not solved Social Security in the 6 years and 9 months he has been President? But now that we have a surplus, when we can give the American people a little piece of it in a tax cut, all of a sudden the President thinks we ought to save Social Security. Why didn't we save it last year or the year before? 
   Why didn't we save it after the President conducted hearings in three or four cities in America and said he understood it and he thought he knew what we ought to do and he sends a package. However, in terms of reform he does almost nothing and sets up a new fund to put in a piece of everybody's Social Security money, not in individual investment accounts but, in a new trust fund to be run by--whom? Seven or nine people; appointed by whom? The Government of the United States. Who believes the Government is going to manage the funds for Social Security in a way to make money and enhance the value of their pension plans? Who believes that? Hardly anyone. 
   Second, who believes we ought to have the Federal Government, with appointed people, investing billions and billions, maybe even trillions of dollars in the stock of America and in bonds in America, without being very concerned whether they will distort the market? Instead of being a free market with equities, loans and bonds, it will be a market controlled by what the Federal Government thinks? 
   Just think of that, a year after it exists there will be somebody on the floor of this Senate saying: We should not invest any of that money from Social Security in cigarette companies. Boy, everyone will say, of course, we should do that. Then next year there will be a report that obesity comes from McDonald's and other companies that sell us quick-fix foods. So somebody will say: Why would we want to invest money in McDonald's? They add to obesity in America. Then, who knows what else? We will distort the American market. 
   Everybody who is thinking understands the President has not submitted anything credible on Social Security. Is it not interesting, there we are showing a $3.4 trillion surplus over the next decade, $2 trillion of which belongs to Social Security, and they will get it--but what about the rest of it? Should we sit around and wait to spend it? Or should we give some of it back in an orderly manner over a decade? 
   Mr. President, your concerns about Social Security and Medicare do not ring true. They come into existence when you do not want to give the American taxpayers a tax cut. That is why all of a sudden they come up. Now you have even indicated we might be able to get that done in a few weeks. Get what done? Fix Social Security and Medicare, which you have not been able to fix in almost 7 years in office? In a few weeks we can fix it so we can give the American people a tax cut? 
   Friends, you understand in a Republican budget there is a very large set-aside that is not spent on anything that can be used to repair Medicare. The problem is the President does not have a plan into which anybody wants to buy. He sent us a plan to fix prescription drugs for a part of America that might need them under Medicare, and nobody likes his plan--Democrat or Republican. So why doesn't he sit down and talk seriously about fixing that? 
   A commission that was bipartisan, that came up with a reasonably good plan--bipartisan, bicameral, citizens and legislators--he caused that to be distorted and thrown away by asking his representatives to vote no when everybody else voted yes. Because we needed a supermajority, it failed by one vote. We had a plan. 
   If I were a senior, I would say: Madam President, it looks to me as if you do not want my children and my grandchildren to have a tax cut because you are trying to use as an excuse that we have to fix Medicare and Social Security when you do not need that money that is going in the tax cut to fix either of them. Why did it take him so long to fix them, if all of a sudden we must fix them in the next few weeks in order to get a tax cut? 
   Frankly, there are a lot of other reasons the President has given, but these are the ones that are politically aimed at America. If you read the polls, if you ask the question the wrong way, Americans will say: Fix Medicare and Social Security first. But if you said to them in a poll question: If we have sufficient money left over to give the American people a tax cut and we have enough money for Social Security and Medicare, would you want to give them a tax cut? watch the answer. The answer, instead of what they are quoting around, would be 85 percent. That happens to be the facts.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about education because somehow or another we have ourselves involved in competing resolutions about the funding of education when we do not know how much education is going to get funded because the appropriation bill has not been produced yet. If this were a court of law, the Daschle resolution would be dismissed as being premature. There is no issue yet. But we will have to debate it and vote on it. Before we are finished, the Appropriations Committee that handles Labor-Health and Human Services will produce a bill that is more consistent with the budget resolution than anything else. 
   Regardless of what it looked like 3 or 4 weeks ago, they are going to have sufficient resources. Remember, the President of the United States advance appropriated, in his function and in his budget, $21 billion. We are going to do some of the same things because they are legitimate and proper. When you take that into consideration, frankly, the Daschle resolution is talking about a nonreality.  
   I can say there is a high probability, and if I had one more afternoon to go talk to a couple of Senators on that committee, I would predict with certainty--but I can say with almost certainty that the subcommittee of the Senate on Labor-Health and Human Services will appropriate more money in education than the President put in his budget. When you combine what they are going to give, it will be more than the President's. 
   Is it going to have every single item in it? I do not know. In fact, before we vote on the final determination of education funding, the Senate will debate the issue on an appropriations bill which I have just described which will have more funding in it than the President's. We will probably decide in a floor fight on this floor how that education program should be structured. I think the occupant of the chair knows that Republicans have been working very hard at loosening up this money from the strings and rigidities of Washington into something that will go local schools in a looser fashion, from which we can get accountability and flexibility. We give flexibility and we expect accountability. It will not be all the line items the President wants, but it will be more money than the President requested. 
   So I do not know what we are voting about in these resolutions. They are premature. The only guidance we have is the budget resolution that Republicans voted for and which said that of the domestic programs, there are a number of priorities but the highest one is education. The Senator occupying the chair voted for that resolution. In fact, it said we should appropriate, over the next 5 years, in excess of $28 billion--$26 or $28 billion more than we had been appropriating regularly under the President's approach. Over 10 years, it should be somewhere around $85 billion or $90 billion more. That is the only direction and guidance we have. 
   That is not binding. But if ever there was something you know you are going to do when you pass a budget resolution, it is this because the American people think it is right. But the American people do not think we are making headway with the existing education programs. They would be thrilled if we gave more money and did it differently. Why should we be doing it the same old way which we have been doing it, which has no accountability and is all targeted whether the schools need it or not? They have to put on the same pair of socks and same shoes in every school district in America. They have to fit into the same shoes in order to get the Federal money, whether they have the problems or not. 
   Then we have the great program that we call IDEA, where we told them you get started with special education and we will end up paying a substantial portion of it. We did not. We cheated. We made them pay a lot more than they were supposed to after we mandated it. Under Republican leadership, we are putting more and more money into that program for special education because we told them to do it, and we said we would pay a certain percent and we never came close. We keep putting more in than the President. The President complains about some targeted program we do not fund, but we fund IDEA and it loosens up money the States would otherwise have to spend for a program that we mandated, that we never lived up to our commitment on, and that is pretty good and we probably will do that this year, provide more funding than the President asked for. 
   So I don't know, when this 5:30 vote comes, what we are voting on. I think we ought to put them both off and let's see what the appropriations subcommittee does. But if we do not, I can say I don't know why anybody would vote for the Daschle resolution. It is a statement of unreality. It is a statement of hypotheticals. It is a statement of: Here is how much money they have to spend in that subcommittee, so I am going to do some arithmetic and assume everything is going to get cut 17 percent. That is about where the 17-percent number comes from, but it does not mean anything because nobody suggests that all the money Labor-Health and Human Services gets is going to be divided the way any Senator currently thinks it should be. 
   It is going to be done by a committee that has been doing it for many years. 
   Those are my two thoughts for the day. I have used about 5 minutes on each, and I talked faster than I normally do because I did not want to stay down here too long. Other Senators want to speak. I repeat: If we cannot give the American taxpayers a cut in their taxes when in the past 6 1/2 years the tax take of America, what we have taken from the taxpayers, is up 58 percent--got it?--the tax receipts of America in the last 6 years 9 months is up 58 percent. The average check increase for American working people is up 11 percent, and the cumulative increase of Government annually over 7 years--6 years 9 months--is 22. 
   Who was cut short? A 58-percent tax increase, 22-percent growth in Government, 11-percent growth in the paychecks of Americans. They need some of their money back. That is what that issue is about. If not now, when? On education, wait and see. We will do better than the President. It will be hard to convince the President, and he will have something to say about it. We ought to put up a nice big board and add up the numbers when we are finished with appropriations. We will do better than he did. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1596, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and independent agencies appropriations bill for 2000. 
   This bill provides new budget authority of $93.6 billion and new outlays of $55.5 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies. 
   I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill that complies with the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. This is one of the most difficult bills to manage with its varied programs and challenging allocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands made of it while not exceeding its budget and is a strong candidate for enactment. So I commend my friend, the chairman, for his efforts and leadership. 
   When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $91.3 billion in BA and $103.8 billion in outlays. The total bill is under the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. 
   I ask Members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which would cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge the speedy adoption of this bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, historically, the royalty has been calculated at the wellhead. The essence of the problem is that MMS decided they want to change that--in many instances, tax it as a royalty many miles downstream. They contend there is a duty to market. A court has already ruled there is no duty to market. They want to come in by the back door and establish regulations and rules that will, indeed, tax beyond the real value of the oil, based upon rules and regulations. It is a new tax, a backdoor way of taking away our prerogative. That is why we have been fighting this for the last 3 years.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first thank Senator HUTCHISON for her kind remarks. I tell her, as cosponsor, what a pleasure it is to work with her. We have been sponsor or cosponsor--depending on the year--of this measure for the last 3 years. Hang in there, I say to the Senator. We have not lost yet. We will not lose this time either because we are right. 
   I want to give a quick summary of the issues, as I see them. When you get right down to it, it isn't all that complicated. 
   First, we need to have new MMS regulations, but the regulations they steadfastly insist on putting forth are fatally flawed. During the moratorium that the Congress has imposed, several of us--Senators LANDRIEU, NICKLES, THOMAS, HUTCHISON, ENZI, BREAUX, MURKOWSKI, and others--have tried to get the agency to fix the regulations, and they stubbornly refuse. In fact, at the request of the administration, we have all sat around the table on at least two occasions, if not more, with the MMS people and the oil people, sitting around talking about the flaws in it, as the industry sees it. But they refuse to take care of the real problems and stubbornly insist they are right. 
   Procedurally, the regulation writing process has been tainted. Let me make sure everybody understands that. People involved in writing the regulations were taking $350,000 payments from the Project on Government Oversight, POGO. When the procedure is contaminated, the best way to proceed is to discard the tainted work product and start over. That is why we have a country with laws. Process is important. People writing 
   regulations are not supposed to be paid by someone who has an interest in the outcome. 
   Can you imagine if the Senate were debating an issue and the shoe was on the other foot what we would be hearing here on the floor? If somebody had taken money, in this case, from the oil or gas companies, think where we would be. The whole process would be thrown out. We need to get to the bottom of the $350,000 payments from the Project on Government Oversight, which is known as POGO. 
   Senators MURKOWSKI, HUTCHISON, NICKLES, and I have written several letters to Secretary Babbitt on this issue. Because of the procedural irregularities alone, the moratorium should remain in place until satisfactory answers are provided regarding the wrongdoing. It has been months, and we really have no satisfactory explanation. 
   That is absurd. No other description is accurate. These MMS regulations are unworkable, arbitrary, complicated, and beyond what they ought to be. One producer with one well with one kind of oil would have to value his oil in 10 different ways. There is no justification for such complexity. It can only be labeled an abuse of power. 
   In addition, the MMS could even second guess, audit, and sue that producer on seven different theories. This is a scheme that is unnecessarily complicated and plainly unworkable. We ought to be able to do better. Regardless of which industry is on the other side of this, we ought to be able to do it better and make it workable. My conclusion is that these regulations are borderline absurd. 
   The proposed rules exceed the MMS authority. These regulations raise royalty rates by imposing a nonexistent and recently quasi-judicially rejected duty to market. The proposed rules are premised on a rejected legal theory called duty to market. 
   The relationship between the producer and the MMS is spelled out in the lease. It is a concise document defining the responsibility and duties of the producer and the MMS. Oil is valued at the lease, period. That is what the lease says. The lease is based upon statutory language in the law. 
   The Mineral Lands Act, 30 USC 226(b), which governs leases for onshore Federal lands, specifically states:  
   A lease shall be conditioned upon the payment of a royalty rate of not less than 12.5 percent of amount or value of the production removed or sold from the lease; [that is] at the time the oil is removed from the well.  
   That is the definition. 
   The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 USC 1331, et seq., governs Federal leases for drilling offshore. The act requires offshore leases to pay:  
   A royalty to the lessor on oil and gas ..... saved, removed or sold from the lease.  
   By regulation, MMS wants to unilaterally rewrite the leases and the law and create a duty to market out of thin air. Duty to market is Government mooching because it wants to increase the royalty amount owed but will not allow a deduction for the costs incurred in getting the higher price. 
   In other words, they would like the higher of the prices at the wellhead or at some other point. And if the higher one 
   happens to be downstream with a lot of costs involved in getting it there, they don't even want to permit you to deduct the cost of getting it from the wellhead to the downstream or upstream source. They want to get the highest royalty and, thus, make the business swallow, without deductibility, the cost of getting it there. 
   We don't do that anywhere in American capitalism. We don't do it in our IRS. We don't do it in simple, good CPA accounting procedures. 
   By analogy, under today's law, the MMS bases its royalty valuation on essentially the wholesale price for the oil. Under the proposed rule, they are basing the royalty on the retail price, which is not authorized by Federal law. The rule does not allow certain transportation and other costs necessary to get the higher price to be deducted from the royalty payment. 
   When I went to law school, I was taught that one party couldn't unilaterally change a contract. When I went to law school, regulations were to implement, not rewrite, the law. Regulations were to be consistent with the law. I was taught that agencies did not have the authority to rewrite contracts through regulations. MMS lawyers must have missed that week of law school because that is exactly what they are trying to do now. If MMS can change contracts through regulation, in direct violation of the law of the land, why can't other agencies do the same? 
   For example, why can't Medicare unilaterally, without congressional approval, change its contract with Medicare recipients and say: You have a duty to stay well; Medicare won't pay your Medicare bills because you breached your duty to stay well? That would be absurd, just as this new way of charging royalties is absurd. 
   If we allow MMS to change the royalty rate, there is nothing to keep the IRS from saying: We want to get more money from American families. So they will issue some complicated regulations and raise their taxes. That would be a usurpation of the exclusive role of Congress. What MMS is trying to do is a usurpation of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress. 
   There is no duty to market in the lease. There is no court-ordered duty to market in the law of the land. It is a figment of the ``tax-raising imagination'' of MMS. They want to raise royalty rates, and that is it. Creating a duty to market when none exists usurps the prerogatives of the Congress and ignores the precedents set by the Department's own review board. 
   In May, the Interior Board of Land Appeals, known as the IBLA, ruled that there was no duty to market in a case known as Seagull Energy Corporation, Case No. 148 IBLA 3100 (1999). The IBLA has the expertise in these royalty cases. This was a 1999 case before the IBLA. 
   Secretary Babbitt reversed that in a case involving Texaco, Case No. MMS-92-0306-0&G. The Secretary unilaterally, and in direct contravention of the moratorium imposed by this committee, overruled its own Board of Land Appeals. 
   I want to commend Senator NICKLES for developing legislation to clarify the authority MMS has regarding oil royalty valuation. Simply stated--and I believe he is right--it stands for the proposition that there has never been,  is not, nor ever shall be a duty to market. If you read a Federal oil and gas lease, there is no mention of a duty to market. It has been the Mineral Management Service position that the duty to market is an implied covenant in the lease. 
   This legislation says the MMS is wrong. That is what the legislation Senator NICKLES has introduced, working its way through Congress, says. 
   Let me back up and explain the issue and why this legislation is needed. Oil and gas producers doing business on Federal leases pay royalties to the Federal Government based on fair market value. Under this administration, this is easier said than done. 
   One of the longstanding disputes between Congress and the MMS has been the development of workable royalty valuation regulations that can articulate just exactly what fair market value is. 
   Cynthia Quarterman, former director of MMS, set out the Interior Department's position that fair market value includes a duty to market the lease production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor but without the Federal Government paying its share of the costs. Many of these costs are transportation costs, and they are significant. MMS calls it a duty to market. I believe it is the Federal Government mooching, trying to get paid without bearing its share of the cost. 
   The bill states congressional intent: No duty to market; no Federal Government mooching. 
   Let me be clear: Where there is a duty to market, it is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Congress. It is not the job of lawyers at MMS to raise the congressionally set royalty rate through the back door. The so-called duty to market is a backdoor royalty increase, and there can be no doubt about it. The MMS has been unable to develop workable royalty valuation rules, and Congress has had to impose a moratorium on these regulations. The core issue has been the duty to market, and I believe I have explained why this is a serious problem. 
   Nobody is attempting to do anyone a favor. Nobody is attempting to be prejudicial toward the MMS and the Federal Government's tax take. What we are talking about is simple, plain fairness. I won't say equity, because as a matter of fact it is law, not equity, that sets this. It is probably equitable also. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 Conference Report before us today. Chairman WARNER and his Committee have done an excellent job in prioritizing available funds to provide for our national defense. 
   Any deficiencies in this authorization bill are a result of overall budget constraints and expanded commitments rather than inattention to our nation's vital security needs. I appreciate the Committees efforts to bring direct spending under control in this bill and conform to the Budget Act limitations. 
   As Chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee I know how difficult the exercise of prioritizing funds is. Every year all of the Congressional Defense Committees face tough choices as to how to best allocate funding so as to meet our immediate defense needs without sacrificing our future. As budgets shrink and global commitments swell, this task becomes increasingly difficult. 
   Mr. President, I would like to underscore the problems Congress currently faces. Here my message is two-fold: first, we do not live in a peaceful world; and, secondly, we cannot defend our national interests if we are not committed to a strong military. 
   I, and many of my colleagues, believe that U.S. prosperity rests on a strong, dedicated military. Everyone has heard the phrase ``peace through strength.'' Perhaps some believe that having been coined during the Cold War, this adage is anachronistic. I strongly disagree. 
   Continued economic growth and the absence of a tangible, imminent threat to our security breed complacency. Complacency characterizes the current attitude toward our national security. 
   As victors of the Cold War we appear to have a false sense of security about this new era. Thus far, the results of U.S. military intervention have not offered evidence that we should worry. 
   However, our current military superiority is a product of the massive investments made during the Cold War. This Administration has not sustained the necessary investments. At the same time, they've increased U.S. military commitments overseas--often without clearly defining the strategic objective of those deployments. 
   Complacency regarding our nation's strategic interests sends a message that ripples through every level of our national security apparatus--from our current inability to recruit the requisite talent to the trained pilots, technicians, and mid-career military professionals leaving for private sector jobs. 
   Although diffuse and more difficult to discern, threats to our national security do exist. 
   Instability in numerous regions throughout the world create security risks with adverse economic, and potentially strategic, impact. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also presents a grave threat. NATO intervention in Kosovo further aggravated potential threats to our national security--specifically, damage to our relations with Russia and China. In addition, Kosovo deployments will stretch an already overextended military to its limits--not to mention a limited, but not insignificant, contribution to peacekeeping efforts in East Timor. 
   Peace through strength is still an appropriate theme. Complacency erodes our potential. If we demonstrate a strong commitment to the men and women in uniform, they will have a good reason to join and to stay. 
   Mr. President, with those thoughts in mind, I would like to briefly discuss  the work of Senator WARNER's Committee on the Conference Report before us today. 
   First, a critical initial step in meeting our commitment to the men and women in uniform is found in the pay raises, incentive pay, and pension reforms found in this bill. As of January 1 next year, all members of the uniformed services will receive a 4.8% increase in their monthly pay. Furthermore, pay increases beyond that date will be one half a percent above inflation. 
   The Conference Report outlines special incentive pay and enlistment bonuses to a variety of needed specialists or highly-trained personnel in our armed forces. 
   Lastly, improvements to military retirement pay and eligibility in the Thrift Savings Plan will provide additional reasons to join and continue serving in our military services. 
   According to a GAO study requested by myself and Senator STEVENS military pay and retirement packages are not the core reasons for our retention problems. However, these improvements offer an important first step toward addressing quality of life shortfalls in the lives of our military men and women. 
   The Committee also increased readiness funding beyond the Administration's request. In addition to the $2.25 billion of emergency money, this conference report adds about $1.6 billion in readiness-related accounts. 
   The President's budget only included $5.4 billion in military construction to fund $8.5 billion worth of projects. This ``split funding'' approach was to be a one-time accounting gimmick to create room for other spending and still remain under the budget caps. I applaud the Authorization Committees' decision not to use this approach for military construction. 
   The pay and pension reforms as well as additional funding for military readiness and military construction will alleviate some of the problems in the immediate term. 
   Necessary still is to address the foreign policy decisions that have led to the high operational tempo. More money cannot resolve questions regarding overseas operations or the organizational ability of any one military branch to respond to post-Cold War deployments. 
   These are systemic problems borne of both domestic and foreign policy decisions. Unless and until we clarify the U.S. position and responsibilities in this new era, we will not know the rules for engagement or intervention. This dilemma has profound implications for the size, structure, and capabilities of our military. 
   There are several items of significant impact on the state of New Mexico included in this authorization bill. I would like to briefly discuss a few of them. 
   Although foremost a matter of national security, the provisions on the Department of Energy restructuring also will have a substantial impact on thousands of workers in New Mexico. These provisions ensure that brilliant science and tight security are compatible within our nuclear weapons infrastructure. 
   Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) Report demanded legislative changes. It clearly stated, ``The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven incapable of reforming itself.'' The PFIAB Report's specific recommendations included: 
   Creation of a new, semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   Streamline the Nuclear Stewardship management structure. 
   Ensure effective administration of safeguards, security, and counterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by creating a coherent security/CI structure within the new agency. 
   I and my colleagues, Senator KYL and Senator MURKOWSKI, followed these recommendations closely in drafting the legislation for DOE restructuring. The creation of a semi-autonomous agency for our nuclear weapons work will implement a true ``Chain of Command'' approach, with all the discipline this entails. I truly believe that this approach, if it had been used in the past, may have avoided some of these security problems and will help us avoid them in the future. 
   These changes are desperately needed at the Department of Energy, and they must be made now. 
   Another national defense issue that has substantial implications for New Mexico is the McGregor Range withdrawal. 
   McGregor Range is one of six military parcels withdrawn from public domain in 1986. These parcels comprise nearly 30 percent of the Department of Defense's 25 million acres. McGregor Range comprises nearly 700,000 of Fort Bliss's 1.12 million acres. The Fort Bliss garrison is adjacent to El Paso, Texas, but McGregor Range is located entirely in New Mexico. 
   McGregor range is vital to military training and readiness. Fort Bliss has a critical role as a national center for air defense, and McGregor Range is essential for fulfilling that role. McGregor Range is the only range in the United States capable of training America's air and missile defense forces. Because all CONUS Patriot forces are stationed at Fort Bliss they depend on McGregor for the training needed to ensure their full readiness prior to deployment. 
   There is strong regional support for this renewal. 176 public comments expressed support for the Army's preferred alternative. An additional 26 expressed support for one of the other alternatives. The provisions in this bill will continue historic non-military uses of the range which include livestock grazing and hunting for 25 years. 
   Military training and testing requirements for McGregor Range are foreseen for at least the next 50-years based on weapons systems that are either currently fielded or are planned for fielding in the near future. For this reason, the Army's Environmental Impact Statement preferred a 50-year withdrawal. 
   My amendment to the Senate Defense Appropriations bill includes a 50-year withdrawal. I am pleased with the work of the Authorization Committee, but I still firmly believe that 25 years is not an adequate period of time for withdrawal of the McGregor Range. 
   Many important programs for the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland were authorized by the conferees. Aerospace propulsion programs at Phillips were increased by $6 million. An increase of $28.6 million above the $115.3 million budget request was authorized for Phillips' Exploratory Development programs. Advanced Spacecraft Technology programs received an additional $19.5 million authorization, including $5 million for the Scorpius Low-Cost Launch program. 
   Directed energy programs comprise a substantial proportion of New Mexico's defense related research, development, and testing initiatives. Different services are working on a variety of laser weapons to achieve better and cheaper cost-per-kill defenses against missiles. Chemical lasers development for the Airborne and Space Based Laser programs are authorized at almost $500 million annually. The pioneering work and ongoing basic research for these systems is at Phillips in Albuquerque. 
   With a view toward the future of laser weapons, this conference report requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a unified DoD laser master plan. The objective is to maximize the return on our investment in these important technologies by coordinating these efforts across the services and provide a roadmap for future development. I strongly support this effort. 
   The conferees also provided an additional $20 million authorization for solid state laser development and $10 million for the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL), programs which are tested at the High Energy Laser Test Facility (HELSTF) at White Sands Missile Range. HELSTF is also designated as the Army's Center of Excellence for all Army test and evaluation activities. 
   An additional $4 million is authorized for the Counterterror Technical Support program. This funding will support the cutting-edge research in blast mitigation materials and structures at New Mexico Tech. 
   Although the President's request included no funding for military construction at New Mexico's defense installations, the conferees added $9.8 million to renovate 76 units of housing at Holloman Air Force base and $14 million to replace cracked and deteriorating airfield ramps at Kirtland. Another $8.1 million is authorized to repair one of the main runways at Cannon Air Force base. In addition, the  New Mexico Air National Guard's Composite Support Complex at Kirtland is authorized at $9.7 million. All of these projects address quality of life or operational needs of the utmost importance to personnel at these installations. 
   Mr. President, again, I would like to thank Senator WARNER and the members of his Committee for their diligent work in allocating tight resources in the best feasible manner. 
   At the same time, I would like to reiterate my view that many of the problems we currently face in our Defense Committees result from inadequate definition of U.S. interests. 
   The systemic problems--retention, readiness, operational tempo--are a product of domestic and foreign policy decisions. We have neither clarified the U.S. position in the current international environment nor have we established relevant rules for U.S. engagement. Instead, we rely more and more on our military to compensate for failed diplomacy. Or we ask our soldiers to play referee in regions of the world teeming with ethnic conflict and territorial disputes. 
   Without first defining our national interest in this new era, we cannot pretend to downsize, right-size, or structure our military to adequately defend U.S. interests throughout the world. More importantly, without a clear picture of the appropriate military structure and necessary force capabilities we cannot answer the $280 billion question: How much is enough?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, this bill is a very important bill. The part I worked on is very small. It has to do with reforming the Department of Energy as it pertains to the handling and maintenance of nuclear weapons and everything that goes with them. 
   I compliment those who prepared the overall bill. It is a very good bill for the defense of our Nation, and it deserves the overwhelming support of the Senate. 
   We had no other way to accomplish something very important with reference to a Department of Energy that was found to be totally dysfunctional, not by those who have tried over the years to build some strength into that Department, some assurance that things would be handled well, but rather by a five-member select board that represented the President of the United States, headed by the distinguished former Senator Warren B. Rudman. 
   Those five members of the President's commission, with reference to serious matters that pertain to our national security, concluded that the Department of Energy could not handle the work of maintaining our weapons systems, maintaining them safe from espionage and spying, and could not handle an appropriate counterintelligence approach because there was no one responsible and, thus, everybody pinned the blame on someone else and we would get nowhere in terms of accountability.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely. 
   Mr. President, what I want to do is dispel any notion that the amendment that created a semiautonomous agency within the Department, to be headed by an assistant secretary who would be in charge of everything that has to do with nuclear weapons development--and they would do things in a semiautonomous way, not in the way that the rest of the Department of Energy does its business--is taking away the authority of the Secretary; that is, the Secretary of Energy. 
   The Department of Energy is an amorphous Department put together at a point in history when a lot of things were dumped in there. Some have no relationship to other matters in the Department. And, yes, we put the nuclear defense activities in that Department. 
   No one could contend that if the Congress of the United States, and the President concurring, wanted to take all of the nuclear weapons out of that Department and put them in an independent agency--which was one of the recommendations of the five-member panel--that that would be unconstitutional, illegal. And there would be no Secretary of Energy involved at all. 
   The other suggestion was, rather than make it totally independent, to leave it within the Department and make it semiautonomous. We did that. 
   The Secretary, and some of those arguing on behalf of a different approach, chose to say that the Secretary does not have enough to do and enough say-so about nuclear weapons development, and therefore it is wrong. 
   I want to read from the bill's two provisions.  
   In carrying out the functions of the administrator--  
   That is the new person in charge of the semiautonomous agency--  
   the undersecretary shall be subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary.  
   Second:  
   The Secretary shall be responsible for establishing policy for the National Nuclear Security Administration.  
   It goes on with two other provisions assuring that the overall policy is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. 
   But I remind everyone, had we chosen not to do that, it would have been legal. We could have taken it all out and had no Energy Secretary involved. We chose not to. We chose to say: Leave it there so there can be some cross-fertilization between the Energy Department's work and the nuclear activities on behalf of our military and our defense. 
   We got this finished, and we made accommodation on the floor of the Senate with reference to the environment. Never was it intended that the semiautonomous agency would be immune from any environmental law. In fact, the first writing of this bill had a legal opinion that if you do not mention it, it is subject to all environmental laws. 
   We came to the floor and some Members on the other side, I think quite properly, said: Why don't you specifically mention that the new semiautonomous agency is subject to the environmental laws? We did that. In fact, it says:  
   The administrator shall ensure that the administration complies with all applicable environmental, safety, health statutes, and substantive requirements. Nothing in this title shall diminish the authority of the Secretary of Energy to ascertain and ensure that compliance occurs.  
   Because we wrote it in, some quibble with the words that we used to write it in. Now they are saying: Are you sure you included everything? We thought we included everything by mentioning nothing; then we tried to include everything verbally and some said: You have to change the words because you really don't mean it. 
   There is nothing to indicate that we have exempted or immunized any of our environmental laws in this statute. They are totally applicable. It is just that the new administrator applies them to the nuclear weapons department separate and distinct from the rest of the activities of the Department of Energy--and it is high time, in my opinion. 
   There are some letters from attorneys general, and I just want to say I read some of them. I have no idea how they came to their conclusions. I will just cite one. The attorney general of Texas, in responding after he received an explanation of the bill from the distinguished chairman, Senator WARNER, wrote a letter saying: 
   After reading your letter, I am satisfied that this legislation was neither intended to affect existing waivers of Federal sovereign immunity nor to exempt in any way the NSAA--  
   The new semiautonomous agency--  
   from the same environmental laws and regulations applied before the reorganization.  
   For those attorneys general who are worried about Hanford out on the west coast--and it might be difficult for attorneys general in the States to be involved--let me remind them that facility does not even come under the jurisdiction of the new semiautonomous agency. It is not considered to be part of the current ongoing nuclear weapons activities. 
   In closing, I just want to make sure that my fellow Senators understand that some people working in the Department of Energy will say almost anything about us trying to reform it. Secretary Richardson is doing a good job for a department that is dysfunctional. He wakes up every week with something that has gone wrong. 
   We ought to start fixing it with the passage of this bill with a new semiautonomous agency in control. But there is a general that was hired named Habiger. He is the Secretary's czar for the Department right now. He went to the State of New Mexico and said--I am paraphrasing: I never involve myself in politics. Those are secret and private between me and my wife. However, in this case, I suggest that the creation of this semiautonomous agency is political. 
   I tried to find out who was playing politics. Was it the five-member commission that I just cited, headed by Warren Rudman, with one of the members, Dr. Sidney Drell, one of the most refined and articulate and knowledgeable people on this whole subject matter? Were they playing politics? Was the Senate playing politics when we got an overwhelming vote? What is the politics of it? 
   If you think the only way to preserve and maintain our nuclear weapons development and to maximize the opportunity for accountability and less opportunity for spying is to have a Secretary of Energy who runs that part of it, then you will not be happy. Because the truth of the matter is, the Secretary will be in charge overall, but there will be a single administrator in charge of this department in the future, with everything that has to do with nuclear, including its security; although in counterintelligence we have agreed with the administration, with the Secretary, and have permitted the counterintelligence to be in two places. There is a czar under the Secretary, and there will be somebody running the counterintelligence within the new semiautonomous agency.

With that, I yield the floor and say I hope the Senate, by bipartisan, overwhelming majorities, passes this bill with this amendment on it, which is going to be good for America, good for nuclear weapons, and it will diminish the chances for spying and counterintelligence to work against our nuclear weapons in the secrets that are so imperative. Let's look back on this day and say we finally did something to move in the right direction.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not take much time because there are so many people who want to speak to this bill and its many other ramifications. 
   My assessment was that the President was concerned about the environmental provisions. We went through it very carefully. I believe the President was satisfied that what we had done was intended to keep this semiautonomous agency totally within the purview of every environmental law of this land. 
   The second issue, obviously, had to do with counterintelligence because the Department under Bill Richardson had gone to a great deal of effort to create a policymaking mechanism for counterintelligence and had appointed somebody to be in charge of it. The amendment in its original form did not account for that. It put all of the counterintelligence within the new, semiautonomous agency. 
   That issue was raised with Chairman Rudman as he testified, and, as the distinguished chairman of the full committee indicates, it was raised to the committee by Mr. Lew from the OMB. Perhaps the good point was made. I think it could have gone either way. But I am certain that everybody involved in security will say it is all right the way it is. 
   Secretary Richardson made the point that there are some counterintelligence issues that are broader and apply in different places within the Department than just in the nuclear weapons part. You shouldn't have two kinds of policies developed on counterintelligence. So we said the policy will be developed in the Office of the Secretary and it will be implemented and carried out in toto for the nuclear part by the semiautonomous agency, and the Assistant Secretary, or administrator--whichever we choose to call him--implements 
   this provision. 
   I believe those are the most important issues of which we spoke. 
   I think the President clearly understood that you could manage a nuclear weapons system without a Secretary of Energy. You could do it similar to NASA, with perhaps a board of directors, and he even commented that certainly would not be illegal. But the point is, we want to leave it in the Department. But when you leave it there, you have to make it somewhat autonomous or you haven't changed anything. I think by the time we were finished that was well understood. 
   I believe we have a good bill with reference to reforming this Department. I think within a couple of years you will see security in a much better shape. I think you will see ``accountability'' as a word of which you will not only speak but you will know who is accurate. And it is high time, in my opinion. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator, Mr. WARNER, for involving me again here tonight. 
   I think I have said enough. I yield the floor. I hope the Senate passes this tomorrow overwhelmingly.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say for the RECORD that there are so many people who have worked hard on this legislation. I don't want the RECORD to even imply that I was more responsible than others. Maybe I worked earlier than some. But Senator KYL worked very hard. Senator MURKOWSKI conducted some marvelous hearings on the subject. Both the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Intelligence were greatly involved and, in fact, participated in helping us with this and supported it wholeheartedly. 
   The Senators on the floor from the Armed Services Committee, Senator BINGAMAN and Senator LEVIN, contributed to some positive things on the floor that were changed as a result of their concerns. I think altogether we have a bill that will work.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from Alabama, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, in a colloquy. 
   I want to begin by commending you, Senator SHELBY for the hard work you have done in crafting this Transportation appropriations bill. You have done a fine job under difficult circumstances in funding the priorities identified by the Committee in this bill, and providing increased flexibility to the states. 
   As you know, one of the more important highway programs in this bill for my home state of New Mexico is the Indian Reservation Roads program. The program is directed to about 22,000 miles of Bureau of Indian Affairs roads serving tribal lands. Of these roads, only 11 percent of the paved roads are rated as being in good condition. Close to 90 percent of the unpaved roads are know to be in poor condition. Indian Reservation Roads funds are critical to improving transportation for Native Americans in New Mexico. 
   I understand that in putting together this bill, the Chairman adjusted the revenue aligned budget authority (RABA) allocation formula, and that programs under the Federal Lands Highways program will receive a total of $37.3 million less in funding under the Senate bill than they otherwise would under TEA-21. This will affect the Indian Reservation Roads program, which is part of the Federal Lands Highways program. Because of these changes to the RABA formula, Indian Roads will not receive an additional $14.5 million in funds it is authorized to under TEA-21. Thus, the Indian Roads program will receive $275 million, instead of the full $289.5 million that would be allocated under TEA-21. I am concerned about this and hope that the Chairman will work to improve the situation for Indian Roads in conference. 
   As this bill moves to conference, will the Chairman pledge to make every effort to sustain full funding as envisioned by TEA-21 for the Indian Reservation Roads program?

   Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Subcommittee's support for the NERC Center, and I would like to highlight the potential of this Center's work as it would relate to the Department of Transportation's mission. The National Environmental Respiratory Center--NERC as it is called--is the only research program in the United States focused specifically on the increasingly troublesome issue of understanding the health risks of mixtures of air pollutants. 
   A major difficulty in moving forward in managing these residual health risks associated with air quality is the fact that no citizen ever breathes one pollutant at a time. Scientists are realizing that it is unlikely that any remaining effect of air pollution on health is actually caused by a single air pollutant acting alone. Clearly, the transportation sector is at least one significant factor in the relationship between air quality and public health. Therefore, it is essential that the Department of Transportation participate in the interagency, multi-disciplinary public-private NERC initiative. I thank the Committee for acknowledging this effort in the report accompanying the pending bill. 
   The National Environmental Respiratory Center was conceived as a joint government-industry effort to determine how to identify the contributions of individual pollutants and their sources to the health effects of complex mixtures of air contaminants. The work is well underway and broad recognition of its importance is manifested by the continually increasing support from industry. Continued support through this appropriations bill is essential to carrying out the Center's multi-year research strategy. Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful the U.S. Department of Transportation will take heed of our recommendation, and I look forward to working with you on this matter.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. 
   I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing us a balanced bill within necessary budget constraints. 
   The Senate-reported bill provides $13.9 billion in a new budget authority (BA) and $17.5 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Transportation, including federal-aid highway, mass transit, and aviation activities. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $12.8 billion in BA and $43.6 billion in outlays. 
   The Senate-reported bill is exactly at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority, and the bill is $4 million in outlays under the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. 
   Mr. President, I support the bill and urge its adoption.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2587, the District of Columbia Appropriations bill for FY 2000. 
   The bill provides $429 million in new budget authority and $389 million in new outlays for federal contributions to the District of Columbia government. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the Senate bill totals $429 million in budget authority and $393 million in outlays for FY 2000. 
   I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, for her hard work and diligence in fashioning this bill. The bill is exactly at the Senate Subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation. The bill is $36 million in budget authority above the President's request, due in part to the inclusion of a tuition assistance program for D.C. students who attend out-of-state colleges. The Administration has requested these funds, however, through the Department of Education rather than directly to the District of Columbia. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Budget Committee scoring of the conference agreement on the District of Columbia Appropriations bill be placed in the RECORD at this point, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) Program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has been an issue of controversy for several years. For next year, the Senate Interior appropriations bill provides $693 million for TPA. This money is used by local tribal governments to operate a wide range of programs like public safety, resources management, education, economic development, and human services. 
   Many tribes are not able to relate TPA funds to their own tribal needs with any specificity. As a result, the BIA simply does not know, and is not able to relate TPA spending to actual tribal needs. We are not saying that tribes misuse these funds. We are saying that there is precious little information about how TPA funds are directed toward tribal needs as determined by the tribes themselves.

Mr. Gover has recommended a pilot project at Eight Northern Pueblos Agency in New Mexico.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, Mr. Chairman, Nambe Pueblo leaders have broken new ground in developing budgets to meet their own needs. Nambe Pueblo is a small pueblo with 633 members. It is located about 20 miles north of Santa Fe. Their Governor, David Perez, and Councilman Tony Vigil and many others at Nambe have spent hours, days, and nights developing a very thorough description of their precise needs. They have worked closely with Eight Northern Indian Pueblos (ENIP) Executive Director Bernie Teba and ENIP Chairman Walter Dasheno, who is also Governor of Santa Clara Pueblo, to document their needs in several key categories. 
   In the area of Land Resources, for example, Nambe Pueblo has identified a solid waste disposal system, flood and erosion control needs, and an agricultural land recovery plan. For community services, they have identified youth services and senior citizen services. Their facility needs have been catalogued, and their economic and tourism plans have been laid out.

   Mr. DOMENICI. When Assistant Secretary Gover first presented this idea to me a few months ago, he told me that ENIP had developed a solid approach for accountability that should be tried as a pilot for other tribes to emulate. Some of the other members of ENIP are anxious to try this approach to becoming more accountable to their tribal members, the BIA, and the Congress. It is a lot of work, but there is also a lot of benefit to be able to map out a complete picture of tribal needs and resources. 
   With Assistant Secretary Gover's continuing enthusiasm and support, I  am confident that a new beginning for accountability in TPA funding will actually be born at Nambe Pueblo. We will count on him to implement this ENIP pilot from existing TPA funds. We believe we have given him enough authority in this bill and other legislation to implement this accountability pilot program, and we look forward to its early success.

It is the single largest expenditure in the BIA, followed by school operations.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas. I think the Senate has an opportunity today to decide whether we are going to give in to a group of Federal bureaucrats who have decided it is going to be their way or no way. That is actually the issue. All we are trying to determine through the activities of an established regulatory body is what the fair market value of the oil is on which the U.S. taxpayers are entitled to receive a royalty. 
   The MMS has decided to change the way we have done it in the past and in the process, in the opinion of this Senator and many others, has made it no longer fair. It is not actually levying a royalty on the value of the oil. They have decided to have new starting points. They are not allowing certain things to be deducted that are actual business expenses. In a nutshell, they are establishing a price upon which the royalty is predicated which is not the result of the marketplace and ordinary business practices but some concoction that they have come up with which will cost more money to an American industry that clearly should not be paying new taxes today. 
   This is a new tax because you change the way you regulate it and the way you determine value and you thus increase the taxes. If it is not the right way, then it is an increase in taxes. I do not believe they should be doing this. I think we should be doing this. I believe they ought to establish a process and submit it to us and ask, Do you want to change the rules on this or not? 
   Essentially, I listened attentively to the Senator from Louisiana. He hit it right on the head. And the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma in his brief remarks was right there. There has not been a better fighter than KAY HUTCHISON. She has been right again. We have been right together on this, and we have convinced the Senate heretofore, but we cannot convince the MMS to be fair, and that is what the issue is all about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think Senator DURBIN, who serves on the Budget Committee, which I happen to chair, knows that on many matters I hold him in high esteem. As a matter of fact, I believe he is smiling a very gentle smile there as he sits back in his chair, and I guess he is going to listen now for a few minutes. I hope so. He would not disavow what I have just said. But he is wrong on this one. He is wrong in many ways. 
   First, he would have done a wonderful job if he had left out the partisan speech at the end about this side of the aisle not being as concerned as our forefathers about the environment. Second, he showed some pictures of leases where one of the leaseholds had been abused and in some way tied that to the Domenici language or to his amendment. To do that is totally without an understanding of the ongoing authority of the BLM and the Forest Service, the twin agencies who are out there on our property. 
   I say to the good Senator, the BLM does not find malfeasance on the part of ranchers only when they renew the lease every 10 years. As a matter of fact, they have total authority to enter upon the premise, inspect, and periodically recommend changes in the use that the rancher should make. They don't wait around until a drought year or until the 10-year permit has expired to go in and change the usage of the lessee. 
   You cannot use what we are trying to do to prevent a wholesale diminution of ranching properties in our States, and state that there are abuses out there that need to be fixed; let me suggest they are being fixed. Animal numbers are being changed all the time. As a matter of fact, 2 years ago they were changed regularly in my State, regularly in Arizona, and regularly in Wyoming because we were in a drought period. Federal managers would say this coming year you can't do as much because the foliage isn't so good. You wore it down pretty good last year. So we are going to cut you by 50 head or 100 head. 
   Ongoing management remains the prerogative of the management agency--in this case the Bureau of Land Management. 
   Having said that, let me also say I have been around a little while--sometimes longer than I want to admit. But the Senate ought to know that no administration before this one--Democrat or Republican--has subjected the leases of cattlemen and women and businesses to a total review under NEPA for the simple issuance of permits. The Forest Service did on a few selective ones. This administration comes along with thousands and thousands of leases out there and decides that before they are going to issue a renewal, they are going to subject it to an environmental assessment and, if necessary, a full-blown impact statement. Some of us told them that is crazy. We lost. Do you know the result? The result is this debate on this floor of the Senate because BLM can't conceivably do their work on time. 
   As a matter of fact, in the State of Wyoming only 15 percent of the subject leases--these leases are to families who live on the ranches and borrow money on their houses and their ranch together--only 15 percent have gone through compliance by the BLM. The BLM hasn't done its work. 
   Look, before we leave a wide-open opportunity to cancel these leases because the environmental assessment is not done, we have to give some latitude to these people who are subject annually to review in terms of their ranch management. We have to provide them with some flexibility and assurance from the standpoint of knowing what they own and what the bankers are going to say about the loans they have on the ranch. There is nothing new about having a loan on a ranch in Wyoming or New Mexico. You put it on the entire ranch, including the fee ownership, and the ranch house. The entire unit--it is called--is collateral for the loan. 
   It is a coincidence that a member of an esteemed banking institution is sitting in the Chair and happens to be from the same State as the Senator who is opposed to my approach. But I ask hypothetically, do you think a banker who had been expecting to renew a loan because there was going to be a new 10-year permit issued--it is about a year away--and the rancher comes up, and says: Hey, banker, friend, are you going to give us a loan again? 
   And the banker says: What does the BLM say about your permit? 
   The poor rancher says: Well, they have their own rule, and it 
   says if you do not have an impact statement you can't get the permit. 
   But they haven't done the required work on this permit. 
   And the poor rancher says: Won't you lend me the money anyway? 
   But the banker says: No, of course not. 
   What Senator DOMENICI tried to do was to say it isn't a ranchers' problem that the BLM undertook such a mammoth job of environmental assessments  and sometimes full-blown statements on every single lease out there in the West. BLM and the Forest Service began the process, so we can say both of the public lands management twins do this. It is not the ranchers' fault. They didn't hold up these environmental assessments. 
   I said to the ranching community: What would be a fair way to make sure you are not harmed by the inaction of the Bureau of Land Management? 
   They said: Let them extend our lease as they would have done 5 years ago, and as they would have done if they had completed their work. But let them continue with their assessment work, and when they get it done and say there are some changes that have to be made, give them the authority to make the changes that the assessment calls for. 
   That is essentially where we are. I understand we are in a battle in the West. We are in a battle where ranchers are looked upon by some environmental groups with very low esteem. In fact, some of the groups even say there shouldn't be any cattle grazing on public lands. They say this without any evidence it is harmful. If managed properly, grazing is not harmful. It is salutary. It is healthy. It is good for the forest lands and for Bureau of Land Management lands. 
   We are not talking here about rich farmers and ranchers; even though there may be some in corporate ownership. 
   I have five letters from New Mexicans. I want everybody to listen to the last names of these people. They live in northern New Mexico with anywhere from 100 head to 350 head. Their names are Gerald Chacon, a Hispanic American whose family has lived there for generations. 
   He says in this letter, ``Please don't take away our security.'' It isn't ``take away our ranch.'' They are saying ``our security.'' ``The bank won't lend us the money.'' He alludes to the fact that if it is only a 2-year opportunity to get a loan, he is not going to have a very good chance. 
   That is the solution of the Senator from Illinois to this problem. 
   From Palemon Martinez, also from northern New Mexico, a letter that just plain pleads with me to make sure their leases are not held in abeyance because the Bureau of Land Management did not do their work. 
   Again, I repeat for those worried about proper management, BLM has entry all year long, and management opportunities all year long. They do not need to wait around for permit renewal to say to my friend, Palemon Martinez, that he has to change his way of doing business because he is grazing too heavily or he is affecting the stream. 
   Alonso Gallegos from Pena Blanca, NM--the same kind of letter. Jake Vigil, and Dennis Braden, general manager for a family. They are all the same--frightened to death of what is going to happen to the security in their allotment if we don't say it is the BLM's fault for not having done the assessments. 
   This fellow, Jake Vigil, had nothing whatsoever to do with it. He is wide open to review. They come out there and do their assessment. He makes his comments. But they do not get it done.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The history of noncompliance by the Bureau of Land Management in getting this work done in New Mexico is miserable. In our State, we are a little ahead of Wyoming. We have 26 percent that have had their environmental assessments done. The rest aren't going to have it done before their permits expire and are exactly subject to what I have been telling the Senate on the floor. 
   My friend from Illinois says: Keep the pressure on the BLM. Don't take the pressure off by saying you can issue the permit. But I say you continue your assessment work, and when you have finished and find that you want to make some changes to the permit, if you must, then do it, and you have the automatic right to do it. 
   We are not on the floor of the Senate trying to risk the security of hundreds and hundreds of ranchers--including these people--for the purpose of keeping the heat on the Bureau of Land Management, which ought to get their own work done. As a matter of fact, there are many people who think the assessments and impact statements are very expensive, that in many cases they don't even fix the problems. 
   We have a NEPA law that is a couple of decades or more old. We attempt to apply it to every kind of environmental issue around. The cases it applies to with the least efficacy are ranchlands because they are small ``events.'' We had in mind big governmental actions before we applied the NEPA laws to land. 
   I am not interested in putting at risk the ranchers in my State so we can keep the pressure on the Bureau of Land Management. Senator GORTON can keep the pressure on in his bill. He gives them the money. He can tell them: Do your work. That is all the pressure they need. 
   Frankly, this is an easy one. Sometimes it is awful hard for people who don't have public lands to understand our plight. This is easy. The only thing difficult is a whole group of organizations that don't think the rancher cares about anything. They are saying: Don't give them help with what DOMENICI wants, give them something less. 
   Keep the heat on; and a wonderful, nice Senator from Illinois who doesn't have any public land making their pitch for them. He is a good pitch maker. He made a good speech today. It just happens to be it is not right. It is not right.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know there are Senators who are waiting to speak on other measures. I am only going to speak for 2 minutes. 
   I congratulate Senator HUTCHISON on the argument she offered today. She indicated that the last three times we have done this, I have either been the sponsor and she the cosponsor, or vice versa. 
   I am here today to again indicate that whoever follows us and talks about the fact that we ought to stick big oil, or we ought to make sure there are no longer any slick deals, as I see some of these comments that are going to be made here on the floor, let me suggest that if you are taxing anything in the United States and you are doing it wrongly or unfairly or without justification under the law, then it doesn't matter whether somebody is going to lose money if in fact Congress says you have to stop doing that. 
   That is what we have here. We are going to have Senators argue that there are certain oil companies that are not going to have to pay. There have been settlements where they have paid. But the truth of the matter is, the intention of this law is, if you are going to change it materially, Congress is supposed to be involved. 
   We have tried to get involved. In fact, for 6 months we have mutually attended hearings with the MMS and the oil producers and talked about what was wrong with these regulations and  rules. Everybody on both sides was saying, let's fix them; let's modify them; let's change them. Frankly, I think the oil people who were at those meetings who have talked with us and have gone to hearings in the Energy Committee are more than willing to listen to realistic, reasonable changes. 
   But essentially what has happened is, the MMS decided to change the rule which historically based royalties on prices at the wellhead. They decided they would go downstream from that wellhead, and they invented a new concept called ``duty to market.'' They decided that they are going to decide what expenses are allowed in moving that gas downstream to where the marketing occurs. They are deciding what the values are at that point. And we could go through a litany of situations where the oil industry believes the decisions are not fair, not market oriented, or not consistent with business practices. Frankly, I think some--because it is oil, or big oil--think it just doesn't matter, stick them. 
   Frankly, as I indicated before, we want to stand here and say: Why don't you get serious about fixing those regulations? And we will get off your back. 
   That is what is going to happen. Until they do it realistically and we get some word that they have been fair and reasonable in the way they are setting these royalty costs and prices that yield dollars in taxes to the oil industry, until we find out there are some changes made, we are going to be here on the floor saying this is a new add-on tax to an industry that maybe 15 years ago we could talk about as if what you taxed them didn't matter. But we know that we have a falling production market in the United States. It is more and more difficult to produce these products. It is more and more expensive and cheaper overseas. Some of us don't want to see the American industry taxed any more than is absolutely reasonable and fair. 
   These regulations are not right. They are not fair; they are not based on marketplace concepts, or we wouldn't be here. 
   I know some are going to want to debate this for a very long time. Maybe we will even have to ask for the debate to be closed. But we are not going to give up very easily. 
   We ask Senators who pay close attention. It is not a matter of what we could get out of this industry or what somebody alleges they would have paid in the settlement. It is a question of whether the new rules and regulations are right and consistent with fair market concepts or not. As you figure the royalty, are you inventing costs and prices and disallowing deductions and the like that have no relationship to reality? We think that is what these are. 
   We would be happy to come back again and debate. I will be glad to be here. But for now I yield the floor. I thank Senator HUTCHISON.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk about someone who has provided invaluable assistance to me and the Budget Committees over the years--Dr. Paul Van de Water, the Assistant Director for Budget Analysis of the Congressional Budget Office. Dr. Van de Water is leaving the Congressional Budget Office this week, after 18 years of distinguished service to the Congress, the budget process, and the American public. He will become the Senior Advisor to the Deputy Commissioner for Policy at the Social Security Administration. 
   Paul Van de Water came to CBO in 1981, the same year I assumed Chairmanship of the Senate Budget Committee. For years he headed the Projections Unit--doing the bread and butter work involved with producing Congressional budgets. Without CBO, I could not have done my job, and Paul contributed mightily to almost every CBO analysis we needed. He has served over and above the call of duty, spending nights and weekends working on our two Budget Committees' requests. I am sure he will never forget the two weeks spent at Andrews Air Force Base during the 1990 Budget Summit. We will not soon forget his sharp analytical skills, his appreciation of Congressional demands, and the institutional consistency he has provided CBO over the last 18 years. Dr. Van de Water has truly been an exceptional public servant. 
   I know I am speaking for all Members who have ever served on the Budget Committees of the House and Senate, and all our staff, when I express our gratitude to Paul for his contributions to this Congressional budget process. I join everyone in congratulating him on his service to the country and wishing him luck in his future work at the Social Security Administration.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my friend, the chairman. 
   Mr. President, fellow Senators, I want to talk for 10 minutes about why this is a good deal for the American people and why it is high time we set in motion a series of tax cuts which will give them back the money they are paying into the Government that we don't need. 
   First of all, everybody talks about the fact that tax reduction comes in over a decade, and it comes in 1 year at a time. Almost everybody who is critical of that says at the same time they want to save Social Security. 
   The truth of the matter is there is $3.3 trillion in accumulated surpluses over the next decade. In order to make sure you are protecting Social Security, each and every year of that 10 years, a substantial portion of that money belongs to the Social Security trust fund. So you can't have tax cuts that use up the Social Security trust fund. Anybody who says we are is ignoring the facts. 
   The reason we have to have a phased in tax cut is because we are saving every single penny that belongs to Social Security for Social Security. Then we come along and say, let's have a tax cut, and let's phase it in each and every year. 
   People can come to the floor and be critical of how slow it is and how long it takes to get the marriage tax penalty totally eliminated. But the truth of the matter is when you pass this tax bill tonight, and if the President were to sign it, you have put into law a change in the Tax Code which will get rid of the marriage tax penalty and many of the other onerous provisions in this law. Still, after you have done that, even though some of our best money crunchers in America have it wrong, there is $505 billion--not zero, as some people have said, $505 billion--off a freeze which you can spend where you want over the next decade, be it for defense, be it for discretionary programs such as education, or you can use $90 billion to $100 billion of it, or as much as you want, to make sure you fix Medicare, if that is your goal. 
   So for starters, there are so many people out there with wrong numbers and attacks on this proposal, who have the wrong facts, that I merely want to answer that part. We take care of Social Security regardless of what the President of the United States says. There is money in this budget for Medicare reform, if you choose to do it. There is money in this budget plan to pay for defense and to pay for education, and other high priority items, and to take care of the needs of this country. 
   What we set out to do was to say we shouldn't keep more than we need, and we shouldn't set billions of dollars around in places up here in the National Government assuming that one way or another it will be there when it is time to give a tax cut. 
   I submit that if you believe that you really do believe in the tooth fairy because, as a matter of fact, if you set that much money around up here and it is not used, it will be spent. 
   We ask the question: Do you want to use this surplus to grow the pocketbooks of Americans, or do you want to increase their savings accounts, or would you like to spend it? That is the issue before us today. It is a blessing that we have this surplus. 
   First, we should set aside enough for Social Security. We have done that. The bill then provides for our taxpayers to get some relief. It preserves and expands the child care credit. It protects various education credits, foster care tax credit, the alternative minimum tax--a fancy name. But what it means is that the way the Tax Code is written today, we give average Americans, middle-income Americans, credits and the like in the Tax Code. Then we take it away under the alternative minimum tax--like we give you a benefit and we take it away. We call it an alternative minimum tax, as if you are so rich you shouldn't get these credits. 
   Do you know that if we do not pass this tax bill, 7 out of 10 American taxpayers will lose some of their credits to the AMT by the year 2008, just about the time that we wiped out the AMT? 
   Please, Mr. President, sign this bill. The bill provides tax relief for health care, long-term care, and has small business incentives. It is a bill that is good for farmers, for working men and women, and families. Overall, it is a very good bill. 
   I also say, Mr. President, please sign this bill. The final tax plan is an excellent tax plan that moves toward slower, flatter, and simpler tax and moves toward taxing income that is consumed, not income that is saved, earned, and invested. 
   On the business side, it moves closer to allowing business to deduct the cost of investments in the year they are made, thereby making them more competitive. 
   This bill overall moves toward tax equity so everyone will get a break for health care regardless of where they work--a big company, small company, or a ma-and-pa one-stop shop. People who need health coverage say: Mr. President, please sign this bill.  
   The bill focuses on generational equity. There are child care credits and long-term credits for the elderly. The President asks, be sure to take care of our senior citizens. We have taken care of them. Senior citizens, we are taking care of your children and your grandchildren who are interested in being helped because they pay more taxes than they should. On behalf of the seniors in the country, and their daughters, sons, and grandchildren, Mr. President, sign this bill. 
   The bill takes the best part of the House and Senate bill and attempts to make it law. Broad-based tax reduction is fair. It cuts the tax rate in the lowest bracket first. Lowering of the 15-percent bracket happens before any other brackets are lowered. This sequencing recognizes that 98 million Americans are the people most urgently in need of a tax cut. Lowering the 15 percent to 14 percent is a 7-percent cut. Widening the lower bracket does two important things: It returns millions of Americans to the lowest brackets, fighting back ``bracket creep.'' In my own State of New Mexico, 151,000 New Mexicans will be returned to the lowest bracket; another 83,000 will see taxes cut. 
   Talking about the marriage penalty for a minute, which everybody has spoken to--I won't be as eloquent as some--it is absolutely preposterous that the United States of America would punish by way of taxation a man and a woman who are married and both working, as opposed to a man and woman who are single. The marriage penalty is the wrong thing for America today. It was the wrong thing when we passed it. We ought to get rid of it. 
   In behalf of millions of married couples who are begging Congress to be fair with them and get rid of this penalty on their marriage, please sign this tax bill. 
   Because of the progressive rate structure in our tax code, Americans in the 28, 31, 36, and 39.6 tax brackets will all see their taxes cut. 
   The marriage penalty relief in this bill is overdue and well done. There is roughly $117 billion in marriage penalty relief. Fully fifty percent of the bills resources go to a broad-based and marriage-penalty tax relief. 
   The bill also phases in a doubling of the standard deduction to finally eliminate the marriage penalty. In addition to lowering federal income taxes by eliminating the marriage penalty for 567,170 New Mexico families, it will also save New Mexicans $72.4 million in New Mexico income taxes as well! Getting married would no longer be a taxable event. 
   The bill increases the child care credit. It increases the credit for families with AGI incomes under $30,000. By 2006, the credit will be 40 percent. This means that 29,042 New Mexican families will get more help with their child care expenses and this is a real helping hand because child care can cost as much as $3,133 to $5,200 a year per child. These 29,042 families with child care expenses say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.'' 
   This bill improves tax treatment for education 7 ways. The 331,815 public school students in New Mexico would be benefitted if this bill were to become law, so I say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.'' 
   This bill provides a deduction for prescription drug insurance, provides an extra exemption for the caretaker of elderly and infirm parents and grandparents, and provides a deduction for long term care insurance. 
   43 percent of all Americans will need long term care at some point in their lives and 25 percent of all families are caring for an elderly relative today. It is an emotional and financial commitment. The long term care deduction can help make it less of a financial burden. For the 19 million Americans expected to need long term care, I say, ``Mr. President, please, please sign this bill.'' 
   This bill cuts taxes by $43.9 billion by providing tax relief to families facing health care costs. 
   The bill expands the deduction for health insurance so that everyone is treated the same regardless of whether they work for a big corporation with a fancy health insurance 
   benefit plan, or whether they work for a small business that does not provided health insurance. This provision could help 43 million uninsured plus the 10.2 million who have access to health insurance but decline to participate because of the cost and it should help the 1.4 million children of self-employed who lack health insurance. 
   In New Mexico this provision could have a big impact and make a big difference. We have 340,000 uninsured New Mexicans who belong to families where some in the family works. 
   On behalf of all these people with no health insurance or with unaffordable health insurance, I ask, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.'' 
   I have talked about why this bill is good for the American family. But there are two provisions that are good for the economy. 
   Lowering the capital gains rate is the best economic policy and I am pleased that this bill lowers the top rate to 18 percent. I am also pleased that the bill increases expensing from $19,000 to $30,000. 
   This bill also phases in a reduction of rates and then repeals the estate tax. The estate tax is perceived as one of the most confiscatory taxes of all time and it is one that disrupts small business and farms. I am pleased that the bill gets rid of the death tax. Dying should not be a taxable event. 
   For all of the constituents who have written me about the unfairness of the death tax I say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.'' 
   The bill increases the amount that can be contributed for all IRAs. It is phased in so that eventually $5,000 a year could be contributed. The bill also increases eligibility for those who can participate in Roth IRAs and includes ``catch-up'' contribution limits for people aged 50 and over. 
   For the 15 million people who would be helped by these retirement security provisions, I say, ``Mr. President, please sign this bill.'' 
   The bill also does some things that really need doing. First it extends the R&E credit for five years. It also includes some desperately needed tax relief for the oil and gas industry. 
   I am very pleased with this bill. It is fair, it is the right thing to do and it should be done before the money get spent on more government. 
   I close today by saying I have been working on budgets for a long time. I have heard criticisms of budgets that we produced, and we have criticized budgets that the opposite side produced. 
   The criticism of this tax cut, phased in over 10 years, is beyond anything I could ever have imagined. With surpluses of this size, for the White House and those who oppose it to be inventing numbers and accusations that are totally unfounded is something I never expected. As a matter of fact, there is even concern about the moderate economic assumptions in this budget. We grew at 6 percent the year before last, 4 1/2 percent last year, over 2 percent this year, and we plan the next decade to grow at 2 to 2.3 percent, a very modest growth. We even plan two recessions in there, and we still get these surpluses. 
   Frankly, I think they are fair projections. At least they are fair enough to make sure we don't risk them being spent. All we are saying is, over the next decade set this much aside, just don't collect it. We are not going to cut taxes. We are just not going to collect it. It will stay with the American people. It is going to be phased in. 
   Fellow Americans, it will take a while for some of them, but maybe we should ask the question for the other side and the White House who are critical that it takes too long for them to come in, When will their taxes come in? When will their tax reductions come? Perhaps never.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for S. 1292, the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY 2000. 
   As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee, I appreciate the difficult task before the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Minority to balance the diverse priorities funded in this bill--from our public lands, to major Indian programs and agencies, energy conservation and research, and the Smithsonian and federal arts agencies. They have done a masterful job meeting important program needs within existing spending caps. 
   The pending bill provides $14.0 billion in new budget authority and $9.15 billion in new outlays to fund Department of Interior agencies, including the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, the fossil energy and energy conservation programs of the Department of Energy, the Smithsonian, and federal arts and humanities agencies. 
   When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the bill totals $14.0 billion in budget authority and $14.3 billion in outlays for FY 2000. The Senate Subcommittee is $1 million in both budget authority and outlays below its revised 302(b) allocation. The bill is $35 million in BA above, and $104 million in outlays below, the bill recently passed by the House. The bill is $1.1 billion in BA and $0.7 billion in outlays below the President's budget request in large measure because the President's offsets to increased discretionary spending are not within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator BYRD, in both the steel and the oil and gas loan guarantee programs, the legislation provides that loan guarantees may be issued upon application of the prospective borrower  (section 101(g) for the Steel Loan Guarantee Program and section 201 (f) for the Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program). Ordinarily, the applicant for a loan guarantee is the prospective lender. Am I correct in assuming that that would be the case under these programs, and that the true intent of the language in the legislation is that the prospective lender is the applicant?

   Mr. DOMENICI. It is possible that under each of these programs there may be many, many eligible firms--more under the Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program, but potentially a high number under the Steel Loan Guarantee Program, as well--particularly as there is no ``floor'' or minimum amount of loan that may be guaranteed. Would the Loan Guarantee Boards have the discretion to establish priorities and criteria for the consideration of applications and award of guarantees, so that projects could be considered in an orderly manner, and there could be a proper mix of loan risks, to maximize the effectiveness of the programs within the amount appropriated for program costs?

   Mr. DOMENICI. I note that the legislation requires the Loan Guarantee Boards to establish procedures, rules and regulations, but appropriates money to the Department of Commerce to administer the programs. Am I correct in assuming that this is because the Boards themselves are not expected to actually administer the programs, but only to adopt rules and procedures, and approve guarantees and amendments? And am I correct in further assuming that, subject to the direction of the Loan Guarantee Boards, the Department of Commerce is expected to prepare proposed rules and procedures for the Boards' consideration; on behalf of the Boards, publish regulations in the Federal Register; process applications for guarantees; and undertake the day-to-day administration of the programs?

   Mr. DOMENICI. I note that the legislation in section 101 (j), appropriates $5 million to the Department of Commerce, for necessary expenses to administer the Steel Loan Guarantee Program. Similarly, in section 201 (i), $2.5 million is appropriated to the Department for necessary expenses to administer the Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program. In each case, the legislation provides that the appropriation, ``may be transferred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Trade Development of the International Trade Administration.'' The operative word here is ``may.'' Do I correctly 
   assume that the Secretary of Commerce has the discretion to determine where funds provided for under these programs can be most effectively administered?

This is of course an important matter for prospective lenders, determining perhaps at what interest rates a guaranteed loan would be made, or indeed whether a loan would be made at all. Am I correct in my assumption that although the bill does not specifically say so in so many words, the full faith and credit of the United States will in fact stand behind the loan guarantees?

   Mr. DOMENICI. This is indeed important legislation, but I ask whether regulations promulgated to implement the legislation would be a ``major rule'' as that term is used in the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804). Generally, any rule that has a $100 million effect on the economy in a single year is considered to be a major rule, and cannot go into effect until 60 days after the rule is submitted to Congress for review and possible disapproval. But, if the loan guarantee regulations are considered a major rule, delaying their effect would appear to be inconsistent with the language and intent of the legislation. Once regulations promulgated under this legislation are written, cleared by OMB, filed with Congress, and published in the Federal Register, I assume they would go into effect right away. Is this correct?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator HATCH in introducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999.'' 
   I am convinced that this bill is urgently needed to assure our senior citizens have access to quality nursing home care through the Medicare program. 
   We can all take a certain amount of pride in the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which contained the most sweeping reforms for Medicare since the program was enacted in 1965. These reforms have extended the solvency of the program to 2015 and brought new health coverage options to seniors throughout the country. 
   However, it should come as no surprise that legislation as complex as the Balanced Budget Act (BBA), as well as its implementation by the Health Care Financing Administration, has produced some unintended consequences that need to be corrected. 
   That is exactly the situation in the case of nursing homes. The transition to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) that was contained in the BBA is seriously threatening access to needed care for seniors all across the country. 
   In May, 63 Senators joined with me in sending a bipartisan appeal to the Secretary of Health and Human Services urging her to address the growing crisis in the nursing home industry through administrative action. To date, we have received no direct response from the Secretary on this matter, nor has the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) shown any willingness to address the problem. 
   With time quickly running out on many nursing home operators, I believe Congress must act before it is too late to assure our seniors will continue to have access to quality nursing home care. 
   Let me note that Congress is not alone in believing there is a problem here. Dr. Gail Wilensky, the Chair of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, recently testified before the Senate Finance Committee that some Medicare patients are having difficulty accessing care in skilled nursing facilities. Dr. Wilensky went on to say that the current reimbursement system adopted by HCFA does not adequately account for patients requiring high levels of nontherapy ancillary services and supplies.  
   In New Mexico, there are currently 81 nursing homes in the state serving about 6,000 patients, and I am convinced that the current Medicare payment system, as implemented by HCFA, simply does not provide enough funds to cover the costs being incurred by these facilities when they care for our senior citizens. 
   For rural states like New Mexico, corrective action is critically important. Many communities in my state are served by a single facility that is the only provider for many miles. If such a facility were to close, patients in that home would be forced to move to facilities much farther away from their families. Moreover, nursing homes in smaller, rural communities often operate on a razor thin bottom line, and, for them, the reductions in Medicare reimbursements have been especially devastating. 
   The legislation we are introducing today would go a long way toward restoring stability in the nursing home industry. It would increase reimbursement rates through two provisions. 
   First, a 2-year period, the bill modestly increases payments for 15 high acuity conditions, like cancer, hip fracture, and stroke. At the end of 2 years, HCFA expects that they will have the data to more properly reflect the high costs of these cases in the payment system. 
   Second, the bill eliminates the one percentage point reduction in the annual inflation update for all reimbursement rates for skilled nursing facilities. 
   I look forward to working with Senator HATCH and the other cosponsors of this bill in pushing for passage of this critical legislation when we return in September.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of this important bill to make some much needed changes to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. I am pleased to join my colleagues, including the chairmen of the Senate Judiciary and Indian Affairs Committees, in support of this legislation. 
   Mr. President, my home state of New Mexico is the birthplace of the atomic bomb. New Mexico's national laboratories have long been involved in developing and testing nuclear weapons. One of the unfortunate consequences of our country's rapid development of its nuclear arsenal was that many of those who worked in the earliest uranium mines, prior to the implementation of government health and safety standards in 1971, became afflicted with terrible illnesses. 
   I began to notice this problem more than 20 years ago, when I learned that miners had contracted an alarmingly high rate of lung cancer and other diseases commonly related to radiation exposure. 
   Many of the miners native Americans, mostly members of the Navajo Nation, with whom the U.S. Government has had a longstanding trust relationship based on the treaties and agreements between our country and the tribes. Some 1,500 Navajos worked in the uranium mines from 1947 to 1971. Many of them have since died of radiation-related illnesses. 
   All of the uranium miners, including the Navajos, performed a great service out of patriotic duty to this country. Their work helped us to win the cold war. Unfortunately, our Nation failed to fulfill its duty to protect the miners' health and some 20 years ago, I began the effort to see that the miners and their families received just compensation for their illnesses. 
   In 1978, in the 95th Congress, I introduced the first bill to compensate uranium miners who contracted radiation-related diseases. The bill was called the Uranium Miners Compensation Act, and it was the predecessor to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) which is law today. 
   The following year in 1979, I held the first field hearing on this issue in Grants, NM, to learn about the concerns and the health problems faced by uranium miners. In later years, I traveled to Shiprock, NM, and the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation to gather more information about the uranium mines and their families. 
   Twelve years after I introduced that first bill, President Bush signed RECA into law. At the time, RECA was intended to provide fair and swift compensation for those miners and downwinders who had 
   contracted certain radiation-related illnesses. 
   Since the RECA trust fund began making awards in 1992, the Department of Justice has approved a total 3,135 claims valued at nearly $232 million. In my home state of New Mexico, there have been 371 claims approved with a value of nearly $37 million. For that work, the Department of Justice is to be commended. 
   The original RECA was a compassionate law which unfortunately has come to be administered in a bureaucratic, dispassionate and often unfair manner. Many claims have languished at the Department of Justice for far too long. 
   Miners and their families, particularly Navajos, often have waited many years for their claims to be processed. Many claims were denied because the miners were smokers and could not prove that their diseases were related solely to uranium mining. In other cases, miners faced problems establishing the requisite amount of working level months needed to make a successful claim. Native American claims by spousal survivors often were denied because of difficulties associated with documenting native American marriages. 
   This bill makes some important, common sense changes to the radiation compensation program to address the problems I have outlined. First, it expands the list of compensable diseases to include new cancers, including leukemia, thyroid, and brain cancer. It also includes certain noncancer diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Medical science has been able to link these diseases to uranium mining in the 10 years since the enactment of the original RECA. We now know that prolonged radiation exposure can cause many additional diseases. This bill uses the best available science to make sure that those who were injured by radiation exposure are compensated. 
   The bill also extends eligibility to above-ground and open-pit miners, millers and transport workers. The latest science tells us that the risks of disease associated with radiation exposure were not necessarily limited to those who worked in unventilated mines.  
   Most importantly, the bill requires the Department of Justice to take native American law and customs into account when deciding claims. I have heard countless stories about the inequities faced by the spouses of Navajo miners who have been unable to successfully document their traditional tribal marriages to the satisfaction of the Justice Department under current law and regulations. This bill will change that, and make it easier for spousal survivors to make successful claims. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this important legislation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost close to $1 billion over the next 21 years. That is far less than some of the other proposals floated in the House and Senate during the past few years. This is a commonsense approach, which addresses many of the problems with the existing program, without unnecessarily expanding the scope of the Radiation Exposure compensation Act. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has done a fine job crafting this bill and I have been pleased to work with him in that regard. I look forward to helping move this bill through the Senate.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to introduce the ``Public Health Response to Youth Suicide and Violence Act of 1999.'' I would also like to thank my colleague Senator KENNEDY for joining me as a co-sponsor of this legislation. 
   All too often we read in the paper or see on TV another tragedy involving our children. These stories about violence, death, and suicide have become all too familiar and commonplace in our nation. Unfortunately, the children who commit these acts often suffer from a mental illness. 
   As I have said many times before the human brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other organs of our body, it is subject to illness. And just as illnesses to our other organs require treatment, so too do illnesses of the brain. 
   And while we have learned so much more about mental illness and medical science can accurately diagnosis mental illnesses and treat those afflicted, the same cannot be said for children and adolescents. Unfortunately, we still know very little about the causes of mental illness in children and adolescents and moreover, the appropriate treatment for these illnesses. 
   Before I proceed there is one thing I want to make absolutely clear: I am not for one minute saying we should lessen our focus on law enforcement or incarceration of convicted offenders. Instead, I am simply saying we might be able to prevent some of the tragedies I have mentioned if we knew more about the cause and appropriate treatment for mental illness in children and adolescents. 
   Today, suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death among individuals between the age of 15 to 24 and the 4th leading cause of death in those 10 to 14 years of age. Estimates show about 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from a mental illness that is severe enough to cause some level of impairment. Additionally, many parents with a child suffering from a serious mental disorder believe their child will become violent without appropriate treatment. 
   Beyond the possibility of suicide and violence, children not receiving treatment for mental disorders not only suffer, cannot learn, and may not form healthy 
   relationships with peers or family, but face an increased likelihood of incarceration as juveniles and adults. 
   I have come to the conclusion that we must make a renewed investment into discovering the cause and the appropriate treatment of mental illness in children and adolescents. Why is it that certain children may be afflicted with a mental illness and others are not? What is the best course of treatment for a child diagnosed with a mental illness? 
   Everyone acknowledges that there is a critical lack of information in the area of child and adolescent mental illnesses and in particular the causes and appropriate treatment of such illnesses. 
   With this in mind, I cannot think of a better entity to take the lead in this endeavor to increase our research and understanding of child and adolescent mental illness than the National Institute of Mental Health. The Institute is already at the forefront of mental illness research and I believe it is uniquely qualified to address the connection between mental illness and youth suicide and violence. 
   The ``Public Health Response to Youth Suicide and Violence Act of 1999'' simply seeks to reduce incidences of youth suicide and violence through increased research by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) of children and adolescents suffering from depression or other mental illness. 
   By providing for increased research the Bill addresses a critical lack of knowledge in the area of child and adolescent mental illnesses and in particular the causes and appropriate treatment of such illnesses that often lead to youth suicide and violence. 
   The Bill authorizes $200 million for FY 2000 to expand and intensify research aimed at better understanding the underlying causes of mental disorders that lead to youth suicide and violence. 
   The Bill contains mandatory activities to be carried out by the Director of NIMH that include developing researchers who are trained in the area of childhood mental disorders in order to better understand the development of brain and mental disorders in children, pursue research into the relationship between mental disorders and youth violence and suicide and to develop effective treatments for these disorders. 
   Additionally, the Director of NIMH will work with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other appropriate agencies to develop a model to train primary care physicians, nurses, school psychologists, teachers, and other responsible individuals about mental disorders in children. 
   The Bill also contains permissible activities the Director of NIMH may carry out that include examining the potential of public health programs that combine individual, family, and community level interventions to address suicide and violence and to identify related best practices. Additionally, the Director may develop and evaluate programs aimed at prevention, early recognition, and intervention of depression, youth suicide, and violence in diverse school and community settings.  
   In conclusion, I would simply restate that I believe expanding research to reduce incidences of youth suicide and violence through increased research of children and adolescents suffering from depression or other mental illness is necessary and I would urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't address these remarks to any exporter of ethanol. But I am really astounded tonight. I think if you pull out your ledger, every time we have an ethanol vote, my friend or someone else is standing there to make sure that I vote for it and make sure that I vote the same way over and over. 
   Frankly, I wouldn't be voting for ethanol if I had to put up with this kind of argument and justification for being for ethanol. Just put that in your hat. Because this is an absurd argument. Most of those who support ethanol on this side of the aisle are constantly arguing that the Environmental Protection Agency oversteps all the time--that they overregulate, that they do things that cost the American taxpayers too much. And yet they come here tonight. 
   There is the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Is this man antienvironment? For most of the same people, they have been arguing that he is too much in favor of the environment. He comes to the floor of the Senate a reputed chairman, and you all make this an environmental issue? 
   You want to make this issue one that says we will sell more corn. I don't believe that is the right way to handle environmental issues in the United States when a blue-ribbon commission issued a report, and the chairman of the committee says: I need time to study it. But it will just be a matter of a few weeks, and we will have a hearing. 
   That is what we should do tonight. We should say to that committee: Do your hearings quickly and give us your recommendation. 
   But to stand here on the floor of the Senate and make this a corn-growers versus a non-corn-growers issue, and try to say it is the environment when you are counting heads, to every head you are counting, you are sending a memo: This is for corn. 
   Is that why we want you to vote for it? Right. In fact, my friend, who I greatly respect, tried to cover that up in a 15-minute speech about it being something else. But it is an effort to say let us get rid of this thing that we are using to make our gasoline better, more oxygenated, and better for the clean air of our country when there is a study that is only 5 days old--6 days, whatever it is. You have the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee saying: Wouldn't you give us time to look at it? 
   Here we have an agriculture bill and somebody making an issue that now what you would do is make PETE DOMENICI tonight, who is not going to vote with you anti-corn growers, says listen, corn growers. You are more apt to make me an anti-corn grower with this kind of approach than if you leave it in the committee and let them do their work. 
   I hope some others will join me in that respect because I am not against corn growers. I don't have very many in my State. But I think it is ridiculous to come to the floor and make this kind of argument in behalf of the environment and leaking underground tanks when you won't even give the most esteemed environmental chairman we have had around here since Ed Muskie a chance to conduct some hearings on it. 
   Frankly, I hope we either table it or somebody offers a substitute so we can do what is right here tonight.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. 
   The Senate-reported bill provides $60.4 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $40.2 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. All of the discretionary funding in this bill is nondefense spending. 
   When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are taken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $64.3 billion in BA and $47.3 billion in outlays for FY 2000. Including mandatory savings, the Subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in both BA and outlays. 
   The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation totals $64.3 billion in BA and $47.3 billion in outlays. Within this amount, $14.0 billion in BA and $14.3 billion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending. 
   For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all the mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill is at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. It is $22 million in BA below and $161 million in outlays above the 1999 level for discretionary spending, and $537 million in BA and $577 million in outlays below the President's request for these programs. 
   I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its 302(b) allocation. I appreciate the Committee's support for a number of ongoing projects and programs important to my home State of New Mexico as it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to talk about the Senate passage of a bill I introduced that will extend the useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. I also want to thank Senator SPECTER for his assistance that helped to make passage of this bill possible. 
   The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces have made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and liberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The service of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and the sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be forgotten. 
   These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be buried at a National Cemetery of their choosing. Unfortunately, projections show the Santa Fe National Cemetery will run out of space to provide casketed burials for our veterans at the conclusion of 2000. However, with Senate passage of this bill we have taken an important step to ensure the continued viability of the Santa Fe National Cemetery. 
   I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National Cemetery that has grown from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. The cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was designated a National Cemetery in April of 1875. 
   Men and women who have fought in all of our nation's wars hold an honored spot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. Today the Santa Fe National Cemetery contains almost 27,000 graves that are mostly marked by upright headstones. 
   The Senate's action today brings us another step closer to ensuring the Santa Fe National Cemetery will not be forced to close. The bill passed today allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for the use of flat grave markers that will extend the useful life of the cemetery until 2008. 
   While I wish the practice of utilizing headstones could continue indefinitely if a veteran chose, my wishes are outweighed by my desire to extend the useful life of the cemetery. I would note that my desire is shared by the New Mexico Chapter of the American Legion, the Albuquerque Chapter of the Retired Officers' Association, and the New Mexico Chapter of the VFW who have all endorsed the use of flat grave markers. 
   Finally, this is not without precedent because exceptions to the law have been granted on six prior occasions with the most recent action occurring in 1994 when Congress authorized the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for the flat grave markers at the Willamette National Cemetery in Oregon. 
   Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator SPECTER for his assistance and state how pleased I am with the Senate passage of this important bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, I don't normally take to the Senate floor and speak in opposition to an amendment of my colleague from New Mexico. But I did yesterday, and I must this morning because if this amendment is reported in New Mexico, and if it says to constituents of our State that the budget resolution we adopted, and what will be left over after the tax cut would decimate education, then it would appear to me that I must answer because that isn't true. 
   First of all, the Senator from New Mexico, my colleague, is at least not as sensational in his approach as the President was yesterday. The President even knows right down to the nickel what is not going to be spent in education. That is impossible. He says that 544,000 kids aren't going to be able to learn to read. That is ludicrous. If that is the kind of talk he needs to defeat a tax bill, then good luck to him. It is just absolutely untrue. 
   Let's get the facts as I remember and understand them. We produced a budget resolution. It is nothing new with reference to the taxes; $792 billion spread out over 10 years was the tax cut in that bill. We also allocated the remaining money for the next decade and, incidentally, in doing that, even though there was a reduction in discretionary spending, the highest priority domestic program was education, for all the reasons stated on the floor by Senator MURRAY and Senator BINGAMAN. It is terribly important that we use our education dollars right and better but that there be more of them. We put $37 billion in additional money during the first 5 years of that budget for education. 
   Now, what happened after that? After that, some 3 months later, the Congressional Budget Office did a midsession review and told us there was more money than that. As a matter of fact, there was $170 billion more in the surplus account. We didn't add some of that to the tax cut. It is sitting there. What I did, so that everyone would understand, I said let's look at this surplus in the chart I used yesterday, and let's assume that we freeze discretionary spending and ask CBO how much money would then be available to put back into discretionary accounts during the decade. 
   They told us: We don't know whether you will use it in discretionary accounts. We can't say that. 
   But there is $505 billion that could be added into priority spending. I believe that means all of the discretionary spending can go up significantly and you can establish education as a high-priority item and fund it at levels higher than we have now, which I think Republicans will do if we have reform in the educational allowances of the Federal Government, so that there is accountability and flexibility in the programs that we send there. 
   I believe what my colleague from New Mexico is expressing on the floor  is a sincere desire that we be sure that in the discretionary accounts we fund education adequately. If that is what he was saying, I join with him in saying that is true. But when he says you need to take $122 billion--or whatever the number is--out of the tax cut in order to do that, I disagree. I don't think you have to do that. 
   Plain and simple, I think there is plenty of discretionary 
   money available. I add, if you use the President's numbers on Medicare--and he said you only needed $46 billion to fix prescription drugs--you have $505 billion, less the $46 billion, and all the rest can go to discretionary spending in the next decade. I am not trying to mislead anybody. In order to understand it, I said start with the premise that we freeze all these accounts and put in what is left. If you look at the budget resolution, we put $181 billion into those accounts, with education being the highest priority. It just happens there is more than that $181 billion because the midsession review added many billions of dollars in accumulated surplus. 
   I am fully aware that Senator BINGAMAN, my colleague, has regularly and consistently as a member of the Committee on Education, and on the floor, been a promoter and a staunch supporter of education. I agree with him, but I believe he is wrong in thinking that we have to reduce the tax cut in order to be sure we do that. I also remind everybody that there are some very significant education programs in this tax bill. It makes it easier to continue your education because it has allowances, credits, and deductions in the adult education area. It makes it easier to pay off student loans. It makes college more affordable, and it provides tax exempt financing for school construction. All of that is in the Roth bill. 
   Whatever time I had remaining, I yield back. 
   I make a point of order that the Bingaman amendment No. 1462 is extraneous to the bill before us. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this table clearly shows there is no Social Security money in this tax cut. 
   Secondly, maybe the Senator is confused. CBO says the President still does not lock up all the Social Security money. It is $30 billion short. 
   Last, I suggest if they are really concerned about the Social Security trust fund size, why are they filibustering against a lockbox that would encapsulate it and make sure it is there? 
   In summary, the Senator from New Jersey is using the wrong chart. It does not apply to the real situation. We are using no Social Security money in terms of our tax cut.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is another opportunity on the part of the other side to propose to the American people that they want anything but tax relief. 
   This is a motion to recommit. It would do nothing to protect Medicare. It is the President's proposal, which is a phony transfer of IOUs to the Medicare trust fund. It does nothing to help senior citizens. It is just an effort to lock up $300 billion so you can't give the American people a tax cut, plain and simple. They don't want to confront the issue of a lockbox for Social Security so they muddle it up and instead of trying to solve something, they would like to create an issue instead of a solution. 
   Frankly, there are hardly any experts in America who look at this lockbox concept for Medicare and say it helps the seniors or it helps Medicare. If this is the plan the President is alluding to across this land, then he has none. 
   I believe, since the other side did not let us have a vote, we ought to do ours procedurally also, and I am compelled to do that. 
   Therefore: The language in this amendment is not germane to the bill before us, so I raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Chairman, fellow Senators, I did not know that Senator BREAUX was going to come to the floor. I am delighted that he has. I want to state how consistent he has been over the months by just putting a quote from the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, a Democrat, here for everybody to see:  
   Medicare must not be used as a wedge issue any longer. The question before this Congress is not whether to cut taxes or whether to save Medicare. That's not the choice we're facing. I support a tax cut, targeted, and I'm dedicated to saving Medicare. It's not an either/or position.  
   That is from a distinguished Senator who is on the committee that will do both--will reform Medicare and will write the tax laws. I give him a great deal of credit because he is a man of his word when it comes to these issues. 
   Frankly, it is not correct that it is either Medicare, prescription drugs, reform, or tax cuts. The truth of the matter is, Senator BILL FRIST has just showed you. 
   I hear Senator after Senator get up on that side and say there is no money for Medicare in this budget, there is no room after the tax cut. 
   Let me repeat, I went back and asked the Congressional Budget Office to do an analysis and assume that we froze discretionary spending. We put in the tax cut, we put in the $1.9 trillion for Social Security, and we asked them: How much money can be added to discretionary spending and Medicare reform and still live within the estimated surplus? And they told us--$505 billion. 
   I say to the seniors in this country, I believe you have witnessed here on the floor, through the good work of Chairman BILL ROTH and the Finance Committee--I say to the seniors across America, I have seen them produce a tax bill that I believe you will love because you care about your sons and daughters; you care about the married members of your family. This bill before us stops penalizing marriage for 22 million American families. I ask the seniors, isn't that a good piece of work? It makes child care more available for your grandchildren. Isn't that a good piece of work? It makes child care more accessible. And guess what. The President plans to veto these--all in the name of ``we can't afford tax cuts.'' 
   To be honest with you, the truth of the matter is, when you finish with that Congressional Budget Office analysis, you are spending 23.4 percent of the surplus for tax cuts, you are putting the entire Social Security surplus aside, and you still have $505 billion to be used over the next decade for high-priority items. 
   So for those who have come to the floor and said there is no money, there is $505 billion over the next decade. Do you want to use $100 billion of it for Medicare? Some say that is too much. The President thought $46 billion was enough. That is very interesting. We still have people talking about how much money we are going to need to reform Medicare. I don't know how much. I trust the Finance Committee, under the leadership of BILL ROTH, to produce a bipartisan bill. The President had proposed $46 billion as the entire amount necessary. Remember, the chart my friend BILL FRIST put up said there is $505 billion over the next decade.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me finish. 
   The President asked for $46 billion for the entire reform package on Medicare. What are we talking about? Holding up a tax bill that takes care of the married sons and daughters of our senior citizens across America. They have children and need all these things that the Tax Code provides? They say, we just want to do anything but give them help, so we will even hold up their bill, claiming we are really holding it up for you seniors because we want to take care of Medicare. 
   Frankly, I have nothing but compliments for the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, because he is one who is concerned about this. But I am equally comfortable in saying I am. I think Senator BILL ROTH of Delaware is concerned about it. I think Senator BREAUX is concerned about it. Frankly, I believe we are going to have plenty of money left over to fix that Medicare problem from that $505 billion. 
   Now, if the Senator wants me to explain this budget, I will explain it right now.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me assure fellow Senators and explain what this is. This is a true assessment of the surplus in total dollars, if you assume that for the next 10 years discretionary spending is frozen. I did that so we could find out how much new money is there, available to spend, because the discretionary programs are not entitled to an inflationary add-on. They are entitled to what we add on. If you want to know where their numbers came from, they came from the budget resolution we produced, which had $181 billion in discretionary spending. That was something we came up with. I asked them to take that out. And when they took it out, they said: Now you have this much to spend. You have $505 billion. 
   If you would like to certify that and ask the Congressional Budget Office, is this correct, they will tell you absolutely, because we got it from them. 
   Mr. President, I am not going to answer questions now because I want to finish my argument.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever baseline anybody wants to use, there is roughly $405 billion above a freeze available to be spent on discretionary spending and on Medicare reform. That is all we try to show in this chart. Before you start the chart, you can spend however much you want, but I decided to spend none so we could put in perspective how much there is that we can spend out of this surplus, and these are authentic numbers. They are correct, if you start with that assumption. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman. 
   I say to Senator BINGAMAN that I would not rise in opposition to his amendment if it was not, as I view it, an implication that what I propose is going to hurt education. 
   Since that is the case, I must tell the Senator that I think he is wrong. So I will proceed, as I must, to tell him what we did with education and what we can do with education based upon the money that is left over after the tax cut is effective. 
   I do not know where the chart comes from that the Senator has up there. But I would assume it comes from somebody who assumes there is no money left over after the tax cut and, therefore, everything will be reduced, and over the next 10 years there will be no inflation added to any function. If that is the case, it is wrong. 
   But if Senators want to look at the budget resolution we prepared, we expect they will stand up and say no, there is not enough money in this budget for education. 
   What we did in that budget resolution, which is not binding--just like his resolution here is not binding; it does nothing for education--it is a wish list and cuts taxes. It reduces the tax cuts substantially. It would be nice if the Senator would tell us which $120 billion and some he would take out of the tax cut. 
   But having said that, let me first start by saying if you want to look at a budget resolution that passed the Senate which had $181 billion in money over a baseline that was frozen for the next decade on the discretionary side, and ask what did it provide for education--an assumption just like the assumptions of the Senator from New Mexico--I would like to tell you what it does. 
   In 1999, that function on education had $47 billion in it. By the year 2009, it has $60 billion in it. It specifically provided that education initiatives receive an added amount of $37 billion over 5 years, $101 billion over 10 years. 
   The Senator from New Mexico, my colleague and my friend, could ask, how are you sure that will happen? I am not. Neither am I certain that the Senator's sense-of-the-Senate resolution is anything but a wish list. How do we know it would happen? If we reduce taxes by the amount suggested, there is absolutely nothing to indicate there would be more added to education in the appropriations process. It is what the Senator thinks they should add; therefore, it is called a sense of the Senate. 
   Over the decade under the budget resolution adopted, and I am not certain it will be implemented because it is not binding, we actually vote every year on the appropriated accounts. So all Members know, the education function in that budget resolution has $570 billion, an average of $57 billion a year, while we are spending $47 billion this year. 
   I don't know where the other graphs came from that are talking about what we are doing to education. Those numbers are from the budget resolution. 
   Nobody knows at what level education will be funded on the discretionary side of the budget of the United States of America budget. They will not know any more if Senator BINGAMAN's sense of the Senate passes. They will say we should not cut taxes by $120 billion, because if we don't, we might put it in education. 
   Having said that, I merely want to look at the budget of the United States and the surplus that is created and then start with a freeze on everything, including education. And it may be the Senator is starting with a freeze and assuming it continues. How much is the surplus? It is $3.371 trillion. What do you do with it? We put $1.9 trillion in the trust fund for Social Security because it is there. We then say: Let's cut taxes in a gradual way over a decade at $792 billion. Then we ask how much is left over to spend on discretionary programs and Medicare. It turns out to be $505 billion. 
   I could not believe under any circumstance that the Congress of the United States, be it Republican, Democrat, or whatever, would take that $505 billion and spend it on education. I cannot believe that. There may be a difference of opinion as to where it is to be spent, but there is a whopping lot of money for high-priority items. 
   I don't know where the Senator got his numbers. If the numbers were legitimate, I would be supporting him. I believe we ought to establish a priority for education. If I thought we would not have enough money for the education function to be appropriated by the appropriators, I might even be saying don't cut taxes that much, but I don't think that is the case. I don't think we need to do that. There will be money around for education. It will grow dramatically because it is a high-priority item, and there is $505 billion over a freeze to be allocated for discretionary programs, and somewhere around 70, 80, or 90 for a Medicare prescription drug reform fix. 
   I regret doing this, but I do not think I want New Mexicans to think what I propose will destroy education in the manner that this sense of the Senate implies. If it did not imply that, I would be for it and I would not be speaking.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there won't be time tomorrow to say what I am saying tonight. That is why I came down. I congratulate the Senator from Delaware, Senator ROTH, and the Finance Committee for a fine job. 
   First of all, I am kind of infuriated, but I will keep my emotions down. The President of the United States has gone beyond what anybody would believe when today, in front of a bunch of young people, he as much as said the Republican plan will make sure you don't even learn how to read. That is disgraceful because the truth of the matter is, if the Congress wants to spend more money on education after this tax cut, there is plenty of money to do it. If the President is persuasive enough next year, he can get more money for education because there is more money to spend. 
   The second thing is not at that level for me, but Senator LAUTENBERG is just flat wrong. Do you know who was spending the Social Security surplus? The President was. In fact, he even sent to us his first proposal and said, only save 62 percent of it, spend the rest of it. He said, we will save it over 15 years, so don't worry year by year about putting it in the trust fund. We challenged him on that. He came back in his midsession review and said: Republicans, you are right: Let's put 100 percent in. So we put 100 percent in the lockbox, into security. So I don't understand what Senator LAUTENBERG is talking about. 
   Having said that, let me talk about this bill because it is a very masterful bill, considering where we are. First, there is no question that marriage,  saving for retirement, and dying should not be taxable events as we enter the new century. If there is anything we have learned, it is that we need to enhance and praise marriage, not punish it. We need to encourage saving for retirement, and we should not tax the event of dying. Isn't it wonderful that we have fixed all of those to a great extent in this bill? What is the matter with that? 
   Mr. President, that is what you are going to be vetoing when you veto this bill. 
   Alternative minimum tax. That is, the alternative minimum tax should not turn the child care credit, education credit, HOPE education tax credit, and foster care credits into phantom tax relief, not worth the paper they were written on because an old alternative minimum tax, adopted during the oil boom, would make these credits unusable, so when you hear these funny words, ``Let's fix the alternative minimum tax,'' it is hundreds and hundreds of thousands of middle-income Americans who thought we gave them an education credit, who thought we gave them a child care credit, only to find that now the alternative minimum tax takes it away. That has been fixed. 
   Taxes are too high if measured by what is needed to fund the Government. They are too high if measured historically. The average family is paying twice what they paid in 1985. The tax burden is 54 percent heavier when measured from President Bill Clinton's first day in office to the end of 1999. He may take a lot of credit for other things, but that is a fact. Despite these record increases, the administration's 2000 budget proposes another $170 billion in new taxes. Unbelievable. 
   Broad-based tax relief. The Senate bill starts off with broad-based relief, lowering the bottom brackets for everyone in our families across America, and then in the bill, after lowering the rate to 14, they raise the brackets by $10,000. 
   That means that millions more Americans will be paying the lowest possible rate. 
   This bill provides significant family relief, although not as much as my good friend from Texas would like on the marriage penalty. 
   I ask our seniors across America, as the President tries to frighten them into thinking we are harming them on Medicare and Social Security when that is not the truth, wouldn't you like it if your sons and daughters who are paying a marriage penalty because they are married are treated like other citizens instead of punished? I believe senior citizens would be very grateful for that for their children--the millions across America. 
   Child care: I think the seniors who they are trying to frighten to death because they want an issue and not a solution would be thrilled to know that Chairman BILL ROTH and his Finance Committee made it easier for their grandchildren to be taken care of under child care and the enormous costs that it imposes on a family. We have made it more accessible, and we have made more advantageous tax laws. 
   Their Tax Code is notorious for giving a tax break on the one hand and then taking it away on the other. That is the alternative minimum tax, and it works in that fashion. This bill that has been put before the Senate protects the child credit, and it protects education credits. 
   Mr. President, and fellow Senators, there is much more that can be said about it. I suggest that this bill will do more for millions of Americans. 
   Taxes are too high if measured by what is needed to fund government. 
   Taxes are too high if measured by historical benchmarks. The average family is paying twice what they paid in 1985. 
   The tax burden is 54 percent heavier when measured from President Clinton's first day in office to the end of 1999. Despite these record increases, the Administration's 2000 budget proposes another $170 billion in new taxes. 
   The Senate bill starts out with broad-based tax relief. Lowering the bottom bracket gives a tax cut to every taxpaying family. The bill lowers the rate to 14 percent. I would have liked to see it go even lower. 
   The bill also widens the lowest bracket so that more people can earn more money without being forced into the 28 percent bracket. This change will return 4 million Americans to the lowest bracket. It will return 151,000 New Mexicans to the lowest bracket and at the same time another 83,000 New Mexicans will see their taxes cut. 
   This bill also provides significant family tax relief. 
   Saying ``I do'' at the altar has meant paying on average $1,400 more on April 15. Marriage shouldn't be a taxable event. This bill corrects this inequity for 19 million American families. 
   As more and more women have entered the work force, one of the fastest growing family expenses is child care. In New Mexico, the annual cost can run from $3,133 to $5,200 per child. This bill increases the child care credit from 30 to 50 percent for families earning less than $30,000, and expands the eligibility for the credit to all families. With the credit increase and the eligibility expansion, as many as 68,000 New Mexico families will be eligible for either a bigger credit or first-time eligibility. 
   The tax code is notorious for giving a tax break with one hand and taking it way in the other. The Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, works in this fashion. This bill protects the child care credit, education credits, day care and other norefundable tax credits from being rendered unusable by the AMT. When the AMT was created in 1986, 140,000 people had to pay it. But by 2008: 
   There will be 40.6 million Families eligible for dependent child credits but 24.8 million of those families would receive zero or less than the full credit as a result of the AMT. 
   There will be 49 million familes with nonrefundable credits--all credits except EITC--and 33.9 million of them will receive zero or less than the full credits as a result of the AMT. 
   There will be 16 million families eligible for HOPE and lifetime learning credits, but 11.3 million would receive zero or less than the full credits as a result of the AMT. 
   The bill recognizes that all family expenditures are not equal. This tax bill recognizes that education is important and provides $12 billion over ten years in tax relief. The bill includes education savings accounts to help 14.3 million families. Seventy percent of these education tax benefits goes to families with incomes less than $75,000. It makes employer provided education assistance permanent. In this ever changing technology-driven world, it is essential that workers pursue life long learning and complete graduate degrees. The bill also makes it easier and cheaper for school construction. There are more than 1,700 schools in New Mexico that I hope will be helped by this initiative. 
   In New Mexico there are 331,815 public school students. It would be wonderful if New Mexican--parents and grandparents started as soon as this bill is signed into law to open an account for each of these 331,815 children. There would be no better investment in America's future and these education accounts should help families meet that goal. 
   When it comes to health care, the Tax Code doesn't discriminate based upon who you are, but rather upon who you work for. Families shouldn't receive disparate tax treatment determined by who you work for. It isn't fair that one worker has health care purchased with pre-tax dollars; while the sole proprietor or the employee of a small business has to pay for 
   health care with after-tax dollars. 
   This bill provides 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed. It also provides an above-the-line deduction that will phase in from 25 percent to 100 percent for every taxpaying American family. There are 43.3 million uninsured people in America, plus 10.2 million who have access to health insurance but decline to participate because of the high cost. This is a big problem in New Mexico. There are 340,000 uninsured New Mexicans where someone in the family works. 
   The bill provides generational equity by providing a child care and a long term care credit. One in four families care for an elderly relative. This bill provides a tax credit and an extra exemption for the in home care giver. 
   Expensing is the most efficient way of reducing the cost of capital for new investment. The bill provides $5,000 worth of new efficiency for every small business by increasing the amount that can be written off in the year the investment is made. A tax policy that allows capital investments to be deductible in the year they are made maximizes productivity, economic growth and job creation. When a company  doesn't have to calculate depreciation it saves 43 hours a year in tax preparation. If we adopted a system of expensing we could save 106 million hours a year in tax and recordkeeping. We would also lower the cost of capital by about one-third. 
   This bill takes significant steps to reduce the estate and gift tax . The bill would lower the top rate to 50 percent, double the gift tax exclusion and get rid of the generation skipping transfer tax which can impose taxes as high as 80 percent when a gift is left to a grandchild. 
   Milton Friedman said and I agree, ``The estate tax sends a bad message to savers, to wit: that it is o.k. to spend your money on wine, women and song, but don't try to save it for your kids. The moral absurdity of the tax is surpassed only by its economic irrationality.'' 
   The death tax is also one of the most unpopular taxes. While most Americans will never pay it, 70 percent believe it is one of the most unfair taxes. 
   Its damage to the economy is worse than its unpopular reputation. The Tax Foundation found that today's estate tax rates (ranging from 18 to 55 percent) have the same disincentive effect on entrepreneurs as doubling the current income tax rates. NFIB called it the ``greatest burden on our nation's most successful small businesses.'' 
   This bill makes a major stride. It makes the R&E credit permanent. 
   With a $3.2 trillion surplus, the only responsible, legitimate course of action is a tax cut. 
   Foolish are they who argue against tax cuts. They say to working families, ``I know what to do with your money better than you do. Give it to me so I can spend it for you.'' 
   The tax burden is high. People work until May 11, of each year to pay their taxes. It is the highest tax burden since WWII. People pay more in taxes than they spend on food, shelter and education. 
   The Senate tax plan is an excellent plan that moves us toward lower, flatter, simplier taxes. It moves our tax system toward taxing income that is consumed and not income that is earned, saved and invested. 
   It's the same old debate: one party wants to give the money to programs; we want to give the money to people. 
   A government big enough to give you everything is a government that takes everything away with a big tax bite. I can't imagine anything more frightening to the average taxpayer than the sight of grand government schemer rushing towards a trillion dollar pile of extra tax payer dollars. 
   Republicans say it is the best of times for a tax cut; the Democrats say it is the worst. Everyone quotes Chairman Greenspan. When Greenspan is deciphered the oracle is that a tax cut is better than spending all the money. 
   If the surplus were a dollar 2 quarters would go for Social Security reform; one quarter for high priority spending --education, research, and defense. 
   With the first three quarters we can save social security, reform medicare, provide adequate funding for domestic and defense spending and pay down the national the debt. 
   The remaining quarter is for tax cuts. 
   The Taxpayer Refund Act before the Senate is the best of plans. It lowers rates. It encourages savings. It eliminates the worst of a bad tax code by eliminating the marriage penalty; killing the death tax and ending the Alternative Minimum tax to rescue the full benefit of the child care, foster care, education, and other needed tax credits for families who otherwise unavoidably would end up in the AMT. 
   If not tax cuts now, then when? The Democrats say--not ever. 
   I say, If not tax cuts now, then what? The President's plan answers: Spend it all. Grow government! 
   The Senate plan is synchronized to our business cycle and the condition of the economy. Congress' budget allocates 75 percent of the projected surpluses over the next 10 years for paying down the debt. This ensures our long-term fiscal virility. 
   Even with our tax cut, our surpluses will climb steadily as a share of GDP and our national debt will be paid off--falling dramatically from 40 percent of GDP this year to only 12 percent by 2009. our plan lowers the level of debt more than the President's plan, keeps government from growing out of control and gives the American people some of their hard earned money back in the form or a well-thought out tax cut.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before my friend, Senator ROTH, leaves the floor, let me say to the Senate that Senator ROTH has come through again for the Senate and for the people of this country. 
   His tax bill is clearly one that recognizes fairness, that puts the money where it ought to be put, gives back to the American people some of their money, and it does it in a way that clearly is prudent and responsible. 
   It will be very difficult when we are finally finished explaining this bill for the President of the United States to veto this bill. 
   We are going to talk about that a little later in the day. Since he has challenged us, we will tell the American people loud and clear what he is going to be doing when he vetoes this bill. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the budget blueprint that Congress has passed for the first decade of the 21st century. It embodies three major things: Social Security, first and foremost. Much will be said about it. But nobody can deny that with this refund to the American taxpayers, we have left intact every single penny of surplus that belongs to the Social Security trust fund, and we will even debate on the floor locking it up so it is very hard to spend. 
   The budget before us and that we adopted demanded that 100 percent of all the funding that Social Security recipients will need will be exclusively set aside for that purpose. 
   Second, it sets aside enough money to meet the demands of Medicare for the next 10 years. Medicare is fully funded under the budget that was adopted by the Congress this year. That means there are no cuts. The program is fully funded for the decade. As a matter of fact, the President cut Medicare in the first 5 years of his budget. We did not do that. Then we would have a rainy day fund to implement any Medicare reform that Congress might enact. I will allude to that soon. 
   Third, after all the bills of the decade have been paid, after Social Security recipients have their money set aside, after we have funded every penny anticipated for Medicare, and have an ample rainy day fund available, if we want to do something on prescription drugs, then we would send back the excess to the American taxpayers--to the working families--and those in middle- and low-income brackets will get a very substantial tax reduction. 
   The budget resolution recognized economic conditions now, and the projected economics including the planning for an inevitable recession that might occur in the future. It outlined a decade-long, phased-in tax cut. Only a very small tax cut was envisioned in the first 2 years of this budget timeframe because the economy is already operating above optimum capacity. We want to keep inflation subdued and interest rates low. The budget expected Congress to pass a tax bill that was very small in the first 2 years and grew as the decade wound its way through into the next millennium. 
   I congratulate again the chairman of the Finance Committee and the members of that committee for producing the kind of tax cut for our budget for the 21st century. I think it is appropriate, prudent, and fair. Chairman ROTH has produced a tax cut that starts small and ends up larger, reflecting economic conditions. He has produced a tax cut that targets help to those who really need it--those with children in school, those with elderly and ill parents who need long-term care, those who are trying to save for their own retirement instead of Government reliance, and many more items of that nature and of that significance. 
   Yes. The same old class warfare arguments like tired, defeated soldiers of past wars have begun to stagger across the Senate debate again--and they will be here before us again--that we are only helping the rich. We are told we must spend the surplus. That is essentially the argument against our tax refunds--we 
   must spend the surplus. We must grow Government. It is the same old debate. 
   One party wants to give money to programs. And we want to give money to the people. That is exactly the way it has been, and that is exactly the way it is on this floor. 
   I believe there is a degree of arrogance in those who argue against tax cuts. They say to working families: I  know what to do with your money better than you do. Give it to me so I can spend it. 
   Can you imagine the arrogance of that position? They have grand schemes now with the surpluses. 
   Republicans, through their dedicated efforts, and Dr. Greenspan and his fantastic ability to manage the money supply in our country, and to control interest rates, have given the Nation this enormous surplus. The President of the United States thinks they have the money to implement new, grand schemes and to grow government. That is the issue. 
   A government big enough to give you everything is a government that takes everything away in the form of high taxes. 
   I didn't originate that quote. I can't imagine and I can't fathom anything more frightening to the average taxpayer than the sight of a grand government schemer rushing toward a $1 trillion pile of extra taxpayer dollars. 
   Republicans say it is the best of times for tax cuts. Democrats say it is the worst of times. Everyone quotes Dr. Alan Greenspan. 
   The Taxpayers Refund Act before the Senate is the best of plans. 
   It lowers rates. 
   It encourages savings. 
   It eliminates the worst of a bad Tax Code. It eliminates the marriage penalty for many Americans. It begins the death of a death tax. It ends the alternative minimum tax, to rescue the full benefit of child care, foster care, education, and other needed tax credits for families who otherwise unavoidably would end up in the alternative minimum tax brackets. They are sick of this. They are worried about it. 
   You will get more mail on this issue because it is grossly unfair to give credits and then take them away--to run across the land saying: We are delighted to have given you a credit for your children's education only to find that middle-income Americans by the hundreds of thousands are falling into this alternative minimum tax trap. 
   I say: Tax cuts, if not now, when? 
   The Democrats say not now. 
   I say: If not tax cuts now, then what? 
   The President's answer is: Spend it all. It does not matter what he says he wants to spend it for; he wants to spend it all. 
   Can you imagine if we did not have this surplus? What will the President be doing--asking for tax increases to pay for these programs he thinks we need? I doubt that. I doubt that very much. 
   I support prudent tax relief, and I must say this is prudent tax relief. It is synchronized to our business cycle and the condition of the economy. It improves our tax policy and moves us toward a system that taxes income that is consumed instead of income that is earned. 
   It moves America toward a tax system that allows business to deduct investments in the year they are made. It encourages investment in retirement, education, and health care. 
   Congress' budget allocates 75 percent of the projected surplus over the next 10 years for paying down the debt and long-term priorities. If the surplus were a dollar, two quarters would go for Social Security, one quarter for high-priority spending--education, research, and defense--and the remaining quarter for tax cuts. 
   Without tax cuts, who would spend the surplus? 
   Not the American people. The Government in Washington would spend it. Without tax cuts, we will ``grow'' Government. There can be no denial of that. The President plans to grow Government substantially rather than give back anything to the American people. He now says he would veto a $500 billion tax cut. What about $200, Mr. President? That means giving the American people back about 6 cents of the surplus, at $200. Can we afford that? I believe we can afford 25 cents out of every $1 of surplus. 
   Democrats say the question is: tax cuts versus Social Security. Tax cuts or Medicare. Tax cuts or domestic spending. Tax cut versus debt reduction. 
   The right answer: It is not ``this'' versus ``that.'' The correct answer is, we can do all of the above. The size of the surplus lets us do it all. That is the reality. Save Social Security, reform Medicare, provide adequate funding for domestic and defense spending, pay down the debt, and give the American people who earned the money a decent tax cut. Do that in a manner that phases in, which will probably be very complimentary to the American economy. 
   Even with the tax cuts and refunds we are talking about, our surplus will steadily climb as a share of GDP and our national debt will ultimately be paid off, falling dramatically from 40 percent of GDP this year to only 12 percent in 2009. Under the proposal we make, the external debt--the debt to the public--will go from 40 percent of the gross domestic product to only 12 percent by the end of the decade. 
   I am amazed the President's political advisers allege this budget is reckless. Nothing is reckless about steadily rising surpluses and paying down our debt by more than 50 percent over the next decade. In fact, our plan lowers the level of debt more than the President's plan. Some may wonder why. That is because the President spends heavily in the first 5 years. We have tiny tax cuts. Thus, he incurs more debt than we do at that time, and he cannot make it up in a decade. 
   I have been amazed by the administration and other opponents who claim our tax cut will lead to higher interest rates because the economy will overheat. That is just not true. The Fed is most concerned not with the economy as it is today but what it will be in 18 months and thereafter. Our tax cut is slow, a total of $28 billion over the years 2000 and 2001. I repeat, if they are worried about stimulus, it is $28 billion in tax cuts. It is almost unrecognizable in terms of impact one way or the other on the American economy. It saves 92 percent of the projected surplus during these first 2 years. As a result, our budget surpluses will rise sharply from 1.4 percent of the gross domestic product to 2 percent by 2001. 
   It is clear that the budget plan is not expansionary, which some people now talk about. It truly is not. Ask any economist to look at it in its true sense, phased in as it is, and ask if it is an expansionary budget. I cannot imagine this tax bill would be defeated on such a preposterous economic observation. 
   In House testimony last week, Chairman Greenspan cautioned against expecting any rapid stimulus as a result of this tax relief package. I can assure the American people that Congress' tax plan 
   will not overheat the economy. As a matter of fact, Chairman Greenspan cautioned against expecting a rapid stimulus as a result of this package, given the long phase-in of the tax cuts. 
   I can anticipate the response of my Democratic colleagues who are likely to say: If your plan is so ideally suited for the economy, why did Alan Greenspan argue we should let surpluses run for a while before cutting taxes? 
   Listen carefully. I have two responses. First, I believe the Congress is doing exactly what the Chairman advised. Our budget plan delivers only $28 billion in tax cuts over the next 2 years. Most of that relief is scheduled to arrive only after surpluses have mounted on a consistent basis. Second and more important, Chairman Greenspan is advising what policies would be best in an ideal world. However, he is fully aware that ideal may not be politically feasible. 
   Let me read a quote he made last week which I think was insightful:  
   There is nothing that I can see that would be lost by allowing the process to delay unless, as I have indicated many times, it appears that the surplus is going to become a lightning rod for major increases in outlays. That's the worst of all possible worlds from a fiscal policy point of view. That, under all conditions, should be avoided. I have great sympathy for those who wish to cut taxes now, to preempt the process. And indeed if it turns out they are right, I would say moving on the tax front makes a good deal of sense to me.  
   The worst of all fiscal policies will materialize if the President gets his way. The President proposes to increase spending by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Most of this new spending would go to create 80 new, often repetitious, often local-government-prerogative-infringing Government programs, with services already being handled at the local or private sector. The President's spending proposals are the worst of all proposals from the standpoint of what is good for America during the next 2 years. That time horizon must concern the Federal Reserve. 
   The President proposes to use $53 billion of the surplus for new spending. It  is nearly twice as large as our tax cut in the next 2 years. Thus, the President's plan would be far more stimulative than the Congress' measured tax cut. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle if they are worried about interest rates rising because the economy is overheating, why support the President's Government-growing agenda over tax cuts? The money is there. We have a surplus. 
   The last question is the $792 billion question: Who is going to spend it? When faced with the President, who wants to spend the surplus, Congress has no choice but to cut taxes. However, we have to be careful. While we are still saving the majority of the surplus for shoring up our long-term fiscal health, we must be careful in that regard. 
   To sum up, I leave two messages today. Our budget is prudent, and it is synchronized for where we are in the business cycle. Be skeptical of the administration's criticism of our tax plan. They want to grow Government well in excess of Congress' tax cut. Most of the spending has nothing to do with Social Security or Medicare. This is what should most concern the American people when faced with the surplus, excluding Social Security funds, and I have already indicated what will happen to them. The Republicans want to give it back to the people who earned it and worked so hard. 
   The big question then is, Who is going to spend the surplus? 
   With tax cuts, the answer is you; without tax cuts, the answer is big government. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Presiding Officer to tell me when I have used 10 minutes. 
   I heard the distinguished Senator from Montana, Mr. BAUCUS, say there is not one nickel for Medicare in this Republican budget. That is absolutely wrong. Perhaps the Senator forgot to include the fact that there is $3.1 trillion in this budget for Medicare, fully funded. 
   What the Senator should have said was: Shame on the President. He is accusing Republicans, and he underfunded Medicare $31.5 billion on purpose. He did such things in his budget as freezing hospital costs for rural America. Senators, including the distinguished Senator from Montana, are worried about that. The President's proposal is that it be frozen for another year. That is where he picked up $31.5 billion. Guess what he did with it. He spent it on other domestic programs. That is the stark reality, unequivocal truth. 
   Having said that, let me start with a quote from the CBO on July 23 of 1999. It has some real application to the so-called Medicare lockbox that is being proposed today to confuse the issue. The issue is putting a lockbox around Social Security. The other side doesn't want to vote for that for some reason, so they say: Let's do another lockbox, let's do Medicare, and we will get credit for reducing the debt. 
   Here is what they say about it. 
   The chief criticism that the President--that is, OMB--has of CBO is that,  
   ......we did not give them credit for $328 billion in transfers from the general fund to the Medicare trust fund.  
   Then they say,  
   That's right, we didn't, and that's because transfers from one part of government to another do not reduce the public debt.  
   The whole argument the President is taking to the American people is that he reduces the debt more than we do. But one of his big-ticket items is this one right here. The Congressional Budget Office says that $328 billion that he wanted to move out of the general fund, so it could not be used for tax cuts, he puts in the Medicare trust fund and wants credit for reducing the debt. 
   What does the Congressional Budget Office say? Fundamentally the most simple of all propositions: We did not give them credit for that because transfers from one part of Government to another do not reduce public debt. That is an interesting one. 
   Then, in addition, we had a very good Senator who does not agree with the Democrats on everything and say--this is BOB KERREY:  
   The President also has a great deal of pain in his plan--a hidden pain in the form of income tax increases that will be borne by future generations of Americans.  
   He is alluding to the $328 billion which are IOUs, and he says:  
   I strongly disapprove of a plan that provides a false sense of complacency that Social Security has been saved by this nebulous and vague idea of ``saving the surplus''--  
   The very same thing applies to Medicare--  
   while failing to disclose the real pain that will be imposed on future generations.  
   When they will have to pay for it, is what he is saying. Their income taxes are going to go up by the amount of $328 billion or whatever amount the Democrats allegedly want to secure for Medicare by putting it in some kind of lockbox in an on-budget trust fund. 
   I also ask an interesting question: Is there anybody who can stand on the floor of the Senate and suggest that by taking this money away from the taxpayers and shuffling it over into a trust fund extends the date by which we run out of money to pay the Medicare people what they are entitled to? Does it increase any? Not at all. You have to change the payment plan to do that. That is what Medicare reform is all about. 
   Having said that, I could even quote the President's own OMB budget about it. 
   Suffice it to say, anybody who wants to read this can. But even they say, ``only in a bookkeeping sense'' does this carry out any real purpose--in a bookkeeping sense, nothing else. We don't need bookkeeping; we need to decide what we are going to do with this surplus. 
   I believe I understand the nature of this surplus. I am working very hard to convince people that we all ought to agree on one set of facts and then see where we are. 
   So I would like to suggest to the Senate, if they find fault with this, they can do their own. But I submit that we 
   have, if you start with a freeze on domestic spending for the next 10 years--Do not jump up and say we cannot do that. I know we cannot do that. But if we start with that, we have an accumulated surplus of $3.3 trillion. We ought to then talk about how the Republicans plan to use that. Very simply, we take every penny that belongs to Social Security and we say put it in a lockbox. That is the debate tonight. But put it in a real lockbox, don't put it in a lockbox such as the one that is offered here on the floor tonight. It is unbelievable that the other side would even claim to have a lockbox. 
   They create another budget point of order on top of at least four that already exist, against a budget resolution that has an on-budget deficit. That is exactly the issue. You can call it Social Security or whatever. There are already four points of order on that. You do not need this new lockbox on Social Security. 
   But let me suggest, let's continue on. If this is the way you look at a surplus, then set all the Social Security money aside. Then go and say, What do we do with the rest of it? We submitted the proposal that was put in this budget resolution when we designed it and voted on it for a tax cut over a 10-year period. 
   People are acting as if we are cutting $792 billion worth of taxes next year. Do you know how much we are cutting taxes next year? Four billion dollars. They are worried about whether we have a tax plan that will overstimulate the American economy. That is so small that it is in the range of rounding errors in terms of the tax take of America. 
   In the next year it is maybe twice that--$8 or $10 or $12 billion. It does not do anything to inflate this economy because we are planning it right. We are planning it to come in piecemeal, as a booming American economy can absorb it. That is $792 billion. If you want  to know the number, that is 23.4 percent of this total surplus. 
   I have been using a dollar bill. It caught on. The Democrats have used dollar bills, and they got us all confused. They have two different dollar bills, one cut in thirds, one cut some other way. Ours is simple. We have not cut it any way. We say one-quarter of it, 23.4 percent, should go back to the American people. It is tough for Democrats to believe this, but plain old arithmetic says there is $505 billion left over. The other side says there is not a nickel in this for Medicare. 
   Before they came to the floor, before this idea that we were not doing anything for Medicare became a political issue, the budget resolution had $90 billion in it for Medicare--the one you voted on, Republicans. It had $90 billion in. Now, look here, there is $505 billion worth of domestic priorities. We submit it is up to the Congress and the President to decide how to use it. But would anybody believe we are not going to use part of it for prescription drugs? Of course we are. And, incidentally, is that enough money? 
   Do you know how much the President said we need for prescription drugs? And he would have sold this to the American people, except it is impossible. He said $48 billion of that is what you need to fix, reform, and pay for prescription drugs. It turns out he totally underestimated it. It is more like $111 billion--$118 billion. But the truth of the matter is, take $90 billion out of it, take $100 billion out of it; that leaves $405 billion to add to discretionary. 
   Just in rough numbers, you could add about $50 billion a year. If you do $100 billion worth of Medicare, you can add $40 billion a year. Is that enough? 
   Tomorrow I will put up a chart showing how much discretionary spending has gone up in the last decade. I would be surprised if it went up $40 billion, net increase, in very many of the years. 
   So essentially we have only one issue here: Do we lock up, in an irretrievable manner, as suggested in the Abraham-Ashcroft-Domenici lockbox, which is really a lockbox--such a lockbox that the Secretary of Treasury was even worried that it did not give Government enough flexibility, so we changed it to give them some flexibility. We provide, in the case of a war, in the case of great emergencies, you are not bound by it. We provide some other flexibility. 
   But the truth of the matter is that this is a prudent way, if you decide you do not want to use the surplus to grow big, big, big, big Government. If you want to grow it, then do it the way the President recommends: Do not have this tax cut in; have a little piece of one.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. In fact, I am prepared to make a guess, if they want us to settle for $300 billion--and $792 billion, rounded to $800 billion, is almost 25 percent--they would like to give the American taxpayers back less than a dime, it looks to me. So if they have a chart up that explains their position and want to use an American dollar, put it up and clip it off at 10 percent and say: That is what we would like to give you back because we need all the rest of it because we want to increase spending. 
   I do not think this applies to the distinguished Senator who is making the argument in behalf of the Democrats. I do not think he would want to spend all that money. But I do believe the President has snookered us all. He has us believing we are really going to harm the American people by not paying for every new program he has in mind and more. And, frankly, that is just not true. 
   In fact, tomorrow, if I can, I will put up about five of the President's new programs, I say to Senator ABRAHAM. I will get them on a chart here, and I will ask the American people: Which do you prefer? These five new programs? Or would you prefer to make it easier to pay off student loans? Would you prefer to make it easier to take care of an elderly parent? Would you prefer to stop penalizing marriage? Or would you prefer a new program? It does not matter what new program. New programs are new programs, if they are added to the expenditure of the Federal Government and are making it grow. 
   We believe it is a pretty good size right now. We believe there is a need for some growth. We believe there is a need in some instances to increase dramatically what we have been spending, and we voted for that in our budget resolution. We said education is one of them, if you will reform the way we give it to the States. Let's put more money in, not less. We said that. We argued it here on the floor. We propose to stick with that. 
   But the truth of the matter is that our lockbox will make our tax cut reasonable and plausible and will make sure the Social Security people are safe. 
   I close tonight by suggesting to everybody who is listening to this debate the President continues to raise the issue and Democrats are following him almost in rote marching, and that is, they get cranked up and they say: We want to save Social Security; we want to save Medicare, which simply means you should not have tax cuts. 
   Here is $1.9 trillion waiting for you to tell us how to fix Social Security. Is it so complicated? No, it is not complicated. He prefers the issue to a solution. That is why we are on the floor. He does not want to submit a Social Security reform program. He wants to continue to hoodwink us into thinking if you give the people a tax cut, you cannot fix Social Security. 
   I will bet the President would not submit a Social Security program that would cost so much that it would not leave money for a tax cut out of this surplus. That is absolutely incredible that he would do that. I do not believe he would submit a Medicare reform program that would be so big and so costly that there would not be money for a tax cut. As a matter of fact, he kind of shocked me. He submitted a reform Medicare plan that only costs $48 billion, if he was right in his numbers. It turns out he is not right, but had he been right, he would have been submitting one that cost $48 billion. I submit there is plenty of money left over to do that. 
   My last argument, and it will take a minute, is there are some suggesting we should not do this now. If we do not do this now, we will never do it because, as a matter of fact, as we proceed through, we will obligate all this money one way or another for some American program, and then we will say there is not any money left for tax cuts. 
   For those who are so frightened about us having a negative impact on the American economy, let me suggest, for the next 3 years, our impact is insignificant, almost negative. It begins to grow a little bit in the outyears, but even the great doctor--as PHIL GRAMM said today--he is like the Bible, everybody quotes him but nobody reads him. That is what PHIL GRAMM said today on the floor. Even he said if you are going to spend it, have a tax cut. He also said the Republican plan is not significant enough in size over a 10-year period or annually to have a negative impact in terms of the American economy. 
   I think we are on the right track. Will the Senator yield me 1 additional minute?

   Mr. DOMENICI. We are on the right track, and I think the Democrats have missed the boat. They are mixing apples and oranges when they try to confuse us on another lockbox for Medicare. I think tonight we have just about disposed of that as being a ridiculous approach which I call anything but a tax cut approach. Frankly, with that size surplus accumulated over this period of time, I say if you cannot give back a little bit of it to the American people, then what do they elect us for? I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am so very pleased that the Senate has passed H.R. 66, and taken an historic step in preserving one of America's cultural treasures--Route 66. I have long championed preservation of Route 66, the ``Mother Road,'' which changed and shaped America in the twentieth century. This body had already passed my legislation earlier this year, S. 292, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Act. Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON of Albuquerque, New Mexico, reintroduced a companion bill (H.R. 66) in the House of Representatives, and after a few amendments, we have finally got legislation which will preserve the unique cultural resources along the famous Route and authorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance through the Park Service. I have been working for this day for nine years. 
   This legislation almost became law at the end of the 105th Congress, but failed to pass in the House of Representatives due to last minute political wrangling. However, no one has ever questioned the merit of this legislation. 
   I introduced the ``Route 66 Study Act of 1990,'' which directed the National Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, commemorate, and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I introduced legislation last Congress authorizing the National Park Service to join with Federal, State, and private efforts to preserve aspects of historic Route 66, the Nation's most important thoroughfare for East-West migration in the twentieth century. 
   H.R. 66 authorizes a funding level over 10 years and stresses that we want the Federal Government to support grassroots efforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway. The Secretary of the Interior can now support State, local, tribal, and private organizations' efforts to preserve these resources. 
   Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to Santa Monica, CA. It rolled through eight American States and three time zones. In New Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants, and Gallup. New Mexico added to the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of Americans their first experience of our colorful culture and heritage. Route 66 allowed generations of vacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. 
   While mobility of Americans has increased, few have forgotten the impact of this two-lane roadway of our youth. The ``Grapes of Wrath'' illustrates how depression-era families utilized this ``Mother Road'' to escape the dust bowl and start new lives in the West. The western U.S. was later opened to tourism, and many people learned the beauties of this entire country, Midwest to West. And I think a few folks discovered that New Mexico really is the Land of Enchantment. 
   The bill is designed to assist private efforts to preserve structures and other cultural resources of the historic Route 66 corridor. I am pleased that as we reach the turn of the century, we have recognized this historic landmark, and the impact it had on this Nation in this century. 
   I thank my colleagues for once again recognizing the importance of this legislation. I also want to thank the many New Mexicans and the National Historic Route 66 Federation for their support and help in this effort. Finally we will have a law recognizing the twentieth century equivalent to the Santa Fe Trail.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I was here, as was the Senator from Texas, when the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, spoke. What kept coming to my mind was: When are Senators from authorizing committees expected to bring their bills to the floor and have votes? I came up with a very simple conclusion, with which my friend, Senator BYRD, will not agree, but I want to state it anyway. 
   The problem we find ourselves in where Senators must offer authorizing legislation time and time again on appropriations bills comes about because this institution, this beloved Senate, insists on doing every single appropriations bill every single year. There is no time for anything else. That is the real problem. Then we do a budget resolution every single year. I believe there is a number around that we use up about 67 to 70 percent of the available time of the Senate on just those two functions. 
   I hope, as we consider trying for 2-year appropriations and 2-year budgets, my good friend from West Virginia will be participating. We would like to hear his views. But I hope we can make the case that for the betterment of this institution, which he expressed my views on today when he spoke of how important it is to America, I have learned, as he has learned--when I came to the Senate, I was not steeped like him, so I did not know about it--it is to be a revered institution, and I want to keep it that way. 
   My last observation is, I think I might have been able to get up--not under your majority leadership, but sometime during my 28 years here, most of which was as a minority Member--and make the same speech you just made as to the leadership on that side of the aisle when your side was in the majority, because when you have what we are having take place here with fair regularity, as we try to pass 13 appropriations bills, and we hear the other side--not you, Senator--the other side say: You will not pass them until we get to take up our agenda--and their agenda is not appropriations; it is a list of eight or nine items that are their agenda; and in this body they are probably minority views, but they want to get them up--then I say that is a challenge to the majority leader. 
   That is hard stuff, because how do you then get the appropriations bills done and not have six of them wrapped up into one, which you just talked about, and put everything else in it but the kitchen sink? 
   So, frankly, I appreciate your discussion today. Clearly, it is intended to help your side of the aisle in a debate on whether or not the appropriations bills should have more authorizing amendments on them that Senators on your side want to offer. In joining  them, I commend you. It is pretty obvious to this Senator you have joined them so that you can make their case that they ought to be permitted. 
   But I also say, if you were in Senator LOTT's shoes, or if I were, and you were being told on every one of these bills this is another one we are going to get something that is the minority agenda, and you will have to vote on it or else, I would be looking for ways to get the appropriations bills done.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the distinguished Senator from Texas has joined me on the floor and that I am permitted to join him in the beginning of a debate. I know the Senator has to leave, and I will try to make my most succinct points in the next 5 minutes. 
   First, I will share with the American people, and in particular with my friend, how I see giving back some money to the taxpayers versus what else we are going to do with the surplus. I choose today, even though I looked around for a different dollar, an American dollar. This one is not signed by the new Secretary of the Treasury. I looked for one. I am not sure he signed any yet. This is one signed by his predecessor. 
   I want everybody to look at that. It represents, in my analogy today, the entire surplus that is going to be generated. According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, using moderate economics, even assuming we are going to have a couple of downturns or recessions in the next 10 years, the total surplus we are going to accumulate is this number, if you will all just look at this chart. It is a little bigger than the Senator has been using, and the numbers are a little bigger in terms of how much we have left over to be spent, but it is $3.37 trillion in the next decade.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I am using everything. This represents everything. Here is what the President says. The President says: Spend it all. Is that true? Does he say spend it all? 
   Well, look here. Here is a chart showing the entire $3.71 trillion. He says, and we say, put $1.9 trillion of it on the debt by putting it in a lockbox for Social Security. Then the Congressional Budget Office evaluates the rest of the President's proposal. Here it is in yellow. It is $1.27 trillion, and every bit of that is literally spent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   The President will argue about that because he even says he has a tax cut. We have looked at the tax cut he proposed. Not PETE DOMENICI, not PHIL GRAMM, but the Joint Tax Commission evaluated it. They said it is not even a tax cut. It is an expenditure. It is in this spending, because the President is saying, collect taxes, give some of it back to some people so they can save it, but you are giving them tax dollars; you are not cutting their taxes. That is an expenditure of tax money. 
   Believe it or not, when you do that, the President increases taxes in his budget by $95 billion. 
   Let me use the same dollar and let me share it with the Senator. Here is the entire accumulated surplus. Republicans say very simply, here are two quarters. We are going to put those two quarters into the Social Security trust fund, 50 percent. The number that is available for spending is bigger than the Senator said. It is $434 billion for Medicare and other highly critical Federal programs, if there are any. So I am going to say one quarter for spending. And, lo and behold, what is the other quarter for? Tax cuts. 
   I ask the American people, out of $1, is 25 cents given back to the American people for overtaxation too big a tax cut? Is it something we should become worried about, that we are going to destroy our Government? 
   I believe the truth of the matter is that you can't have any tax cuts if you propose what the President has proposed, because I will show you again what he proposes. On Social Security, he finally came our way, as the Senator said, and said put it all in a trust fund. All of the rest is spent. 
   Let me ask, if we spend it all, is there any left for tax cuts? I mean, by definition, he is spending it all so there is nothing left for tax cuts. 
   A lot has been said about the distinguished economic stalwart of America, Dr. Alan Greenspan, in the last few days. What has he said about it? I want to tell my colleagues that regardless of what was said in the last few days, Alan Greenspan has essentially made two statements about a surplus. I will give verbatim one of them from January 29 before our committee. Here is what he said: I would prefer that we keep the surplus in place; that is, reduce the debt. ``If that proves politically infeasible,'' he said, ``cutting taxes is far superior to spending, as far as the long-term stability of the fiscal system and the economy is concerned.'' 
   In the last speech he made, and I quote: ``Only if Congress believes that the surplus will be spent rather than saved is a tax cut wise.'' 
   Now, we don't have to guess about that. Why do we not have to guess about that? Because the President has already told us he is going to spend it. So Dr. Greenspan said, if you are going to spend it, it is far better for America's economic future to cut taxes. 
   Essentially it seems to this Senator that we are being sold a bill of goods. 
   We are being told that to spend one quarter of the surplus, that giving back the American people some of their overtaxation is risky to the economy. Dr. Alan Greenspan said the riskiest thing to do with the surplus is to spend it. That is what he just said. We are saying that we agree with him. We think it is too risky to do what the President is recommending. He will, by the time he is finished, have spent every cent of it, and he will call some of it ``saving Medicare.'' 
   I want everybody to know this. Let's look at this chart again. I don't know how much it is going to cost for the Finance Committee and the House Members to fix Medicare. They are working on it. They have all worked terribly hard on a bipartisan commission, and the President shot it down. Senator BREAUX was involved in that, and he believed that we had one going. What we are saying--and this is very, very important--when we have completed our tax cut, there is $434 billion left for a Medicare fix, Medicare reform, and prescription drugs, if you want it, and for other highly important programs, such as education, defense, and others. In fact, we might, as the debate goes on, put together a budget and come to the floor and show how this $434 billion might be used so that everyone will know there is money for education, if that is what you want, and there is money for Medicare reform, if that is what you want, and there is money for defense, because we have been told that that is what is left over as a surplus item, and it doesn't belong to Social Security. So it is either used for tax cuts or it is spent. We are saying: Save a quarter of it, give it back in tax dollars, and put a quarter of it in a rainy day fund, so to speak--a quarter of the dollar I showed you. 
   I want to close with a few more comments.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to wrap this up, and I intend to do this everywhere I can, anyplace I am asked, on any TV show I can get on. In summary, plain and simple, it is the following: The man who is most responsible for a good American economy is probably Dr. Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board. He has said:  
   I would prefer that we keep the surplus in place and reduce the public debt. If that proves politically infeasible, cutting taxes is far superior to spending it.  
   Here is the Republican budget: Debt reduction in Social Security, in literal numbers. I used in the summary 50 percent; it is actually 56 percent. Literally, the tax cut is less than a quarter; it is 23 percent. The money left over for Medicare and other programs is 20.1 percent. Frankly, that is a good plan. That is balanced, and it is not risky. 
   Here it is encapsulated in another manner. Here is the President's plan: Of the $3.3 trillion accumulated over the next decade, $1.901 trillion goes into Social Security and debt service. He contends he has done more in debt service than we have. Frankly, who do you believe? We believe the Congressional Budget Office. They say we are putting more on the debt than the President is. So when his emissaries get on television and say ``we want to reduce the debt,'' the implication is that Republicans don't. But we are doing the same amount, or more, than the President. It is right there. 
   The President then says that they don't want to do any tax cuts because, if you look at his budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, including a tax cut--which is not a tax cut--he spends every nickel of it. If you want to talk 
   about a risky policy, that is a risky policy. From what I can tell, that is what Dr. Alan Greenspan said would be the worst thing to do--to spend all the surplus. 
   Last, our plan: Debt reduction and Social Security trust fund encapsulated, so they can't be spent, in a lockbox. Tax cuts, $794 billion, and for expenditure items that are very necessary, such as Medicare, education, defense, and others, there is $434 billion left over. 
   Now, it is very difficult when the Secretary of the Treasury--the new one--gets on talk shows and says what a risky policy this is. He talks about the fact that they want to preserve or do more on the debt than we do. We are bound by the Congressional Budget Office in the Congress, and they tell us we are doing as much, or more, than the President in that regard. They tell us the President is spending every dime of the surplus on one program or another, or for a tax cut that is not a tax cut. And they maintain that a Republican plan that says, use 75 cents on a dollar for Social Security, debt reduction, Medicare, and domestic priorities, and give 25 percent back to the public, is risky. What is risky about it? Is it risky to give 25 cents out of a dollar back to the public to spend and less risky to keep it here and let the Federal Government spend it? I don't believe anyone would agree it is more risky to give some of it back to Americans and let them spend it, as compared with keeping it here and spending the entire 100 percent of the surplus on Federal Government-controlled programs and projects. 
   Whatever time I have remaining, I yield back, and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, in a colloquy. 
   I want to begin by commending you, Senator GREGG, and your Ranking Member, Senator HOLLINGS, for the hard work you have done in crafting this Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary appropriations bill. You have done a great job in funding the priorities identified by the Committee in this bill. You have been particularly helpful to me in my efforts to curb the trafficking of Mexican black tar heroin in my home state of New Mexico. 
   A separate issue of particular importance in my home state is the Women's Business Center program at the Small Business Administration. In this bill, you have funded the Administration's request of $9 million for this program, and I applaud you for meeting the President's request. 
   Unfortunately, the President's request fails to address an important issue for the future of the Women's Business Center program. Particularly, the President's request does not take into account the need to allow existing WBCs to re-compete for federal funds once their initial five-year funding stream expires. So, many existing centers with outstanding track records of facilitating the growth of women-owned businesses and providing technical assistance to fledgling companies will go unfunded, while the SBA allows new, untested centers to open in other areas. Sacrificing the successful, existing centers to replace them with new, untested ones seems like bad policy. I think we need to open more new Women's Business Centers, but we also need to help the existing ones continue their work. 
   Senator BOND, the distinguished Chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator KERRY and I, along with a group of 25 bi-partisan co-sponsors, have introduced S. 791, the Women's Business Center Sustainability Act. This bill would increase the authorization for the Women's Business Center program to $12 million and allow existing centers to re-compete for up to 40 percent of the federal funds available under the program. Is the Chairman of the Subcommittee aware of this bill?

   Mr. DOMENICI. As the Chairman may know, an additional $2 million in funding this year would be critical to the effort to allow existing centers to re-compete for federal assistance. Without this additional funding, many existing centers will be forced to close their doors. Assuming that S. 791 passes both houses of Congress and is signed by the President later this year, I hope that the Chairman will be willing to find a way to provide this additional $2 million for the program once this bill gets to conference.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1217, the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Bill for 2000. 
   This bill provides new budget authority of $34 billion and new outlays of $23.1 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, and the federal judiciary. 
   I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member for producing a bill that complies with the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. This is one of the most difficult bills to manage with its varied programs and challenging allocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands made of it while not exceeding its budget. So I commend my friend, the chairman, for his efforts and leadership. 
   When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $34.1 billion in BA and $34 billion in outlays. For general purpose activities as well as crime funding, the bill is at the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for both budget authority and outlays. 
   I ask members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which would cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge the speedy adoption of this bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly agree we ought to adopt the amendment. I will speak for one moment on it. I will not address the first portion of it, wherein the amendment discusses the responsibility that rests with reference to making sure that appropriate communications occur rather than be stymied by the new Agency. 
   I think that is good language. I do not know that we would have had anything different than that in the underlying bill, but this clarifies it. I am pleased to be part of that. 
   With reference to the second part of the amendment, the Department of Energy has been operating with field offices--some of them very successful, some of them not so successful. There has even been a clamor over the past 5 or 6 years to create more of them rather than fewer of them. In fact, there have been proposals to create more field offices that this Senator personally has had to confront in the appropriations bill. 
   What this says is that rather than being silent in the bill with reference to the Rudman recommendation regarding field offices, this says the Deputy Secretary may use an appropriate field structure for programs and activities of the agency. I think that is good. It gives them the options and it gives them all they need for good management. What we are talking about is good management--field offices versus the national office. 
   So I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment. We have no objection on our side. I urge the chairman and cochairman of the Intel Committee to concur in our recommendations.

   Mr. DOMENICI. It has been a pleasure working with Senator BINGAMAN on this and on some other amendments. I say to the two floor managers, it is my hope we can take the four or five remaining issues and see if we can't get one amendment put together to see if we can resolve them. We should have an answer to that for the floor managers within the next half hour, 45 minutes. 
   Having said that, let me talk about the field offices for a moment. I have also been a proponent of the belief that if you can do some of the business of government down close to where the problems are, you are better off. I believe that such is the case with field offices. If properly run, under the appropriate accountability rules, wherein everybody knows who is accountable for what, I believe they can be very helpful. 
   Because I believe that, I think this amendment gives the option to retain them in a manner that will be helpful to the new Under Secretary as he puts together the semiautonomous entity. 
   I think much of the activity in field offices has been good. The fact the entire Department has made it very difficult to run the nuclear weapons part may be some of the reason the Rudman board was not thinking of field offices in a very good light. I believe it is imperative we look at it that way--in a good light. We have not told them how to use them. We have not told them what kind of role they play. We have said they may be used for programs and activities of the agency. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me, first of all, congratulate and thank Senator KYL. 
   There have been many Senators involved, including the occupant of the Chair, who have serious concerns about the issue. But I believe we have a great threesome who worked together fundamentally from the beginning. Senator KYL was more than willing right up front when the idea evolved. When we said let's work on it, he was most willing to take the lead, and, frankly, knows a lot about nuclear weapons, the safety, and the well-being of them. He knows a lot about the so-called science-based stockpile stewardship. He has not been an advocate of doing anything with reference to nuclear weapons that would diminish in any way America's great strength in that regard. I commend him and thank him for it. 
   I want to comment for just about 3 minutes on the issue that he raised. 
   There have been contentions that the Department of Energy is moving in the right direction. In fact, I think the  Secretary misspoke once when he said to the Congress and to the people we have taken care of the security problems. That is not a quote. It is just a general notion of what he said. 
   I noted over the weekend that the new four-star general, retired, has been put in charge of security and counterintelligence. They called him the czar. I note that he has indicated he is a year away from getting what he thinks is necessary under this dysfunctional department to be able to say we are taking care of the security issues in the best possible way. 
   Why wouldn't we hurry up and reorganize? Instead of that czar spending all of his time trying to get a structure set up under the old system--which everybody says isn't going to work, and which says, Good luck, general, but when you are finished with all of that, it isn't going to work--we ought to get this reorganization in the hands of that Department, in the hands of the President of the United States, and say, Let's get on with trying to implement. 
   I submit that it is going to be hard to implement. 
   There are many ties that are going to have to be broken. There are many parts of the Energy Department that are going to go down swinging in terms of them having little or nothing to say anymore about the nuclear weapons aspect of this. They all have parts in it. It has made it such a bureaucratic mess that even as I look at amendments that want to ease up a little on the semiautonomous nature, my mind immediately goes back to, well, if we open the door a little bit, we are just going to end up in 10 or 5 years right back where we are. 
   I want to make sure everybody understands that we want to keep it semiautonomous where the Secretary is ultimately engaged, but within that is something similar to the FAA that is doing its own work on nuclear weapons. I think we are close. 
   However, I suggest to those Senators who want to discuss amendments or who contemplate offering amendments, including the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator CARL LEVIN, that we hear from him soon as to what he wants to do. We have a proposal we are discussing about going somewhat in his direction but not totally. 
   I am trying to see if we can minimize amendments and get this done quickly. If not, I think we will just start voting. Some don't want to do that. I think we will have to do that within the next hour or so if we can't put things together. Then I will have a couple amendments, if that is the case. I think they are more acceptable than what I understand others are going to offer. We will get those debated.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the floor of the Senate today, yesterday in a press conference at the White House, today in a press conference, and this afternoon, the President of the United States will end about 48 hours of White House attack on tax cut proposals that Republicans have put forth. We are very grateful, however, that some Democrats are now espousing the same --in particular, in the Senate. The whole idea of the attack is, we don't have enough surplus to give the American people a tax break. 
   I hope the American people understand the contentions made by the President, by the Secretary of the Treasury, by those on the floor today from the other side who debated it. I hope they understand that this is an attack that should be called ``anything but taxes.'' That is the philosophy of those who are attacking what we are trying to do--anything but taxes. 
   For those who think we don't have enough resources, I will take some time today, both on the floor and in other places here at the Capitol, to explain that, indeed, it is a prudent plan. Indeed, there are sufficient resources, and there are sufficient resources in the broadest sense, to take care of our commitment to Social Security. We have done that. We want a lockbox, and we can't get it passed in this Senate. There is ample money for reform of the Medicare system to include prescription drugs. 
   We will also today let the American people know that the Congressional Budget Office believes the President's prescription drugs are not going to cost only $48 billion in new money; their estimate is they could cost $118 billion--a very important difference, more than double the amount. The point of all this is the contention that we can't take care of the rest of government if we have a tax cut. 
   I will just use a round number here. My recollection is that the surplus is $3.9 trillion--people can't even fathom $3.9 trillion--over the next decade. To put it in perspective, the entire budget of the United States on an annual basis, including Social Security payments, Medicare payments, all of the appropriated accounts, is about $1.8 to $1.9 trillion. Almost twice the total expenditures of the Federal Government in a given year is the surplus accumulating, according to the best estimators and best economists we can put on this issue--experts at both the Office of Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office. 
   I quickly penned some figures. If we have $3.9 trillion in surplus and we want a tax cut over a 10-year period of $782 billion, that is 20 percent of the surplus that would be given back to the American people by way of tax cuts and tax changes. That will make for better economic sense in the future. 
   That is a rough number. That is a gross number. However, it puts it in perspective. We ask the question, Where is the rest of it going? We will share in detail what we say it is going for and what the Congressional Budget Office says the President's budget is going to be used for. It will be an interesting comparison. 
   For those on the other side and those in the White House--including the Secretary of the Treasury--who think they will have free rein making their case, which in my opinion is 
   extremely partisan, it is Democrats in the White House, including the Secretary of the Treasury, who are saying, ``We are not for tax cuts,'' and making every kind of excuse in the world to avoid it. 
   We will make sure that our side of this is understood. We believe if we don't have a significant tax cut adopted now for the next decade, all that surplus will be spent. We can already see it in plans coming from the White House. We can already see it in the current budget of the President extended over a decade as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   I thank the Senate for giving me a little bit of time this morning. I clearly did not today present our case in its totality. I want everybody to know there is another side to the partisan antitax fever that will be coming out of the White House the next couple of weeks. That is what it is. It is a ferocious attack on anyone who wants to give back taxes to the American people, using all kinds of arguments, even if they are totally partisan, one-sided exaggerations. 
   We won't get as much news because the President's press conference will be heralded everywhere. Before we are finished, we will have a few spokesmen tell the American people what this is about. I wish we had an opportunity to present what we are going to present today to the House. I wish we could do it in a joint meeting to the public. The concern that there is not enough money for discretionary appropriations in defense is wrong. The notion that there is not enough money for Medicare--be it the President's $48 billion or the $118 billion that the CBO says a plan such as the President's would cost--is not so. 
   In these 5 minutes, that is the best I can do. I don't have charts. They prepared their charts for use today and hereafter. We will use them. Frankly, attacks on the budget resolution by the White House should get thrown in the wastebasket. If Members want to attack a budget, attack the President's budget and see what he did with all this surplus. See what the Congressional Budget Office says he will do with all this surplus. We know what we will do. We will lock up $1.9 trillion for Social Security. That leaves a very large amount for defense, education, and other areas--indeed, a very significant amount for Medicare, if we choose to reform it, and a tax cut about the size proposed in the budget resolution approved here. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, Senator FITZGERALD, had asked, before we knew the Senator was coming up, whether he could come to the floor and speak for 5 minutes. He got here, but the Senator had started so he was cut out for an hour. I wonder if we could have consent for the Senator to speak for 5 minutes and it not be counted against either side.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope this issue does not in any firm manner split the Senate. It seems to me that need not be the case. 
   I want to read from the original Rudman report and then I will try to put quickly into a framework why we think we have complied with what the distinguished Senator, the ranking member of the Department of the defense authorization committee, Senator LEVIN, is concerned about. 
   I am reading from page 46 of the report:  
   The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform of the weapons lab is simply unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations imposed by DOE management.  
   Actually, when you read that and you read the letter that came some 3 or 4 weeks after the report from the panel, talking about clarification, the best you can conclude is that it is not absolutely clear how we should do this. I submit that when you read the clarifications that were proposed with reference to the issue before us, we have solved that issue in this bill. I hope those who are thinking they can vote against the bill if we do not do this will understand. 
   On page 2 of the bill, as said a number of times, we have made it eminently clear that the Secretary is the ultimate authority; the Secretary, not the new Under Secretary. We have said:  
   There shall be within the department a separately organized agency under the direction, authority and control of the Secretary. ......  
   I do not read the rest of the sentence, but that is what it says. Then it says, at the request of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator BOB KERREY, paragraph C:  
   The Secretary shall be responsible for all the policies of the agency.  
   Then, at the request of others because they wanted to make sure the Secretary could use other Department people to help him--that is, the big Secretary--we said:  
   The Secretary may direct other officials of the Department who are not within the agency to review agency programs and make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the administration of such programs .....  
   And then--I read the next part very slowly:  
   ..... including consistency with similar programs and activities in the Department.  
   I read that, and other things in this bill, to say that those who are putting this bill before us to straighten up the Department and give us some security and counterintelligence that is reliable have, to the best of our ability, provided the Secretary and the new Agency with precisely what the Rudman board recommended. First, they wanted autonomy. I read that: It should be a structure free of all other obligations of the DOE. Yet it goes on in the supplemental report, or the letter of transmittal, saying here is our final interpretation of conflicts. It talks about some policies that ought to be consistent across the Department. 
   I do not believe we need to put language in that charges the Secretary with putting these policies that are departmentwide in place and then saying this new Agency is bound by them. I think the room ought to be there for the new Agency to prepare its programs in this regard, be it on the environment, be it on management, be it on safety, be it on whatever. The Secretary still has the overriding authority, if he chooses, to say: I have selected some members of the staff of the Department, we have reviewed it carefully, and we recommend that you change something because we want you to be more in harmony with the Department. 
   But to create a structure that is semiautonomous and then say whatever policies the Secretary pronounces that are departmentwide are binding on this Agency is to deny the Agency the autonomy right up front and to set the presumption in the wrong place. So I hope we do not do that. I am willing to clarify it, if it needs to be clarified further, but I do not think we need this provision ripping at the autonomy at the very outset, waiting around to see what the departmentwide rules are before you can implement this. I just think that is the wrong way to go. 
   Having said that, I want to recapitulate where we are going for just a moment. The amendments that have been offered so far have been offered on the Democrat side. Senator BINGAMAN and I have one we are going to offer together, that we have resolved and the Senate is going to accept, with reference to work for others within the laboratory, which has been an issue of concern. Then I understand there are a couple more amendments. 
   I want to say to my friend, Senator BINGAMAN, I know he has an amendment with reference to the environment. Since I have not offered an amendment, I am going to offer an amendment on the environment before he offers his. I am hopeful it will clarify the situation and he may not offer his. But if he chooses to, we will have one on the environment, safety, and others, so as to make it eminently clear we do not intend to exculpate this new Agency from any of the national environmental laws or the national laws with reference to safety. We never intended to. We will make it clear. 
   Beyond that, we have a little bit of time left. I, myself, am going to run out of time to be able to be down here working on this, but if the Senator thinks another 10 minutes of effort together will help--might I do it this way? Might I ask, how much time do we have left?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment. I was pleased to work with the Senator BINGAMAN and Senator REID in getting it developed. I thank our staff. 
   We are very proud that the laboratories do work for others. That means the Department of Defense and the private sector; it means other agencies of the Federal Government and work for the Department in other areas besides nuclear. It is important, and we knew it from the very beginning, that this flexibility and ability to do such work be protected to the maximum extent in the new configuration and management scheme. 
   I believe we have done that. It will not detract from its principal mission, which is the subject matter of the amendment, creating a new agency within the Department, but it will assure that these jewels of research, which are the three nuclear deterrent laboratories, remain at the high level they have been for many, many decades. That means it will work for others, thus attracting the very best scientists. 
   We think this can be done and protect intelligence and counterintelligence activities within the laboratories. 
   We have no objection on our side, and I don't assume there is any on the other side.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN. I will shortly send an amendment to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator LEVIN, Senator LIEBERMAN, and Senator REID. 
   Let me suggest, first, that this has been worked out during very serious discussions, and I think it turned out to be a very good amendment. 
   Senator BINGAMAN has played a vital role in it. He has been concerned and wants to make sure that it is eminently clear that this new semiautonomous Agency complied with the applicable environmental, safety and health rules, and laws. 
   I will read quickly a couple of sentences of the amendment and yield to my friend, Senator BINGAMAN, and see if we can agree. We have no objection on our side. I don't believe he has any on his side. 
   This is section (u), in the underlying Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment. It says:  
   The Agency for Nuclear Stewardship shall comply with all applicable environmental, safety, and health statutes and substantive requirements. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall develop procedures for meeting such requirements. Nothing in this section shall diminish the authority of the Secretary to ascertain and ensure that such compliance occurs.

In responding, let me first confirm for my friend from Idaho that it is not the intent of this amendment to shift or reassign responsibility for Idaho's Advanced Test Reactor to the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. Let me further acknowledge the larger issue that my colleague has raised, by stating that under the new Departmental structure created by the Kyl, Domenici, Murkowski amendment the Secretary of Energy should continue to ensure that the capabilities, skills and unique expertise of all of the Department's laboratories are made available to the national security programs of DOE. In this way, the beneficial collaboration between defense and non-defense sectors of the Department--a collaboration that has been taking place over the entire history of DOE--will continue under the new structure.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Our Independence Day, July 4th is also a significant day at the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico. On July 4, 1699, seventy-seven years before the famous American Independence day, the Spanish Governor of the New Mexico Territory sanctioned the ground-breaking for the Mission San Jose de la Laguna. 
   Laguna Pueblo has six villages--Laguna, Mesita, Paguate, Encinal, Paraje, and Seama. The Mission San Jose is the Mother Church for all the villages. To celebrate this important milestone, a feast day was declared for the Laguna Pueblo. Events started with a fund raising dinner on Friday, July 2. On Saturday, July 3, traditional dances were held at the main plaza and a beautiful fireworks display and community dance closed the first full day of celebration. 
   On Sunday, July 4, at 8 o'clock in the morning, an open air mass was celebrated by Bishop Donald Pelotte of the Archdiocese of Gallup. Laguna Pueblo drummers and singers in traditional dress participated in the mass. Pottery vessels by Laguna artists were made for the Eucharist. 
   Special guests included former U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, the Blessed Sacrament Sisters, Sisters of St. Agnes, and Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. Father Antonio Trujillo of the San Jose Mission was a key participant in the mass. He spoke of the importance of continuing to embrace two religious traditions in mutual respect. 
   Gratitude to all who organized this very special Independence Day event for Laguna Pueblo was generously given. Laguna Pueblo Governor Harry Early and the Pueblo Council were present and active throughout the activities. Special guests were introduced. 
   Traditional Indian dances such as the Hunter's Dance and the Eagle Dance were held throughout the day on the same plaza where the mass was celebrated. 
   The formal mass of the Mission San Jose and the Laguna Pueblo traditional dances emphasized the beauty in which these two cultures have overcome past difficulties and now flourish in grace and common respect. As Father Mark Joseph noted, we are reminded today to ``take care of your family as St. Joseph took care of his family.'' The Catholic Church and the Laguna Pueblo families have clearly taken this message to heart.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how we are going to use the rest of the time. I will use a little bit of time. If anyone wants to speak on either side of the issue, there is some time between now and 10:40 or so when we are going to vote on cloture. I yield myself such time as I may use. 
   I, too, urge that everybody vote for cloture. There is absolutely no reason for us not to proceed with the intelligence bill, which has been carefully thought out. It is not my bailiwick. I am not a chairman, cochairman, or a member, but I have attended meetings with them since the breaking news about the Chinese and their involvement in gathering up very secure and secret information from the United States through our laboratories. 
   That bill should not be held up, and the Senate has already agreed by unanimous consent that when it comes up--the amendment we are alluding to, the amendment that has been talked about now for a number of weeks, has been prepared in its final form for some time. It has been circulated to whomever needs it. It has been discussed in various committees, and it has been criticized, praised, and modified. 
   Before it came to the floor, it had the input from the now famous board that Senator Rudman headed with four other distinguished Americans with great expertise in the area. Their recommendations are in the amendment. We had people who know the Department and who know the Department of Defense help us draft it. It was conceived and being prepared even before the Rudman board made their final recommendations. 
   Personally this Senator had arrived at the conclusion that something drastic had to be done even before the report. Now we can have some time this afternoon and this evening for those who want to argue about the potency of this amendment or whether it has some shortcomings to offer amendments. 
   We will be meeting at about 11:30 in the leader's office with five or six Senators who have a particular interest or bipartisan interests and may have amendments. We will be meeting in the leader's office to see if we can't discuss them. 
   I hope Senators who have raised issues about it and who have indicated they have amendments will join us and be prepared to talk on our bill on which they have amendments, and to bring forth their ideas also. 
   Later in the day, if we continue to debate this issue, I will have more to say about why we need it, and I will discuss the specific provisions of this amendment in more detail. 
   Let me just quickly read three or four provisions that I think should dispel some of the concerns that have been raised. If they do not quite do the job, let's talk about it. 
   On page 2 of the amendment, for those who are wondering whether the Secretary of Energy, a Cabinet member, will still be in charge of this semiautonomous agency, when you call it ``semiautonomous,'' it means that somebody is in control of it 
   and, therefore, it is not autonomous. That is why semiautonomous is included as a description. 
   But the amendment says, first:  
   The Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the agency. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall report solely and directly to the Secretary, and shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary.  
   Skipping on a bit, to page 2 of the amendment:  
   The Secretary may direct other officials of the Department who are not within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship to review the agency's program and to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the administration of such programs, including the consistency with other similar programs and activities of the Department.  
   There are some who want to make sure the Secretary has sufficient input, that he will have sufficient opportunity to look at what they are doing and make determinations as to the propriety of consistency with the Secretary's policies. 
   I think what we just said makes the case. 
   This morning, one of those writers who has been covering the deliberations in the Washington Post talked about the chief of nuclear stewardship counterintelligence and how there might be some inconsistency within that particular person's effort and what the Secretary's policies are on counterintelligence. 
   I refer to page 4 of the amendment. I read the following at the bottom of the page:  
   The Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Counterintelligence shall report to the Under Secretary, and implement the counterintelligence policies directed by the Secretary and the Under Secretary. The Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Counterintelligence shall have direct access to the Secretary and all other officials of the Department and its contractors concerning counterintelligence matters, and shall be responsible for.......  
   Then it proceeds to delineate for what they will be responsible. 
   Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side, and how much remains as a whole?

   We have come a long way from not knowing exactly what we ought to do to a very strong cadre of Senators in a bipartisan nature who have decided that this amendment should be adopted, and perhaps a couple of changes and technical adjustments can be made. But this is not just the work of three sponsors. I am very pleased to have been one of the three who has gathered. 
   I note the Armed Services Committee's input is represented in this bill and has been present at almost all the meetings in the form of the chairman, JOHN WARNER. Senator WARNER has been an integral part, along with the Armed Services Committee staff which has knowledge in this particular area. 
   The Intelligence Committee has been excellent. While they have conducted their hearings--and they had a heavy workload to get ready for this bill--they have taken significant time to discuss this issue and to discuss this approach. 
   This amendment is cosponsored by the chairman and cochairman of the Intelligence Committee. I thank Senator SHELBY, the chairman, for his fine cooperation and that of his staff, and, obviously, the presence of Senator BOB KERREY on the floor indicates he is totally cognizant, fully aware of this, and supports what we are trying to do. 
   In addition, obviously there has been tireless work in terms of trying to get the facts in the name of the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska has spent a great deal of time with a very competent staff. It is small in number but efficient and knowledgeable. They have conducted some of the best hearings on this subject matter. I am very pleased he is taking an active role. The fact he is on this bill and articulately defending the approach within the amendment is very helpful and should be helpful to the Senate.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator THOMPSON and his staff have been very objective. Obviously, his committee has a lot of jurisdiction to conduct hearings with reference to restructuring of anything in Government. We are very pleased he chose to join us and he chose to lend us the excellence and expertise of his staff as we put this package together. 
   It is a very good approach. After 20 years of actually floundering around within a bureaucracy at the Department of Energy that was very top heavy, as reported by various commissions, I am very thrilled to be in this Chamber and able to say we are going to try to do better by the most serious research and the activities which are most apt to harm us in the future if others get them. It is the national security of America and perhaps peace in the world that hangs on whether this Department can do its job right, this autonomous agency with reference to nuclear activities, and whether we can find a better way to maintain freedom for those scientists, the greatest in the world, so they will come and do their work and at the same time do a far better job of securing the secrets that are within the minds and the products that our great scientists are producing at the nuclear laboratories. 
   In the meantime, there are some who want to punish the laboratories. I note with some interest the appropriations bill in the House from the subcommittee that is supposed to fund our nuclear activities. Obviously, it has been reduced so dramatically I am not at all sure they can function. I do not know if that is a function of not having enough money or a function of saying: Let's do something about the fact that we are worried about security. 
   That is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to adopt this amendment in both Houses, send it to the President, and get started with the task, for the first time in 22 years, of trying to set up an appropriate semiautonomous agency to do our nuclear work, to conduct the activities of our nuclear laboratories. 
   I have been asked by the leader, unless my colleagues have an objection,  to ask unanimous consent that all the time be considered used on both sides of the aisle and the cloture vote occur at 10:40 this morning. This means we will go into a quorum call, and anybody who wants to can call off the quorum and speak. Is that fair enough to the Senator from Idaho?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, frankly, this is a very important debate that starts today on a very important bill, H.R. 1555, and there is a very important amendment that we will allude to and talk about this afternoon with reference to reorganizing the Department of Energy in ways that have been suggested by many in order to minimize security risks in the future and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the department of the Department of Energy that works on the nuclear weapons installations, facilities, and research within that department. 
   I note the presence of Senator LEVIN on the floor, and I want to be as accommodating as he would like in terms of his using time. I am prepared to speak a lot today about history and the like, but whenever he is ready, I will be glad to yield to him. 
   I am going to start today's debate by inserting into the RECORD a June 30, 1999, column from the Wall Street Journal, written by Paul C. Light. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and the author of ``The True Size of Government,'' Brookings, 1999.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Light discusses in this column on the 30th day of June, 1999, and set it a bit in perspective. As Senators and those listening today might recall, starting about 3 months before this article written by Paul C. Light appeared in the Wall Street Journal, word broke through the media in the United States of the possibility that the People's Republic of China had, in fact, breached security at Los Alamos National Laboratory and, indeed, they may have some of the most significant and profound secrets with reference to our nuclear weaponry in their possession. That broke in the New York Times in a series of articles, and thereafter it was in the headlines and on the front pages of our papers for 3 or 4 weeks. Now it seems to have dwindled a bit because Congress and the executive branch are working on what we ought to do about it. 
   Frankly, one of the purposes for my being on the floor today and tomorrow and for as many days as it takes until we can take up the intelligence bill, H.R. 1555, which I have little to do with because I am not on that committee, is an amendment that would permit us to organize within the Department of Energy that aspect of the Department of Energy's work that has to do with nuclear weapons. 
   The reason that is important is because the American people should not be misled, nor should we let this issue go to sleep. The issue is a serious one. The issue of who develops and protects our nuclear weapons, and are they doing it in the best possible way, should be front and center with the American people because if, in fact, the security was breached to the extent that the Cox committee report had--that is a House Member's name; he was chairman of a joint committee in the House that prepared a report commonly known as the Cox report. If it is as bad as he and other House Members say in that report, and as bad as some others who have reported on it say, then clearly we are at risk that the Communist Chinese has sufficient information to develop, over time, a very significant arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
   Coupled with the fact that they are moving rapidly with respect to delivery systems, then clearly in the next millennium we will have a new adversary in the world. It will no longer necessarily be Russia as a successor to the weapons systems and delivery systems--the U.S.S.R.--but, essentially, we may have both Russia and China with substantial nuclear weapons. We may feel secure with our Air Force and our Navy and with our Army, as we have had these skirmishes in the past 3 to 5 years, but we will still be looking at a very dangerous world. 
   As a matter of fact, it may be the only single source of real power and military might that Russia might have for the first 50 or 100 years in the next millennium. And that is enough for a country that is not doing very well to be a bit dangerous. It is certainly enough for the world to be dangerous and America to be in danger and fearful if the Chinese Communist regime has a determined and dedicated and significant nuclear arsenal. 
   With that as a background, and with many hearings in both bodies--some joint, some singular by different committees--over the weeks since this was first broken, we have heard all kinds of evidence about how this happened--some of it in secret, some of it public. As a Senator from New Mexico, I have had to learn about nuclear weapons because two of the laboratories are in my State, and I happen to be chairman of the committee that funds all of the Department of Energy. I have said that there is so much that went wrong that there is plenty of blame for everyone. This is not exclusively a problem that occurred within that laboratory at Los Alamos. It is not exclusively a problem that something happened within the Department of Energy. It is not totally dispositive of this issue to stand on the floor of the Senate and say the FBI didn't do their job right--which they didn't. The problem is, it was a comedy of errors. Everybody seems to have messed up on this one. 
   Frankly, it seems that enough time has passed for us to be on the verge of fixing it, and so let's talk a minute about how we are going to fix it, and then I will read excerpts from the article that I asked be printed. First of all, there is no question that we received a formidable report from the PFIAB Commission, which is made up of five members. It is a presidentially appointed group. 
   The President did something different about this one than in the past in that he asked them to do the report and to plan to release it to the public.  They did. It was released to the public, and its principal spokesman and chairman was the very distinguished former Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Rudman. 
   We will talk at length about what they recommended. But suffice it to say they found that the management structure within the Department of Energy was in such a state of chaos that it could not control, in the form and manner that it existed over these past years, the security of valuable secrets and information within the laboratories; that it was incapable of doing it because it was disorganized, or organized in a manner where there was no accountability. So that if you wanted to blame the FBI for something that happened out of their Santa Fe, NM, office, they could clearly, if they chose, say: Yes, but somebody else fell down on the job. 
   If you asked the Director of the laboratories, he would say: Nobody ever told me about it. Nobody brought me on board. I thought since they were doing an investigation of an individual that they were in charge of the investigation, and I didn't have anything to do with it. 
   There are many examples, real and anecdotal, that say the Department of Energy is incapable of maintaining within its current framework of management such a significant system as the nuclear weapons system of the United States of America. 
   Frankly, it pains me to come to the floor and say that I have arrived at that conclusion unequivocally. And it pains me to say that I arrived at it some time ago. As a matter of fact, there will be a big argument made that we should move slowly. 
   I would like in due course, if not today, tomorrow, to outline why the time has come to fix it in the manner recommended by the Rudman commission, which is a Presidential commission. How much more time do we need? 
   I will tell the Senate that 2 to 3 weeks before the Rudman report was issued, this Senator from New Mexico was busy working with Senators developing the exact same model that the Rudman commission ultimately recommended to the Congress and the President of the United States for restructure, in a formidable way with significant changes, of the entire apparatus that functions within DOE and produces for us safe, sound, and reliable nuclear weapons and that has all of the ancillary functions which are related to that. 
   Having said that, it was not just yesterday that there were recommendations that the Department of Energy was straining under its own bureaucracy and that the nuclear weapons laboratories were victims of it. In fact, we will allude to at least two prior reports and recommendations to that of the Rudman commission by which clearly we are sending a loud and clear signal: Fix it. It is not working. It is the risky way you have it done. 
   I would add, it is not only risky as to security, but let me suggest there is a substantial lack of efficiency and the ability to manage the nuclear weapons system adequately and frugally to get the very best we should have. It is almost an impossibility within the structure of the Department of Energy, a hybrid department made up of many different agencies and groups thrown together in a haphazard way. And then we expect the nuclear weapons part of it to function under the overload of management, rules, and regulations that apply across the board to any kind of function within the Department, some so removed from nuclear weaponry that you wouldn't even think of them being in the same personnel department, in the same environmental department, or in the same safety and health departments. 
   With that, let me move to the Wall Street Journal article and paint a little history along with this writer, Mr. Light. 
   He starts by saying: 
   How can Washington prevent future security breaches like the one at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory? Last week former Sen. Warren Rudman, chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and a head of a special investigating panel, recommended a ``new semiautonomous agency'' within the Department of Energy that would have ``a clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy and drastically simplified lines of authority and accountability.'' 
   Mr. Rudman is right to focus on the structure of the department, not the failures of one or two key bureaucrats. For the Energy Department has never had more layers of management than it does now--and its leadership has never been more disconnected from what is happening at its bottom. 
   Secretary Bill Richardson, last week appointed a security ``czar,'' Gen. Eugene Habiger, to serve as the fulcrum for a newly rationalized chain of command. But the czar may merely add one more layer to a meandering, mostly unlinked collection of overseers who can easily evade responsibility when things go wrong.  
   I could not say it any better. 
   Continuing on:  
   At the department's founding in 1979, its secretary, deputy secretary, undersecretary and assistant secretary ``compartments'' contained 10 layers and 56 senior executives. By 1998 those four compartments had thickened to 18 layers and 143 senior executives, including an assortment of chiefs of staff and other alter-ego deputies who fill in whenever their bosses are out. 
   The problem in such overlayered, top-heavy organizations is not a lack of information on possible wrongdoing. Lots of people knew about the vulnerabilities at Los Alamos. The problem is finding someone who is ultimately responsible for taking action. Which department executive does Congress hold accountable for the security breach? The secretary? His chief of staff? One of the two deputy chiefs of staff? The deputy secretary? Undersecretary? Assistant secretary for defense programs? For environmental management? For science? How about the principal deputy assistant secretary for military applications? Deputy assistant secretary for research and development? Defense laboratories office director? Perhaps the assistant secretary for strategic computing and simulation? Or the inspector general, deputy inspector general, or assistant inspector general? 
   The answer is everyone and no one. And the diffusion of accountability continues down into the University of California, the contractor that supervises the Los Alamos laboratory and three other DOE facilities. Whom does the federal government hold accountable at the university? The president? The senior vice president for business and finance? Vice president for financial management?  
   And on it goes. I will jump down in the article to another full quote:  
   No wonder it takes a crisis to focus attention. With 15 to 25 layers just to get from the top of the department to the top of Los Alamos, information is bound to get lost along the way, and no one is accountable when it does.  
   I am going to skip a little bit of the article and move down to the end of it with another quote. I will insert it with the underline parts being that which I read.  
   Spies will be spies, and the Los Alamos espionage probably would have occurred regardless of the width or height of the government hierarchy. But the breach would have been noticed earlier and closed sooner had the top been closer to the bottom. If Congress wants to increase the odds that nuclear secrets will be kept in the future, it could do no better than to order a wholesale flattening of the Energy Department hierarchy. Then it should do the same with the rest of the federal government.  
   The reason I read excerpts from the article is that it is quite obvious to me this man has his finger right on the problem. 
   Let me now proceed to a discussion of the latest thorough investigation of the Department of Energy and its mission as the primary functionary in nuclear weapons from research to security to safekeeping, et cetera. Let me move to the latest thorough report, and then we will go back to some others that existed prior thereto. 
   I don't know that I want to make this report a part of the RECORD, but everybody should know if they want to read what has been said by the latest contingent of reputable, dedicated, knowledgeable Americans, I am reading from ``Science at its Best, Security at its Worst,'' a report on security problems of the U.S. Department of Energy by a special investigative panel, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, of June 1999. 
   There are plenty of these reports around for anybody who wants to participate in this discussion. We will make them available. We will see that some are in the Cloakroom for people who might want to review them. I will talk a little bit about the significance of this report and why I think the time has come to adopt its principal recommendations. 
   For those who wonder what we are trying to do, obviously, we had to draw from a lot of people to do what was recommended in this report. While Members may not find every word of the extensive amendment I will soon allude to in detail within this report, let me repeat, for anybody interested in the security of the weapons laboratories and the nuclear weapons activity of  our Nation, the amendment we are trying to call up as part of H.R. 1555 is the recommendations from this report. 
   Let's get in the RECORD what this report is. This report is the result of a March 18, 1999, President Clinton request that the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, commonly known as PFIAB, undertake an inquiry and issue a report on ``The security threat at the Department of Energy's weapons lab and the adequacy of measures that have been taken to address it.'' 
   I will read the names of the board members and make sure the Senate and everybody knows who they are: The Honorable Warren B. Rudman, chairman; appointed members are Ms. Ann Z. Caracristi, Dr. Sydney Drell, Mr. Stephen Friedman, to form the special investigative panel. They are the members. They were given detailees from several Federal agencies, including CIA, FBI, DOD, to augment the work of the staff. They spent 3 months interviewing 100 witnesses, received more than 700 documents encompassing thousands of pages, and conducted on-site research and interviews at five of the Department's National Laboratories and plants: Sandia National Lab, Pantex in Texas, Oak Ridge in Tennessee, Livermore in California, and Los Alamos in New Mexico. 
   This report and an appendix that supports it, both of which are unclassified, are now before the Senate. A large volume of classified material which was also reviewed and distilled for this report has been relegated to a second appendix and is authorized for special kinds of authorized recipients. 
   This report examines the 20-year history--which I just alluded to in reading the excellent article by Mr. Light--of security and counterintelligence issues at the laboratories, with an issue on five laboratories that focus on weapons and related weapons research. It looked at the inherent tensions between security concerns and scientific freedom at the laboratories. In effect, they looked at the institutional culture and efficacy of the Department. They looked at the growth and evolution of foreign intelligence and the threat thereafter to the National Laboratories, particularly in connection with foreign visitors programs, the implementation of effective Presidential Decision Directive No. 61, the reforms instituted by the Secretary, and other related initiatives. 
   At some point in time within the last 5 or 6 months when it started to evolve that, in fact, there could have been a very serious, significant, prolonged, and persistent breach at Los Alamos, the President of the United States--and others might argue that the timeliness of the President's actions is an issue. I am not sure that I will argue that point. My point in what I will discuss today and tomorrow, and for however long it takes to get this bill up and get this amendment considered, is going to be discussing how we fix what is wrong with this Department of Energy as it relates to nuclear weapons and how we do it now--not 6 months from now, not a year from now, but now. 
   Eventually, the President issued a Presidential decision directive which is called No. 61. Now, that suggested in no uncertain terms that some things be changed in the Department, and changed forthwith. However, those were things the Department could do without any legislation. They preceded the thorough recommendations that were made by the Rudman commission. Then it included additional measures to improve security and counterintelligence.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of the cochairman of the committee that actually has jurisdiction and is in control of the bill, H.R. 1555, Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska. 
   I say to the Senator what I said to one of his staff members who was on the floor. Whenever the Senator is ready, I will relinquish the floor and yield. I am prepared to speak today and tomorrow and however long is necessary until we all get together and get the bill up and get the amendment to it called up. I am not here today to keep others from speaking. My responsibility with reference to the amendment which we propose is to start talking about the significance of it and of the Rudman report to the future security prospects for our nuclear resource development by the Department of Energy. 
   I started on that report of your good friend and mine, Senator Rudman. This is not a bad breaking point for me if the Senator desires to speak.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what I want to do, in the presence of my friend, is recap. I heretofore, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, made the point of why we need some dramatic, drastic, and significant reform of the Department of Energy as it applies to nuclear weaponry in all its context. I have indicated there are a number of reports that point in the direction of doing something very different, not just some new boxes in the Department. 
   I said I would start with a review of the Rudman report as to what they recommend, because the amendment I will  be proposing and of which Senator KERREY is a cosponsor is our best effort to incorporate into the bill language the Rudman recommendations. We are not inventing something new, although some of us were on that trail before the Rudman report. It is essentially an effort to convert these recommendations, of which my colleagues are fully aware, to a bill, and that legislation will be presented when we are on the bill. We do not know when that time will come. We are now on a motion to proceed to that bill. 
   Let me now, in my own way, talk a bit about the Rudman report. The Senate is now fully aware of who the commissioners are, what their origins are, and the fact that this is the first such report that has been made public. In the past, Presidents have used them, but they have not made them public. The President asked from the outset that this report be made public. That was prudent because we were in such a state of confusion and chaos regarding how much of our future security was actually stolen. This was a good way to say some people are recommending ways to fix it. It is public. 
   Let me state to the Senate, and those interested, some of 
   the significant findings of this report. Remember, the reason the report is significant is not because it is the only report of its type, but it is the last one recommending drastic change. These findings I am going to be talking about are in support of the bill we want to introduce, because they are in support of the Rudman commission's recommendations. 
   Findings found at pages 1 through 6--I am going to pick out the ones I think most adequately present the issue and the reasons for doing something. 
   No. 1, from my standpoint:  
   More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal inquiries--by executive branch agencies, Congress, independent panels and even the DOE itself--have identified a multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence problems at all the weapons labs.  
   I give this fact at the outset because I am very concerned there still will be some in the public, at the laboratories and in the Senate, who will say we need more time. Remember, the finding I just stated was that for 25 years there have been reports, studies, and inquiries that addressed the issues in this amendment we want to call up on the bill. 
   No. 2:  
   Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and at the labs themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.  
   Those are not my words. I might have phrased it differently. Essentially, in the amendment we want to call up, we are also trying to change the organizational disarray. We are trying to change it so that managerial neglect will be harder to be vested in this part of the DOE. We are addressing the culture, but we are not destroying the actual necessary component within these laboratories of freedom for scientists. But freedom is not absolute for scientists who work on nuclear weapons. We want to give them as much freedom as is consistent with minimizing security risks, and that means there has to be pushed through management a change in the culture without changing the scientific excellence.  
   ......DOE headquarters and at the labs themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.  
   The way it is phrased one would think they were doing something intentional in that regard. I would not have used ``conspired.'' It happened that way because of the way it is managed and the way the culture has developed. 
   Let me move down to another couple I think are very important:  
   DOE has a dysfunctional management structure and culture that only occasionally gave proper credence to the need for rigorous security and counterintelligence programs at the weapons laboratories. For starters, there has been a persistent lack of real leadership and effective management of the DOE.  
   They also factually concluded that the Department--and this is very important--is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. Why do I pull that one out? Because we are hearing that we do not need to do everything this report recommends because the Secretary is going to do it. As a matter of fact, the Secretary is a friend of mine. He is from my State. He served in the House and I in the Senate, and I have great respect for what he did. He has done 
   more in the Department in the past few months than anybody we have had around in terms of seeing that it is really risky and things are dangerous there; we have to get on with fixing them. 
   The point is, the Rudman commission said the Department's bureaucracy is so dysfunctional that it cannot reform itself. For those who will come to the Chamber either in opposition to the amendment or indicating we should go slowly because the Secretary is doing some things, I will keep reading them this statement. 
   This is not our statement. This is the statement of five of the best people around appointed by the President of the United States to tell us how to fix this. In fact, I will tell you one of them, Dr. Drell, would be picked by anyone on any five-member commission that was going to survey and recommend how we should handle nuclear weapons within our bureaucracy better. 
   He is on this, and he agrees. They are saying the Secretary cannot fix it because the bureaucracy is so rambunctious, so overlapping, so inconsistent that it cannot fix itself. 
   Last:  
   Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems with security and counterintelligence in the ..... laboratories, but also to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire Department.  
   I am going to move to a couple more facts. We all know--no, we do not all know; some of us know because we have been around here long enough--that we can look at who have been the Secretaries of Energy over time, and the Rudman report has something to say about that. 
   This is a complicated Department, but if you know anything about it, it runs all the nuclear weapons activities in the country. For starters, one would think: Boy, we ought to put somebody in who knows a little bit about that. 
   The report says:  
   The criteria for the selection of Energy Secretaries have been inconsistent in the past. Regardless of the outcome of ongoing or contemplated reforms, the minimum qualifications for Energy Secretary should include experience in not only energy and scientific issues, but national security and intelligence issues....... 
   I am not going to list the Secretaries in the last 30 years since the DOE was formed, and prior to it ERDA, but I am going to merely say there have not been very many Presidents who gave serious consideration to who should be the Secretary in the same context that the five-member commission looked at what should be the qualifications. 
   There will still be some who will say: Well, look, we have a Secretary who is trying. This has just come upon us. Let's go a little slower. 
   The Rudman commission made another finding, and it is the following:  
   However, the Board is extremely skeptical that any reform effort, no matter how well-intentioned, well-designed, and effectively applied, will gain more than a toehold at DOE, given its labyrinthine management structure, fractious and arrogant culture, and the fast-approaching reality of another transition in DOE leadership. Thus we believe that he has overstated the case when he asserts, as he did several weeks ago, that ``Americans can be reassured; our nation's nuclear secrets are, today, safe and secure.''  
   That is an allusion to a statement by our Secretary of Energy. I take it Secretaries have tried to tell us they are doing everything they can within the structure they have and that we are moving in the direction of making things safe. 
   This board--I frequently call it a commission--the Rudman board, has taken a look at that statement versus what they think you can do in that Department, and they have concluded that things are still kind of at risk. 
   I note today, in the presence of the press the new securities czar, the distinguished four-star general who was appointed, is saying: We're working on it, but it is at least a year away in terms of having something in place. I note that is in the news today. 
   What did this distinguished board--sometimes referred to in my remarks as commission--actually recommend by way of reorganizations? I want everyone to know I am going to repeat that there are other reports, prior to this, that recommended dramatic changes within the Department, and I  have not yet alluded to them. I am only talking about the Rudman recommendations. 
   They suggest that:  
   The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations imposed by [the department].  
   In order to do that, they say it can be done in one of two ways.  
   It could remain an element of DOE but become semi-autonomous--by that we mean strictly segregated from the rest of the Department. This would be accomplished by having an agency director report only to the Secretary of Energy. The agency directorship also could be ``dual-hatted'' as an Under Secretary, thereby investing [him] with extra bureaucratic clout both inside and outside the department.  
   They go on to say:  
   Regardless of the mold in which this agency is cast, it must have staffing and support functions that are autonomous from the remaining operations at DOE.  
   Essentially, when you read the recommendations, the most significant words are their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all other obligations imposed by DOE management. 
   You get that one of two ways. You get it semiautonomously--which I have just read--or you can take it out of the Department of Energy in toto, stand it free, i.e., NASA. They have suggested those are the two ways. 
   Those of us who have been involved for years think that we ought to start by trying to convince the Senate and House that we should make it semiautonomous, leaving it within the DOE, for a number of reasons, and only if all fails should we go the other route. 
   This Senator is very concerned about the laboratories that make us so strong and contribute so much to our science effectiveness in the world, that they remain the very best. I would not, for a minute, be talking about restructuring if I did not think those laboratories could continue to do work for others, work for other agencies, and work for the Department of Defense and nuclear weapons. I believe they can and they will. I believe they will, under the amendment about which we are talking. 
   So while there is much more to talk about, in summary, H.R. 1555, which is the annual intelligence authorization bill, the sooner we can get it up on the Senate floor, the sooner we can bring up this amendment, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski, et al. amendment, which has every chairman of every committee who is involved in this as cosponsors, along with a number of other Senators, and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, who is here on the floor with us, Senator KERREY, and Senator FEINSTEIN of California. As soon as we can start debating it--obviously, we are willing to listen; we do not claim that every ``t'' is crossed right and every ``I'' is in the proper place, but we believe the format to accomplish what the Rudman five-member board recommended is within the four corners of that amendment, and that is what we ought to be looking at now in the next few days to get it done. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know how much longer the Senator wants to speak, but I can only be here  about 15 or 20 minutes and I still have a few comments. I want to listen attentively to what he is saying. 
   I believe I heard the Senator mention four or five things. I ticked them off as he mentioned them, and we find there may be two that are not in the bill which were thought to be management techniques. Three out of five or three out of six are in the bill. I am willing to work on anything my colleagues want to work on, except I want to make sure of what I consider to be the most important recommendation of all, when the Rudman report says:  
   To achieve the kind of protection that all these laboratories have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations of DOE management.  
   If we start with that, then I think we can work on that in terms of how you get there and make sure it means what you want it to mean. Frankly, I am very pleased this afternoon because I heard both the Senator from Michigan and the cochairman of the Committee on Intelligence say they want to get on with the bill and they want to try to work on the amendment to get it as bipartisan as we can. 
   Frankly, if that is the way we are moving, I am ready to say, let's work on it. I have given my colleagues my draft. It is the final draft. As soon as my colleagues have amendments, we want to look at them. I have three or four Senators to check with, and I am sure my colleagues have, too, but I do think you clearly understand, in the way the Senator has expressed it, that it will have its autonomous functions within that agency. 
   The Senator has a great concern, and if I was not positive that we had satisfied it, I would not be here. 
   On the second page, paragraph (C), we say:  
   The Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the agency. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall report solely and directly to the Secretary and shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary.  
   That was put in because everybody said we ought to do that. It was a little earlier than some of you think. My colleagues missed it for a while. It is there. 
   At the end of the page we also say:  
   That the Secretary may direct other officials of the Department who are not within the agency for nuclear stewardship to review the agency's programs and to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the administration of these programs, including consistency with similar programs and activities of the Department.  
   The Senator from Michigan has expressed a concern about 
   that one. This may not be exactly the wording he would like, but I believe it moves in the direction of one of his previous concerns.

   Mr. DOMENICI. That is a fair statement that the Senator made about what I would like to see. I also stated on Friday past, the first time I ever said this as a Senator who has been involved with these nuclear activities since I arrived--and I have been chairman of the subcommittee that appropriates it for almost 6 years--if the semiautonomous agency is weakened, to the extent it is really just another of blocks on a chart, I will wholeheartedly support taking it all out of the Energy Department and making it a freestanding department. 
   In fact, I am almost looking at this that if it were a freestanding agency like NASA, and moved within the Department, how would the Secretary control it? I am beginning to think of it that way. He still would have to control it so long as it is in his Department. But I think we have said that in the amendment. 
   We are willing to work with you on whether there are better ways to make sure he still is the boss; that is what you are talking about, that he is in control. The Under Secretary in charge of this new semiautonomous agency is not totally independent or we would not call him ``semiautonomous.''

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you for recognizing me. 
   I say to Senator LEVIN, I have read that part of the Rudman report which talks about the Secretary having adequate input and having staff to make input. Let me tell you what I would be very worried about; and I remain worried about it as we talk with the members of the staff of the Secretary. 
   I think the worst thing we could do is to create this semiautonomous agency on paper but make it still like it is subject in every detail to the Secretary of Energy and his staff. So I am not going to sit by and tell you I agree because I do not agree that we should say on the one hand an Under Secretary is going to run it, and it is created with autonomous authority for him, and then say  the Secretary's office can, with various staffers, run it day by day. Because then all we have done is created autonomy and then taken it away. 
   There are two ways to take it away. One is very direct. For example, just take out the environment and say they do not have control of the environment. That is one way. The other is to put it all back into the Secretary in detail so his staff can be running it. 
   I think you and I would be serving our country terribly if we created it, in a poor manner, semiautonomous and then found in 5 years, when it was set up, that three strong men in the Secretary's office were running it. I think that would be the worst ending we could have because we would be back to seeing how good they were at things; and without that, it would be an unsuccessful operation. There would be more masters rather than just the one we are looking for. 
   Having said that, I want to speak for a moment--because I forgot to during my opening remarks--about the kind of science that exists at these laboratories, especially our three deterrent laboratories and two that help them that are partially in this mode, and a little bit about the origin of all this work. 
   I want to start by ticking off a few names. This is by far not the entire list. 
   This whole scientific entourage that we have here which we call the nuclear weapons laboratories, the great crown treasures of our science-based research, was started in an era when America did not have enough scientists of its own who were nationalists, American born and raised, educated in America. 
   So guess what the list of the early Manhattan Project scientists who helped us get a bomb sounded like. They sounded like Italians. Enrico Fermi; he was an Italian. He was at one of the other laboratories in the country. Both he and his wife were taken to Los Alamos and they became some of the principal players. It sounded like Hans Bethe; it sounded liked Edward Teller, Carl Fuchs--and the list goes on. 
   Frankly, we were taking a real gamble because they knew what they were doing, each and every one of them. Collectively, they knew they were preparing an atomic bomb for the United States of America to either win the Second World War or to use it to stop it. They were working at a ferocious pace to get it done before the Germans got it done. We all remember that as we read about it. 
   Those scientists had contacts all over the world, whatever kind of world it was at that point in time. The same thing is happening today. We should not be surprised that we have marvelous Chinese scientists at our laboratories. They are American born, American educated, and I assume some are naturalized citizens, and they are among our best. 
   It just so happens that the Chinese seem to have breached our security in some intricate ways, not the way the Russians did it. They did not come along with a big bribe and pay somebody off. They did it in an intricate way by little bits 
   and pieces. Since the Chinese scientists who make their nuclear program work are intimate about Americans in science, would you believe that it is our understanding that the chief scientist in charge of their nuclear weapons development has a Ph.D. from one of our universities? You do not think he knows American scientists of his era? He was apparently a very good nuclear physicist or scientist--Ph.D.--from one of our universities. We understand in the hierarchy there may be six or seven who were educated as MIT or Caltech or someplace, and they are running their program. 
   The point of it is, we cannot, in some fit or frenzy, put a wall up around these laboratories and say these scientists cannot exchange views around the world; they cannot travel to conferences. 
   Let me ask you, do you think they would stay at the laboratories, if they are among the greatest minds around, if you told them they can be only half a scientist, that they cannot go to a conference where Chinese scientists are coming who may exchange views on something extraordinarily new in the field of physics which has nothing necessarily to do with nuclear bombs? The truth of the matter is, if you try it, do you know who the losers will be? The losers will be the American people, because we won't have the greatest scientists in those laboratories. What has made us the most secure nuclear power in the world? Our scientists. We talk about everything else, but it is the scientists over the last 40 years, successors to this list I gave --incidentally, I did not mean to imply that there weren't many early scientists who were American; obviously there were. Some of the leaders were Americans, no question about it. We should not leave the impression that we don't want scientists, whatever their national origin is or whatever their basic culture is, working in our laboratories and we want to muzzle them; for if we put a wall around the laboratories, it will be a matter of a decade and nobody will want in the laboratories, much less out of the laboratories. Instead of worrying about getting secrets out, we will have to worry about getting enough good things to happen where there are some secrets. 
   I want to make that point so everyone will know that my approach and the approach I am working on with other Senators to create this semiautonomous agency is not directed at closing these laboratories, closing the lips and the brains of scientists and putting them behind a bar up there. 
   When I was a young boy, believe it or not, we had a family that could all fit in one big car. On a number of occasions we drove from Albuquerque to Los Alamos because we were inquisitive. We had heard that if you went up there, they wouldn't let you in. So we would drive up, and they wouldn't let us in. We would drive up to these big gates, and that was the Los Alamos scientific laboratory. No trespassing. So I was there. That was the early version of this. Now they have grown into much larger institutions, much more sophisticated kinds of 
   science. 
   In addition, because my friend Senator LEVIN has been talking about things that concern him, I will mention two or three things that I want everyone to know. 
   First, what is a semiautonomous agency and what is an independent agency? The best I can tell Senators is, a model of independence would probably be NASA. I don't know the best model for a semiautonomous agency within a department, but I will tell my colleagues that what it means is described very clearly in the Rudman report, that the functions of this agency must be autonomous and not subject to the everyday rule of the larger department. 
   If we are not prepared to do that, then let's not kid ourselves and say we have done it halfway. It must be done in a way that is consistent with the agency director reporting only to the Secretary of Energy and in a manner that would assure that its functions are autonomous, even if it means we must have a duplication of functions. Because if there is one set of functions, we are back where we are. If it is not subject to the Secretary's power, then it is not semiautonomous; it is autonomous. 
   I think we are on the same side, trying to make it semiautonomous, which means the Secretary is still all powerful. Having said that, let me say that as we proceed, I am willing to look at the document line by line as it gets introduced--it has been circulated--and cite where I believe we have covered most of the aspects that are of concern and that have been expressed as of concern on the floor, save two. 
   One of them has to do with the laboratories being able to take work for other agencies, for the Defense Department and from the Energy Department, and thus remain laboratories that are diversified, that are, thus, very attractive to scientists. I will insert in the RECORD, and not read much from it, testimony given in the Committee on Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power and the Committee on Science Subcommittee on Energy in the House, by William Happer. 
   Dr. Happer is one of the distinguished scientists in the United States and used to be in the department. He concludes in the statement, in reference to the new agency:  
   I do not think that the ANS need hinder the support by other parts of DOE, or by outside agencies, of science at the Weapons Laboratories. As a former director of the Office of Energy Research, I saw, at very close quarters, how work was funded by my office at the Weapons Laboratories, and how other Federal agencies--for example, the National  Institutes of Health, or DARPA--arrange to have work done. The creation of an ANS within DOE might actually help the interactions between the Science Laboratories and the Weapons Laboratories if it leads to better management [at the semiautonomous agency].

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. The report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget of 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through July 14, 1999. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Res. 209, a resolution to provide budget levels in the Senate for purposes of fiscal year 1999, as amended by S. Res. 312. The budget levels have also been revised to include adjustments made on May 19, 1999, to reflect the amounts provided and designated as emergency requirements. The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $0.4 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution $0.2 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.2 billion above the revenue floor in 1999. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $56.1 billion, $0.1 billion above the maximum deficit amount of 1999 of $56.0 billion. 
   Since my last report, dated June 21, 1999, the Congress has taken no action that changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very simple proposition. The American people, by overwhelming odds, would like us to take every single penny of the Social Security that belongs to the Social Security trust fund and lock it up so it can't be spent. The issue is not only a Republican issue; the President of the United States has said we should lock it up. He didn't say lock up something for Medicare; he said lock up the trust funds for Social Security, period. 
   Senator DASCHLE, leader of the minority, said very recently that there ought to be some common ground. We ought to lock up the Social Security trust fund. What are we doing on the floor? We have six times tried to get an amendment up--not a bill, not a final action but an amendment, after which you can have amendments to your heart's desire. 
   We can't get the other side to agree that we will do that. We will have limited debate on that amendment, after which they can have all the debate and all the amendments they wish. It is only the amendment that we would like to get voted on. Why? Because it is time that, rather than talking about making sure we don't spend under the pressure of emergencies and all kinds of other things, we don't spend the Social Security trust fund money. 
   Now, the President of the United States came our way already. He said lock up 100 percent. At one time in his 
   budget, he said lock up 62 percent. He came with us and said lock up every single penny. 
   That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get a vote on doing that, after which time, if the Democrats see fit, they can muddy the water and bring up amendments on other issues, and if we had time today, we could debate the foolhardy issue that even Democrats think makes no sense--that we should take the surplus that belongs to the people of the United States and put it into the Medicare trust fund with IOUs to be paid for by increased taxes on our children later on. We can debate that if you would like. But that is not the issue. 
   The issue is Social Security money, the senior citizens' pension money. Time is wasting. The pressures to use it are growing. The opportunities to come to the floor and say let's spend it, with the passage of each day, are getting closer and closer. Somebody will say we need this for something. Who knows what. It could be agricultural policy for America or any kind of thing you can dream up. 
   I say to my friends on the other side, let's get on with it and let's close the debate on the amendment. Then we can open the debate after that vote occurs on anything you wish. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to clarify this from the standpoint of what a Democrat on the other side who is well versed in this had to say about this issue. On March 22, 1999, Senator BREAUX, on a CBS newscast, avoided criticism of Clinton. Senator BREAUX said: Some people want an issue of Medicare rather than solving the problem. They talk about wedge issues. 
   Senator BREAUX added that one of the problems is that some people want an issue out of Medicare rather than solving the problem. They talk about wedge issues. 
   Are you going to have a tax cut or are you going to save Medicare? 
   That is old politics, he said. I think the American people are tired of it. They want us to solve the problem, not give them political slogans. 
   Now, to stand on the floor of the Senate and even imply that the proposed tax cuts in the budget resolution of $782 billion over a decade would in any way infringe upon the Social Security trust funds is to confuse the public of America, and it is exactly what the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is saying--sloganizing, making an issue by slogans. 
   Secondly, if there is any implication that there are not sufficient reserves in our budget to take care of Medicare, that is an absolute error and an untruth. There are huge amounts of money left over after the tax cut. In fact, it approaches $450 billion that is not allocated to anything during the next decade other than what we choose to use it for in the Congress. 
   I remind everyone, the President said we can fix Medicare with how much? Forty-eight billion dollars will give us prescription drugs, he said. We had $90 billion left over in our budget resolution that was unspent, and now, with the new estimates, there is more money there. We can fix Medicare, put this money in a lockbox, have the tax cut, do that by the end of this year, and fix things for American seniors on both fronts: Lock up the money that is theirs and fix Medicare. 
   To talk about this trust fund as if it has something to do with fixing Medicare is an absolutely erroneous stating of the situation in the Senate and in the fiscal policy of America.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will take a little time to speak about the surplus that we have over and above Social Security, which we call the non-Social Security surplus. That is the amount by which the taxpayers of this country have paid more into the U.S. Treasury than we need to run Government. 
   I choose now to speak to a proposal that I made with the introduction of a tax bill yesterday. I introduced it and had it printed and reported to the appropriate committee because I thought that even though I am not on the Finance Committee, that some of my ideas and thoughts might be relevant. I wanted the Senate to have the benefit of what I thought should be a good way to fix the Tax Code while we are reducing taxes. 
   Let me address this matter in a text that I have prepared and worked very hard on, including the bill that was introduced. I thank my staff for the diligent work and the Joint Committee on Taxation for their willingness to help us with evaluations of how much these various proposals will cost. 
   T.S. Eliot wrote, ``April is the Cruelest Month.'' Millions of Americans agree, especially around April 15. The Congress is going to pass a tax bill to make April a little kinder. I say it is time to share the surplus. Since without tax relief it takes the average worker until May 11 to earn enough money to pay his or her taxes, our tax bill also lets people start working for their families' benefit earlier in the year. 
   American families are currently saddled with an unprecedented tax burden. Total Federal tax collections are at a post-World War II high of 20.7 percent of the gross domestic product. Individual income tax collections alone are 10 percent of the gross domestic product and are projected to stay there. 
   We have never experienced a government based on that level of income taxation, speaking of the income tax component of our total American government tax table. 
   The 1990s are truly a decade when government taxed the total population of America at a very excessive rate. The President will have a choice to spend on government programs or resist the urge to splurge and instead return the overpayment to its rightful owners in the form of a tax cut or tax relief. It is estimated the average American household will pay nearly $7,000 more in taxes than the government needs to operate the non-Social Security portion of the government over the next decade. The tax-writing committees of Congress are working right now to fashion a 10-year tax cut, phasing it in, that will total around $778 billion over the next 10 years. In the Senate it seems that they are working on that exact number because that is what the budget resolution we adopted said they should do. The House seems to be moving in a direction of a little larger tax cut over the decade, but we are talking now about $770 billion to $800 billion plus. 
   The ideas that are encapsulated in the bill I introduced take into account that the economy is booming. Personal income tax, as measured against adjusted gross income, is up 8.25 percent  from 1997 over 1996. That is a current year IRS statistic. That is, personal income, as measured as adjusted gross income, is up 8.25 percent. Income tax revenues are up 10.2 percent. This is good news and bad news, and these statistics encapsulate both. 
   The good news is our salaries, capital gains, and interest income are growing. The bad news is that bracket creep is pushing more and more Americans into higher tax brackets, even though we do not have as many brackets as we had years ago when bracket creep was a major American problem because of high inflation. 
   It is still pushing them into higher brackets, and at the same time, the code is working to make more and more American taxpayers pay what is commonly called now AMT taxes; that is, alternative minimum taxes, which really were never intended to cover the vast number of Americans that are currently being pushed into the alternative minimum tax portions of our code because they are being pushed into higher brackets. 
   I share with the Senate the key components of the bill I introduced, and I want to recognize that this bill builds upon legislation introduced by Senators COVERDELL, TORRICELLI, and MACK. 
   The philosophy behind the various provisions is something important, as I view it. I have been a long-time advocate of fundamental tax reform. I believe it would be better for our economy and simpler and fairer if we could shift our tax base from income that is earned and instead tax income that is consumed. There are very few who disagree that that would be a very good approach to a philosophy of taxation in our country. I have often said our current code is hostile to savings and investing and that we, as a Nation, pay the price in the form of lower economic growth. 
   The philosophical underpinnings of this package corrects some deficiencies. Let me go through it. 
   First section. Broad-based tax relief for all taxpaying families. Purpose: To cut taxes for 120 million American taxpayers by lowering and widening the 15-percent Federal income tax bracket. 
   Second, marriage penalty mitigation and burden reduction. The purpose is to return 7 million taxpaying families to the 15-percent bracket and to cut taxes for another 35 million taxpaying families who will benefit from a tax cut of up to $1,300 per family. It eliminates or mitigates the marriage penalty for many middle-class taxpaying families. That happens by merely adjusting the brackets downward and upward in the 15-percent area. I repeat, you do not change the marriage penalty for middle-class taxpaying families, but by making the 15-percent bracket broader, adding $10,000 to the adjusted gross income people can earn and still be in that bracket, and lowering the bottom bracket 1.5 percent, much of the marriage penalty is mitigated for people in those brackets. 
   Third, dividend and interest tax relief. Adjusting the tax base to recognize that dividends and interest should not be taxed. Now, obviously, there is not room in a tax package to totally eliminate dividends and interest. But the purpose of our bill is to provide an incremental step toward taxing income that is consumed rather than income that is earned and saved. It simplifies the code by eliminating 67 million hours of spent time in tax preparation. It eliminates Federal income taxes on savings for more than 30 million Americans in the middle-class families and reduces Federal income taxes on savings for an additional 37 million Americans. It essentially allows about a $10,000 nest egg to grow, tax free, and will let Americans enjoy the miracle of compound interest. 
   Specifically, it excludes the first $500 in interest and dividend taxation. That permits you to grow this nest egg and not have to pay taxes on the interest and dividends for the first $500 in that kind of income. It sounds small, but it affects a huge number of Americans and starts us in the direction of saying we ought to save, and we ought to start taxing not earned income, but consumed income. 
   The next provision is a capital gains cut by recognizing that investment and investing should be encouraged, not penalized. A Tax Code for the new century should exclude modest capital gains from taxation. The purpose of the provision is to provide an incremental step toward shifting our Internal Revenue Code away from taxing savings and investment. A savings-friendly Tax Code would lower the cost of capital so that prosperity, better paying jobs, and innovation can continue in the United States. 
   The bill would eliminate capital gains for 10 million American families, 75 percent of whose income is $75,000 or less. This provision is also a 70 million man-hour timesaver. I can think of many activities to spend 70 million hours on rather than filling out tax forms. The specific of this provision is that it exempts the first $5,000 in long-term capital gains from taxation. It eliminates it totally from taxation. 
   Another important section deals with retirement savings incentives. The purpose of this is to say that the savings rate for all Americans will increase by reforming the system to favorably treat income that is invested for retirement. It 
   provides targeted incentives to middle-class families to increase their retirement savings in a traditional IRA by $1,000 per working member of the family per year. Specifically, it raises the contribution limit for traditional deductible IRAs from $2,000 to $3,000 and indexes the limit for inflation, when we can fit that into the dollars in the code. 
   The bill includes a death tax phaseout. It recognizes that death should not be a taxable event in the 21st century. We do not have sufficient resources to do away with it in toto. Some will be proposing it. I think they will find that it is rather expensive, even with $782 billion to spend. So the purpose of ours is to begin phasing it out. Specifically, it reduces tax from the top rate of 55 percent to 40 percent. 
   Then we have innovation and competitiveness. We all know those are characteristics that, at this point in our economic history, are rampant in our American economy. Innovation and competitiveness are the things that turned the American economy around and made Japan ask: What is America doing right? It made France and Germany ask: What are they doing right? Fifteen years ago, everybody was asking the reverse. Some were wondering if we should do things like they did things. I am grateful we did not, for most of the difference was planning by Government. They continued to do it and we came out of it with innovation and competitiveness. 
   Now we ought to make sure we do what we can with this available surplus to make the research and investment credit turn out to be a permanent part of the Tax Code. This change recognizes that the single biggest factor in creating better jobs through productivity growth is innovation. Productivity growth is derived from research and development conducted in the private sector. Between 60 to 80 percent of the productivity growth since the Great Depression can be traced to innovation. 
   Specifics of the proposal. The provisions here are the same as those contained in Senate bill 951, which I introduced. It makes this tax credit permanent, but also expands it to cover businesses that were not heretofore covered, including many small businesses that are filled with innovation but can't avail themselves of the research and development tax credit. 
   Last, but not least, the bill includes a section on energy independence. All I will say is that America is, once again, looking at itself in the world and finding that we grow more and more dependent on oil from abroad. In fact, it has gotten so high that there is no question that America is now dependent for its very survival upon importing oil from foreign countries. We have probably reached the point where we cannot avoid that. We will always be dependent. But the question is, Should we let an American oil and gas industry--principally made up of independent producers and risk takers--wither and die on the vine? Or should we change the Tax Code so more capital will be made available by the way we change the Tax Code for that kind of industry, the oil patch of America, for those who supply the services, take the risks, and those who pump the oil and gas. 
   We have made some changes and many Senators are interested in some of these issues, such as oil and gas capitalization, through changing the Tax Code. I won't read them one by one. To be specific, with reference to my own  State, this overall proposal cuts taxes for 574,000 New Mexican families who have to file an income tax return. 
   First, the bill cuts taxes by 10 percent by lowering the 15-percent bracket to 13.5 with a 5-year phase-in. This lowers taxes for families with adjusted gross incomes up to $44,000 for joint filers and $28,000 for single filers. The tax change puts 424,000 New Mexicans who weren't up to that amount in a new lower bracket and cuts their taxes by 10 percent. This bill also raises the threshold on the 15-percent bracket--something that was included in the proposals made by the distinguished Senator from Georgia and Senator TORRICELLI from New Jersey. It raises that threshold by $10,000 so that middle-income Americans can earn up to $55,000 in a joint return and only pay 15 percent, instead of being dumped into the higher bracket once they are at $44,000. 
   This is going to cut taxes for families with adjusted gross incomes between $44,000 and $55,000. You know the rest. 
   According to our own revenue and taxation department in my home State, approximately 151,000 New Mexicans would be returned to the 15 percent tax bracket from which they have been pushed out; 83,000 of the families would see their taxes cut by $1,300 a year. Because of the progressive rate change structure, New Mexicans in the 28, 31, 36 and 39.9 brackets would all see their taxes cut by a similar amount because of the marginal rate concept in our law. 
   This bill excludes $500 in interest and dividends from taxation. The exclusion essentially makes a $10,000 nest egg tax free; 504,000 New Mexicans will be helped by it and file more simple tax returns. The bill exempts $5,000 in capital gains from taxation, amounting to a $1.4 million tax cut for 118,000 New Mexicans. 
   I close with a quote from Milton Friedman. 
   Milton Friedman said, and I agree:  
   The estate tax sends a bad message to savers, to wit: that it is O.K. to spend your money on wine, women and song, but don't try to save it for your kids. The moral absurdity of the tax is surpassed only by its economic irrationality.  
   The death tax is also one of the most unpopular taxes. While most Americans will never pay it, 70 percent believe it is one of the most unfair taxes. Its damage to the economy is worse than its unpopular reputation. The Tax Foundation found that today's estate tax rates (ranging from 18 to 55 percent) have the same disincentive effect on entrepreneurs as doubling the current income tax rates and NFIB called it the ``greatest burden on our nation's most successful small businesses.'' 
   The would make R&E credit permanent and phase-in some modifications during last five years. This is essentially the text of a bill I introduced earlier this year. 
   The bill increases expensing to $250,000. This will simplify record keeping for 2.5 million small businesses and save them a whopping 107,000,000 hours in tax preparation. 
   It also phases out the AMT for both indivduals and corporations. 
   The tax plan also recognizes that there are certain areas of the country--oil patch in particular that are being devastated. At the same time, the oil and gas industry pays some of the highest taxes in the country. For this reason the bill also includes oil and gas tax relief. 
   While the Joint Committee on Taxation has not completed its revenue estimate, it is my intention that these tax provisions can be accommodated within the Budget Resolution.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. 
   Madam President, I want Senator KENNEDY to know that I will not get red in the face today. My wife is watching, and she tells me I do better when I do not yell. 
   Looking at America today, I ask this question: Is the best way to resolve the problem of somebody who is a patient and sick, and the kind of coverage and care to which they are entitled, to give it to the trial lawyers to resolve before juries in court cases? 
   I cannot believe the best we can do to arbitrate and settle these disputes is to say: Let the trial court do it; let the juries do it. We already know, if you are looking for an egregiously inefficient way to resolve disputes, use the trial lawyers and use the courts of America. It just does not target the problem. It resolves issues in a very arbitrary way. 
   I say to everybody here, I am convinced that letting the trial lawyers solve a medical problem is borderline useless. It will cost immeasurable amounts of money because every lawsuit will be worth something and because everybody will be frightened to death to try something before a jury,  not because they are guilty but because jurors and the trial system are apt to award a gigantic verdict. Then every case is worth something. 
   Can we not figure out a better way than that? Whatever the arguments in this Chamber, the issue is: When people are covered by managed care or private health care, to what are they entitled? 
   It is not an issue of whether a doctor performs malpractice. That litigation is wide open. It is, if they are not getting what they are entitled to, how do you fix that? Frankly, I believe to fix it by throwing every one of those decisions into the lap of a trial lawyer who can file a lawsuit is, for this enlightened America, borderline lunacy. For an intelligent, bright America, it is ludicrous to suggest that as a way to settle disputes about coverage and quality of care. 
   Think of this: You open this up to the trial lawyers, and whatever an HMO or a managed care or an employer's policy provides for people is going to be in question unless the patient turns out healthy, safe, and sound. 
   If it turns out that they get sick or sicker, what do you think the case is going to be? They should have provided a different kind of care; I am in court; I am going to get an expert to say it should have been different; I am going to get a contract lawyer, an expert, to read into this contract what they think I should have. 
   Then they are liable for wrongful death, they are liable for any kind of illness, because the patient did not get well. 
   Frankly, I believe that is a giant mistake, and everybody should understand we are adding billions of dollars to the cost of health care through this and maybe will not get the kind of relief the people need. 
   Whatever the Republicans' final package is, I hope and pray that as part of the external review process we put in something that is very tough on HMOs and managed care and other policies, that they will provide what an independent medical expert says they are supposed to do, and it will force them to do it, not in a jury trial but in the process run by the States and their policymakers and insurance carriers. 
   Do we want the final decision as to the kind of coverage, the propriety of what was given to patients, to be decided by jurors in a courtroom with monstrous liability attached to it, 
   or do we want it to be done by an expert as part of a review process with short timeframes and mandatory performance when they make a decision as to what they are entitled to? 
   I believe an enlightened America should opt for the latter. I do not believe an enlightened America should even consider having contract disputes of this type determined by trial lawyers in courtrooms by jurors. 
   Which do we want? Do we want health care or do we want a jury verdict? Do we want health care as it should be or do we want a trial in the courts of this country? I choose the former, and you can do it without putting these issues into the courts of America, Federal or State. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish I had brought a prop with me. It would have been the front page of the New Mexico papers in 1997, because in 1997 across New Mexico there were front-page stories and headlines. Guess what they said: ``New Mexico Passes Patients' Bill of Rights.'' 
   Six months later, in July of 1998, there could have been a comparable headline across New Mexico, my State, the State in which the Democrats want to cover every single person who has health insurance. There could have been another headline saying: ``Patients' Bill of Rights Now Effective in New Mexico.'' 
   Maybe if I had brought that newspaper with me, some people from that side of the aisle would understand. They do not trust the States and even if the States already have protection through a bill of rights, they still want to take over nationally. 
   Forty-two States have protections for some or all of the very same things that are in the Democratic bill that the editors across America, at least to the extent identified by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, seem to be supporting. They do not even say in our State we already have the protection, except they imply it in Texas by saying: How can it get to be so expensive when we already have it? 
   I ask the question: If they already have it, why do we need to pass one? Our premise is that 42 States already  have many of the protections being suggested here. Some of them are moving in the direction of covering more than is being proposed here. Why do we insist that they would be better enforced in Washington, DC? I submit to anybody who understands the bureaucracy in Washington, do you really want every State's protection under a bill of rights to be dependent on HCFA? HCFA cannot handle in any diligent manner, with any reasonable conclusion, the work we have given them on Medicaid and Medicare and benefits and figuring out who can pay what. And now they want to give HCFA, from every State in the Union, huge numbers of the very people the other side of the aisle is crying for but who are already protected. 
   I do not know if we will ever get anybody, outside of those who hear what I am saying, to write that and check it out. It does no good to say the Democrat plan covers 161 million Americans. The question is, Why do we cover 161 million Americans? 
   I will introduce as part of my remarks the entire list of patient protections and mandates that are already in New Mexico's law. It reads like a litany of the issues we have been debating: Emergency room, OB/GYN, and how you get protection under it. 
   Everybody in New Mexico, on all the issues we have been discussing, is already covered, except whom? Except those the Republican bill covers as we introduced it and have debated it, for it goes out into the land and says there are some people the Texas Bill of Rights does not cover because they cannot; it is not legal for them to cover them. Some people in New Mexico are not covered. I wish I could tell you how many, but nobody knows how many. Some have insurance, and we cannot cover them with New Mexico's rights. 
   So we are covering them here. So it is a bill of rights for those who are uncovered in America. 
   I do not know how we will ever make the point, but let me just say, if you do not need coverage under a bill of rights because you already have it, then how does anyone get by with coming to the floor and saying: We're covering it anyway, and the other side of the aisle isn't covering it and they don't care? How do you get away with that?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. So I decided the best thing I could do is come here to the floor and see if I could express, in as simple language as I could, why the Congress needs to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. I think I have tried my very best today to say we probably need one for those who are not covered or cannot be covered in our States because, by operation of law, the States do not cover them and cannot cover them. 
   Actually, I wish we could say that 200 times. Maybe we ought to. Every time somebody stands up, we ought to say: We're covering those who are uncovered in America. Now let's go on to the rest of the debate, and then put up a sign and say: We're covering 48 million--put it up there--because they are the only ones who either do not have this protection or cannot have it. These people are not covered because the law says you cannot cover them, the States simply do not have the authority to provide these rights to these people, vis-a-vis, the health insurance they have. 
   Having said that, I believe that answers most the questions that have arisen in this debate. But, then I understand there remains--I see this as only four issues--another very interesting issue. Because at this stage of the evolution in the United States of America of settling disputes one goes to court and asks a jury to do it even though plenty of criticism exists from laymen and professionals on how inefficient, how lacking in rationale the decisions are that are rendered by juries and trial lawyers bringing cases. The Democrats insist that we put that in here as the mechanism, the means, the way to settle disputes over scope of coverage, whether you have given somebody what they are entitled to under an insurance policy or not, or given them the specialists they are entitled to. 
   Can you imagine, we are making a major issue here out of whether the lawyers and juries and courtrooms ought to decide that? Can you imagine that we could stand up before a group of people and say, just as the millennium arrives, we have concluded that with all the knowledge we have, everything we know about arbitration, mediation, ways to avoid going to juries and courtrooms, that this was the way to resolve this issue, and if we do not do it, as our opposition says, we are denying people insurance coverage? 
   What we need to look at before the day is over--and what I hope those who wrote editorials will look at--is did the Republicans have in their bill a method and means of resolving these disputes which are legitimate disputes? Do we have a method of resolving them that is apt to do it expeditiously, professionally, and is it apt to be right? 
   I believe, with what has been added here on the floor and will be in the bill tonight, when we finally vote on it, that we can 
   stand up and say, there is a way. 
   We think enough of this issue that we have made it nationwide, as I understand it. There will be no insurance policies that do not have this approach to settling the solutions across the land. That is pretty fair. Because it is sort of generically necessary for whatever set of rights you are giving to people. 
   So there are two issues. Frankly, for me, they are both very simple. I have explained the one on scope of coverage, and I have just explained the one on why in the world would you get lawyers and juries involved in the disputes between patients and health care systems on coverage. If doctors perform their service improperly, we still have medical malpractice. That is not being changed here. It is when you sit down and have an argument about a specialist, can you get a decision quickly. 
   I have heard from our side, from some very good experts--and as a matter of fact, we on the Republican side are very fortunate. We have a great doctor helping us. Frankly, when he tells us about this, I am not even sure we need a second opinion. He seems to know the answers very well, and we seem to rely on him. We are very glad to have him. He suggested, along with Senator ASHCROFT and others, that we ought to have a more straightforward, forthright, expeditious, and enforceable provision to handle the disputes between patients and their insurance coverage as to what they are entitled. 
   Those are two of the issues. To tell you the truth, if those two issues could be resolved, we would be well on our way to having it done. 
   There are some other issues that are around on the scope of what exactly we ought to mandate? They are not as important as these two. Who should we be covering? Should you let lawyers instead of doctors, lawyers instead of independent professionals, determine the scope of coverage and the entitlement of people to coverage under insurance, and the delivery of health care under new insurance approaches in the United States? 
   My last point, those couple of editorials my friend from Massachusetts read were written by editorialists who said we should not be concerned about cost; we should only be concerned about care. Let me tell you, one of the reasons we do not have enough coverage in the United States is because health care is expensive. While there are some who think the money just flows down from heaven and we pay for coverage, most people know somebody is paying for it--a business. In my State thousands of small businesses are paying for it. 
   If you think it is not important to them as to whether they maintain coverage, how much coverage they are going to pay for it, and whether their insurance costs go up 6.1 percent or not, then I guarantee you, you have not been reading the letters I am getting in my office from small businesspeople saying: You cannot give us too many mandates and you cannot have lawyers suing us because of the kind of coverage we have.  
   You may be surprised, but businesses do not have to provide health care. That is the law in America. It is voluntary on the part of most businesses. I am very pleased that most businesses are moving as rapidly as they can to buy insurance. 
   But I guarantee you, the other issue is, how much do we have to add to health care costs to get a reasonably good system for patient protection that is not now available in America? That is what we have been talking about, doing that where it is not available because of the operation of law. 
   We could go into three or four more issues, but I choose to give my own summary and my own understanding of the real nature and philosophical difference between that side of the aisle, the Democrats, and this side of the aisle. 
   Frankly, everyone around here knows I am not a Senator who votes one way all the time. I have been known to have a big argument with my friend from Texas, and he votes one way and I vote 
   another. I will not chalk up the results, like that scoreboard: DOMENICI--6; GRAMM--0. But in any event, we have had those disagreements.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. He will think it was the other way around. 
   But in any event, the point of it is, it does not normally fall on this Senator to come to the floor and brag about our side of the aisle being right. But I can tell you, on this one I am very pleased with what has happened. I never have felt more comfortable than I have with this task force of Republicans who have handled this issue. 
   They have been good. They have been sharp. They know the issues, and there has never been a shortage of Senators arguing on this bill. I have been very pleased that they are willing to answer questions far more than I am. They know much more than I do. 
   I believe the issue is as I have painted and described it today. If it turns out that by beginning to cover a bunch of people who aren't covered, we only add eight-tenths of a percent to the cost, we don't inject into the system lawyers and courtrooms and jury trials to determine disputes between a provider and patient, and we provide for resolution of disputes in an expedited manner, as is going to be done in the bill we will introduce when we wrap this thing up tonight, I think we are on the right track. 
   I don't believe the American people, contrary to what my good friend, Senator KENNEDY, said, are going to be fooled by this. I don't think when it is over they are going to say: Boy, we would have had much better health care if the Democrats would have won their way. I think many are going to say it would have been a lot more expensive. I think many of them will say: We would be back in Washington every week trying to get the rules out of HCFA, which can't handle what it has now, much less handling all the States in terms of the Patients' Bill of Rights and the remedies available under it. 
   I thank everybody who worked on our side as diligently as they have. I particularly say we are lucky in the Senate to have Dr. BILL FRIST as a Senator. He is on my Budget Committee. I had trouble. I used to say his name ``First'' instead of FRIST. It took me a while. He tried to correct me six or eight times, and I finally got it. I think we are very fortunate to have him here because when he tells us how this works, and he shares the opinion of how the medical people are looking at it and what the reality is, I end up thinking Tennessee did us a very special favor by sending him to us. 
   I close by saying, I hope after all this work, the proposal that the Democrats offer will get defeated and that the final Republican bill, which will be explained again in depth by others, passes. Let's go to conference and see how it all turns out.

I did not say 42 States have every single item that the Democrats want in the Patients' Bill of Rights, but they do have the authority to put in as much as they want. So if the sovereign States, their Governors and legislatures, think your litany of things ought to be there and they are that important, they have the authority to pass it.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today with Senator BAYH to introduce the Responsible Fatherhood Act of 1999. 
   Even on its best day the government can never be a replacement for a loving two parent family. As the father of eight I cherish the moments I have spent and will spend with my children because they are my best friends. 
   But sadly, there is a growing trend among American children, they are growing up without the love and guidance of their fathers and in many cases these children are going years without seeing their fathers. 
   This trend has taken a terrible toll on not only our children and families, but our nation as a whole. For instance in my home state of New Mexico over 24 percent of families do not have fathers present in the home. 
   Nationally, the numbers are not any better; nearly 25 million children or 36 percent of all kids live without their biological father and since 1960 the number of children living without their father has jumped from 5 million to 17 million. Additionally, about 40 percent of these children have not seen their father in the last year. 
   I cannot think of two more important issues facing our nation than the dual goal of promoting marriage and responsible fatherhood. I believe you could describe the role parents play in the lives of their children in the following way: providing love, guidance, and discipline; while at the same time teaching about respect, honor, duty and the values that make our nation so great. 
   And while we all acknowledge the positive benefits of a two parent family these are more and more families where fathers simply are not present in the lives of their children. I would submit this is a tragedy because a child growing up without a father or a mother simply misses out on something very special. 
   I recently came across a quotation that I think is appropriate: ``it is a wise father that knows his own child.'' However, the exact opposite is now occurring with a growing trend towards absentee fathers. 
   The bill we are introducing today seeks to reverse this trend by providing states and communities with support for the dual goal of promoting marriage and responsible fatherhood. 
   Specifically, the bill: authorizes a public awareness campaign to promote responsible fatherhood and the formation and maintenance of married two parent families. 
   Additionally, our bill creates a responsible parenting block program to provide support for state and local governments, nonprofit, charitable and religious organizations' efforts to promote responsible fatherhood and the formation and maintenance of married two parent families at the state and local level. 
   The final component of the bill changes existing Federal law to encourage a stronger connection between fathers and children through increased child support to families and more available training through the Welfare-  to-Work program for low-income non-custodial fathers. There is one provision within this component I would like to specifically focus on and that is the State option to disregard child support collected for purposes of determining eligibility for, or amount of, TANF assistance. 
   While it is the intent of this section to allow States to disregard certain child support collected that amount is also limited only to cases where states have chosen to pass-through up to $75 of child support payments per month directly to the family and then only that $75 may be disregarded by states. 
   In closing, I want to encourage my colleagues to lend their support to this important issue and Senator BAYH, I very much look forward to working with you on this exciting piece of legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, please tell me when I have used 4 minutes. 
   I say to the President of the United States: Thank you very much, Mr. President. You have agreed with us on one of the most important issues confronting the senior citizens of this Nation. In your budget and your recommendations in the past, during this fiscal year, you suggested that only 62 percent of the Social Security trust fund be saved and put in a trust fund and stay there for senior citizens for their Social Security. We suggested in our budget resolution that anything short of 100 percent was not right. After weeks of debate in this body, without an opportunity to get a vote on an amendment that would have said that and would have locked it tightly in place, the President of the United States announced that there are more resources available because the surpluses are bigger and decided that he agreed with the Republicans that 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund should be set aside for Social Security purposes. 
   Now the time has come for the Senate to do that. This is not an issue of Medicare. This is an issue of the Social Security trust fund being available for no purpose other than Social Security. In the meantime, it is used to reduce the national debt. That is the program, that is the plan, that is 
   the safest and fairest thing for seniors across this land. 
   Pretty soon, we are going to find out whether that is really the issue or whether there is another issue, and that other issue is, even if you have done that and set it aside and locked it away, should there be a tax cut? It would appear that for some reason, the President of the United States and maybe a majority of the Democrats in the Senate don't want to let the American people have a refund of the taxes they have overpaid. And now we learn from both auditing or accounting entities, the President's and ours, that that surplus is even bigger than we thought. That is aside from the Social Security trust fund--in addition to it, without touching it. 
   The issue, then, is what kind of gimmick are we going to use to eat up that surplus so there is no money available to give back to the American people? That is the issue. The issue will be couched as if we should put $350 billion of this non-Social Security surplus in a Medicare trust fund. But the President's own proposals belie the necessity for that and just give it a birth--you open it up and you can see it for what it is, an effort to deny the American people a tax cut because, lo and behold, the President said we can reform Medicare. We can actually put in place prescription drugs. And what is  the price tag? Let's just agree that the President has a good number--how about that, I say to Senator ABRAHAM--$46 billion, not $396 billion; $46 billion is what he says we need during the next decade to provide prescription drugs, which he deems to be good for the senior citizens of America. He is crossing this land and saying: I am for prescription drugs. 
   We are for prescription drugs. In fact, we are so pleased that the President has acknowledged exactly that situation that we are almost prepared to say--as soon as we run some numbers --that we can do better than you have done in terms of prescription drugs for senior citizens who need prescription drug assistance. 
   But let's remember, he says we need $46 billion. We are going to hear some arguments about the lockbox, saying let's have another lockbox for Medicare and let's take a bunch of the money that the taxpayers ought to get and put it over there in a trust fund under the rubric that it will help get rid of the deficit, that it will bring down the deficit of the United States, the overall debt--even though the three major accounting entities that have testified said it will be the same thing whether you put it in there or not. It has no impact because at some point you have to pay off those IOUs, and that means a tax increase. 
   Now, this is rather complicated, but the truth of the matter is--listen up, seniors--we are going to provide a prescription drug benefit as good as the President's or better. Let's focus on that. That is what we are going to do. Indeed, we are going to put every nickel--I remind everybody it takes $120 billion more for the trust fund to get all it is entitled to, according to CBO. 
   We are going to put more than $1.8 trillion in. We are going to put $1.9 trillion in that trust fund. 
   In summary, we are making some headway. It is slow and tedious. 
   I assume that today all Members on the other side of the aisle are going to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed. I believe that is the case. It will be 100 to nothing, as if they have agreed to a lockbox. Actually, that is a wasted vote, if there are going to be 100. They are just deciding they all want to go home and say: We are for the lockbox also. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate the yeas and nays on the lockbox motion to proceed----

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is not an issue of what kind of economic game plan we have had for the last 5 or 6 years. We all understand that hard-working Americans are making this economy hum. Investors who have become more enlightened and entrepreneurs who are taking more risks have caused a great American recovery, sustained in a manner we have never expected. 
   The issue is, when we collect more taxes, and we exceed expectations--in fact, not just by a few hundred million, but actually approaching $1 trillion--should we wait for the Government to spend it or should we give some of it back to the American taxpayer? 
   Actually, the Social Security trust fund can be saved. Medicare with prescription drugs can be reformed and fixed so we have prescription drugs, and there is still a large amount of money left over. What should we do with it? Invent some way to set it aside? If we do that, it will be spent. Let's give some of it back to the American people. That is why the lockbox is important. It says what is left over does not belong to Social Security; it belongs to the American people. Use it prudently, Congress, and give back some of it. 
   It appears there is a war with that side of the aisle against giving anything back to the American people from these kinds of surpluses. I believe we will win that war. We relish it. We are ready to go. That will be the issue the next couple of months. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1282, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for FY 2000, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. 
   I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for bringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary spending caps for FY 2000. 
   The pending bill provides $27.6 billion in budget authority and $24.7 billion in new outlays for FY 2000 to fund the programs of the Department of the Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Executive Office of the President; the Postal Service; and related independent agencies. With outlays from prior-years and other completed actions, the Senate bill totals $27.8 billion in budget authority and $28.2 billion in outlays. 
   For discretionary spending, which represents just under half the funding in the bill, the Senate bill is at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority, and it is $109 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. The Senate bill is $0.5 billion in both BA and outlays below the President's budget request.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from Colorado, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, in a colloquy. 
   Mr. President, I want to begin by applauding the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Treasury-General Government Appropriations Subcommittee for what they have done under difficult budgetary circumstances. The Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget request for Customs included a controversial $312.4 million user fee to fund 5,000 existing Customs personnel. That budget gimmick essentially forced the Committee to either reduce Customs staffing levels or reduce or deny many needed projects and new initiatives. Under those difficult circumstances. I believe that Committee made the right choice. 
   The Customs Service has added to the problem by failing to include comprehensive air interdiction and marine enforcement fleet modernization plans requested by Congress in its Fiscal Year 2000 budget request. Has the subcommittee received either of these plans?

   Mr. DOMENICI. As the Chairman knows, I believe that the AS350 AStar helicopter is a proven force-multiplier for Customs that has been used along the Southwest border, and elsewhere in the country, to support operations by the Border Patrol, and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. According to information provided by the Customs Service, in the past year these Customs helicopters assisted in the seizure of approximately $14 million 7,800 pounds of cocaine, almost 25 tons of marijuana, 88 vehicles, 1 aircraft, 12 illegal weapons, 5 vessels, and 210 arrests. In addition, the Executive Director of the Customs Air Interdiction Division, has indicated that AStar is the most cost-effective element of the Customs air fleet. Based on this track record, the AS350 AStar has become the light enforcement helicopter of choice for the U.S. Customs Service. 
   Mr. President, I understand the budget constraints facing the Subcommittee. I would simply ask that as we proceed with this bill in conference or later in the year, the Chairman and the distinguished Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. DORGAN, consider making investments in proven, cost-effective force multipliers--like the AStar helicopters--that can help strengthen law enforcement and improve our efforts to combat the inflow of drugs into this country a funding priority.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1283, the District of Columbia Appropriations bill for FY 2000 as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   The bill provides $410 million in new budget authority and $401 million in new outlays for federal contributions to the District of Columbia government. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the Senate bill totals $410 million in budget authority and $405 million in outlays for FY 2000.  
   I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator HUTCHISON, for her hard work and diligence in fashioning this bill. The bill is exactly at the Senate Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. The bill is $17 million in budget authority and $12 million in outlays above the President's request due to the inclusion of a tuition assistance program for D.C. students who attend out-of-state colleges. The Administration has requested these funds, however, through the Department of Education rather than directly to the District of Columbia.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss recent developments regarding the Rio Grande River in New Mexico, an endangered species called the silvery minnow, and praiseworthy action by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this week. 
   As I have previously outlined before to my colleagues, a complicated and potentially chaotic situation involving literally hundreds of thousands of water users along the Rio Grande in my state could emerge this year. Yesterday, the Fish and Wildlife Service designated almost 170 miles of the Rio Grande channel as critical habitat for the silvery minnow. This designation, as Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt testified earlier this year, is prematurely driven by a court order before the needs of the minnow and economic impacts are known. Indeed, this is a ``cart before the horse'' situation that would be comical if its consequences weren't potentially so tragic. 
   In light of this situation, the action by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Tuesday is heartening in two respects. First, I want to profoundly thank Senator CHAFEE, chairman of the committee; Senator BAUCUS, ranking member; and Senator CRAPO, chairman of the relevant subcommittee, and their staffs, for their help on S. ll00, a precisely crafted bill that would bring a logical and commonsense reform to the present Endangered Species Act. Second, I also thank the various environmental organizations and their staffs that helped us in this effort. This was a unique, bi-partisan undertaking. I think the committee's work shows that intelligent reform can occur in this highly charged  arena. I will do all I can to assist in ``clean'' passage of this legislation, without the burden of multiple amendments that will fracture the consensus that has developed. 
   S. ll00 simply requires that the designation of critical habitat for an endangered species occur, in the future, after the scientific work necessary to develop a comprehensive recovery plan for that species is completed. That sounds logical to my colleagues, I suspect, but the present Endangered Species Act provides for just the opposite: that is, it requires a designation of habitat before science has told us what a species needs to survive. 
   I have been asked what relationship exists between S. 1100 and the Rio Grande/silvery minnow situation. The answer will clearly depend on how the courts resolve this particular case. However, S. 1100 provides that designation of critical habitat should occur concurrently with the development of a recovery plan. That is a significant step forward, but only a first step. It will prevent the situation now found on the Rio Grande in the future. 
   A court has forced the Fish and Wildlife Service to prematurely designate critical habitat, a premature designation that everyone agrees could be counter-productive. Mr. President, you know that a full Environmental Impact Statement is required by law in the case of a ``major federal action.'' If any case cries out for a full EIS, it is the case of the silvery minnow. The potential impact of this federal action by the Fish and Wildlife Service, compelled by the court, could have consequences well beyond the normal definition of the word ``major.'' At stake is the water, literally the water used every second of every day by all users of the Rio Grande system. Unfortunately, even with legal precedent on the need for an EIS in habitat designations, the Fish and Wildlife Service chose not to do one. 
   Some try to portray this particular case as one dividing farmers and ranchers from the more extreme environmentalists in our state, a situation described quite accurately and colorfully by Secretary Babbitt earlier this year as ``intransigence.'' Yet, this issue is much broader than that kind of confrontation: hundreds of thousands of users, people who depend upon the Rio Grande for their water in their taps at home, residents of Santa Fe and Albuquerque, and the communities in between, could find their water endangered. 
   In light of this potential, I believe that a full-scale Environmental Impact Statement must be done on the silvery minnow issue. It is only after we know the impact that critical habitat designation may have on all users, and its relationship to saving the species, that we can intelligently move forward.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal yesterday wrote:  
   What is not in dispute is how hard a hit small domestic oil took during the recent downturn in oil prices. While larger oil companies with their huge asset bases and integrated businesses were able to weather the storm, many of the smaller producers, which operate on low margins and minuscule volumes, lurched toward ruin. 
   These small producers, who mop up the tailings of the country's once-great oil fields primarily in the West and the Mid-west collectively produce about 1.4 million barrels of oil daily, an amount roughly equivalent to that imported to Saudi Arabia. And the total number of such subsistence wells, defined by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission as ones producing 10 barrels of crude a day or less were abandoned at an accelerated rate during the downturn, experts say.  
   The Wall Street Journal is not the only entity noticing the plight of the domestic independent oil and gas industry. DOE recently wrote: ``Domestic crude oil producers have seen the price of their product (adjusted for inflation) fall to levels not seen since the 1930's.'' 
   Independent oil and gas producers have wells in 32 States. Senators from these producing States have heard from the producers, oil and gas service small businesses, Governors, mayors and county commissioners. The situation was so bad in Oklahoma that the Governor held a special session of the legislature. In New Mexico, we have oil and gas producers organizing marches and rallies calling attention to their crisis. When the oil and gas industry suffers a cash flow problem and credit crunch, so do Federal, State and local governments. The recent oil and gas crisis has cost States and localities $2.1 billion in lost royalties alone. One community had to chose between keeping the hospital or the school open. Oil tax revenues were, not sufficient to keep both operating. 
   The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States is at the lowest count since 1944, when records of this tally began. The industry is predicting that the U.S. will loss an additional million barrels a day of domestic production as a result of the last price collapse. This production shrinkage will be felt in the marketplace in 12 to 18 months. 
   Beginning in November 1997, the oil and gas exploration and development industry began experiencing the lowest inflation-adjusted oil prices in history. 
   Recent Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) statistics speak for themselves: 
   .55,000 jobs lost out of an estimated 338,600 total industry jobs. 
   .Additional 68,000 oil and natural gas jobs (20 percent) are at risk of being lost. 
   .136,000 oil wells (25 percent of total U.S.) and 57,000 natural gas wells shut down. 
   Every barrel of domestic that we lose will have to be replaced with barrel of foreign produced oil and our dependence on foreign oil is already too high--in excess of 57 percent and trending higher. 
   The industry we are trying to help includes royalty owners in all 50 States. Many of these royalty owners are retired and depend on their oil royalty checks to pay for their daily expenses. When the price of oil dipped to $10 a barrel several months ago, these royalty owners saw their royalty checks drop by half. 
   At $18 to $19 a barrel our independent producers barely break even. At $14 a barrel they lose $10.30 a day per well or $3,752 a year per well. 
   The oil and gas industry is a very capital intensive industry on the front end--exploring and drilling wells and also on the back end--shutting in wells or going out of business. The drilling costs for a well range from $600,000 to $15 million for an off-shore deep water well. Getting out of the business is capital intensive industry, too. On average it costs $5,000 to $10,000 a well to decommission a well. 
   It is an industry dependent on banks and credit. The independents get about 40 percent of their capital from financial institutions. The price of oil has just recently improved, but the bankers have been reluctant to restructure loans or to make new loans. 
   Capital budgets to develop new production and replace depleting existing production have been cut dramatically. Most independents are not drilling new wells. The industry has a viable future but they have to get through this current credit crunch, and they need loan restructuring to keep them going until they can recover from the big price drop of 1997 through mid-1999. 
   This is why I joined with Senator BYRD to propose an emergency loan  program for oil, gas and steel--two important core industries. I am hopeful that the House will quickly name conferees and move the bill through the legislative process. Domestic oil and gas production is America's true national strategic petroleum reserve and we need to make sure there is an industry in the U.S. capable of meeting our strategic oil and gas needs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that would provide Habitat for Humanity $1.5 million for construction of a multi-unit development for Tibetan refugees living in Northern India. 
   These refugees were forcibly driven from their homes by the Chinese communists. They are living in the Dehradun area and are among the poorest people on earth. They are without citizenship rights and cannot own land. As such, they exist as squatters in burned out homes and shacks remaining after the Hindu-Moslem conflicts of a few years ago. The conditions are deplorable; soaking wet in the monsoon season and freezing in the winter. 
   Many Americans are aware of the plight of these Tibetan refugees and have started taking actions to help them. The Dalai Lama is a full partner in this project and has put the full weight of his friends and government behind this. 
   This money will fund a plan to purchase 14 acres of land on behalf of the Tibetans and provide for the construction of a multi-unit development for 160 of the poorest families. An American architect has volunteered his time to visit the site, direct the preliminary clearing, and draw the plans for the village. 
   General Mick Kicklighter, U.S. Army, Ret., serves as President of Habitat for Humanity International and will oversee the direction of resources for this project. The President of the Arundel County, Maryland, Habitat for Humanity affiliate is working to lay out detailed building time and cost management for the village. The property has been obtained, building permits secured and the land has been cleared by the hand effort of the refugees. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me and the cosponsors to this amendment to support funding in the amount of $1.5 million to directed to Habitat for Humanity International for completion of this project. The creation of this village with U.S. assistance will serve as a model for the international aid community. I firmly believe that the impact of this modest sum will be felt globally.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the resolution I have just alluded to is a bipartisan resolution. A number of years ago we started this approach to character education called Character Counts. Senator Nunn was the cosponsor of a resolution that passed the Senate on innumerable occasions, perhaps as many as five times. It declares for all of America that one week during the year will be known as called Character Counts Week. 
   Frankly, from this Senator's standpoint, we hear so much about what we ought to do and what we can do to help our young people as they grow up in this very difficult society and often very difficult time. We all understand that there are many people who have primary responsibility for our children. We are not in any way talking about negating that primary responsibility, that of relatives and grandparents and mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters to help raise a child with good values. But we have found, starting about 6 years ago, that the teachers in our public schools have been yearning for something they would like to teach our children that for some reason had been eliminated from both the public and private school agenda. It is sometimes referred to as character education. 
   I chose to call it ``Character Counts'' and I chose to speak about a specific program that is being used in many public schools in our country, and certainly in my State of New Mexico, whereby the teachers take six pillars of character and they embrace those within the classroom--on a day-by-day basis, not as a special class. But let me just mention a few of the Character Counts traits that are part of this program and used in many schools. 
   Let's start with the first one. It is trustworthiness. In some public schools and private schools, especially in the grade schools, for one entire month, the school would promote the idea of trustworthiness by students and teachers, who have lesson plans and programs that articulate what trustworthiness is. They use this with the students, and they from time to time engage in discussions, engage in activities around the school that epitomize trustworthiness. I think we all understand trustworthiness is one of those characteristics and qualities of character that says you should not lie. It says if you agree with somebody to do something, you should live up to your agreement. Trustworthiness has a quality of loyalty to it. 
   Then maybe the next month, one of the other six pillars would be discussed and woven into the curriculum. The next month, it may very well be ``respect.'' The same kind of thing might happen during that month in some grade school in New Mexico or Idaho or the State of Tennessee or the State of Connecticut, where an awful lot of activity in Character Counts education is taking place. 
   Maybe the next month it might be the third trait, which is ``responsibility,'' and then maybe the next would be ``fairness,'' and ``caring,'' and ``citizenship.'' 
   I have been part of this now for a number of years. It is a joy to visit public schools, parochial schools, and other kinds of schools, and visit a class and just talk to the young people about the word of the month; to see the teachers, how excited they are that for that month the children have been talking about responsibility; they have been talking about that in terms of their classmates, their teacher, their responsibilities at home. 
   Then if you are lucky, you might choose to visit a school at the time once a month when they are having an assembly. During Character Counts assemblies, schools bring all the students together, and they present awards to the students that month who were most responsible. One way of reinforcing the importance of good character is to reward those who did more  things than anyone else that month to demonstrate ``trustworthiness,'' or ``responsibility,'' or ``caring,'' or ``respect,'' or ``citizenship.'' 
   Actually, Character Counts and its Six Pillars are not the only character education idea and program taking place in our country. But it is one of the best. The resolution we have just 
   adopted resolves and proclaims the week beginning October 17 of this year, and the week beginning October 15 in the year 2000, to be National Character Counts Week. We request that the President issue a proclamation calling upon people and interested groups to embrace the six core elements of character identified by the Aspen Declaration, which are trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. That week the people in the country observe as National Character Counts Week, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
   There are many Senators who have already joined in this effort from both sides of the aisle. Some are very active in their home States, and some are not. But I can say to any Senator who would be interested, there is a format which is very simple and at the same time very effective and profound, where a Senator or any elected official can get together with the superintendent of schools and others and talk about joint sponsorship of Character Counts in that particular public school. If the board of that school condones it and says it is a good idea, then it is all a question of leadership and who wants to pursue it and push Character Counts. So when graduation at a Character Counts school occurs, you can attend and you can see what the 9 months of character education have done. At schools where arithmetic was taught, grammar was taught, reading was taught, all of a sudden the young kids also know something about these six pillars of character. 
   Frankly, people ask what has gone wrong with our country and what should we do about it. 
   I am no prophet, and I am not one who thinks he knows all the answers, but I say what is missing in the United States more now than 20 or 30 years ago is character. The old Greek philosophers talked about character. I think it was Plato who said a country without character is a country that cannot exist for long, and that for a country to have character, the people in the country must have character. 
   What we are speaking of is our little mission and our part in trying to change the quality of lives of young people by letting them know that some things are better than other things, there are some things that are right and some things that are wrong. 
   Nobody seems to object across this land to these six pillars, these six words. It used to be whenever one talked about behavior and said values, people would wonder, whose values? 
   In our America, under our Constitution, we surely cannot decide which religions values are to be taught in the schools, for as soon as we do that, we have to ask which ones are being left out. And as soon as we do that, we begin to break down the wall of separation between church and State, which is such a formidable part of America as it started under our forefathers and continues today. 
   It is interesting. I have asked in many assemblies of adults whether there was any objection in the community--be it the community of Gallup, NM, or Clovis, NM, or Las Cruces, NM, or Albuquerque, my home city--to these six pillars. If one thinks them through, they are so fundamental and desperately needed that hardly anyone can object to them. 
   I wish the Governors of our country--and I am going to ask them, along with my good friend and chief cosponsor, Senator DODD of Connecticut--might adopt this in their States. I want to work with the Governors to move together with the public institutions of education and the private institutions of education to begin a broader-based promotion of Character Counts in more States. 
   Frankly, a number of our Senators have been involved in the past. Senator DODD has brought this idea to his State, and Senator LIEBERMAN works with him. Senator FRIST of Tennessee has had great success in getting it started, and now it is multiplying in his State. I have had a rather phenomenal success in New Mexico. In my small State, over 200,000 young people, one way or another in classrooms across our State, are learning and living these six words, these six pillars of character, as part of their 9 months of education. It is having a profound effect. 
   On the other hand, there are cynics. They ask: How do you know? Are you sure? 
   We do not know for sure, although we are beginning to get some objective analysis that seems to indicate that some of the things going wrong in the schools before are not going wrong when the six pillars of character are utilized, are popular and preeminent and where the children are participating in building their character around them. 
   I believe we are better off trying character education than not. If I had to guess what might change things, I would say if the young people in our country can build individually and collectively into their daily lives the six pillars of character celebrated in this resolution, so they feel part and parcel and immersed in the ideas of respect, trustworthiness, caring, and the other three pillars I have mentioned heretofore, we have a better chance of effecting some change for the positive than almost anything else we can do. 
   I am going to do my share to keep this going in my State. I am also going to join Senator DODD in meeting at the next opportunity with the Governors in a bipartisan way to see if they will engage us in a discourse and dialog about character education and, in particular, how Character Counts works in the places it is being tried. 
   There is not an organization that dictates Character Counts 
   for the Nation, nor does it promote it nationwide. This is an activity left up to localities. The only thing is, it is coordinated in our country by an entity which came up with these six pillars, the Josephson Institute of Ethics. That institute helps provide materials and the know-how for localities, schools, Boy Scouts, athletic clubs and others to promote these six pillars. But, it is up to the locality to do something about it. 
   But today, we are going to adopt this resolution celebrating Character Counts in the hope of raising awareness and encouraging states and localities to consider using this approach in their communities. 
   I note the presence on the floor of my cosponsor who has done a wonderful job in his State, and also speaks about Character Counts and the six pillars in various places in this country. He has had a significant degree of success. The way it is run in his State is different than our State, but, nonetheless, the six pillars are becoming prominent. 
   These six pillars are becoming prominent in the education of young people. We might never have thought we could include them, but in the backs of our minds we always thought they must be used. 
   How can we raise children without responsibility, without caring and respect being meaningful to them? 
   I am very pleased to be part of this again this year. Like I said, I am going to try to be a little more effective in expanding Character Counts to a few more places with the help of my colleague, Senator DODD. As I said in Senator DODD's absence, we are going to ask Governors to take the lead. We will join them and get the Josephson Institute and any others that are involved in character education and move it ahead so that many States will be like Senator DODD's and mine where it will be flourishing among young kids. 
   Mr. President, I say again, today, for the sixth consecutive year, we will adopt a resolution designating the third week of October as National Character Counts Week. Once again, this resolution has received overwhelming bipartisan support with 57 cosponsors. Through this measure, this body--the United States Senate--pledges its support and encouragement of character education and training by setting aside one week for a celebration. Yes, National Character Counts Week, October 17-23, 1999 and October 15-21, 2000 will be an opportunity for schools, communities, and youth organizations all over America to celebrate the ideals of good character and honor those who have worked so hard throughout the year to promote values such as trustworthiness, caring, fairness, respect, responsibility, and citizenship.  
   I believe it is time to reclaim the importance of these values in our daily lives. Many Americans, I regret, have become too cynical about the role of character in modern society. For too long, we have declined to discuss fundamental moral principles in our schools for fear of offending someone or imposing our beliefs. However, we nearly forgot that this nation was founded upon basic values. These values have bound our citizens together and sustained them through wars, depressions and other adversities. Indeed, it is our belief in these core values that continues to make the United States a beacon of hope and opportunity to people around the globe. 
   The ``Six Pillars of Character'' concept reflects these core values. They are the building blocks to helping our children recognize the difference between right and wrong, and they deserve a place in our schools alongside lessons in math and reading. Although parents do bear ultimate responsibility for teaching children the value of human dignity and character, we, as a community, have a duty to support these messages outside the home. To that end, Senator DODD and I are exploring ways to expand the role of character education in schools and after-school programs, and we urge our colleagues to join us. I can assure the Senate, character education programs have been phenomenally well received in school systems throughout the country. 
   In my own State of New Mexico, teachers have told me they finally feel empowered to discuss what it means to be a good citizen and a good person with their students, and they love it. Schools across the state have walls covered with posters on what ``responsibility'' means, and students who demonstrate outstanding acts of caring, for example, are celebrated at pep rallies. These simple lessons are taking root among our children, and they must be encouraged. 
   I am not suggesting that character education is the magic elixir that will prevent tragedies like the Columbine High School shooting from happening, but it's a start. We, as a society, need to tell our children that lying is not acceptable, under any circumstance. Stealing cannot be allowed. Breaking the law will not be tolerated. We also need to reinforce positive values, and programs like Character Counts do just that. I applaud the Senate for passing this resolution designating a National Character Counts Week for this year and next, and I encourage my fellow Senators to continue to work with me to ensure that our children receive strong and consistent messages on the essential values our society must embrace in order to succeed. 
   This is Republican time, but I am going to yield on Republican time to my colleague, Senator DODD.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I have been a Senator for a long time. I have participated in a number of events that made me feel very good about my work and about my community and the citizens of my State. But I do not believe there has been anything as satisfying as to work with the communities in New Mexico and school boards and superintendents and teachers on the six pillars of character in Character Counts. It has been absolutely something that I just will never forget. 
   I am quite confident that while it is not the only answer, the elixir, to all of our problems, it is certainly a very positive thing going on in the lives of our young people. We ought to be proud of these efforts and certainly encourage Character Counts, where we can. 
   I would say to the Senate, if any of you get involved in Character Counts, it is very difficult for the schools to have success at the high school level, but a lot of work is being done there. It is among the grade school children where this program starts. As they move through those years, when they have been exposed to character education for 4 or 5 years, there is a real difference in how they perceive their relationship to their teachers, to their parents, and to their community. 
   Mr. President, I understand that I have a number of minutes remaining under my control on the Republican side of this.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak a little about the President of the United States, his staff and his renewed focus on the domestic and economic issues of this country. 
   Across the land, it has been heralded that the President is once again coming back to address economic issues and wants to become a part of the economic agenda. He wants to be involved with what we are doing here in Congress in our work on approving money for programs, talking about Medicare, Social Security, and other things. 
   I will say at the outset that it wasn't too many months ago that the President of the United States was promoting a plan that was considerably different from what he is espousing today. It wasn't long ago that you felt satisfied with saving only a portion of the Social Security surplus and using the rest for your spending initiatives. Yet, as of today, the President's plan has come the Republican way. We both say now that we should save 100 percent of the money that belongs to the Social Security recipients of our country and we should not let it be squandered on anything else. 
   This means that we are going to save the $1.8 trillion dollar Social Security surplus over the next decade. In the Congressional plan, the only way that we can touch these funds is if they are needed to undertake substantive reforms of Social Security to ensure that the program works well for seniors. Nothing else. 
   In order to guarantee such restraint, we have developed a lockbox proposal--I came up with the basic idea and Senator ABRAHAM has taken a lead in promoting it. While the President's lockbox is different from ours, at least we are speaking the same language--even the President is saying that we must make sure not to spend any of the Social Security surplus. That puts us on the same path. He is following us. We thank him for that and are pleased to have him on board. 
   However, now is the chance for him to show his commitment to this principle. Up until now, we have faced opposition on our lockbox bill, both in our budget resolution and on the Senate floor. I would remind you that we have not been able to vote on this proposal here yet because the Democratic minority doesn't want to let us vote on our lockbox. We are going to ask them another time, very soon, to give us an opportunity to vote on it. This lockbox has the name, Abraham-Domenici. It is a real lockbox. 
   We are also joined by the distinguished junior Senator from Missouri as our third cosponsor, Mr. ASHCROFT. We wish others would join. We wish Senators from the other side would join. Let us make sure that when we say to the seniors that we are putting their Social Security funds in a lockbox, that it is real and is the most real one we can do. As a matter of fact,  our bill is so tough that the administration has opposed it on the basis that it might put our Government in a straitjacket. They fear that it might cause some harm to our Government and to our country because we tied the knot on our lockbox so tightly. 
   We do not agree. We think we need a tough lockbox to guarantee safety. However, the Administration should take comfort in the fact that the Office of Management and Budget--the President's experts on budgetary matters--has just revised up their surplus projections over the next decade in light of recent economic strength. As our economy grows and new jobs are added, people pay more in taxes. This means that once again, there is more revenue expected in the year 2000 than we contemplated 3 months ago. This means that we will now have an on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000 above and beyond the Social Security surplus--both the President's budget shop and the Congressional Budget Office expect forecast this. This is true, even accounting for the $7 billion we spent recently in FY2000 on Kosovo. This money came out of on-budget funds--we have not touched the funds that are accumulated by Social Security. 
   The President believes that we have a $5 billion on-budget surplus remaining next year. I can't tell you what the Congressional Budget Office is going to say with certainty, but I can tell you it is more than that. I can tell you it is between $10 and $15 billion. That means we can lock up Social Security's money in the Trust Fund and still have a $10 or $15 billion buffer to absorb any unanticipated expenses. This should allay the Administration's concerns about our lockbox. 
   Having said that, let me talk for a moment about a profound change which has occurred in our country in recent years. Something very dynamic is happening to the US economy. Some say 
   we're having a new industrial revolution of sorts in the high tech arena that is fundamentally changing the way we do business. It has fueled tremendous growth in all sectors. Now, no one knows for certain why this recovery is so long-lived. However, even though I am usually pretty cautious as budget chairman of the Senate, it does appear that this growth will propel us toward higher and higher surpluses going forward. It is realistic to assume that American taxpayers will be paying far more in taxes than we need to run the Government for many years to come. 
   That means, year over year, your Government spends less than it takes in. It is great to run persistent surpluses. However, we will surely lose the faith of the American people if we end up spending those surpluses. We must save Social Security's money now and in the future. However, we should think carefully about what we do with the extra surplus--the surplus above Social Security's funds. The President is thinking about this and has formulated 15 year budget plans. I should say as an aside, we will not use 15 year budget numbers--we will not go beyond ten years, regardless of what the President does. Ten-year estimates are long enough--we will have almost a trillion-dollar surplus beyond Social Security during the coming decade. 
   Now, I have not seen the entire new plan of the President, but I can tell you that is has some odd features. In the first five years, no one in America will get any tax relief. The Government of America will retain control of all the enormous projected surpluses. Tax relief is relegated to the second five years in the President's plan. 
   That is not fair to the American working man or woman. Now certainly, we will need to retain some of the projected surpluses to put toward Medicare reform. The President envisions one type of reform where he spends $51 billion of surplus dollars on a Medicare prescription drug benefit. We don't know if that is right or not. But we can sit at the table and fix Medicare given our wonderful fiscal situation. But let's not kid ourselves. We don't need a trillion dollars. We should be giving some of this money back to the American people--they are the ones who generated all these extra tax payments, they ought to get some of them back. 
   In that regard, it appears we are on a collision course with the President. We will let the American people be the judge of who is correct. I don't think that these hardworking men and women will stand by as their taxes climb higher and higher--I think they will support our call for tax relief. 
   It is unfair to assume that the Government, having collected more than we need, ought to start saying: Well, let's find out how we can spend all of it in Government. How does that make sense? Should we wait for Washington to figure out which new program it needs? Should we do what the President is doing? He wants to put $340 billion of IOUs into the Medicare trust fund, and then say, in 30 years when the IOUs come due, we will just raise income taxes to pay for it. Putting that money into the trust fund for Medicare does not enhance one payment, does not increase its solvency for one week. And here we sit failing to say exactly what it is. The President's proposal will lead to income tax increases down the road to cover these IOUs. 
   I should say a number of Democrats and almost every Republican have been critical of this presidential proposal. It is similar to writing a postdated check. Guess who is signing the check? The American people, because they back up the U.S. Government who signed that check. It is postdated 30 years. When it comes due, there isn't any money to pay it. So then you go out and tax the American people to pay it. But, in the meantime, you can for some reason run around and say there is a lot of money in the trust fund, ignoring the long-run consequences of this plan. Frankly, I don't believe this is the right way to do things. 
   I look forward to a good, healthy debate. Normally, I would wonder whether the President is going to once again politicize the issue of Medicare so much so that it will turn out that we will not do anything, and we will all be frightened to death. But I actually believe that the President and Congress can work together. However, we do not endorse the President's reliance on trust fund accounting. Instead of forcing all the surpluses into some trust fund or another, why don't we give them back to the people who paid us? Maybe they could set up their own trust funds. Maybe they could start their own savings plan. Maybe they could put a little more into the kind of things they think they need for their families. 
   In a sense, I don't know about the rest of the Senators on both sides of the aisle, but I look forward to these issues we are going to discuss between Members of the Congress and the President. On some of them, I look for us to walk right down this aisle in bipartisan fashion and get some things done. However, we will not walk into an end agreement where no relief is given to American taxpayers. We will not be able to agree with the President of the United States if he is leading all the Democrats--which I somehow doubt--saying, no matter how big the surplus is, let's just wait around and see if Government doesn't need it. I submit that, if you do that, Government will need it. Government will use it. And the taxpayers who collectively paid more into Government than we need will see bigger Government, more money spent and less money in their own pockets, which is where more of it ought to be. 
   I think my time has expired. I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator INOUYE in sponsoring this legislation to establish the American Indian Education Foundation. 
   Similar foundations exist for national parks and national fish and wildlife purposes. Many Americans leave assets to benefit American Indians, but there is currently no national foundation to encourage this type of giving for the benefit of Indian children in BIA schools. 
   The American Indian Education Foundation would primarily benefit elementary and secondary American Indian students with books, computers, school supplies, cultural preservation programs, literacy programs, and many other worthwhile activities. 
   There is already a pool of about $400,000 held by the Office of Indian Education in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). These personal assets have been donated over the years for Indian students, but there is no legal mechanism to transfer these funds to BIA schools. This legislation would allow the BIA to direct these funds to BIA schools to meet immediate education needs of today's Indian students. 
   I am proud to encourage this kind of targeted giving, and I am optimistic about its potential. America is a generous nation. As more Americans become aware of the spectrum of needs at BIA schools on Indian reservations, I predict a huge success for this important foundation. 
   I commend the Administration for developing this legislation, and I thank my friend Senator INOUYE for taking the initiative to move it forward in the Senate. 
   I urge my colleagues to encourage private gifts to national Indian education purposes by supporting this proposed foundation.

   Mr. DOMENICI.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through June 16, 1999. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Res. 209, a resolution to provide budget levels in the Senate for purposes of fiscal year 1999, as amended by S. Res. 312. The budget levels have also been revised to include adjustments made on May 19, 1999, to reflect the amounts provided and designated as emergency requirements. The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $0.4 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $0.2 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.2 billion above the revenue floor in 1999. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $56.1 billion, less than $50 million above the maximum deficit amount for 1999 of $56.0 billion. 
   Since my last report, dated May 12, 1999, the Congress passed and the President signed the 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-31). The Congress also cleared for the President's signature the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act (H.R. 435). These actions changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Miss Katie Kelly, an exceptional young woman from my home state of New Mexico who was recently crowned 1999 Miss New Mexico. Miss Kelly, a Santa Fean, will go on to represent New Mexico in the Miss America contest in Atlantic City, New Jersey, this fall. 
   Miss Kelly is representative of the selfless, poised, and self-assured young women that I am proud to have represent our state on a national level. This year's Miss New Mexico laureate is a Christian Life Academy graduate who is now attending Santa Fe Community College. She plans to attend Pepperdine University next year and study broadcast journalism and voice. Her previous achievements include, being named 1998 Miss Albuquerque Teen USA, 1999 Miss Santa Fe America, and second runner-up of the Miss New Mexico Teen USA pageant. 
   I have no reservations that she will dutifully fulfill the responsibilities that accompany this accolade. I wish her the best of luck in the Miss America Contest and in all her future endeavors.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Why? Because the President asked for $6.5 billion to replenish funds for the Kosovo engagement, which was being taken--by operation of law, nothing illegal about it--from other military needs. That is the way these things happen. The request was: Help us replenish it; give us the money. 
   Now, the point you have made is, we were in conference over that bill to which the Senate had seen fit to add $6 billion more for defense because we were so worried about preparedness, operational maintenance, and spare parts. So it was not just $6.5 billion urgent for defense; it was almost $12 billion. 
   Now, what you have said, my friend from West Virginia, you said we had a right, as conferees--and we had support--to say, let's get our part of this decided in this conference. And what would have happened? We could still, perhaps, be locked up in conference and the urgent money would be yet not decided upon, which funding, in fact, has already been signed by the President and is operating to help our military.

The proviso was that we be here today, just as we are, with this bill freestanding. We now have it here properly, over long threats for long debates, because the Senate overwhelmingly said: Let's get on with it; even if we don't vote for it, we want to get on with it. 
   So it's urgent that everybody know it's here again with the Senate already having voted for it.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is the first time I have had a chance to say this on the floor, but while you were in the House serving in various positions, there was a Senator here with the same last name as the junior Senator from Indiana--Birch Bayh. He sat right over there. 
   Many a time we were on the floor arguing, debating, sometimes agreeing, sometimes disagreeing. So he can read it in the RECORD, I say to my good friend, former Senator Birch Bayh, he did a great job in producing such a son. He was always so proud of him, telling me about him. I am very pleased I have a chance to serve with him. I look forward to that, because I think he has a marvelous, level head, and very good common sense. I say that as if that is an exceptional quality around here. I didn't mean to say that. If that is what I said, it is OK.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to put the word out, Democrat or Republican, whoever has amendments, this bill is subject to amendment. Senator BYRD has expressed the desire that we try to keep it to germane amendments, but that is not the rule. It is up to Senators. I am here on the floor. While many may think I don't have to eat, because other Senators are slimmer than I, and could probably go without lunch more often, I would like to be working. I hope we have something to do. I urge that people get their amendments to the floor and start discussing them. There are a number of them that we want to talk about, with Senators GRAMM and NICKLES, whenever they are prepared to discuss items with us. 
   I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I do have a few minutes I could use up with some comments about oil and gas, this bill, but I truly ask, if there are no Senators that want to offer amendments or speak, I will send word to the leader that we should have a recess for a few minutes to see if we can get some amendments to the floor. In any event, somebody will be here one way or another waiting. 
   Before I finish and ask that my request for a quorum call be announced, I note the presence of the junior Senator from Alabama. I wonder if he would want to comment on something.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Now that I have the floor, I wonder if my friend will engage in a little discussion with me for a moment. I think the approach you have just spoken of will be a good one for the Senate. 
   I am somewhat familiar--I will be more familiar when you are finished with your discussion of your four points--with what kind of amendments you are seeking. I believe it is possible we could sit down with Senator BYRD and work on all of those amendments. Some of us have been thinking about some of those amendments, even without you offering them; and some of them make eminent good sense to me. 
   So if you will do that, if you will discuss them, I am certain 
   that unless there are other Senators beyond you and Senator NICKLES, what you are talking about, even if we do not agree, we are not going to be here late tonight on those, if we can get them done. The question is, are there others? And we don't know about that. There may be; there may not be. 
   It may be that we cannot vote on some of these because of some other matters that are beyond our control. But I do not think we need time at 10 tonight to debate the ones you are talking about. We will understand them very soon, and we will start working with you and see what we can do.

   Mr. DOMENICI. But, on this one, I had a different view. I think before finishing today, by working with Senator NICKLES and Senator BYRD we can bring this closer to some of the basic concerns. 
   We will not get around to the notion that we will make guaranteed loans. In any event, we can't do that, but that would mean we give up our fight, I think, on some other issues. We can make the lending of them more objective--make it so there is a little bit of risk the borrower takes, and also we will discuss 
   with Senator BYRD the makeup of the board. I can't say much about that. We have to talk about it. 
   I am going to go to an appropriations meeting, and I will be back in 15 or 20 minutes. I know Senator NICKLES is here. I shared the same concerns with him. I understand he agrees not to offer amendments. We will have a meeting with Senator BYRD, and we will see what we can do about the Senator's amendments. I don't know about other amendments.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Under the order, I am to proceed. I note the presence of Senator ROCKEFELLER and I will yield to him in 1 minute. 
   In my case, on behalf of oil patch--not Exon and Texaco; these loans do not apply to them--the question has been asked: Why them? As if the United States and the Congress of the United States has not helped businesses that are in bad shape, that are regional or national in nature. And I have no complaints about that help.  
   Let me suggest that since 1993 we have, under supplemental appropriations as an emergency measure, appropriated $12.8 billion for agriculture assistance. That is not oil patch. I voted for agriculture and I live in a modest agriculture State. I was told that it would help, so I voted for it. 
   Natural disasters, the kind that you can hardly avoid calling a disaster, but I think oil patch is a disaster. I will explain that further in my remarks following Senator ROCKEFELLER. 
   Let me talk about natural disasters. People wonder whether emergency designations are useful in this country. In the same period of time, 1993 through 1998, we have spent $36.1 billion for natural disasters without batting an eye. Some of them cost $5 billion. 
   We are concerned about oil patch, especially the small people whose businesses are right down at rock bottom, and the patch isn't flourishing so the bankers are wondering whether they should loan to them. We want them to know we are concerned. 
   I will discuss the numbers. Oil patch, oil rig, oil well drilling, and related activities in America have lost more jobs in the past 10 years than any American industry. Our dependence continues to come down. We are starting to close wells off so they cannot ever be used, because they are too small and too expensive because the price is too low. The companies that work them are going to go broke. We think some are viable and banks might look at them and say with this kind of approach, although the banks will have to risk something under the new approach, we think it might help a few. 
   We have had $36.1 billion in declared emergencies for related damage in natural disasters, $12.7 billion for agriculture, and some Senators think it should have been double that already. 
   I have not been called upon to vote on whether that is enough or not. I listen when we are presented with problems and I do what I can for a part of America's economic sector. That is why I said if we are going to help steel--and I think we ought to do that; I have heard some wonderful Senators discuss why we should--I thought we ought to say something to the oil patch of the United States, since the same kinds of problems are occurring in Hobbs, NM, Eunice, NM, medium and small towns in Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere, and across the oil patch States of this land. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the interest of time, I will explain only one amendment, and I will let my colleagues pick up the others. If they want to repeat what I have said, fine. 
   Essentially, many Senators on this side have complained that this was an emergency measure, and that one way of looking at an emergency measure was that this bill might use some of the Social Security surplus. The emergency clause has been stricken. It is not in there anymore. As a consequence, this money is spent out of the regular allocation: Truth in budgeting, as you call it. It does not come out of the trust fund because it is paid for like any other program. 
   If you are wondering how much for this year's appropriation, it is $19 million. So we have to find $19 million within the $1.8 billion budget of the United States. So we don't have to take any money out of Social Security. That is the only point I want to make. 
   We fixed three other things other Senators were concerned about. I will let Senator NICKLES or Senator GRAMM explain those. I don't need the remainder of my time. Whatever I have left, I yield back.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, earlier this week the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board released its report on security and counterintelligence operations at the nuclear weapons laboratories of the Department of Energy. 
    The report's title--Science at its Best, Security at its Worst--neatly encapsulates the Board's findings. This report reiterates and clearly delineates problems within our nuclear laboratories that other reports have also detailed. No one should be surprised. 
   Let me simply list a few of this newest report's more compelling conclusions:  
   At the birth of DOE, the brilliant scientific breakthroughs of the nuclear weapons laboratories came with a troubling record of security administration. Twenty years later, virtually every one of its original problems persists. 
   The nuclear weapons and research functions of DOE need more autonomy, a clearer mission, a streamlined bureaucracy, and increased accountability. 
   More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal inquires ..... have identified a multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence problems at all of the weapons labs. 
   Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen. 
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven incapable of reforming itself. 
   Lastly, the report states: Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems with security and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire Department.  
   These findings are nothing new. 
   When Senators KYL, MURKOWSKI, and I introduced our amendment to the Defense Authorization calling for reorganization and streamlining within the Department of Energy, one of the charges leveled against us was that no hearings had been held on this issue. That old, tired claim that ``we need more hearings'' is used every time Congress tries to act on an urgent matter. 
   Sometimes that may be true. In this instance, we have undoubtedly destroyed a major forest with all the paper documenting DOE mismanagement in just the past 15 years. We have done studies; we have held hearings; the House has held hearings; we have asked for a review by the GAO, by the CRS, by outside groups, and we must have 25 pounds of recommendations gathering dust right now. 
   Today, my friend Secretary Richardson is implementing a new round of reforms at DOE. Mr. President, you should know that, while I have been critical of some past Secretaries for failing to give sufficient attention to these matters, Secretary Richardson is clearly indicating a willingness to tackle these issues. 
   However, Secretaries come and go. Reforms introduced during any specific tenure of a Secretary often do not endure after their departure. The Rudman report states, and I quote, ``the Department of Energy is incapable of reforming itself--bureaucratically and culturally--in a lasting way, even under an activist Secretary.'' 
   I can tell you from my own experience that it is sometimes hard to figure out just who is responsible in any given situation at DOE. Under the current structure the programs within one office, comply with policies set by a second office, in accordance with procedures set by a third office, verified by a fourth office. When I look at something like that, I have to wonder, ``Who is in charge?'' 
   The experts involved in producing the Rudmann Report asked a number of DOE officials to whom they report, who whom they were responsible. The most common response was ``it depends.'' 
   This myriad of oversight and review does not improve performance. To the contrary, in some cases it diminishes performance. It is my view that it is frequently easier to be an overseer than the responsible party. As overseers have multiplied, the line between oversight and responsibility has been blurred and sometimes disappears. The frequent result is that, when mistakes are made, everyone thinks they were an overseer, and nobody takes responsibility. 
   Mr. President, the national laboratories, especially the ones in my state, literally saved millions of lives through their work in World War II and during the cold war. They abound with dedicated, patriotic, and truly gifted men and women, working for this nation's security as their top priority. We should not make the labs a scapegoat for an ineffective bureaucracy. We need a fundamental re-emphasis on the nuclear weapons work at DOE, recognizing that the rules and regimes that govern the rest of the DOE cannot be entirely used in the nuclear weapons complex. 
   I would like to show you an organizational chart of DOE's current structure as it pertains to our nuclear weapons program. This chart is found on page 17 of the new report. As one can readily discern, it's a toss up who or what office might have oversight in a given situation in a maze such at this. Just one glance at this chart makes the point. 
   The PFIAB Report demands legislative changes. Again, I quote, ``The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven incapable of reforming itself.'' The PFIAB Report makes some very specific recommendations as to what changes are necessary. The authors recommend that Congress pass and the President sign legislation that:  
   Creates a new, semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   Streamlines the Nuclear Stewardship management structure. 
   Ensures effective administration of safeguards, security, and counterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by creating a coherent security/CI structure within the new agency.  
   The organizational chart outlining this new organization looks something like this. This can be found on page 50 of their report. 
   Creation of a semi-autonomous agency for our nuclear weapons work is precisely what I have been pushing over the last several weeks. Indeed, what I and my colleagues Senator KYL and Senator MURKOWSKI have proposed boils down to a true ``Chain of Command'' approach, with all the discipline this entails. I truly believe, and today's report confirms, that this approach, if it had been used in the past, may have avoided some of the security problems and will help us avoid them in the future. 
   The Rudman Report is a significant, timely contribution to the accumulating evidence that we must act to ensure that brilliant science and tight security are compatible within our nuclear weapons infrastructure. 
   I would like to congratulate Chairman Rudman and the members of the PFIAB for the tremendous contribution their findings will make to the dialog on how to best preserve our nuclear secrets and still maintain the greatest scientific research centers in the world. 
   The recommendations made in this report parallel what I and my colleagues tried to do several weeks ago. Perhaps this additional evidence will persuade others that it is long past time for Congress to take decisive action. I encourage my colleagues to read the report and draw their own conclusions about the need for organizational reform at DOE.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending Military Construction Appropriations bill provides $8.3 billion in new budget authority and $2.5 billion in new outlays for Military Construction and Family Housing programs and other purposes for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2000. 
   When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the outlays for the 2000 program total $8.8 billion. 
   Compared to 1999 appropriations, this bill is $385 million lower in budget authority, and it is $622 million lower in outlays. 
   This legislation provides for construction by the Department of Defense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it provides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. military services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and quality of life programs for our service men and women. 
   The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished subcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's allocation. 
   The bill provides an important and necessary increase in budget authority above the President's request for 2000. Most of the $2.8 billion increase fully funds projects that the President's request only partially funded. Because the bill supports appropriate full funding budgeting practices and because it funds highly important quality of life programs for our armed services, I urge the adoption of the bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, I commend Senator KENNEDY, because he offered an amendment. It is pending. I join him in that amendment. That amendment is germane, and it takes care of the entire argument about there being a loophole, because it takes the loophole out. 
   We didn't put the loophole in. The House did. The loophole is that the Social Security trust fund should be used only for Social Security. The House said it should also be used for Medicare. 
   Now, the good Senator from New Jersey is saying there are no amendments possible. This amendment could be called up after cloture, and it would take that part of it out and would leave it just for Social Security. 
   Now, senior citizens are hearing an argument that says we ought to protect both Medicare and Social Security in a proposal that is trying to take the Social Security fund and keep it for the future for senior citizens. One at a time, let's get it done. What is wrong with the other side of the aisle coming forth and debating keeping the Social Security trust fund for Social Security, not divert over and talk about Medicare, which is in committee being debated as to getting a bipartisan bill out of committee? We ought to wait for that to occur before we start talking about Medicare with Social Security. 
   Finally, the idea that this won't work and the notion that Senator DOMENICI in the past has said: Let's first pay off Medicare's responsibility, let me clear that up. 
   We were talking then about a huge cigarette tax. That is not before us. The cigarette tax was going to be spent by the President and by many on both sides of the aisle, to which I said: Before we do that, we ought to set it aside to see if Medicare needs it. That was a brand new tax.  
   Plain and simple, if the Democrats will cooperate, which they are not going to, we will bring before the Senate and have a debate: Do you want to put 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund aside and use it only for Social Security, or do you want to save 62 percent, as the President says, for Social Security? Incidentally, to the credit of Democrats in our committee, not a single one of them voted for the President's budget, 
   not a single one. They voted for little pieces. Even they didn't think the President's ideas were correct. Frankly, from our standpoint, we stand ready, and we say to the American senior citizens: Put the blame where it belongs. 
   They didn't let us vote on a tough lockbox because it was too tough. We fixed it up to accommodate the Secretary; still too tough. The other side says: You can't get it done. Now we have one that is not as good, but significant, and now they say they want to take care of Medicare also. 
   We ought to get our priorities straight. We are debating a trust fund in the Senate for Social Security money. If they want to offer amendments to change that in some way, even after cloture, they can vote on those amendments. I repeat, Senator KENNEDY has handled it right. He put in an amendment already. That amendment says Social Security trust funds should only be used for Social Security. It takes Medicare out of the House bill. That is a good way to approach this legislation--not to stand up and say Republicans aren't doing anything. As a matter of fact, we came up with the toughest lockbox you could imagine. But we heard that it is too tough, too hard on future Americans, to hard on our debt, so we changed it some. Then the excuse was: We are not ready to vote on that; we need more amendments. 
   I think the American senior citizens know what we are trying to do. I hope they know what the Democrats are trying to do. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while we wait for Senator JEFFORDS, who has a very important matter to bring before the Senate, let me thank the many Senators who have cooperated in an effort to get this bill passed. We still have the issue that Senator JEFFORDS will raise before the Senate, but I suggest, in a bill that is about $600 million less than the President requested with reference to the nondefense part of this bill, we have done a pretty good job of covering most of the projects in this country that are needed, that the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation talk about and a number of projects in the sovereign States that our Senators, from both sides of the aisle, represent. 
   We have done our best. We were not able to fund everything, nor were we able to fund at full dollar, and we had to reduce funding for the ongoing projects substantially in the flood line of money and projects that the Corps of Engineers has going for it. 
   We understand that the allocations for this subcommittee, which is made up with a significant amount of defense money and a lesser amount of nondefense money, have been allocated in the House in a manner that is about $1.6 billion less than this bill. We do not know how that can ever be worked out in conference, so we are very hopeful that before the House is finished, they will do some of the things that have been done in the Senate to alleviate the pressure on committees such as the energy and water subcommittee and others. 
   We have no assurance of that, but obviously everything is in place so that when this is passed today, if it is passed, we will be on a path to be ready for the House bill when they send it over and immediately go to conference. We will be ready to 
   do that at the beck and call of the House to try to get this bill done at the earliest possible time. 
   I will await the arrival of the distinguished Senator from Vermont, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I state here for the RECORD my sincere appreciation and thanks to Senator REID, the ranking minority member, and his staff--all of them. This is a complicated bill involving everything from the deepest military needs in terms of research, in terms of development, maintenance, safekeeping of all of our nuclear weapons at our nuclear laboratories around the country, the maintenance of all the other laboratories that DOE runs, to water, inland waterways and barges and seaports and flood prevention. Many Members have an active interest. We have had to work very hard to do what we think is a reasonably good job under the circumstances. 
   I also say to the distinguished junior Senator from New York, with reference to Brookhaven, I am totally familiar with the situation at Brookhaven. I worked on it for 2 years in a row when they had some problems up there. We worked with the administration and the Department. Clearly, if they qualify for the Worker Transition Program, we ought to be able to handle it administratively. The Department ought to be able to do that. 
   I say to Senator REID, I will be there helping wherever I can. I am very grateful we did not have to have a vote on this issue, because I think we would have had to object to it. I think it is much better that it be handled administratively. If they are entitled to it, they will get it because the program is already there. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to share with my fellow Senators the reality of what has happened to solar energy in this bill. First of all, in the Senate bill, for everything in this bill that is nondefense, there is a reduction of 7 percent. That means that for all of the things we do in water, in the Corps of Engineers, and all the other things, there is a 7 percent reduction. If we were to adopt this amendment, we would be taking this piece of the budget and increasing it 7 percent, thus giving it a 14 percent preferential treatment over the rest of the nondefense items in this bill. 
   All we are doing in this bill is reducing from $365.9 million, reducing it by $12 million, which is less than a 3 percent reduction, which means this is already favored by way of prioritizing by about 5 percent better than the other nondefense accounts here. So we can talk all afternoon and into the night about how great renewables are; we can all agree; but that is not the issue. The issue is, should we add $70 million when we have had to reduce everything else that is nondefense by the huge amounts I have just described? I do not think we need to. 
   Most of the things the Senator is discussing we will continue to do, and some that are in the pipeline ready to get done will get done because we are going to fund this at $353.9 million. That is not peanuts. Most of the solar things we want to do as a nation will get done. 
   As long as everybody knows, we are not trying to be arbitrary. We thought we were very fair in the treatment of renewables in this bill. It was not enough. We had to add $70 million more with an amendment that was out of order because it added to the amount we had to spend in our allocation, which means it breaks the budget. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you. 
   Fellow Senators, I suggest to you, the Chair has ruled that what the Senator seeks to do is out of order. We did establish right after we started this bill that amendments had to be filed at the desk so everybody could look at them. As you look at that sequence of things, a motion to send this back to committee with instructions was out of order; so those who want the Senator to win could not have won anyway. Now he wants to just 
   send it back to committee. The Chair has once again ruled that is out of order. 
   How far do we have to go? As a matter of fact, we have already taken care of renewables better than almost any other nondomestic piece of this budget. We have reduced, by 24 percent, items such as cleanup, nondefense cleanup, in this country because we do not have enough money this year. We are $600 million short. We have only reduced this function by 2.8 percent. We reduce the Corps of Engineers by 8 percent, the Bureau of Reclamation by 3 percent. The total nondefense has been reduced by 7 percent. 
   We have prioritized well. As a matter of fact, if this amendment passes, we will be giving renewables a 14-percent priority over the rest of the nondefense programs of this country which, on average, have been cut 7 percent, because this would ask to increase it by 7. I believe it should be tabled. I hope we will do that expeditiously. I thank Senator REID for his attentiveness and his stick-to-itiveness on this. I believe we have treated renewables fairly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit for the RECORD the official Budget Committee scoring of the pending bill--S. 1168, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for FY 2000. 
   The scoring of the bill reflects an amendment I offered at the beginning of this debate to correct an inadvertent error in the bill as reported to the Senate. With this correction of a clerical error, the bill provides $21.3 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $13.3 billion in new outlays to support the programs of the Department of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of Reclamation, and related federal agencies. The bill provides the bulk of funding for the Department of Energy, including Atomic Energy Defense Activities and civilian energy research and development (R&D) other than fossil energy R&D and energy conservation programs. 
   When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken into account, the pending bill totals $21.3 billion in BA and $20.9 billion in outlays for FY 2000. The bill is $2 million in BA below the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation, and at the 302(b) allocation for outlays. 
   The Senate bill is $0.1 billion in BA and $0.5 billion in outlays above the 1999 level. The bill is $0.3 billion in both BA and outlays below the President's budget request for FY 2000.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment specifically focused on encouraging small business partnership interactions with the Department of Energy's national laboratories and other facilities associated with Defense Activities. 
   Congress has frequently encouraged the national laboratories and facilities of the Department of Energy to craft partnerships that are supportive of their mission interests. Congress has emphasized that all program funding at these institutions can be used for mission-supportive partnerships. 
   Through industrial interactions, the best practices from industry, from improved technologies to improved operations, can be infused into Department missions. These interactions also provide opportunities for U.S. industry to benefit from technologies developed in support of the Department's mission areas, with a corresponding impact on the competitive position of our nation. 
   In past years, Congress has identified large amounts of funding, over $200 million per year, to encourage formation of these partnerships. There is less need for these funds for industrial interactions today, since the labs and facilities should have learned how to optimally use these partnerships. However, the reduction in funding for industrial interactions does not imply that Congress is less supportive of them, it only indicates the expectations that the Department's programs should be able to continue to use these partnerships without line item funding. 
   One specific class of industrial interactions, however, requires continued attention and specific funding from Congress. This involves interactions with small businesses. Small businesses are a primary engine of U.S. economy. They frequently represent the greatest degree of innovation in their approaches. Their focus on innovation makes them a particularly important partner for the labs and facilities, yet their small size and less developed business operations make interactions with the large Departmental facilities difficult. 
   In addition, each of the labs and facilities needs a supportive small business community surrounding them, one  that can provide needed technical services as well as provide an economic climate that assists in recruitment and retention of the specialized personnel required at these facilities. 
   For these reasons, we need a focused small business initiative to encourage interactions with this vital community. These partnership interactions can take many forms, from very formal cooperative research and development agreements to less formal technology assistance. They should be justified either on a mission relevance or regional economic development basis. 
   Four these reasons, Mr. President, this amendment creates a Small Business Initiative within Defense Activities for $10 million. With this Initiative, this vital class of interactions will be encouraged. 
   Mr. President, I also wish to speak about an amendment to add $10 million for a specific area of civilian research and development. This area involves assessment of accelerator transmutation of waste technology that may be able to significantly reduce the radioactivity and radio-toxicity of certain isotopes found in spent nuclear fuel. 
   Accelerator transmutation of waste or ATW may enable the nation to consider alternative strategies for spent nuclear fuel at some future point in time. Our present plan involves no options, it involves only the disposition of spent fuel in a permanent underground geologic repository. Yet that spent fuel still has most of its energy potential. 
   Depending on future generation's needs for energy, the availability of cost effective technologies for generation of electricity, and whatever limitations on power plant emissions may be in place, the nation may want to re-examine the advisability of continuing the current path for spent fuel. Transmutation technologies could enable energy recovery, along with significant reduction in the toxicity of the resulting final waste. However, while transmutation is technically feasible, much research and development will be required to determine its economic implications. 
   There is intense international interest in transmutation--from France, Japan, and Russia as examples. This is an excellent subject for international collaboration, and may lead to additional cooperation in the entire area of spent fuel management. The U.S. needs to have a sufficiently strong program to participate in such an international program, and ideally to exert a degree of leadership on the directions of international spent fuel programs. 
   For these reasons, Mr. President, this amendment adds $10 million to the civilian research and development funding line within the nuclear energy programs.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I share the concerns of the Senator from Idaho. However, it is not clear to me that the Department of Energy currently has the authority to use appropriated funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for the purpose--on site storage at nuclear power plants--that is of concern to the Senator from Idaho. As I interpret current law, there exists no statutory provision allowing the Department of Energy to fund on-site storage. If that were the case, would my colleague from Idaho still feel the need to offer his amendment?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing the Senate a bill that is within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. The bill provides $1.7 billion in new budget authority and $1.4 billion in new outlays for the operations of the U.S. Senate and joint agencies supporting the legislative branch. When House funding is added to the bill, and with outlays from prior years and other completed actions, the Senate bill totals $2.5 billion in budget authority and $2.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2000. 
   The bill is $23 million in BA and $20 million in outlays below the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. I commend the managers of the bill for their diligent work, and I urge the adoption of the bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the compromise Y2K liability bill before the Senate today. 
   I want to commend my colleagues who have worked hard to put the Senate in position to pass this important legislation. 
   After working for years to enact securities litigation reform, I know how tough it is to battle the trial lawyers. In fact, many of the same entrepreneurial lawyers who specialize in securities class actions have already begun to file Y2K class actions. 
   Let there be no doubt that being a trial lawyer is big business. In anticipation of the problems associated with Y2K, lawyers have been putting on seminars on how to plead, try and negotiate Y2K lawsuits. Nearly 80 companies have already been hit by Y2K lawsuits. 
   Y2K offers these enterprising lawyers a new litigation gold mine. If we do not pass this bill, estimates are that the litigation costs from the Y2K problem will be as much as $1.5 trillion. That exceeds the cost of the asbestos, breast implant, tobacco and Superfund lawsuits combined. 
   Our economy is the envy of the world. High technology companies have done much to fuel the growth of the stock market in recent years, and they have provided millions of Americans high paying and rewarding jobs. The average high-tech wage is nearly 75% higher than the average private sector wage in the United States. These companies spend nearly $40 billion per year in research and development. I would rather see high-tech firms continue to spend their resources on their employees and on improving their products, rather than spend money on lawyers. 
   And there is no doubt that deep-pocketed technology companies will be the most attractive potential defendants in abusive Y2K litigation. These companies proved to be the most attractive for entrepreneurial securities  class action lawyers, and I have every reason to believe that they will find themselves in the lawyers' cross hairs once again if we don't enact this bill. 
   Rather than turn our booming high tech economy over to the trial lawyers, this bill seeks to place some reasonable restraints on Y2K litigation. The focus of this bill is to encourage potential litigants to fix their Y2K problems without having to resort to the courts, and the lawyers. 
   The bill would require a 90-day cooling off period to allow potential plaintiffs to offer a way to cure any Y2K defects which arise in their products. This is a reasonable alternative to the ``rush to the courthouse'' atmosphere which might prevail without this legislation. 
   I am also pleased to see that the drafters of this bill have chosen to include the proportionate liability provisions from the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in this bill. These provisions, taken from the bill Senators DODD, D'Amato and I passed into law, are the essence of fairness in tort reform. Who can argue with the concept that defendants should only be responsible for the portion of damages corresponding to their actual fault in any given case? I guess the trial lawyers might argue with that idea, but few others would. 
   Finally, I want to say a word about punitive damages. I think the drafters of this bill have done all they can, and compromised as much as possible on the issue of punitive damages. At this point, unless you are a small business, there is no limit in this bill on punitive damages, if the plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable standard for punitives has been met. 
   In my view, I would have liked to see this bill further cap punitive damages. Punitive damages are designed to deter future wrongful conduct, but it has been shown that they serve relatively little deterrent purpose. This is particularly true in Y2K cases, where the problem is one that is fixable the first time it is discovered. Since we cannot have another ``millennium problem'' for another thousand years, I fail to see how punitive damages should apply in any Y2K case. 
   Former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, in describing punitive damages generally many years ago, noted that they invited ``punishment so arbitrary as to be virtually random.'' Justice Powell wisely has commented that because juries can impose virtually limitless punitive damages, they act as ``legislator and judge, without the training, experience, or guidance of either.'' Justice Powell didn't know about the Y2K problem when he wrote these words, but they still ring true in this debate here today. 
   While many of us would have liked to see this bill go farther in a few areas, I believe that some lawsuit reform is better than no reform at all. Rather than let the trial lawyers run out the clock, the drafters have done a fine job reaching a compromise. This bill is a reasoned approach to the problem- one that emphasizes cooperation, not litigation and puts our economic growth and our high-tech businesses ahead of greedy trial lawyers. I am happy to support it. 
   I thank my colleagues for yielding me time, I again commend the drafters of this bill, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me remind everyone that this would have been a great argument 3 weeks ago when the Senate passed, with an overwhelming vote, a supplemental appropriations bill that had this precise bill in it. A vast majority of Senators voted in favor of the Emergency Supplemental bill. So we already passed it. 
   All of a sudden, steel and oil and gas become a very bad thing. But we already passed it overwhelmingly. We sent it over to the House to go to conference. The Senate Conferees wanted their loan programs. The House was dead set against it. Because of these loan programs the Emergency Supplemental for Kosovo and Hurricane Mitch was deadlocked. The Senate conferees said, all right, let's pass the Emergency bill without the loan provisions but let's take it back to the Senate, and when it gets back to the Senate, let's vote it out and take it to conference with the House so we can finally resolve the debate that started weeks ago in conference. 
   Frankly, the air tight lockbox that everybody thinks will really tie up Social Security forever--I want to confess, I invented it, I dreamt it up. But, you know, every time we turn around now for the next 6 or 8 months, as we work our way through, where is the lockbox? Do we really have one, or don't we? 
   We will hear this ``plundering'' heard--led by the Senator from Texas--that we are plundering. If you divide $270 million by 10 years, we are plundering it to the extent of $27 million a year. 
   If you want to look at the reality of things, in order to say to the oil patch in the United States, which already has lost over 56,400 jobs out of an estimated 340,700 jobs just since October 1997. With oil patch in crisis our rural communities are dying on the vine. Those who service the oil industry in the field--not the Exxons and the Texacos--going broke or belly up because they can't get loans, we are not going to fix that.  
   But I submit that if you are worried about making loans, we make hundreds of millions in loans for agriculture. We voted $6 billion or $8 billion in supplemental emergency funds for agriculture. If you don't think the U.S. Government lends money to business, just go look at the Small Business Administration, where hundreds of thousands of dollars are loaned to small business on 90 percent guarantees. Guess what. They are making it. There is no gigantic default rate. They are being helped to get into business and succeed. 
   Frankly, from my standpoint, it just appeared to me, as a Senator from oil patch, that essentially if we are going to help other people, then I just want to try to see in the Senate if you would like to help the industry that is a core fundamental of any industrialized economy--the production of oil and gas in the United States, which is withering on the vine, and dependence is going through the roof. Our foreign oil dependence is now 57 percent. 
   Senator NICKLES mentioned the steel program of the late 1970's. It was a small, unstructured, ad hoc program. I believe there were a grand total of five loans made. We sit here tonight and equate this to an era in American corporate history when inflation was 18 percent, interest rates were 20 percent, and my friend from Texas says because that program didn't work very well we shouldn't try again. 
   That experience is a lesson, but frankly, it is irrelevant. The steel industry of today bears no resemblance to the steel industry of the 1970s. Our economy today, bears no resemblance to the economy then. Interest rates and default rates by American 
   companies are nowhere near what they were then. The failure of business to default is all over the guarantee program in America. The failure is very small, because the economy is strong and they are able to pay their loans back. 
   So Senators on my side of the aisle can feel free to vote against this measure as a matter of substance. But I believe in fairness to having passed these bills already--we committed to go to conference with the House to see what they would do--we ought to invoke cloture so as to delay this bill for the shortest period of time possible. It could be amended post cloture, but at least we won't be here killing the bill that is exactly what I have outlined--a revote on something we already voted for. 
   I am not going to argue the economic condition of oil patch, because some of the Senators on my side of the aisle, and a few on that side of the aisle, already know that the United States, in terms of oil patch, those people who service oil wells, they are experiencing a total economic collapse. If we can't see fit to put $500 million on the books that can be loaned to them, and have to argue about the philosophy of loans by the Federal Government and the default rate of 25 year ago, then, frankly, I believe oil patch has the right to conclude that we just don't care. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the drug problem which is plaguing the northern part of my home state--a problem which has had particularly profound effects on the quality of life and the health of the citizens in an area known as Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. 
   Simply put, Rio Arriba County faces one of the most severe black tar heroin epidemics this nation has ever seen. In recent years, there have been 44 heroin overdose deaths in this small county--more per capita than any other area of the country. Last year, New Mexico led the nation in per capita heroin overdose deaths, and Rio Arriba County led New Mexico. 
   Just this weekend, one of the local papers printed a story about the black tar heroin epidemic in northern New Mexico, and the reporter interviewed several heroin addicts. Two of these addicts died of overdoses between the time they were interviewed and the time the story was printed. That is how acute the problem is. 
   Rio Arriba County is a rural community with close to 40,000 inhabitants. Many of those who reside in this small county have family who have lived there for several generations. Neighbors don't just know each other--they know each other's entire families and their family's history in the area. 
   This is a close-knit community, one which recognizes that it must band together to beat this problem. Families, political leaders, community institutions and public safety and heath experts must work together in cooperative fashion to rid this area of the scourge of heroin. 
   Earlier this year, I mentioned this problem to Attorney General Janet Reno, and she committed to help coordinate the federal response to the heroin epidemic in northern New Mexico. 
   After speaking with Attorney General Reno, I later convened a field hearing in Espanola, New Mexico in Rio Arriba County to begin to bring people together at the local, state and federal levels to see what could be done. The hearing was held under the auspices of the Commerce, State, Justice subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by Senator GREGG. I want to thank Senator GREGG for agreeing to the hearing, and for his commitment to providing the necessary federal resources to begin to address the problem. 
   At the field hearing, we heard from Laurie Robinson, Associate Attorney General for Justice Programs, who has since sent a technical assistance team to the area to meet with state and local officials, treatment providers, and community groups in order to begin to formulate a comprehensive plan to attack the problem. This technical assistance team returns to the county this week to continue its efforts, and I expect them to issue an action plan by mid-July. 
   This plan will include recommendations on how the county can best coordinate local drug treatment and intervention efforts, and take advantage of new federal resources made available in recent months. 
   I want to commend the Department of Justice, Attorney General Reno, and her partners in this effort--the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), as well as New Mexico's Department of Health and Human Services, which has worked closely with the federal team. 
   Their comprehensive effort will ensure that we don't simply throw money at this problem and hope that it goes away. I believe that the strategy they produce will have a lasting, positive impact on the substance abuse problem in Rio Arriba County. 
   The strategy will include new federal resources for prevention, treatment and law enforcement, and I want to outline federal efforts to date to combat this problem. 
   In addition to bringing in the Department of Justice team to coordinate federal resources, in April, I convinced the Senate to include $750,000 in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to allow Rio Arriba, Santa Fe and San Juan counties to participate in the New 
   Mexico High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). 
   Expanding the New Mexico HIDTA will allow state and local law enforcement officials to enhance their efforts to rid northern New Mexico of drug traffickers, many of whom are Mexican nationals who bring the heroin to New Mexico through the crime corridor between the southwest border and Rio Arriba County. 
   Because a crime corridor exists in New Mexico, with the help of Senator GREGG, the Committee also included $5 million in this year's Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill for a pilot project through the United States Attorney's office in New Mexico. 
   Much of the heroin brought into northern New Mexico comes up Interstate 10 from Mexico between Las Cruces and Albuquerque. This pilot project will allow the U.S. Attorney to undertake federal prosecutions of illegal immigration and drug trafficking along that corridor. It is patterned after a similar successful initiative, called Project Exile, which significantly reduced illegal gun smuggling and violent crime in the corridor between Camden, New Jersey and Philadelphia. 
   Solving this problem will take more than just increased law enforcement. It also is critically important that we give children healthy and safe alternatives to drugs and crime. 
   With Chairman GREGG's help, the Senate Appropriations Committee has provided $750,000 for an after-school program in Rio Arriba, and increased funding for the Boys' and Girls' Clubs nationwide. Northern New Mexico has long faced a true shortage of worthwhile crime and drug abuse prevention programs, particularly for children. 
   We need to provide kids with constructive outlets for their time and energy, so they do not become the next generation of addicts. I think that our efforts here recently are going to change that for the better. 
   Finally, let me talk a little bit about treatment, because that is the most difficult problem the county faces. Currently, there are 66 treatment beds in Rio Arriba County. Yet, all but six of them are reserved for alcoholics. There is no in-patient treatment for heroin addicted kids and no detox facility in Rio Arriba. So the county has a long way to go in dealing with the special health care needs of heroin addicts. 
   To assist with the efforts, I have requested $2 million from the budget of  the Department of Health and Human Services to help expand drug treatment and prevention services in the county. Also, the state of New Mexico has provided $500,000 for increased drug treatment in the area. 
   Successful treatment programs require more than a one-time infusion of federal or state funds. Communities, state and local governments and treatment providers must work together to keep them viable and operational once facilities are established. Federal dollars can help, but the bulk of the effort must come at the state and local level. 
   A big part of what the technical assistance team I have sent to Rio Arriba County is doing is figuring out how to coordinate federal, state and local treatment resources, and how to make these treatment options available for many years to come. This is a critical component in the strategy we have begun to develop. 
   As I see it, the federal response to the drug problem in Rio Arriba County has been swift and comprehensive. We have done much more in a short amount of time than simply throw money at the problem. We have begun to build upon the three main components of any successful anti-drug strategy: law enforcement, treatment and prevention, and the Department of Justice and other federal agencies have begun the process of working with the local community to improve in all three areas in Rio Arriba County. 
   It is my hope that in a few years, after our efforts and ideas have been implemented, we will look to northern New Mexico as an example of how small rural communities can overcome big drug problems. We have a long way to go, but I look forward to continuing my efforts to defeat the heroin problem in Rio Arriba County and help this proud community get it back on its feet. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Los Alamos County on its 50th anniversary. This small northern New Mexico county has packed an amazing number of contributions into its short history. 
   Los Alamos had already completed its momentous contributions during the Second World War, when it was officially created in 1949. But the work of Los Alamos and its contributions to national security were far from completed. Few might have anticipated that the nuclear stockpile created at Los Alamos would lead to an unprecedented five decades free of massive global conflict. During those five decades, the nuclear weapons of the United States have provided time for the world's leaders to strive toward global peace. Today they still serve as the ultimate guarantor of our precious freedoms. 
   Throughout the County's history, its support for the national security objectives of Los Alamos National Laboratory has never wavered. The success of the lab is completely intertwined with the success and history of the County. As we've advanced toward world peace, admittedly with steps far smaller than all of us would wish, the County has supported dramatic changes at the laboratory, from changing characteristics of our nuclear stockpile to new challenges that the laboratory was called upon to address. For example, in 1949, most of the non-proliferation and environmental challenges that the lab addresses today did not exist. 
   I believe it is also important to note on this anniversary that the time of the closed secret city has long passed, and Los Alamos County has now become a community open to scientific and economic growth and cultural diversity. Today, the lab and the surrounding County are making wonderful strides toward becoming fuller partners in the Espan 6ola Valley and with all of New Mexico. 
   Los Alamos County and the laboratory have a wealth of challenges ahead as national priorities are modified to adapt to new global conditions. The future of Los Alamos County should be as bright as its past, and the range of its contributions will continue to be of vital importance in guaranteeing the nation's freedoms.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me thank Senator REID very much for doing that. We have all been working to try to make sure that as this week fills up with other kinds of votes, on everything from Y2K to the lockbox and other things, we be given ample opportunity to get this bill passed. 
   We worked very hard under the leadership and direction of our chairman, Senator TED STEVENS, chairman of the full committee, to get this bill ready and to get it out here as soon as possible. This will be the second full Appropriations Committee bill that will be before the Senate. If it passes in the next few days, we will be on some kind of a record in terms of our ability to get a large number of the appropriation bills done in a very timely manner. 
   For that, I am grateful to the chairman and ranking member of the full committee for the amount of resources that were given to this committee. I will begin with an explanation of how we tried to respond to the allocation of resources. 
   First of all, this is an interesting bill, interesting in the sense that it is not very rational in that you have two things mixed that are about as far apart in the spectrum of prioritizing and need as you could get. All of the nuclear weapons research and development for all of our bombs and all of our safeguards and all of our great research is in this bill. That has been and is still defense work. It is work for the defense of our country. We get money for this because it is a defense function. When we had the walls up wherein you could not spend defense money for anything else, the money that came into this bill for that purpose came right out of the defense total. 
   There is another piece of this bill that has to do with water and water resources, not as they relate to anything nuclear, just water and water resources, various inland waterways, various dams, various dikes, Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, those kinds of activities, and a myriad of flood protection projects, because the Federal Government, over time, has been a major player with the States in a matching program with reference to flood protection. 
   Then sitting kind of in the middle but aligned with those water projects are things that the Department of Energy does that are not defense oriented. We call those the nondefense energy projects, research of various types that is not necessarily or even required to be related to the defense activities I have just described. 
   So in a very real sense, it is kind of comprehensive and a mix of various funding requirements of our country that do not mesh. 
   We started from the beginning saying there are certain resources that come to this committee from the full Appropriations Committee that are clearly for the purposes of the defense of our Nation. We have taken those resources and said that all of the resources we are getting from the Appropriations Committee which have historically been for defense will be used for defense only. To the best of our ability, we have not used any defense money; that is, defense nuclear money, and defense having safe weapons, the nuclear stockpile, the stewardship stockpile--we have used defense money for that--we have not in any case taken some of that money or any of that money and used it for water projects or used it for nondefense Department of Energy work. 
   I would like to keep it that way. I have no power of the Budget Committee or points of order to keep it that way, because we, in compromising, when we put the 5-year Balanced Budget Act together, bipartisan, and executive branch with the President, had walls between defense and nondefense for 3 years, and then it was discretionary for the last 2. We are in the last 2 now. 
   I have, nonetheless, with the assistance of my ranking member, kept defense money for defense programs and not put it into nondefense domestic energy programs or in water projects. 
   On nondefense energy projects--I will just mention one--there is an amendment pending to do more with solar and renewable energy. That is not a defense activity. We have done the best we could, but we have not used any defense money for that. I hope when we see the amendment, since one is going to be forthcoming, that they followed that pattern and have not taken it out of the defense activities, because with what we know about the world, with what we know about Russia and the  hard feelings that exist, what we know about the Chinese and their moving as quickly as they can toward a nuclear empire of their own with reference to weapons--and we have agreed that we are not going to do any underground testing whether or not we pass the treaty on nuclear testing or not; we have agreed not to do any--it is absolutely important and imperative we prove we can maintain our nuclear stockpile with adequate safeguards and that it is standing the test of time. 
   What we need to do that with is the new program called science-based stockpile stewardship. The occupant of the Chair is an expert in some of these areas and has worked long and hard in the House. I thank him for a lot of the help he gave in trying to reorganize the Department of Energy, which will continue to come up even after the Rudman report today. I am sure it will be before us again. I believe the occupant of the Chair, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, has constantly raised the question, Will stockpile stewardship work? Will science-based stockpile stewardship work? Will substituting computers and new kinds of systems that can take x ray-type pictures of what is going on inside one of our nuclear weapons, even far more sophisticated than that, that knows what is going on--that is the substitute for testing in an underground mode that we have done for many decades in getting our weapons to be the best and most safe in the world--if that isn't working, then obviously everybody has to rethink where we are with reference to underground testing. 
   So I don't want to shortchange science-based stockpile stewardship. There are three or four aspects of it that are very expensive--the development of certain buildings and certain technology. We are not finished with them yet. We are maybe halfway finished. We have about half more to go, including the gigantic, new process we are building at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which has the initials NIF, National Ignition Facility. 
   The Senate is now considering Calendar No. 128, the Energy and Water Act for Fiscal Year 2000. As we begin, there is a technical error in the bill as reported by the committee. I will send to the desk, with the full understanding of my ranking member, a correction to that error. It has been cleared by both sides. I ask unanimous consent that, after I send it to the desk for reading, it be agreed to.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on June 2 the Committee on Appropriations reported Senate bill 1186, the Energy and Water Development Act for the year 2000. 
   As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the recommendation would provide $21.2 billion in new budget authority, $12.6 billion within defense, and $8.6 billion within nondefense. In the defense accounts, that amounts to a $220 million increase over the request; in the nondefense accounts--that is including the water project--it amounts to a $608 million reduction from the request. 
   For the first time in memory, the recommendation before us provides less money for water projects than was requested. We have reduced some energy research, nondefense environment management, science, and the Department of Energy's administration accounts. 
   In fact, in order to accommodate some serious shortfalls in the President's request and some very legitimate requests from Members, we have cut a significant amount more than $608 million that we are short from that request. For example, the recommendation before us restores the $81 million for the Power Marketing Administration to provide power to their customers. That was left out of the President's request, and we had to cut other programs, above the $608 million, to provide these funds. 
   As we have made these reductions, we have tried to follow certain criteria. In the water accounts, for example: 
   Where the President fully funded or provided advance appropriations for special projects, such as the Everglades, Columbia River Fish Migration, and the CALFED project, we have brought those programs back down in line with other accounts, but we have funded them. 
   Second, projects included in the budget at the capability level, in this year when we will not be able to fund projects at their full capability, have been reduced to no more than 85 percent of capability. 
   Third, items where the budget request was significantly increased over the current year's level of funding have been reduced to bring them back in line with the fiscal year 1999 levels. 
   We have not included unauthorized projects or projects contained in the water resources development bill, called WRDA 99, which is still in conference. 
   Finally, a significant amount of previously appropriated and unused funding has been used to finance the fiscal year 2000 program or recommended for rescission in order to save outlays. 
   Having said that, the recommendation for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is still at $3.723 billion. That is $182.6 million below the budget request and $374.1 million below the fiscal year 1999 enacted level. 
   Moving on to the Bureau of Reclamation, the recommendation before the committee totals $756.2 million. This is $100 million below the budget request and $24 million below the current year level. Within this account, the largest single reduction is from the request for the bay delta restoration Program, and we can go into more details on other projects. 
   From the Department of Energy's nondefense accounts, we have proposed--because we don't have sufficient money--some substantial reductions from the President's request. 
   For example, the recommendation for solar and renewable energy is $348.9 million. That is $3.4 million over the level the committee recommended a year ago, but it is less than the 
   President asked for. 
   We have also gone through all of the DOE accounts and found $41 million in unobligated balances from old projects and programs, and we have gone so far as to rescind $1,000 from an old program that hasn't been around in years, to make those funds available for this act. 
   Within the defense allocation, we have been able to add some funds, because we were given a slight increase by the Appropriations Committee from that account. To the extent possible, we have tried to recognize the needs of Members with environmental management sites. We have provided increases at Savannah River and the Hanford site as well as Rocky Flats where DOE is on track to complete this cleanup by 2006. Let's hope we can stay on track and celebrate that event soon. I am well aware that more funds could be justified to increase the pace of cleanup at those sites, but we simply don't have the necessary resources. 
   Within weapons activities, we have begun a major realignment among the defense laboratories. As we have taken some nuclear weapons designs out of the stockpile, an imbalance has been created between Livermore and Los Alamos in my State. To ensure that balance is retained between them, we have transferred responsibility for one warhead design from Los Alamos to Lawrence Livermore. We have also expanded certain operations at the Nevada Test Site and initiated a microelectronics capability, a new technology which will make our weapons safer in the future, and at the same time may make some breakthroughs for American industry and for future uses that may bring microengineering and microelectronics into our everyday lives in a very big way. 
   The Defense Authorization Act was recently passed by the Senate, and the  Intelligence Authorization Act will come to the floor next week, perhaps. It is my hope that is where issues related to the Cox Commission report and allegations of espionage at our laboratories will be addressed. The recommendation before you does not include any broad effort in that regard. It is an appropriations bill, not an authorizing bill. 
   Now, obviously, I am hopeful that nobody will offer broad changes to the structure of DOE and moving toward better security within DOE. As I say, it is not an authorizing bill; it is an appropriations bill. The extent to which we can predict the action taken on the authorizing bill so far will necessitate funding in this regard. We have made some adjustments. 
   We have increased funding for security investigations from $30 million to $45 million. We have increased funding for counter-intelligence from the requested level of $31 million to $39 million--we are proposing to more than double the funding of $15.6 million the Committee provided last year. Finally, because some have raised concerns about materials security, the recommendation provides an increase of $10 million for physical security. 
   In summary, the recommendation before you is for $21.2 billion, a reduction of $380.8 million from the request. 
   It is our intention to work, if we have to, late tonight, but with the unanimous consent agreement that was entered into, obviously we will know by 5 o'clock the extent to which we will be working on the floor handling various amendments. We will be here all afternoon. 
   I personally urge colleagues on my side--I hope that Senator REID will urge his on his side--to bring any amendments they may have to the floor so we can consider them today. 
   It is my intention to shortly--after all amendments have been filed--act on a package of managers' amendments. We will not do that immediately. We will wait a while. 
   I yield the floor and turn the podium over to my distinguished ranking member, Senator REID. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend Senator REID for his comprehensive statement. I tell him and the Senate how pleased I am that I have a ranking member who understands the importance of the work of the Department of Energy in our nuclear weapons development, maintenance, and safekeeping, because sometimes it is rather lonely. 
   Many people fail to understand the relationship between not having any more underground testing and the decision to have a new science-based stockpile stewardship of nuclear weapons. Without underground testing, with various scientific approaches and new kinds of scientific instrumentation, we are going to produce the atmosphere and environment surrounding what would have taken place in a real underground test, and we will be able to say what is happening to our nuclear weapons--their safety, well-being, maintenance, and reliability. 
   That is a big undertaking. For those who come to the floor regularly and eloquently urge we put plenty of money in our defenses, it is high time they understand we have to put plenty of money into this area because, although the regular military of our primary military adversary in the world is getting depleted and its strength is being greatly diminished, the country remains a huge owner and developer of nuclear weapons. They do not build their weapons as we build our weapons. They are far less sophisticated. That is their choice. We chose another approach. Our approach requires we regularly understand what is going on in the wear and tear and longevity of our nuclear weapons as they stand ready, continuing to be the great deterrent they are. That has a fancy name. My good friend from Nevada explained it very well. It is tied inextricably to our decision not to do any underground testing. 
   Frankly, there are some in this body, including the occupant of the Chair, who are not quite sure we should have abandoned underground testing, and there are some who maintain we ought to do science-based stockpile stewardship and nuclear testing. I heard Dr. Schlesinger testify about that at a committee hearing. Perhaps Senator KYL has heard them say that. The policy of our country is not to do that. It is to substitute for nuclear testing, scientific knowledge, and scientific technology, first simulating and then acquiring information regarding the reliability of nuclear weapons--a huge undertaking. 
   Our scientists approached it with great trepidation. There are still some great nuclear scientists who are not sure it is sufficient and who are not sure at some point we will not have to go back and think it all through again. But for now, three basic laboratories are doing this. One of the lead laboratories is Lawrence Livermore, with reference to a great big project called the National Ignition Facility. Los Alamos has a piece of it, both in computer technology and in a new building and new instrumentation called the DARP program. And Sandia, the engineering part of our laboratory structure, is heavily engaged in developing the kind of computer capacity to do the simulating and make sure we are getting  the right answers in these new, sophisticated tests of the validity and consistence and well-being of nuclear weapons. 
   That is all in this bill. So Senators who are worried about defense should know a big portion of this bill is defense, unless they perceive we now live in a world when we can have defense all in the defense appropriation bill, all those subjects, and not have a nuclear deterrent and a nuclear maintenance function within our Nation's priorities. 
   If some feel that, then this is not defense. But who would dare say that to the American people? Who would even suggest we ought to be underfunding this kind of activity? 
   Frankly, the Senator from New Mexico was greatly concerned upon hearing, in the last 3, 4, 5 months, so much about the lack of security because clearly I do not want, nor should the Senate, that fear and that concern to have an impact on the maintenance of the scientific effort that we all know we have to do so long as we will not and do not intend to test any of our weapons, either old or new. 
   This is a good bipartisan bill. This is a bill that has had a lot of input from Senator HARRY REID. Of that I am proud. He has listened to our concerns; we have listened to his. There are many Senators' States that have projects in this bill that are very important to them on that side of the aisle and on this side of the aisle. 
   I believe we are going to have less money to spend, and I say this to all the Senators. We are going to have less money for this bill. Even if we wait around until the end of the year and think we can make some kind of deal with the President, we are going to have less money in this bill than we had last year. That is just the way it has to be under the Balanced Budget Act. I think we have done a good job in allocating that money, which is short, to the various functions of Government within this bill. We have not shortchanged our defense preparedness, as it pertains to nuclear weapons, in the process. 
   I understand that my friend, Senator REID, concurs with this unanimous consent request I will propound.

   Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank Senator SPECTER for raising this issue and suggest to him that the same issue has been raised by his distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM. Senator SPECTER and I have been speaking about that the last few minutes. 
   Let me say, in answer to the questions that the Senator asked with reference to the Lackawanna project, I will answer them as best I can, maybe not in the same order in which they were asked, but I believe I will answer all of them. 
   First, we have had to go through this bill and where we found unfunded obligations that were not going to be needed for a substantial period of time, in some instances well beyond a year, and that the project or projects would continue at full pace exactly as planned, we have decided, since we have some desperate projects that are not going to get any money, to move the money around, but that does not mean we do not intend to fully fund the project. If you will note in my remarks, I said we are not funding any unauthorized projects. The projects in Pennsylvania, including the one I just mentioned, are authorized and proceeding. They do not need any work by any other committee. They are ongoing. 
   All I can do is give you assurance that there is no intention to take these projects off of their natural course of completion. That is what the Corps says we need each year and can spend each year, and there will be $17 million left in this account, only $6 million of which is needed for the year 2000. Nobody should be concerned about that project not proceeding at full speed ahead. 
   I can assure you that is what I have been informed. I believe that is what you would have in a letter from the Corps, if you wanted it. I can further commit to you that we continue each year with these water projects, and clearly we always have substantial amounts of money. 
   Last year, the President very much underfunded projects. We had to find money to fund them. This year, because the nondefense portion of this bill is squeezed some and because the President cut some things we can't cut, we have had to squeeze some of these other accounts, some in the manner we are discussing. But there is no reason to be concerned about the projects getting funded. As a matter of fact, we may find ourselves in conference with the House, which would make available more money for the water projects because of the way they will fund things. It may very well be that they won't want to do it this way, that they want to save money some other way. We will work on that. 
   If, before we are finished here on the floor, this was unsatisfactory for any reason that you or Senator SANTORUM or you together find, I will be willing to discuss it again and see what we could do to assure you that these projects are going to be fully funded. 
   In reference to the fact that last year three projects were put together in a technical manner but in a manner that is acceptable in terms of analyzing the benefits versus the costs, sometimes called a cost-benefit ratio, that has been done. There is no change in this bill. They fit together, and they are evaluated together, and they meet the criteria. There is no effort on the part of the Appropriations Committee I chair that I am aware of that would want to change that so as to demean in priority and effectiveness one versus the other two or two versus one or the like. 
   I do not know if we can do anything more to be sure of that than what I am telling you now and what is in the law as it is now. Somebody would have to change it, not just come along and say we are not going to do it. They would have to change something. You would know; I would know. Everybody in Pennsylvania would know. It would not be easy to do.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator KENNEDY, I commend him for what he is doing. I remind the Senate that the last time I looked, this bill had 33 Republicans on it and was led on the Senate side by the chairman of the Finance Committee. He is one of the leaders, not just Senator JEFFORDS from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   Frankly, what has happened is, though we pass laws with reference to helping people who are disabled, either because of physical disabilities or mental disabilities, a lot of our terribly mentally handicapped do participate in disability programs. 
    What they do not participate in very well is the training programs for them. We are just getting that started. 
   But essentially we pass laws saying let's help them. Then we forget about them for about 15 or 20 years, which is what happened here. We find that in many respects the law has arbitrary finalization of benefit dates that hurt instead of help. Instead of encouraging that a person who is disabled go to work, if anybody is experienced with the old law, before we change it, what the people will be telling them is: Be careful, because if you try to go to work and get off, they take you off so quick and for such a tiny amount of earnings that sometimes that job finishes because the disabled do not have the propensity to have 6-year-long jobs; sometimes it is 6 months, 5 months. 
   In the case of the mentally ill, sometimes a schizophrenic works 1 month. This program, unless we change it, does not work for them, because they get taken off the benefit list too quickly. Then it is hard to get back on. So a parent may say: Let's just not ask Jimmy to go to the Green Door and get trained over here to get a job. They say: Let's just leave that alone and talk to him about volunteering, not earning money. But I tell you, to the extent we are encouraging that, we are doing a very bad thing for disabled people. 
   You will find across the board, for the disabled people, young or old, the most important thing going is for them to get a job. You cannot imagine how important it is for them to get a paycheck. It is among the most intriguing psychological things that happens to a disabled person--when they earn their own money--that you have ever seen. 
   Why should we have laws that help them but at the same time discourage them from getting a job because they may get kicked off the rolls too quickly, or they cannot get on quickly enough after they get unemployed? Let's change that and make it common sense. 
   I understand these laws are good laws, the ones we are changing. They put America in the vanguard when we passed them. They are good. But in the meantime, we are finding that nothing is as good as a job. These jobs do not pay a lot but pay just enough to qualify people under the old law to get off the rolls. So it is not as if it is rich people who are getting on and off the rolls, people earning $100,000; it is people earning minimum wage. In some instances, they even have youth jobs that are at less than minimum wage, and all of a sudden they qualify--no more aid--and they are worse off than they were before. That is what this is; the essence of it is to try to fix those things. We ought to fix them. 
   It does not belong on this bill that Senator REID and I are managing. Senator KENNEDY has not said it does. But, look, if you cannot resolve it, we are going to do what has to happen here. I hope the Republican leadership would get together--actually, they are in the forefront. I am assuming that the chairman of the Finance Committee is not here today. He would probably be here. He wants to make sure it is done right. He has to find offsets, does he not? There are offsets. 
   This bill is going to be neutral budgetwise. We are going to pay for it. It is not that we are going to add to the debt, or use up the surplus or use the Social Security trust fund--none of those. 
   Frankly, I am very hopeful that our bill has served a purpose. There has been a nice debate. There is nobody here who needs the Senate any more  than we do right now. Nobody is offering amendments. We are waiting. It is all right with me if they do not. It is a fine discussion. 
   I thank the Senator. It is good to get an opportunity to comment.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, before Senator KENNEDY leaves the floor, I will just make a comment. He mentioned those disabled because of severe mental illnesses: manic depression, schizophrenia, severe chronic depression. 
   I say to the Senator, I introduced the parity bill with Senator WELLSTONE to try to get more insurance coverage resources applied to these serious illnesses. I want to share with the Senator, since we are talking about disabilities, a notion that came to me with reference to severely mentally ill people. 
   I said, what would happen if the United States, by definition, had decided we would not cover, under health insurance, illnesses of the heart because we did not want to cover illnesses of the brain? The complicated vessels are the heart and the brain. What if 30 years ago, as we produced the list of coverable illnesses, we said no coverage for heart conditions. Guess what would have happened. None of the breakthroughs in treating the heart would have ever occurred because there would not have been enough resources going into it for the researchers and the doctors to make the breakthroughs. 
   As a matter of fact, we would not have invented angioplasty and all those other significant techniques. What would have happened in the meantime is that hundreds of thousands of Americans would be dying earlier than they should. That would be along with what I just said. 
   When we say insurance companies should not cover schizophrenics, who have a brain disease, diagnosable and treatable, that we should not cover them, then are we not saying the same thing about a very serious physical frailty that hits between 5 and 15 million Americans during any given year, from the very young to the very old, with the highest propensity between 17 and 25 years of age for schizophrenia, manic depression, and the like? 
   It seems to me that sooner or later, if we are going to call something ``health insurance,'' it ought to cover those who are sick, wouldn't you think? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-6-19990614</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Why do we call health insurance ``health insurance'' and leave out a big chunk of the American population? Because the definition chooses to will away an illness. You define it so it does not exist, right? No. It exists. Families go broke. Their kids are in jails instead of hospitals. Because once they get one of these diseases, there is no way to help them, because there are no systems, because there are not enough resources. The resources come from the mass coverage by insurance. That is what puts resources into illnesses and cures. 
   So I just want to assure you, we are going to proceed this year. We are going to proceed with this parity bill. We are going to have a vote here. I do not know which bill yet, but we are going to have a good debate. We are asking the business community to get the price tag. We do not want to hear any of this business that it is going to break us. 
   We want to know, based on history, what is it going to cost? Then we are going to let the Senators and the public decide: Is that too much? What if it isn't too much in the minds of most Americans and Senators? Then it seems to me the marketplace will have to adjust to it. 
   Obviously, if I have a chance, I would like to talk about this. I would like to do it on the floor of the Senate so a lot of other Americans hear about it. I would like to do it when somebody is here to talk about the significance of this. 
   This is important business, the disabled in this country, whether they are disabled physically or disabled mentally. If we are going to have a real society that is proud of being free--and we have put so much emphasis on that--then we cannot leave out big chunks of the public with arbitrary laws or a failure to have insurance companies take care of the responsibilities of health coverage for disabled Americans. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know the numbers, but I am going to guess that 60 to 70 percent of the suicides are probably found to be caused by a mental illness, most of them by severe depression. Frankly, one of the reasons we have so many suicides is because we have not created a culture among our medical people and among those who help our medical people of properly diagnosing such things as depression. 
   One of the reasons we don't have a culture that does the diagnosis right is because it is not covered by insurance. As a consequence, there are not enough resources put in at the grassroots where doctors are getting paid for this and universities can do research on it, because it is worthwhile to the doctors to become experts in this. We are doing a little more than we did in the past but not enough from the standpoint of real mass involvement. 
   Young people in particular are the majority victims of the suicide numbers, which is such a shame. Many of those 21,000 are kids; right?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Teenagers, 31,000; they are not in the senior citizen numbers. There is a small percentage, but the big percentage are in the absolute throes of starting a great life. If we could do a better job with diagnosing depression, we would have medication and therapy preventing many of those 31,000.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Senator REID is on his way. 
   Mr. President and fellow Senators, the ranking member and I have decided that it won't do us any good to remain any longer on the energy and water appropriations bill, because we are now in the process of working out a number of amendments and apparently there is one that may have to be voted on; we just got it, and participants would not be ready this evening in any event. Everyone understood that they needed some time at the earliest convenience tomorrow, or when we can get back on the bill. 
   Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, the ranking member, we are ready to get off the bill tonight and wait our turn as early as possible in the process tomorrow. We are working on a number of amendments. There is probably one that is going to require a vote tomorrow. But they won't be ready this evening in any event. We knew that.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill before us today. I would like to sincerely thank Senators STEVENS and INOUYE for their strong leadership on the Defense Subcommittee. I also would like to recognize the hard work and diligence of the staff on this Committee. 
   Every year this Committee goes through the exercise of trying to allocate sufficient funds for the foremost priorities of providing for our nation's defense. Every year under the current funding constraints the difficulty of this task increases. This year is no exception. 
   I would like to briefly mention some of the most important aspects of our defense addressed in this spending package. 
   The bill provides $264.7 billion in new spending authority for the Department of Defense for FY 2000. This is $1.4 billion above the President's request. This recommendation meets the budget authority and outlay limits established in the 302(b) allocation. 
   In parallel with the Defense Authorization bill, the bill funds almost 1.4 million active duty military personnel. This bill fully funds a 4.8-percent pay raise for FY2000 and includes more than $1.838 billion in supplemental spending for military pay. 
   This legislation provides approximately $2.1 billion for overseas contingency operations in Southwest Asia and Bosnia. I and many others suspect we'll be forced to pass an additional emergency supplemental for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. As Chairman STEVENS has already indicated, it would be premature to speculate about those possible appropriations at this time. 
   The bill includes appropriations totaling $92 billion for operation and maintenance (O&M). This is $626.1 million above the Administration's request. 
   The bill supports the establishment of 17 Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) teams. And it provides $1.3 billion for combating terrorism. Within the funds for combating terrorism, the bill makes $79.6 million available to provide Army and Air National Guard full-time personnel to facilitate successful achievement of this mission. 
   I fully support the decision to appropriate $475.5 million for Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction programs. These are important programs that address one of the most significant proliferation threats we face today. I also would like to voice my strong support for the decision that $25 million be used only to support Russian nuclear submarine dismantlement and disposal activities. 
   I also sincerely appreciate the Committee's effort to restore some of the funding required for research, development, test, and evaluation. The increase of $2.1 billion to the budget request will help prevent the loss of scientific and technical expertise within our defense infrastructure. Moreover, this will help ensure that the U.S. maintains its technological lead in its defense capabilities. 
   The Committee also funded several items that will ensure that New Mexico based defense installations and programs remain robust. I would like to briefly highlight some of the items that received funding in the appropriations bill. 
   Directed energy weapons provide the potential of low cost per kill ratios sought for our missile defense capabilities. In the area of directed energy, $14 million will go for the High Energy Laser Test Facility at White Sands, the Army's premier facility for directed energy programs. There is an additional $15 million for the Tactical High Energy Laser program. This joint program with Israel is very important to proving the concept of using lasers to achieve defenses against short and medium range missiles. After significant cuts and changes to its development plan last year, the Airborne Laser program is fully funded at $309 million. 
   The Committee added $40 million to the Warfighter Information Network program. Based at Laguna Industries, this program manufactures mobile command and control headquarters for a digital Army. 
   An additional $7.5 million was appropriated for modernization of testing equipment at White Sands Missile Range. Also, $6 million will be made available for much needed perimeter fencing to prevent further accidents from unexploded ordnances at the range. 
   $10 million is included for the Scorpius Low Cost Launch program. A significant portion of the research and development for this program is based at Phillips, and testing of the engines and the rocket itself is conducted at New Mexico Tech and White Sands. This is an important program both because of the implications to our national security that arise from exorbitant launch costs and due to potential cost savings to taxpayers by lower costs for getting payloads into orbit for U.S. defense programs. 
   Several other Phillips based programs also received additional support, including: $5 million for further research and development on radio frequency weapons, $25 million for military spaceplane efforts, $5 million for advanced countermeasures using solid state laser technologies. 
   At my and other member's request, an additional $10 million of funding will be made available for research and development of new technologies to counter chemical and biological  threats. $4 million in support was included for the blast mitigation research of both military and nonmilitary explosives at New Mexico Tech. 
   Lastly, $10 million in additional funding was added for the Theater Air Command and Control Simulation Facility (TACCSF) at Kirtland Air Force Base. This will help a great deal in making this facility the world class training facility necessary to maintain combat readiness of our Air Force in the coming years. 
   I believe this bill demonstrates the balance required to best fund our armed forces under current fiscal constraints. Again, I am pleased by the hard work of my colleagues on this Committee and express, once again, my admiration for the hard work of Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE in achieving an appropriate spending package for our military men and women.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill would renew the withdrawal of the McGregor Range for use by the U.S. Army. 
   McGregor Range is one of six military parcels withdrawn from public domain in 1986. These parcels comprise nearly 30 percent of the Department of Defense's 25 million acres. The lands will revert to the public domain in 2001 unless Congress passes new legislation. 
   This amendment is specific to the 608,000 acres utilized by Fort Bliss and does not address any of the other renewals for other military installations. 
   McGregor Range comprises nearly 700,000 of Fort Bliss's 1.12 million acres. The Fort Bliss garrison is adjacent to El Paso, Texas, but the McGregor Range is located entirely in New Mexico. 
   Sections of McGregor are used for cattle grazing and other nonmilitary purposes such as hunting and recreation. The Bureau of Land Management manages the cattle-grazing program through close coordination with the Army. These cooperative efforts provide for efficient use of the lands as well as effective stewardship of the natural resources located there. 
   Recent studies of this issue provides a succinct summary of the most relevant policy issues surrounding the renewal of withdrawal for military purposes. Mr. President, allow me to briefly list the major findings of this study: 
   Fort Bliss has a critical role as a national center for air defense and  McGregor Range is essential for fulfilling that role; 
   McGregor Range is the only range in the United States capable of training America's air and missile defense forces. Because all CONUS Patriot forces are stationed at Ft. Bliss they depend on McGregor for the training needed to ensure their full readiness prior to deployment. 
   Successive BRAC rounds have reduced the capability of the DOD to support both current and future training and testing requirements with the available infrastructure. Range complexes such as McGregor and White Sands Missile Range are critical now and will become more critical in the future as weapons systems and doctrine evolve which allow greater stand-off distances and mobility in the future. These capabilities are wasted if we fail to train our forces to the maximum extent of their capabilities. 
   McGregor Range supports the U.S. Air Force in the training activities at Holloman Air Force Base. 
   The combined space of McGregor Range and White Sands can be leveraged to accommodate the needs of a more modern Army. Currently, the range supports specialized test operations by White Sands Missile Range which require additional safety buffer zones to ensure public safety. 
   Military training and testing requirements for McGregor Range are foreseen for at least the next 50 years based on weapons systems that are either currently fielded, such as Patriot, or are planned for fielding in the near future. Additionally, emerging doctrine and weapon systems part of the Army-After-Next will require large areas to fully train soldiers in the employment of these weapons systems. If the requirement is known for the next fifty years, then it is unclear why a shorter withdrawal period is reasonable. 
   The BLM's 1986 Wilderness Study made a ``No Wilderness'' recommendation regarding the Culp Canyon WSA. This recommendation was ``based on the low-quality wilderness value of the WSA and the potential conflicts with associated military use of the area.'' Without this portion of the range, the Army's ability to conduct Patriot and related air and missile defense training will be reduced by approximately one-third. 
   There is strong regional support for this renewal. 176 public comments expressed support for the Army's preferred alternative. An additional 26 expressed support for one of the other alternatives. 
   The Army's proposal will continue historic non-military uses of the range which include livestock grazing and hunting for 50 years. 
   The Army has already met its obligations with respect to performing an Environmental Impact Statement, holding public hearings, and submission of request for renewal to the Administration. 
   In sum, all of the legal requirements set forth by Congress have been met. Congressional action is now required to ensure that the Army retains its ability to test, simulate, and train for missions at Fort Bliss. Allowing the Army's continued access to these lands is critical to adequate training and readiness now and in the future. 
   One of the fundamental duties of Congress is the maintenance of the national defense. Nothing is more fundamental than the provision of training ranges, such as McGregor, in maintaining a trained and prepared military.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 1122, the Defense appropriations bill for FY 2000. As scored with adjustments, the pending bill provides $264.9 billion in total budget authority and $176.9 billion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related activities. When adjusted for outlays from prior years and other actions, the bill totals $263.9 billion in BA and $254.6 billion in outlays. 
   There are some major elements to this bill that are important for the Senate for review. 
   The bill is consistent with the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement and the discretionary spending cap. In fact, in both budget authority and outlays the bill is below the amount that the Congressional Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2000 would contemplate for the Defense Subcommittee's allocation. This is in recognition of the fact that readiness items originally planned for fiscal year 2000 were accelerated into fiscal year 1999 in the 1999 Emergency Kosovo Supplemental, which the President has signed into law. 
   As a result, for budget authority, this bill is $3.1 billion below the allocation originally contemplated for it; for outlays it is $2.2 billion below. Because of this situation, the allocation approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee for defense has been reduced and held for subsequent reallocation. 
   In addition, this year the defense budget is once again confronted with a serious mismatch between the DOD/OMB and the CBO estimates of the outlays needed to execute the programs in the budget request. CBO's estimate of outlays was $10.5 billion higher than OMB and DOD's estimate. 
   Because the President's proposed budget was over the discretionary cap by such a larch amount, compensating for the OMB and DOD undercount of outlays would require very large reductions in manpower, procurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that are simply not acceptable, especially in view of the conflict in the Balkans. To enable this bill to be considered on a basis commensurate with the President's request, an outlay adjustment of that size is included in the scoring of this bill. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has assured me that this action reduces the 2000 outlays shortage to manageable dimensions and avoids the negative effect on readiness or modernization that would otherwise be necessary. 
   I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to compliment the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his very skillful handling of this important legislation and for his statesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling issues in this year's defense budget.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN. He can rest assured that we intend to answer any questions he might have, debate any amendments he might have, and do this in a way that all of us can feel is right. 
   Nobody was more saddened than this Senator when the Cox report was issued and when many of the facts broke in the New York Times and other newspapers about a Chinese espionage effort. 
   I have been working with these Labs for a long time. I believe we are very fortunate as a people to have these National Laboratories in our midst. Looking at the science they practice, the technology they develop, and the way they have protected and preserved our nuclear options during a long cold war, with a formidable opponent who chose another route in terms of making nuclear weapons but is nonetheless formidable both in capacity and number, we are very fortunate that up until this time in history, with a few times when it wasn't true, almost without limit the very best scientists in America cherished working at one of these three great Labs and at the defense portion of the Lab in Tennessee at Oak Ridge. Great scientists, great Nobel laureates serving America well. 
   The problem now is, it has become obvious that for a long time, with the biggest emphasis here in the last 3 or 4 years, the Chinese, the People's Republic of China, and their spies and cohorts have engaged in a solid effort on many fronts to extract as many secrets as they could from these Laboratories. We now know there is a high probability that they have succeeded and that our children in the future will have a much more formidable Communist Chinese leadership confronting the world with a much more formidable set of rockets, delivery systems, and nuclear weapons. 
   All of their sabotage did not occur, all of their efforts to spy did not occur, at just the Laboratories. They have had a concerted effort across our land. But there is an adage that says, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The counter one to that is, if it is broke, fix it. Frankly, before the day is out, as I attempt to answer questions about this approach, I will read to the Senate reams of reports, many of which have occurred in the last 4 or 5 years, telling us that we must change the way we manage the nuclear defense part of the Department of Energy. Now we have a reason to do it and a reason to get on with that business. 
   Frankly, I have struggled mightily to try to figure out what is the best approach under these circumstances. I am firmly convinced that with the assault on the Laboratories and our scientists that is coming from the Congress and coming from across this land, we had better take a giant step right now to move in the right direction and to assure people and assure the Laboratories that we are not going to do anything to hurt their science base and their professionalism and their capacity to stay on the cutting edge for us and our children and our future. 
   The Laboratories, under this proposal, will retain their multiple-use approach. They can do work beyond and outside of what they do for the nuclear deterrent part of this bill. 
   I am very disturbed when I hear that the President of the United States is against this, that he may have even made a few phone calls. I figured those are coming because his trusted friend, the Secretary, who is also my friend, Bill Richardson, wants to make all of the changes in the Department part of an administrative change. 
   Let me say loud and clear, as good as he is, as hard as he is trying, as much autonomy as the President gives him, the Secretary of Energy cannot fix this problem without congressional help. That is what we are trying to do here today. We are trying to fix something so our nuclear deterrent will have a better chance of remaining the best in the world and as free as humanly possible from espionage and spying. 
   Frankly, before the afternoon is finished, I will read excerpts from three reports in the past 5 years just crying out to fix it. 
   We piled together various functions and put them in the Energy Department. We created a bunch of rules within the Department that do not distinguish between the management of nuclear deterrent affairs and the management of such things as refrigerator efficiency research. They are all in the same boat, all subject to the same management team, hundreds of functions that have nothing to do with nuclear deterrence. Yet security was left in a position where the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing. 
   And if you look at how it is structured, you can probably figure out that there is some justification for it being in such a state of chaos. There is not enough focus on the seriousness of the issue. Even when signs and signals came forth, there have been people within the Department of Energy who didn't do their job right. There have been people at the Laboratories who didn't do it right. There have been people at the FBI who clearly messed up, and there have been people in the White House who surely didn't rise up strongly enough and say something must be done now. 
   Essentially, what we are doing in this bill is to carve out within the Department of Energy--carve out kind of an agency, for lack of a better word. It is going to be called the Security Administration, or Security Administrator, and an Assistant Secretary will run it and be responsible to the Secretary and in total charge. That one individual will be in total charge of the nuclear deterrent effort, as defined in this bill. 
   There will be an extra reporting system that Senator MURKOWSKI asked us to put in with reference to security breaches being transmitted to the President of the United States and to the Congress, as soon as they are known, by this Assistant Secretary who is totally in charge of this new administration within the Department of Energy. They will have their rules and regulations, and they will conduct the affairs singularly and purposefully to make sure our nuclear deterrent is handled correctly and that the security apparatus is done efficiently and appropriately. 
   Once again, I say to the Senators on the other side of the aisle, including my friend Senator BINGAMAN, and the Secretary of Energy, who, obviously, is working hard to defeat this amendment, we ought not to defeat this amendment. If you have some constructive changes, let's get them before us. We ought to send to that conference at least something that is much more formidable and apt to do the job than we have done in this bill, because we are apt to find some very serious suggestions coming from the House. 
   If this bill goes there with no serious changes in the Department of Energy, they are apt to be changed by the House. We ought to have our input, and I am very proud that every chairman of every committee on our side of the aisle who will have anything to do with this in the future has signed onto this amendment--the Intelligence Committee chairman, the Energy and Natural Resources chairman, Government Operations, and I am the Senator who appropriates the money. We are all on board asking that we take this step in the direction of real reform and that we can go home saying this defense bill, when it finally comes out, may indeed start us down a path that not only the Chinese, but nobody will be able to breach the security the way they have in the past. 
   Now, from my standpoint, there is not going to be a perfect structure ever designed for the nuclear deterrent work, nuclear weapons work, of the Department of Energy. It is complicated, it is complex. That Department is complicated and complex, but there is nothing within that Department more important than this. I have been listening, as people have ideas about what ought to happen, and I am worried about some of those ideas. I am not worried about this idea. 
   I am not worried about this idea; this idea will work. What I am worried about are ideas that are talking about putting these Laboratories in the Department of Defense, which started  from Harry Truman on down that it was something we thought we should not do as a Nation. I am worried when this bill goes to conference and, in the heat of all this, we will do something we should not do. If they adopted this amendment, I would feel very comfortable, as a Senator, with these Laboratories. I have probably worked longer and harder on these issues than any Senator around, and I would be comfortable that we are starting down a path to make it work and yet keep alive that enormous prestige and scientific prowess that has served us so well. 
   Before the afternoon is finished, we will have more remarks. I yield the remainder of my time to the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and thank him for his efforts in this regard.

   Mr. DOMENICI. There is no need to do that. Let me say to Senator BINGAMAN, first of all, I believe that over the past 15 years--certainly within the last 6 or 7--and I am not casting aspersions in any way on anybody else, but I believe I have had as much to do with keeping the labs diversified as any single Member of Congress. 
   I believe we have done an exciting job in dealing with the cards that were dealt to us when we decided not to do anymore underground testing. And I believe what Senator REID spoke about, which has the very fancy words surrounding it--``science-based stockpiled stewardship''--you have no idea how long it was difficult for me to put all four of those words together. I used to leave half of them off. But I think I have got it now. It was a very complicated concept. It was imposed on a laboratory system that, I regret to say to you and everybody, was broken down. 
   In fact, I am going to quote from some reports--all current ones, because they go back years--saying the Department of Energy, in terms of doing its work right for the nuclear weapons part--I haven't seen an analysis about solar, but that is a little program, whether they run it or fund it. I have not seen a report in the last decade, and there are two within the last 6 years, that does not say the Department of Energy's ability to handle nuclear weapons development is not broken to the core. That is principally because it is stuck in a department with so many other things to do that are, with reference to urgency, much different and much easier and not as important as nuclear weaponry and all that goes with it. 
   Yet, decisionmakers are making decisions on refrigerator efficiency, and then they move over and make a decision on nuclear weapons. I would almost say with certainty--but I am not going to say I will predict--if they don't adopt this amendment--and we are going to stay here for a while and see if we are going to adopt it. Maybe some of you want to filibuster it. Some of you haven't filibustered yet, so it might be exciting. But I can tell you, either this model or a totally independent department for nuclear weapons is going to be the aftermath of this espionage. 
   I am not worried that it is going to be the Department of Energy managing this because I think too many people have spoken out about that. But when those looking at the management end up saying it cannot fit in a department of the type that is the Department of Energy and be run in a regular, ordinary chain of command decisionmaking, which is what I call this proposal--you can allude to it as stovepipe. I choose the Marine concept that is chain of command--I almost would predict today--but not quite--that it will be one of those, freestanding. When, finally, it is determined what I have been frustrated with for years about the ability to manage that Department, perhaps you can manage the other aspects that are not so critical, but you can't manage the nuclear part under the current environment. 
   It needs dramatic change. 
   The reason we are on the floor and the reason we are going to finally get it done is because we are scared, because now it is not a question of efficiency and how long it takes to make decisions for nuclear weaponry. It is because we are frightened that we are getting kicked to death. So being frightened, we are going to fix something. This fix is not going to be a little tiny fix as we have done in the past. If anybody chooses to say this is the most dramatic change in 22 years since it was created from its former underpinnings called ERDA, which was another department put together with bits and pieces from everywhere, they are right. It is the most significant proposal to streamline nuclear weaponry that has ever been put forward. 
   But let me suggest that this administration has had two reports, or three, suggesting that dramatic changes ought to be made, and nothing has been done of any significance. 
   Secretary Richardson, in the aftermath of what some have called the ``greatest espionage'' in our whole history, is busy and is to be admired and respected for trying to reform. But if you try to reform it, and you are the Secretary of Energy, and you are as diligent as Bill Richardson--and one who likes to run a lot of things, which  I admire him for, and one who is a good politician, so he wants to do things politically acceptable, especially for the White House and those he works for--you will never come to the conclusion that this Department should be streamlined such that the Secretary has only one person to be responsible for the nuclear weapons and they will run it inside out, because in a sense it diminishes the role of the Secretary. 
   I don't know whether Secretary Richardson does or not. But they are not in office more than 6 months, and they run around calling these great laboratories, including those in my State, ``my laboratories.'' It is just like: Isn't this great? The Secretary of Energy has this big, $3 billion laboratory, and he calls it ``my laboratory.'' 
   I did not say Secretary Richardson does that. I have not heard him. But, if he did, he would be consistent with the other ones. 
   We have a suggestion here that is probably going to make it a little more difficult for Secretaries of Energy to run around and call them ``my laboratories,'' because they are going to be a laboratory system run by an administrator within the Department, whether he ends up being an Under Secretary or an Assistant Secretary who is going to run the whole show. 
   For those who do not think there are models such as this, there are. You can take a look at DARPA. You can take a look within the Energy Department at the nuclear Navy. It is different than this, but if you want to look at a model that is within a big department where you have something structured to handle a very important role and mission, there are such models. As a matter of fact, there are experts who say this is a good model, if you want to keep it within the department. 
   I want to address two other things, and I want to read some notes. 
   First, if this Senator thought for 1 minute that the implementation of this approach would minimize the diversification and versatility of these three major laboratories to do outside work for the government and others, I would pull it this afternoon. I don't believe that will happen. I don't believe it is inherent in this amendment. I believe that if there is concern it can be fixed with language, because the fact that it is so poorly managed under this structure that we have is not what is contributing one way or another to its versatility. It is the efficiency and effectiveness of the scientists that are making these laboratories multiuse, multipurpose, multifaceted and that do work beyond nuclear work. 
   Since my colleague asked that his first speech not be counted as two speeches, which I didn't object to, I gather that the other side doesn't intend to let us vote on this. I don't know what we should do about that. I will meet with our leadership. If it is just up to me, I will debate it as long as we can tonight, and I will go home without the bill completed and bring it up and take another week on it when we come back. 
   The time is now to fix this tremendous deficiency in terms of how our nuclear weapons and everything attendant to it are managed. 
   Secretary Richardson is doing a mighty job, but he will never fix it without reorganization and streamlining and chain of command that is provided in this amendment, which is not perfect and not the only one. But this is what it is intended to do. 
   Let me just read a couple of things. This is Admiral Chiles' report, the so-called Chiles report of March 1, 1999:  
   Establish clear lines of authority in DOE. The commission believes that the disorderly organization within DOE has a pervasive and negative impact on the working environment. Therefore, on recruitment and retention, accordingly the commission recommends that the Secretary of Energy organize defense programs----  
   That is what we are talking about----  
   consistent with the recommendations of the 120-day study. We recommend three structural changes.  
   They recommend three, for starters. 
   I use this because anybody, including my colleagues and Senator REID, who has today spoken about how well the laboratories have done, would almost have to admit that they have done well in spite of the absolute chaotic condition with reference to sustained accountability within the laboratories as a piece of DOE. 
   Frankly, I have appropriated for 5 years--this is my sixth--the Committee on Energy and Water, which funds totally the laboratories, to some extent, not totally, with reference to nuclear work and to some extent on nonnuclear. 
   There were Congressmen asking that we create some new regional centers for headquarters, Albuquerque, for example, or a greater region somewhere in Texas and the like. We asked, rather than do that, that the appropriations fund a 120-day study. That was done. I am sure my colleague has that. If he doesn't, his staff does. 
   I am going to quote from the executive summary of this, which is dated, incidentally, February 27, 1997. Still reports are saying ``fix it, fix it.'' 
   At the bottom of page ES-1, ``These practices''--after describing practices within this Department of Energy as it pertains to nuclear weaponry--``are constipating the system.'' 
   I am quoting.  
   They undermine accountability, making the entire system less safe. Further, the process prevents timely decisions and their implementation. Untold millions of dollars are wasted on idle plants and equipment awaiting approvals of various types, or on investments which age and become obsolete and expensive to maintain without ever having been used for the original productive purposes. Finally, the defense program has a job to do--maintenance of a nuclear deterrent, which is not well served by the ES&H review and approval process that drags on forever.  
   That is the current system of environmental safety and health review in this Department. 
   People worry about what this amendment is going to do. 
   Let me tell you. This report says that we are not well served by that which exists in the Department now, and an approval process that drags on forever helps no one. 
   There is much more to be read in the most current studies that kind of clamor for doing something dramatic and different.  
   The largest problem [says this same 120-day study on page ES-1] uncovered is that the defense program practices for managing safety, health and environmental concerns are based on nonproductive, hybrid, or centralized and decentralized management practices that have evolved over the past decade. It goes on to say that because they have evolved doesn't mean they are effective or operative.  
   I very much am pleased that Senator BINGAMAN yielded so I could have a few words. Senator, I will be back shortly, but I am called to the majority leader's office to discuss this issue. It will not take me over 15 minutes, and I will return. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first want to say how sorry I am at the treatment of this amendment, the first major, significant effort to put our nuclear weapons development house in order and stop the espionage we have been hearing about. The American people are now very fearful of the consequences of this situation. There can be all the talk the other side wants that the Secretary of Energy is going to fix this. The truth of the matter is, the Secretary of Energy is lobbying very hard against this, even calling the President about it. I think it is because the Secretary wants to fix it himself. 
   As good a friend as I am of his, and as complimentary as I am about his work, the truth of the matter is he cannot fix what is wrong with the Department of Energy as it pertains to nuclear weapons development and maintenance. 
   Second, he cannot correct the lack of accountability among those various elements of the Department that are charged with security transgression activities. It is impossible under the current structure of the Department. 
   Some have said this is being done too quickly with not enough notice. One of my fellow Senators was saying the Chinese did not give us very much notice when they set about to steal our secrets. We already know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. We already know about that. It is not going to get better until we decide to change things dramatically and raise, within the Department, the concern about the tremendous value of nuclear secrets and nuclear weapons development information. It cannot any longer be dealt with in the same way we deal with all the other things in the Department of Energy. There are hundreds of energy issues in that Department that take up the same time of the same people, the same regulators who are supposed to be concerned about nuclear weapons. That must stop. Sooner or later something like we proposed here is going to take shape. 
   I hear some have said it is the status quo. It is the opposite of the status quo. I understand our Secretary has said it is the status quo. It is the very opposite of it. I understand some have said it gives the nuclear part of this, the nuclear weapons people, total control where they are not responsible to anyone. That is not true. The Secretary is still in charge. The truth of the matter is, if we made them a little less responsible for all the goings on in this monster department, we would all be better off. So in that regard, we will take some credit for that. 
   There are others who suggest this has not previously been thought of in this way. I want to read from a 1990 report of the Defense Committee in the House.  
   We concur with the recommendation of the Clark task force group to ``strengthen DOD's management attention to national security responsibilities.'' These steps should include raising the stature of nuclear weapons programs management within DOE, for example by establishing a separate organizational entity and administration with a clearly enunciated budget, reporting directly to the Secretary.  
   That is precisely what we have done. 
   I want to close tonight by saying this issue will be revisited. We can say to the Secretary and the Democratic whip, and those on that side who would not let us vote--who did not bother to try to amend this, just decided they would threaten a filibuster and be prepared to do it--that they have not seen the last day of this approach. Because it is imperative, if our 
   country is going to do justice to the future and be fair with our children and their children, we cannot continue down the path we have been on with reference to nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons design and development. We must do better. 
   If you were to design a system calculated to give the most important and most effective part of the Department the least attention, that is what you would do. You would do it like we are doing it. 
   Or if you were to decide that the most important function for our future should be treated along with other functions that are rather irrelevant to our future, you would design this Department and you would be here fighting this amendment because you would have that situation that I just described right on top of the most important function of the Department of Energy. 
   So, with a lot of care and attention, I worked on this. I will continue to work on it. I know a lot about it, but I do not assume that I know more than other people. We ought to all work on it. But I suggest to the President and to Secretary Richardson, they better get with suggesting to Congress some real ways that we can be involved in stopping what has been going on in the Department of Energy on both fronts, the sabotage and the stealing of secrets, which we will never correct unless we change the structure, making the nuclear weapons system the most important function of the Department of Energy, bar none, second to none, at the highest elevation, not fettered or burdened by all these other functions of the Department. 
   If you can imagine that the bureaucracy within that Department worries about--I said a couple times on the floor--refrigerators and their ability to be more energy efficient, and those who worry about that are the same group of people who worry about the same kind of things as pertains to nuclear energy. They do not belong in the same league. They should be separated. 
   Our suggestion, for accountability and more direct reporting, more opportunity for committees in Congress and the President himself to know when security violations are occurring and are serious, must at some point be adopted. 
   Frankly, none of this is said with any idea that my good colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, is anything but totally concerned about this issue. He has different views than I tonight, but clearly I do not in any way claim that he has anything but the highest motives in his lack of support for the amendment on which I have worked. 
   Neither do I think the distinguished minority whip in his remarks should have said about this amendment that it will put the national security at risk and that it will put our nuclear weapons and development of them at risk. He should retract that statement and take it out of there. If anything, any management team would say it would improve the situation. 
   I yield the floor and reserve my 2 minutes.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss three interrelated aspects of our country's security at the brink of the new millenium. There has already been discussion of NATO in this new world. We have also intermittently discussed the war in the region of Kosovo. 
   It is important to reflect on NATO's mission under changed circumstances. It is critical to address the U.S. role as part of NATO. At the same time, we must evaluate threats globally, and we must be vigilant in safeguarding our security and defense capabilities. 
   In April, we celebrated NATO's 50th Anniversary. Despite the circumstances, we had good reason to celebrate. After the horrors of World War I and II, U.S. decisionmakers sought to construct European structures for integration, peace, and security. U.S. policy focused on two tracks: the Marshall Plan for economic reconstruction and NATO for transatlantic security cooperation.  
   The creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 acknowledged what we failed to admit after World War I. Europe was and is a precarious continent. Twice in the first 50 years of this century, America fought against tyrannical and malevolent forces in Europe. 
   It is important to remember that NATO did not begin as a response to the Warsaw Pact. This primary objective evolved as a de facto result of Stalinist expansion into Central Europe. 
   Fifty years later NATO remains the strategic link between the Old World and the New. NATO achieved its Cold War mission and even now, in a changed era and very different world, NATO is a vital element of transatlantic cooperation and security. 
   We must, however, be conscious and careful in applying the lessons of the past to current circumstances. None of what I have just talked about should be interpreted as an argument for current NATO action in the region of Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro. 
   The administration repeatedly suggests that violence in the Balkans ignited the First World War. This is true. A member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Serbia, at that time, was a small nation fighting for independence within a crumbling Austian-Hungarian Empire. 
   Due to Russia's alliance with Serbia and Germany's open-ended military pact with Austria, both Germany and Russia mobilized immediately. Other than a few neutral countries--Norway, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, and Spain--the rest were locked in polarized blocs that set the Triple Alliance against the Triple Entente. 
   Such polarized blocs do not exist today. Serbai's aggression against Kosovar Albanians can and has created regional instabilities. But this would not lead to World War Three. 
   This is not 1914. Only one alliance dominates Europe--NATO. NATO can be used as a force for peace. Acting without regard to security perceptions outside of NATO, however, can lead us down a very different and dangerous path. 
   Our current actions disregarded the views others of their own security. Our actions in Kosovo may yet unravel any gains achieved in nuclear arms reductions and cooperative security alliances since the Soviet Union collapsed. 
   Furthermore, NATO's response in Kosovo has accelerated and exacerbated regional instability. We have managed to create a humanitarian crisis, while not achieving any of our military objectives. Of course, any rational person could see that an air campaign from 20,000 feet would not prevent executions, rapes, and purges on the ground. This is especially true given the 5 months of time we gave President Milosevic to plan, prepare, and position his forces. 
   One relevant aspect of today's world that the administration failed to mention in their arguments for involvement in this campaign is the impact this would have on U.S.-Russian relations. We have a tendency to believe that Russia is so weak and needs our money so bad that we can disregard their views or interests. 
   I ask you to consider two key facts: 
   as Russia's conventional military declines, reliance on their nuclear arsenal increases; 
   global stability cannot be achieved without cooperation between the U.S. and Russia. 
   The reciprocal unilateral withdrawal of thousands of tactical nuclear warheads between the U.S. and Russia may also be reversed. Russia has recently announced its intent to redeploy components of its tactical nuclear arsenal. We were on a path through arms reduction and steps toward increased transparency to addressing tactical weapons. These gains are steadily unraveling. 
   The administration never suggested that NATO strikes against Serbs may lead to a worst-case scenario over the next few years in Russian politics. Russia faces Parliamentary elections this year and a Presidential election next. 
   According to one of the most pro-American Duma members, the U.S. Administration picked the best route to influence the upcoming elections in favor of Communist and ultra-nationalist parties. In Russia, 90 percent of the public support the Serbs and are against NATO. 
   This war will have profoundly negative impact on the relationship between Russia and the U.S. for a long time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with some sadness but also with some pride, that I stand before the Senate today to recognize Austin Smythe--a longstanding and highly respected member of the Senate Budget Committee staff. After nearly 15 1/2 years of service to the Senate and the Congress, Austin will begin employment in the private sector at the end of this week. 
   Those who know Austin in this Chamber, know he is a Senator's dream staffer. Austin is dedicated, loyal, intelligent, and above all else possessing integrity beyond reproach. He came to the Senate Budget Committee in December 1983, as the committee's energy budget expert. Over the years, he gradually took on more responsibilities to where today, as he leaves the Senate, he is my staff director's right-hand man on issues related to the budget act, process reform issues, and the often arcane world of budget scorekeeping. 
   He has been instrumental in the passage of many a budget resolution and reconciliation bills over these last many years. He has also taken the lead on helping to reform the process by his work on the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the Unfunded Mandates Control Act of 1995, and the Line Item Veto Act of 1996--that unfortunately was ruled unconstitutional. He has been my key budget committee staffer on my quest to get Congress to change its appropriation and budget process into a biennial system--that work, I promise you Austin, will continue. 
   Along the way, Austin was able to find the time to get married and start a family. It is his wife, Katie, and his two young girls that have borne the real burden of Austin's dedicated service to the Senate and his country. 
   The American public is unaware of the role staff play in helping us elected officials ``to do the right thing.'' Sometimes even with good staff, we get it wrong, and of course, when it doesn't come out right we blame our staff. But if the legislation advances public policy in an affirmative way, we will take the credit for success. In truth, of course, it is to staff like Austin Smythe, who work under very difficult circumstances, long hours, and sleepless nights, that we--and indeed the country--all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude. For without Austin's dedication, and staff like him, the things we have gotten right would never have happened. 
   I wish Austin and his family the best. And on behalf of all the Budget Committee members, the committee staff, and indeed the entire Senate, thank you Austin for a job well done. We all will miss you.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and honor that I rise today to introduce a bill to extend the useful life of the Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico. 
   The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces have made immeasurable sacrifices for the principles of freedom and liberty that make this Nation unique throughout civilization. The service of veterans has been vital to the history of the Nation, and the sacrifices made by veterans and their families should not be forgotten. 
   These veterans at the very least deserve every opportunity to be buried at a National Cemetery of their choosing. However, unless Congressional action is taken the Santa Fe National Cemetery will run out of space to provide casketed burials for our veterans at the conclusion of 2000. 
   I believe all New Mexicans can be proud of the Santa Fe National Cemetery that has grown from 39/100 of an acre to its current 77 acres. The cemetery first opened in 1868 and within several years was designated a National Cemetery in April of 1875. 
   Men and women who have fought in all of nation's wars hold an honored spot within the hallowed ground of the cemetery. Today the Santa Fe National Cemetery contains almost 27,000 graves that are mostly marked by upright headstones. 
   However, as I have already stated, unless Congress acts the Santa Fe National Cemetery will be forced to close. The Bill I am introducing today allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for the use of flat grave markers that will extend the useful life of the cemetery until 2008.  
   While I wish the practice of utilizing headstones could continue indefinitely if a veteran chose, my wishes are outweighed by my desire to extend the useful life of the cemetery. I would note that my desire is shared by the New Mexico Chapter of the American Legion, the Albuquerque Chapter of the Retired Officers' Association, and the New Mexico Chapter of the VFW who have all endorsed the use of flat grave markers. 
   Finally, this is not without precedent because exceptions to the law have been granted on six prior occasions with the most recent action occurring in 1994 when Congress authorized the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for flat grave markers at the Willamette National Cemetery in Oregon.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation, cosponsored by Senator KYL, that would allow the Forest Service to convey parcels of land to States and local governments, on the condition that it be used for a specific recreational or local public purpose. The National Forest System Community Purposes Act is patterned after an existing law that set in place one of the most successful local community assistance programs under the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). 
   That law, the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, was enacted in 1926. Under its authority, the BLM has been able to work cooperatively with States and communities to provide land needed for recreational areas and other public projects to benefit local communities in areas where Federal land dominates the landscape. With skyrocketing demands on the Forest Service and local communities to provide accommodations and other services for an ever-increasing number of Americans who take advantage of all the opportunities available in the national forests, I believe the time has come to provide this ability to the Forest Service. 
   In the 1996 Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act, there were no fewer than 31 boundary adjustments, land conveyances, and exchanges authorized, many of which dealt with national forests. Had this legislation been enacted at that time, I cannot say for sure how many of these provisions would have been unnecessary, but I expect the number would have been reduced by at least one-third. 
   During the 105th Congress, I sponsored three bills that directed the Secretary of Agriculture to convey small tracts Forest Service land to communities in New Mexico. All three bills were subsequently passed in the Senate unanimously, but two of these bills were not enacted last year, and the Senate has once again seen fit to pass them in the 106th Congress. We now await action in the House. I know that other Senators are faced with a similar situation of having to shepherd bills through the legislative process simply to give the Forest Service the authority to cooperate with local communities on projects to meet local needs. 
   Over one-third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal government, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can be difficult. Communities adjacent to and surrounded by National Forest System land have limited opportunities to acquire land for certain recreational and other local public purposes. In many cases, these recreational and other local needs are not within the mission of the Forest Service, but would not be inconsistent with forest plans developed for the adjacent national forest. To compound the problem, small communities are often unable to acquire land due to its extremely high market value resulting from the predominance of Federal land in the local area. 
   The subject of one of the bills I just alluded to provides an excellent example of the problem. That bill provided for a one-acre conveyance to the Village of Jemez Springs, New Mexico. The land is to be used for a desperately needed fire substation, which will obviously benefit public safety for the local community. Since over 70 percent of the emergency calls in this particular community are for assistance on the Santa Fe National Forest, however, the Forest Service would also benefit greatly from this new station. 
   In fairness, the Forest Service was very willing to sell this land to the village, but they were constrained by current law to charge the appraised fair market value. Herein lies the biggest problem for small communities like Jemez Springs. In this case, the appraised value of an acre of land along the highway, obviously necessary for this kind of a facility, was estimated to be around $50,000. Combined with the cost of building the station itself, this additional cost put the project out of reach of the community's 400 residents. 
   Through this example, it is clear to see that both the national forests and adjacent communities could mutually benefit from a process similar to that under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. This program has worked so well for the BLM over the years, I see no reason for the Forest Service not to have the same kind of authority. 
   The National Forest System Community Purposes Act would give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to convey or lease parcels of Forest Service land to States, counties, or other incorporated communities at a cost that could be less than fair market value. In order to obtain the land, the State or community would develop a plan of use that would be subject to Forest Service approval. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I think the time has come for this legislation. In fact, during a recent discussion I had with Forest Service Chief Dombeck, he was somewhat surprised to learn that the agency did not already have this authority. I would urge the Senate to provide this needed assistance to local communities around the country.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the tragedy at Columbine High School, and in the midst of our debate on Juvenile Justice issues, I am proud to offer tribute to the youth group known as the Young Marines. The Young Marines is the official youth program of the Marine Corps League and the focal point for the Marine Corps Youth drug demand reduction effort. Its mission is to promote the mental, moral, and physical development of young Americans. All of its activities emphasize the importance of honesty, courage, respect, loyalty, dependability, and a sense of devotion to God, community, and family. 
   After World War II, members of the Marine Corps League discussed the possibility of establishing a Marine Corps League Youth program as a civic project for detachments and to create interest in the League. For historical purposes, the birth of the Young Marines was in Waterbury, Connecticut in 1958. The official charter was issued on 17 October 1965 and thereafter the program spread thought the country. 
   In this age where the youth of America has been labeled as troubled or misguided, their detractor's fail to notice that there are groups and organizations which do take the time to participate in the lives of our youth, to guide them in a world that is full of distractions, and of glorified violence. It makes me very proud to be able to identify an organization whose goals are to promote the mental, moral, and physical development of its members, to instill in its members the ideals of honesty, fairness, courage, to stimulate an interest in, and respect for, academic achievement and the history and traditions of the United States of America. The Young Marines work to promote physical fitness through the conduct of physical activities, including participation in athletic events and close order drill. Any maybe what is most important, the Young Marines stress a drug-free lifestyle through a continual drug prevention education program. 
   Much has been said about the troubles of today's youth, and recent events have illustrated what can happen when teens consider themselves outsiders or without purpose or guidance. I think it's time that we give the recognition and respect to the groups and the youth who do participate in these groups, that which they deserve. I believe that the guidance that groups such as the Young Marines provide is more effective than any legislation can possibly be. And maybe we can start producing real role models that teens can relate to, instead of offering them the glorification of violence and drug use which is so prevalent in the movies and on television. I welcome the opportunity to extend my support to the young people of New Mexico who are participants in this vital program. I firmly believe the experience as Young Marines will greatly contribute to their future success.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, which addresses longstanding problems encountered by Federal land managers first, in disposing of surplus federal property, and secondly, in acquiring private inholdings within federally designated areas. This legislation builds on existing laws and provides resources dedicated to the consolidation of federal agency land holdings. 
   I first introduced this bill prior to the end of the 105th Congress, as Title II to the Valles Caldera Preservation Act. This portion of that legislation was independent of the proposed acquisition of land in New Mexico, and perhaps more important. Again this year, Congress will commit large sums of federal taxpayer dollars to purchase new property. Before we do, however, it seems prudent to provide a framework for the orderly disposal of unneeded federal property that also commits resources to meet our current obligations to those who hold land surrounded by federal property. 
   Currently, one-third of the land area in New Mexico is owned by the Federal government. On average, across the eleven Western States, the Federal government owns approximately one half of the land. I agree that this public land is an important natural resource that requires our most thoughtful consideration in the way it is managed and used by the public. 
   To best conserve our existing national treasures for future use and enjoyment, we must devise, with the concurrence of other members of Congress and the President, a definite plan and timetable to dispose of surplus land through sale or exchange into private, or State and local government ownership. 
   The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act provides for the orderly disposition of unneeded Federal property on a state by state basis. It also addresses the problem of what are known as ``inholdings'' within federally managed areas. These interrelated problems give rise to an interrelated solution proposed in this legislation. 
   There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately owned land trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management units, including national parks, national forests, national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. In many cases, the location of these tracts, referred to as inholdings, makes the exercise of private property rights difficult for the land owner. In addition, management of the public land is made more cumbersome for the Federal managers. 
   There are also cases where inholders have been waiting generations for the federal government to set aside funding and prioritize the acquisition of their property. With rapidly growing public demand for the use of public land, it is increasingly difficult for federal managers to address problems created by inholdings in many areas. 
   This legislation directs the Department of the Interior to identify inholdings existing within Federal land management units that landowners that have indicated a desire to sell to the Federal government. Inholdings will only be considered for acquisition by the Secretary of Interior if, after public notice, landowners indicate their willingness to sell. The Secretary will then establish a priority for their acquisition considering, among other factors, those which have existed as inholdings for the longest time. 
   Additionally, this legislation authorizes the use of the proceeds generated from sale of land no longer needed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to purchase these inholdings from willing sellers. This will enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies to work cooperatively with private land owners, and with State and local governments, to consolidate the ownership of public and private land in a manner that would allow for better overall resource management. 
   There is an abundance of public domain land that the BLM has determined it no longer needs to fulfil its mission. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), the BLM has identified an estimated four to six million acres of public domain land for disposal, with public input and consultation with State and local governments as required by law. 
   Let me state this very clearly--the BLM already has authority under an existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell land out of Federal ownership. Through its public process for land use planning, when the agency has determined that certain land would be more useful to the public under private or local governmental control, it is already authorized to dispose of this land, either by sale or exchange. This legislation maintains every aspect of existing law. It also provides an orderly process, and sufficient resources, for the BLM to exercise it. 
   The sale or exchange of land which I have often referred to as ``surplus,'' would be beneficial to local communities, adjoining land owners, and BLM land mangers, alike. First, it would allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate resource management. Second, it would contribute to administrative efficiency within federal land management units, by allowing for better allocation of fiscal and human resources within the agency. Finally, in certain locations, the sale of public land which has been identified for disposal is the best way for the public to realize a fair value for this land. 
   The problem is that an orderly process for the efficient disposition of lands identified for disposal does not currently exist. This legislation corrects that problem by directing the BLM to fulfil all legal requirements for the transfer of land out of Federal ownership, and providing a dedicated source of funding generated from the sale of this land to continue this process. 
   I want to make it clear that this program will in no way detract from other programs with similar purposes. The bill clearly states that proceeds generated from the disposal of public land, and dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings, will supplement, and not replace, funds appropriated for that purpose through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In addition, the bill states that the BLM should rely on non-Federal entities to conduct appraisals and other research required for the sale or exchange of this land, allowing for the least disruption of existing land and resource management programs. 
   This bill has been a long time in the making. For over a year, now, I have been working with and talking to knowledgeable people, both inside and outside of the current administration, to develop many of the ideas embodied in this bill. Prior to adjournment of the 105th Congress, my staff and I worked closely with the administration on this legislation. I have since received additional comments from the  Interior Department, and have included many of their suggestions into this bill. 
   I feel comfortable in stating that by working together, we have reached agreement in principle on the best way to proceed with these very important issues involving the management of public land resources, namely, the disposition of surplus public land in combination with a program to address problems associated with inholdings within our Federal land management units. 
   I look forward to hearings on this matter, and anticipate that most of my fellow Senators will agree that Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act logically addresses this management issue. I believe that in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the American people that we truly have accomplished a great and innovative thing with this legislation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators KENNEDY, MCCAIN, HATCH, HUTCHISON, DEWINE, CHAFEE, LUGAR, ABRAHAM, SANTORUM, and WARNER in submitting our Senate Resolution on ``English-Plus.'' With this resolution, we are affirming the importance of mastering the English language plus other languages of the world, such as Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and many, many more. 
   English is the most widely used language in the world in the areas of finance, trade, technology, diplomacy, and entertainment. English is also the world's living library of the last 100 years of scientific and technological advances. There is no doubt that English is as close as any language in history to becoming the world's dominant language. 
   As Americans, we have always valued our ``melting pot'' ideal. The business of this country is conducted in English, and there is much pride in the ability to speak English as well as to read and write in one's native language. Those who know English and have mastered another language or two have a distinct advantage in a more competitive world. 
   As the son of an Italian immigrant, I can personally testify to the importance of the concept of English Plus. My father did not read or write in English, yet he insisted that I learn English first and do my best at speaking and writing Italian. My parents both spoke Spanish--a skill which they found very useful in establishing a wholesale grocery business in Albuquerque. 
   Tens of thousands of New Mexico families still speak Spanish at home. Spanish remains a strong tie to their culture, music, history, and folklore. After decades of being taught to learn English first, many thousands of New Mexico's Hispanic families also speak Spanish fluently. 
   In New Mexico, 1998 marked the 400th anniversary of the first permanent Spanish settlement near San Juan Pueblo in the Espanola Valley. Many celebrations and educational events marked this important anniversary. Hispanic culture, customs, and language received much attention throughout New Mexico. More than a third of New Mexico's population is Hispanic, and the Spanish language and culture have a special place in our state's distinctive blend of Spanish, Anglo, and Indian cultures. 
   New Mexico is the only state in the United States that has a constitutional requirement to use both English and Spanish in election materials and ballots. 
   In New Mexico, 37 percent of the people are Spanish-Americans or Mexican-Americans. The term ``Hispanic Americans'' is used in our country to describe Americans whose roots are in Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, and South America. As U.S. News reported in the May 11, 1998, issue, ``the label Hispanic obscures the enormous diversity among people who come (or whose forebears came) from two 
   dozen countries and whose ancestry ranges from pure Spanish to mixtures of Spanish blood with Native American, African, German, and Italian, to name a few hybrids.'' 
   U.S. News also reported that ``The number of Hispanics is increasing almost four times as fast as the rest of the population, and they are expected to surpass African-Americans as the largest minority group by 2005.'' In the October 21, 1996, issue, U.S. News reported that ``Nearly 28 million people--1 American in 10--consider themselves  of Hispanic origin.'' By 2050, projections are that 1 in every 4 Americans will be Hispanic. 
   An article in The Economist of April 21, 1998, stresses the value of the Spanish language to America's fastest growing minority group. ``America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful resources.'' 
   In the western hemisphere, Spanish is clearly a prominent language. With established and emerging markets in Mexico, Central America, and South America, the Spanish language is a key to foreign competition in our own hemisphere. 
   As the world economy moves into the next century, it has become clear the ``domestic-only market planning'' has been replaced by the era of international trade agreements and the creation of regional trading blocs. In 1996, the total volume of trade with Mexico was estimated at $130 billion. Our trade with the rest of Latin America that same year was $101 billion. 
   Spanish is clearly a growing cultural and economic force in our hemisphere. It is also the common language of hundreds of millions of people. Recent economic trends of this decade show Latin America as the most promising future market for American goods and services. 
   With Latin America as the next great market partner of the United States, those Americans who know both English and Spanish will have many new grand opportunities. Mexico's recently hired and celebrated its one-millioneth maquiladora worker in international manufacturing plants along our border. This milestone event unquestionably shows the value of knowing two languages as manufacturing expands among the hundreds of Fortune 500 companies now manufacturing in Mexico. 
   Mr. President, I have long believed that New Mexico and other border states are uniquely poised to create the focal point of North American trade with South America. I agree with The Economist observation that ``America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful resources.'' I predict that English Plus Spanish will be one of the major marketable skills for the next century. 
   In conclusion, I would like my colleagues to see the value of ``English Plus'' Spanish in our own hemisphere. ``English Plus'' and other European languages has long been a shared value, and ``English Plus'' African and Asian languages have become very important also. In every corner of the world, foreign languages matter to us for cultural, economic, and security reasons. 
   Worldwide, we see a renaissance in cultural assertiveness where countries take greater interest in preserving and sharing their own cultural identities. As nations grow more interdependent economically, there is a parallel interest in maintaining their own cultural integrity, with language as a key linchpin of cultural identity. 
   Mr. President, our nation's potential markets in Mexico, Central America, and South America alone spell a vital future for ``English Plus'' Spanish. If we want to continue to expand our nations's cultural and economic American influence in the world, then we urge the adoption of ``English Plus'' as our national policy. We believe this approach will lead to a more prosperous and secure world. 
   We believe we should not isolate America to English only and to do that would be a big mistake. The Senate resolution I am speaking of supports and encourages Americans to master English first and English plus other languages. We believe we should add to that, but not English only. We see English plus other languages as a more sensible statement of our national policy. Our Nation is rich in resources. We want to encourage American citizens to learn other prominent languages that the world uses and that we must use in the world and that many in our country use as part of their cultural background.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, not too long ago Senator GRAMM and I stood on the floor shoulder to shoulder preparing a budget for the United States. Not too long ago, I came up with the idea of a lockbox for Social Security. Once my friend, Senator GRAMM, saw it, a few words of congratulations and a few thoughts on how to make it perhaps a little better, we stood shoulder to shoulder that we wanted to save the Social Security trust fund. Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed. 
   The Senator from New Mexico is proud of the budget that is going to operate for the year 2000, the new millennium. It is going to be a tough budget, and we are going to try to live with it. But I do not believe we should leave the floor today with a lot of Americans, if they were listening, thinking that the budget of the United States is out of control. 
   Sometimes my good friend from Texas overstates the case. And by overstating the case, sometimes, instead of being as effective as he could be, he is a little less effective. 
   Nobody looking at the budget of the United States as it pertains to the accounts we are talking about, defense and appropriated domestic accounts, thinks it is out of control. As a matter of fact, the whole world looks at this budget, the one that the Senator from Texas is saying is out of control, and says, how do you do it? You are doing so well. 
   As a matter of fact, the defense spending which is in this budget--part of the budget that the Senator is talking about--is at the lowest level and under control, the lowest level since World War II, the end of World War II, in terms of the percent of our gross domestic product that goes to defense. Likewise, the domestic spending that he is alluding to, out of control, says he, well, let me tell you, it is the lowest in history in terms of the percent of GDP. We are doing a great job of controlling this part of the budget. 
   He and I may come to the floor and discuss another issue where we might agree, but it has nothing to do with this bill, nothing to do with these ideas that he is alluding to today about the budget. They have to do with entitlements and mandatory spending. So for those who think the budget has gotten kind of big, we have to face up to where it is that it is getting its pot belly. It is not getting it from these two accounts, defense and domestic discretionary spending. That is the truth. 
   The Senator referred to families and their budgets. I noticed some people were listening to him almost enraptured thinking about their own checkbooks. To compare a family checkbook with a great American country that has a war going on in Kosovo that we didn't know about 6 months ago and expect us not to have to spend some money for that is to compare an individual American family in their kitchen with their checkbook to a country that is at war and needs money to fight the war. That is what is principally behind this appropriations bill. The overwhelming percentage of this spending is for the defense of our Nation, if that is why we are in Kosovo, because we have something to defend. And whether you like the war or you don't like the war, it costs money. It isn't predicted in the family checkbook that in the middle of the month you are going to have a war, because families don't have wars. They don't go out and buy more tanks and more airplanes, when they have a disaster. 
   That is point No. 1--the budget is not out of control. 
   Point No. 2--the overwhelming percentage of this particular bill is for the defense of our Nation. Many of us are proud that we put more money in than the President had asked us for. We thought the President low-balled the request because he didn't want to be embarrassed about this war, and so he has far too little money. We put in $5 billion more in this bill. Take that to the American people and ask them: Would you do that, or would you not do that? Would you believe Senator GRAMM's reasoning for saying 
   let's cut some other American programs to pay for that? 
   By the way, the sequester which he is speaking about, the across-the-board cut which will be done by the Office of Management and Budget, the President's people, it will not be 1.25 percent for all the rest of the accounts. Because the year is so far down, it will be almost 4 percent, 3.75 percent, or some $3 billion. Is that what we should do when we have emergencies, cut all of Government across the board 3.75 percent, not when the budget starts, but when the budget year is half over with or more than half over with, just say we are going to cut it? Families do not do that either, if you want to talk about families. They don't come along when they have all their children's bills paid for and everything else and say that we are going to cut 3.75 percent out of it and spend it for something else. They don't have that kind of problem. That is what we are going to be confronted with for American programs in education, in construction, in highways, in everything. 
   It is just not worth it, in this Senator's opinion. The longer you wait and delay this bill, the more the demands are going to be, not less. They will be more. 
   Let me just give you one more. If we are out of control, every country in Europe and every industrial democracy in the world has already gone out of this world. They are all spending more than we are as a percentage of their budgets. Their budgets are much higher than ours. And that is why we are doing so well--because our budgets are low, and our taxes must remain low.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The issue now is not whether you want to vote for this bill or not. The issue is whether you want to support a motion to waive the point of order, a very specific, new point of order; I helped draft it. It is a nice point of order. Whether you want to waive it or not, that is the issue. If you want to vote against the bill, you can still do that but, frankly, you should move to waive this so that when those people who want to vote for this bill vote for it, they are not confronted with having to cut Government 3.75 percent in order to accomplish the purposes suggested here by my good friend from Texas, Senator GRAMM.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in conclusion, Senator GRAMM makes a lot of good points. I believe we make some good points, also. I don't believe we ought to, at this stage of the budget year, adopt a point of order that will send us back to all of the Government programs, some of which many of us don't like, some of which many of us love, most of which are halfway through a year. I don't believe we ought to go back and have them cut 3.7 percent across the board. 
   One thing about missing our budget targets--the so-called caps, Mr. President--the overwhelming percentage of supplemental appropriations have been for real emergencies, or emergencies that the President of the United States asked us for and in which we concurred. That is what the Budget Act says; caps are binding except for emergencies; emergency money is not subject to caps. That is what we have here. 
   I hope we pass this appropriations bill today and fund what our military desperately needs to replenish the Kosovo war and replenish the military equipment and the time that was spent in Central America for the disaster that killed 10,000 of our neighbors in Central America. Those are predominant items in this bill. There are a lot of small ones that are difficult to justify, but in a real sense they don't really amount to the essence of this bill, which is emergencies we cannot contemplate. 
   I yield back whatever time I have.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report accompanying H.R. 1141, the fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
   The pending bill includes emergency funding to finance the United States participation in NATO military operations in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. This supplemental makes available $11.0 billion in emergency, and contingency emergency, defense appropriations based on the crisis in Kosovo and the closely related readiness crisis in our armed forces. 
   Of these funds, $10.8 billion are appropriated to the Department of Defense: 
   The supplemental provides the $5.5 billion the President requested for military operations in Kosovo and Department of Defense refugee assistance. 
   It also provides some very needed readiness funding, specifically: $1.0 billion for procurement of depleted munitions stocks; $1.1 billion for spare parts, stocks of which have reached crisis proportions for some weapon systems; $700 million for overdue maintenance of these same weapons systems; $100 million for recruiting to address DoD's retention crisis; $200 million to improve the declining training of military personnel in high priority military specialties, and $200 million to repair aging bases. 
   These are important additions that clearly merit this additional funding and an ``emergency'' designation. Some will argue that these adds for defense are too much; others will argue, correctly I believe, that these readiness increases are overdue. I have received both official and unofficial reports of extremely serious readiness problems in our armed forces. This additional funding will just begin to address these problems correctly. 
   The legislation also makes $475 million available to the Secretary of Defense for Military Construction for him to use, under proper controls, as he sees fit. Another $1.8 billion is provided for military pay and pensions, subject to authorization legislation that Congress may choose to enact. 
   Both of these latter additions are deemed ``contingent emergencies.'' The money will only be expended if the President agrees that the needs constitute an emergency and the funds should be spent for the stated purpose. The President need not spend these funds if he so selects. This, I believe, is an appropriate way to make these funds available. 
   I strongly support these funds for our troops in the Balkans and for those in other parts of the world who may soon find themselves also involved in this troubling conflict. Regardless of our views regarding the conflict in the Balkans, we must fully support our armed forces being employed there and ensure that their equipment and training is fully and completely supported. It would be dangerous and foolish to do anything less. 
   The conferees also provide $1.1 billion for humanitarian assistance to refugees from Kosovo. Congress provided an additional $548 million above the President's request to aid refugees that have fled Kosovo and the 20,000 that are temporarily resettling in the United States. This is a significant infusion of  resources to address an increasingly desperate situation in the nations bordering Kosovo. 
   I commend the managers of the conference report for including the emergency aid to Central American countries who suffered form the ravages of Hurricane Mitch. This aid is for our neighbors who faced devastation of Biblical proportions last fall. The final aid package totals $814 million for the region. 
   I remind my colleagues that the United States has worked for more than a quarter of a century to help develop democratic movements in this region. The need to move quickly and pass this funding cannot be overstated. When I visited the region in December, I was gratified to hear government agencies and relief groups emphasize over and over again, ``We want your help, not forever, but so we can begin to help ourselves and continue building stable and democratic societies.'' 
   In addition to these critical items, the final bill addresses the President's request for a $100 million appropriation for Jordan under the Wye Peace Accord. The Congress also provides an additional $574 million for aid to America's farmers following the $5.9 billion in emergency aid approved by Congress last October. It is also important to note that the conferees have taken swift action to ensure that sufficient disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is available for Oklahoma, Kansas, and other Midwestern states that have been severely damaged by recent tornadoes. 
   Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks a table by the Congressional Budget Office that summarizes the spending in the pending bill. 
   Mr. President, including offsets to some of the nondefense emergency and non-emergency spending in the bill, the net total of the final bill is $11.35 billion in BA and $3.7 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. An estimated $2.0 billion in BA and $7.4 billion in outlays will be expended in fiscal year 2000 according to CBO estimates of the bill. 
   Finally, I address an issue raised by the inclusion of a provision in the conference report concerning the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC. Because this language in the conference report attempts to change the way we treat an OPIC program under title V of the Budget Act (The Federal Credit Reform Act), it violates section 306 of the Budget Act. 
   We have consulted with CBO and OMB, and both agencies say they will not change their treatment of OPIC programs from past practices because of this provision. Therefore I will not challenge this language, because I do not think the conference report will have any practical effect on credit reform or our budgetary treatment of OPIC programs. 
   I support this bill. It is largely an emergency spending package that responds to serious natural disasters at home and abroad, and to the NATO military campaign in the Balkans and the resulting tragedy of thousands of Kosovar refugees displaced during this conflict. I urge the adoption of the conference report.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might not even take that long. 
   I want to compliment the Senator from Missouri for his proposal and just speak a little bit about a word that is on a lot of people's minds these days. In fact, many people are saying: Boy, it sure would be great if we could get responsibility back into our schools so our children could learn what responsibility means. 
   I think it would be great if we could get the entertainment industry to show a little responsibility. Some responsibility from those who make films and produce TV shows, produce advertisements, produce many of the vile computer games our young people are using so they become excellent sharpshooters, excellent killers. In fact, some of these computer games have made our children proficient at shooting people right through the head, one after another, because they learned it on the computer game. 
   Everyone seems to be saying that our children need to learn greater responsibility. Actually, Hollywood and those who produce television shows and movies, they are the ones in need of a new sense of responsibility. I do not know any way, under our Constitution, to stop what is happening. I do not know if I would be wise enough to figure it out. But I tell you, the adults who are in the entertainment industry have to, sooner or later, look at themselves and say: What is our responsibility to the young people of this country? 
   Right now it seems there is none, other than to make money. If the adults in the entertainment industry continue to refuse to produce films that are good for our young people, even if it is more difficult to sell them, if they refuse to go out and get innovative people to write the kinds of things that are salutary and healthy and helpful, then I believe they are irresponsible. I believe they need a lesson in responsibility. Instead, they hide admirably behind the Constitution. 
   I believe, if our forefathers who put the First Amendment in the Constitution, the freedom of speech that the entertainment industry hides behind, could see what they produce, what they feed to our young people, what they feed to our society under the alleged protection of that Amendment, I believe they would reconsider and try to figure some way to make sure we had a bit more responsibility built into this aspect of the American free enterprise system. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue raised by the Hatch amendment number 322, which the Senate agreed to on Tuesday, May 11. While I support both the underlying bill and this amendment, I am concerned about a portion of this amendment which is within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on the Budget. The Hatch amendment contained language which amends that portion of the 1994 Crime Bill which created the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. 
   This portion of the amendment does two things: (1) it extends the fund through fiscal year 2005 and (2) it extends the discretionary spending limits (albeit indirectly) through fiscal year 2005 for the violent crime reduction category. As a result, the amendment was subject to a point of order pursuant to section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 because it contained matter within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee and was offered to a bill that was not reported by the committee. I chose not to challenge this provision because I support the underlying legislation and I have been assured by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, that my concerns will be addressed when the bill goes to conference. 
   Let me begin by saying that I support full funding for crime fighting efforts. I am, however, troubled by this amendment because--in its attempt to ensure funds are available for these important programs it has stumbled into a series of, as yet, unresolved issues regarding the budget process: should the discretionary spending limits be extended beyond fiscal year 2002? If yes, should there be limits within the overall cap for items such as defense, highways and mass transit, and crime? Current law (section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985) provides limits on discretionary spending (the ``caps'') through the end of fiscal year 2002. 
   When the issue of the caps was last addressed during deliberations on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress decided that the overall caps on discretionary spending would end after 2002, that the defense cap would end after 1999, and that the crime cap would end after 2000. This was decided as part of a very carefully crafted compromise between the Congress and the President, involving both mandatory and discretionary spending, that has now led us to a balanced budget. Our ability to live within these discretionary caps has played a significant role in producing not only a balanced budget, but surplus for the foreseeable future. Thus I feel it is not appropriate at this time to extend only the crime cap without addressing the broader issue of the appropriate level of discretionary spending. Moreover, I fear that raising the issue of the caps at this time will unnecessarily complicate the passage of this important juvenile justice legislation. 
   I know that I do not have to remind my colleagues how difficult it is going to be both this year and next to pass all 13 appropriations bills and stay within the caps which we currently have in place for the next three years. While I am supportive of funding for criminal justice programs, I am concerned that extending the crime cap will only make an already difficult task that much harder. I might also point out to my colleagues that by extending only the crime cap and not the overall cap, this legislation has the effect of limiting crime spending for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 when there will be no such limits upon any other type of discretionary spending. 
   I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH, for recognizing my concern with this amendment and I look forward to working with him on this issue when the bill is in conference.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago I rose to speak and share with my fellow Senators an extraordinary exchange that occurred between myself and Interior Secretary Babbitt regarding the failings of the Endangered Species Act in a situation on the Rio Grande River in New Mexico. I told you that the Secretary's remarks were significant because they acknowledged that this law, however well intentioned, is not working. 
   I felt Secretary Babbitt's testimony before the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee could open the door to significant reform of the Endangered Species Act, permitting all parties to work together. I pledged to begin serious work on improving the Endangered Species Act, and I am immensely pleased today to be cosponsoring this bill with Senators CHAFEE and CRAPO to do just that. 
   I was in the Senate to vote in favor of the Endangered Species Act, but the courts are implementing it in a cart before the horse fashion never contemplated by the Congress. The focus of saving species should be on planning recovery, not using premature habitat designation as a hammer on the heads of humans sharing that habitat. We want to protect endangered species, but we don't want to unnecessarily hurt people. Tying critical habitat designation to recovery plan implementation is logical, defensible, and the right thing to do. This legislation goes directly to the heart of this issue. 
   The protection of endangered species is supposed to be accomplished by first figuring out the necessary habitat for survival, then designating that critical habitat. But the Endangered Species Act and the courts are rushing the process. According to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, recent litigation will ``strait jacket'' the federal government into prematurely designating the critical habitat for, in one case, the Rio Grande silvery minnow. 
   People in D.C. tend to forget that the western United States is the arid, ``great American desert.'' Western rivers and streams are primarily supported by melting snow pack. They change annually from roaring torrents in April to bare trickles in June, to dried up river beds in August. The Rio Grande, despite its ``big river'' title, is no exception to this cyclical flow. As a child, I often walked across the dry riverbed in Albuquerque. 
   This will be a very dry year in the normally arid New Mexico. The historical hydrographic record shows that between 1899 and 1936, long before Albuquerque grew, or the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District started to farm, the Rio Grande was dry twenty percent of the 
   time in August as measured at the San Marcial Gauge. 
   Now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, prodded by various groups, are claiming a ``new'' water demand on the river for the silvery minnow. They should assert the interest in the water needed for the minnow, but the demand isn't new. The issue, however, is how should that interest be asserted and what the need really is. And, once known, how do we continue to address the human water needs, and at what cost? 
   I believe something is terribly wrong in the way the courts are handling this situation because you may have to close down a river to human users without knowing the habitat needs for an endangered species. The Secretary of Interior is required to base critical habitat designation on the best scientific data available, after taking into consideration the economic impact of that designation. 
   I asked Secretary Babbitt whether the Interior Department had sufficient data to determine the true water needs to sustain the silvery minnow in the Rio Grande, and to make an accurate economic and social assessment of what a critical habitat designation would mean to existing water rights owners. Babbitt testified that his department does not have sufficient information, but that it has no choice but to act because of federal court orders.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, to talk a little bit about a program we understand has been accepted by the Senate for inclusion in this bill. 
   Five years ago, during the last re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Senator DODD, Senator Nunn and I included a provision in that Act to allow for several pilot projects around the nation centered on increasing character education in our schools. 
   That legislation helped foster the growth of the Character Counts movement across a few schools in a few states. 
   The amendment that the Senate has agreed to accept today will expand upon that effort. The bill provides $25 million in funding for character education through the Department of Education, including $15 million for schools and $10 million for after-school programs. 
   My colleagues have heard me talk before about the Character Counts program, where children and teachers use six pillars of character and incorporate them into their daily lessons. Things like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
   After five years, I believe that I can say that the effort to bring character education to our schools has been a success. In New Mexico, 200,000 kids and 90 percent of our schools participate in some form of character education. Teachers tell me that character education has empowered them in a fabulous way to teach and reinforce positive behavior by their students. 
   Schools which have utilized Character Counts report lower instances of truancy, classroom disruptions and student violence. Character Counts makes schools better places to learn for our children, and teaches them values in the process. 
   And it's not just the teachers who want to bring this program to our nation's children. Parents believe that it is important too. A recent survey by the Superintendent of the Albuquerque Public Schools found that 84 percent of parents felt that strengthening education programs which teach character and integrity should be a high priority for their schools. Improving character education is the number three overall concern parents express about the quality of their children's education in Albuqerque. The amendment accepted today will allow more schools to address this concern. 
   I have heard colleagues say that six percent of all juvenile criminals commit 60% of all of the violent crime in America. This bill will encourage states to treat this small percentage of violent juvenile offenders like adults and get them off of the streets. 
   It is obvious that there are a lot of very good kids out there, working hard every day to go to school, study hard and improve their lives. Character education will help the adults in their lives to teach them to make good decisions, based on things like respect, caring, and responsibility. 
   I understand that the Senate also has accepted two other Domenici amendments to allow states to use some of their portion of the $450 million Accountability block grant program and part of the $200 million Delinquency Prevention Challenge grant program to fund character education initiatives. This will provide states with additional resources to incorporate character education in their schools, if they choose to do so. 
   I have seen this work in New Mexico, and I am pleased that the Senate has  agreed to help bring Character Counts to other areas of the country where maybe it has not caught on quite as well as it has in my state or Connecticut. I thank the Senate for accepting my amendments and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will speak on our time in opposition to another subject for 10 minutes. 
   I rise today to address the issue of media and teen violence. I am sure I cannot do better than Senators who have spent so much time this month on this issue. I congratulate Senators MCCAIN, HATCH, BROWNBACK, BOND, and LIEBERMAN for their efforts. 
   However, because last year I had a personal, although long-distance encounter, with one of the more notorious characters in the media world, I thought I might share that event. First, I will start with a few observations of a more general nature. 
   First, just four short observations: 
   One, clearly a large body of research proves that the media target violence to teenagers. The movie and television rating system is too often unenforced. I urge my colleagues to read Sissela Bok's book, ``Mayhem,'' for a systematic look at the selling of carnage and rage to our youth by the media pushers. 
   Second, this issue is not new. Indeed, back in 1993 Senate bill 943, the Children's Television Violence Protection Act, was introduced in this body. Before that, we had a wide-ranging debate about television and movie violence in the 1980s. 
   So far, the entertainment industry, using the best public relations that money can buy, and by hiding their refusal to accept any restriction on their poison behind the first amendment of the Constitution, have been able to increase the violence and mayhem of their products without any accountability. 
   In 1954, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, chaired by then Senator Estes Kefauver, asked whether violence in media was destructive. The media kings said more research was needed. In 1969, the National Commission on Violence concluded that years of exposure to violence will cause the vulnerable among us to engage in violence much more readily and more rapidly. 
   I should add that CBS executives censored the script of CBS reporter, Daniel Schorr, when he tried to report this finding on television news. 
   In 1972, a massive report by Surgeon General Jesse Steinfeld concluded that a definite and causal relationship existed between violence viewing and acts of aggression. Then, in 1981, data further supporting Surgeon General Steinfeld's report was issued. This report was published by the American Psychological Association, a group of Boston pediatricians. They summarized 30 years of research on the subject: Watching violence causes aggressive behavior. That is their conclusion. To use the technical finding, there is a causal link between exposure of children to violent images and subsequent violent behavior. 
   As Senator BROWNBACK pointed out earlier, there is more and more evidence every single year that violence on television, in music, in movies, damages our children and leads some of them to act out of some of their violence in their daily lives. 
   Look at the trend lines. As violence has proliferated in the movies and on TV, juvenile violence has come right along with it and proliferated just as the violence in movies and on television. 
   Recently, at an event at which he raised $2 million from Hollywood, even President Clinton said, ``As studies show, hundreds (of vulnerable children) are more liable to commit violence themselves as a result of watching violence on television or in the movies.'' 
   Both the American Medical Association and the American Association of Pediatrics have warned against exposing our children to violent entertainment. These doctors have to help rebuild the lives of children emotionally, sometimes physically maimed by 
   elements of the entertainment industry. 
   Number 4, finally it is clear to me that the relevant committees of the U.S. Congress must continue to focus on this subject because the Congress sometimes has a short attention span, and the mind polluters know this. We have not had a comprehensive, intensive series of investigations. 
   But Congress should do this: We have subpoena power, which the relevant committees have, and should be used to compel those who hide to come forth and reveal the memos, the research, and the marketing tools they use to sell death and dismemberment to our children. 
   Mr. President, I hope that Senators will investigate the selling of movies that have the PG-13 ratings to those that are 7, 8 and 9 years of age as happened with Jurrasic Park. As Senator LIEBERMAN said recently, ``The evidence strongly suggests that Joe Camel has sadly not gone away, but has been adopted by the entertainment industry instead.'' 
   In addition, we hope that committees will work on innovative legislation along the lines suggested by Senator BOND that will simply do one thing, the one thing the industry cares about: Making it less profitable to make and sell death and hate. Only by doing that will we force change. We have tried moral suasion and it is not working, although it is by far the best solution. 
   Let me conclude, Mr. President, with a personal interaction with one of the more outspoken opponents of change, Mr. Edgar Bronfman, chief executive officer of Seagrams Limited, which owns, among other things, Universal Studios and Universal Music Group, the world's largest record label. 
   On October 5, 1998, I wrote a letter to him. In that letter, I endorsed the plea of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, that Universal Studios, owned by Mr. Bronfman, add a statement to the studio's remake of the film ``Psycho.'' 
   As most of my colleagues know, the subject of mental illness and efforts to help those afflicted, the work to remove the stigma of mental illness has been one of the issues I have worked on for much of my career. 
   So when I made my appeal I suggested that the industry merely note that in the years since 1960, when Alfred Hitchcock first made his movie, we have seen major advances in the treatment of major mental illnesses. We asked the statement also note that millions of Americans affected by those brain disorders are leading fulfilled lives because of medical research. We wanted to end the stigma attached to people who are mentally ill, and thus ask for a special favor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. About 3 weeks after I sent my letter, on October 29 I received a response, not from Mr. Bronfman, but from one of his lawyers. I ask unanimous consent this letter of October 29, 1998, be printed in the RECORD at this time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. To put it in polite terms, the lawyer suggested that maybe those of us concerned about mental illness could meet with Universal Studio lawyers to talk things through, sort of a therapy session for those too sensitive to the world. But the lawyer was clear, Universal Studios was not going to add any language that the Alliance for the Mentally Ill had asked of them and suggested. After all, the movie is a classic, they said, and critics have said so. In short, the message was, you are being a little sensitive, but do not disturb the creative genius that is at work here. 
   Then I read in recent weeks more accounts of the distinguished Edgar Bronfman. It seems he was one of the entertainment kings who refused to attend the White House Conference on Teen Violence and the Media. He also refused to participate in hearings into teen violence and marketing of violence to teens that Senator BROWNBACK held on May 4 of this year. But this time the gentleman found time to pontificate about those who tried to show leadership and the relationship between the music and television shows and movies he produces and the violence affecting our teenagers. He said:  
   It is unfortunate that the American people get finger pointing and chest pounding from government officials.  
   And having delivered himself of such nonsense, Mr. Bronfman departed to Florida to dedicate a theme park. 
   I decided to learn more about him. It turns out he inherited a business from his family--nothing wrong with that. He decided to branch into the media. He now heads Universal Studios, which recently gave us the classic, ``The Mummy.'' He should be proud. It turns out that one of his musicians is Marilyn Manson, winner of the MTV award for the new best artist of the year. Manson is the author of such classics as ``Irresponsible Hate Anthem,'' which contains the line, ``Let's just kill everyone and let your God sort them out.'' And then using the ``f'' word. 
   This was just one song on the Bronfman-produced album, ``Anti-Christ Superstar.'' I think he should be proud of what he produces. 
   I say that obviously not meaning it. 
   Even when thoughtful members of the entertainment industry, like Rob Reiner and Joel Schumacher call for real, honest review of the guts, gore, and godlessness Hollywood turns out, the distinguished Bronfman disagrees. He says that attacking Hollywood for its culture of degradation is opportunism. He seems to have a very similar view to that expressed by another Hollywood executive who said the first amendment ``keeps the Government out of our industry and lets us be what we want.'' 
   This is more than facile cynicism. It is more than merely mercenary spirit. This is the cry of those who have thrown aside all notions of good and evil and who merely want the rest of us to let them be. They want to sell whatever they can to whoever they can entice and want the rest of us to let them  be. After all, who are we? Parents? Grandparents? Public officials? American citizens? Who are we to criticize them? 
   These people should look at their deeds and be proud--really proud. 
   Let me conclude by asking simply this question: What in the world would our Founding Fathers make of an interpretation of this great document called the Constitution that claims that the glorification of rape, dismemberment, violent death is unequivocally and absolutely protected by freedom of speech? 
   The result is we are seeing kids imitating art, taking their guns to school, joining gangs, and committing acts of violence. I suspect the Founding Fathers would simply have said: Is this the pathetic pass you people have come to? Shame on you. And we would not have made them proud.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I do. I talked to the Senate a little bit lately about character education. I am putting a statement in the record regarding Character Counts, an education program which utilizes six pillars of character. One of them is responsibility and another is trustworthiness. We are all excited about this program and hoping our children will learn responsibility and trustworthiness--meaning don't tell lies, be responsible for the agreements you make, to the covenants you have, to the institutions you support. 
   Isn't it interesting, everybody says we ought to be promoting this because our children need it. Actually, I do not know how to stop what I have described about Hollywood tonight. I do not know how we can do it in law. But sometime or another, somebody has to be responsible. Somebody has to step up to the bar in the movie industry and say we ought to challenge those who work in the industry, who produce these products that are going out to our children and to our people, and see if we can't turn it in another direction. Do we have to pick the easiest prey, our children, and produce the easiest film that will make money? You know they all make money if you load them with this kind of violence and degradation. Can't the movie industry work on something better? I think that is the challenge. 
   I do not have an answer, but maybe a group will be formed and among them they will grow up. Maybe some board of directors of some corporation with a mother or a grandmother on the board may for once ask: What are we putting on television? Can we look at the programs that we are spending our corporate dollars on and see? 
   Wouldn't that be something, if every chief executive, instead of listening only to his advertising man, had a board that wanted to see what they were buying. Not only by way of advertisements, but also programs they bought? That might be a nice idea, if people started doing that, you might hear some mothers and some grandmothers and some parents speaking out.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me first respond by saying what I forgot to say when the Senator from Alabama first stood up. I should have congratulated him for the excellent job he has done on this bill. He has been on the floor when I have handled lengthy budget bills and a lot of amendments. He was there to encourage me. I think we worked nicely together. He learned some things during the budget resolution. 
   What a marvelous job the Senator has done under very tough circumstances. I commend him for that. 
   Frankly, it seems to me we need every bit of leadership we can get to assess this issue and be realistic about it. From the President on down, leaders have to tell the truth. Those people who are involved in the business of producing movies and films which our young people view, which we know are more apt to cause them to use guns, are more apt to cause them to do violent things, they need to acknowledge the truth. 
   For those in the entertainment industry to say there is no proof that movies cause violence, what kind of proof do you need? There are multiple studies that say there is a relationship. 
   Does the Senator remember when he was growing up that people would say, ``Well, if you read a good book, it is going to be good for you''? Doesn't it follow that if you read something that is not good, you are apt to learn that also? Whoever defines good or bad, that is up to them. But it is just obvious  that one cannot see all of this violence and not be adversely affected by it. 
   Just starting with that and saying let's all acknowledge that, what do we do about it? There may be a lot of different things. Certainly I do not have the prescription, and I did not say I did. But I think we ought to begin by saying that we should not get this into the minds and hearts and senses of our young people. We ought to find a way to avoid it. We ought to find a way to give them better things to view, better things to hear. 
   It seems to me the country would be so relieved if some of those leaders in that industry were to step forth and say: We just formed a group that is going to try to do that. We don't know how successful it will be. 
   They might be shocked. It might be very successful. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986. 
   This report, my first for fiscal year 1999, shows the effects of congressional action on the budget through May 7, 1999. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Res. 209, a resolution to provide budget levels in the Senate for purposes of fiscal year 1999, as amended by S. Res. 312. The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget resolution by $0.6 billion in budget authority and above the budget resolution by $0.2 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.2 billion above the revenue floor in 1999. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $52.4 billion, less than $50 million above the maximum deficit amount for 1999 of $52.4 billion.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my thoughts on the juvenile justice legislation before us here today. I want to commend the majority leader for bringing this important bill to the floor this week. 
   I think it is time for the Senate to have a full debate about our Nation's juvenile crime policies, and the role the Federal Government should play in addressing youth violence. 
   The Federal Government should provide greater funding to the States to combat juvenile crime, but without tying the hands of the States and their ability to implement new and innovative approaches to the problem. The bill before us is a step in that direction. 
   In the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, CO, this will be a particularly timely debate. But I want my colleagues to know that, in the view of this Senator, this is a debate which is long overdue. 
   As far back as 1995, I held field hearings in my home State of New Mexico to talk to people about their experiences with escalating youth violence. 
   I brought in judges, law enforcement officers, youth counselors, and prevention experts, as well as victims of juvenile crime, to see what the Federal response to the problem ought to be. I then introduced legislation based on what I heard from the experts in New Mexico. 
   And I must say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and his colleague, Senator SESSIONS, you all must have heard the same things from your experts as we heard in new Mexico. Because many of the same concepts and ideas which I heard during those discussions in New Mexico have found their way into your bill before us today. 
   Ideas like graduated sanctions, so that kids are punished the first time they commit a bad act, and given more severe punishment for subsequent, more severe offenses. 
   In New Mexico, I heard countless stories of juveniles who committed 10 or 15 minor crimes before they ever were given even the slightest punishment. It is not wonder that so many kids disrespect our justice system. This bill will encourage States to adopt graduated sanctions policies, and provide resources to do so. 
   Another theme echoed throughout the field hearings and meetings I held in New Mexico was the need to better address the rights of the victims of juvenile crime. 
   Often, the victims and their families are forgotten in the juvenile justice system. States frequently require closed court hearings, rarely notify victims when offenders are sentenced or released, and often fail to allow for restitution. 
   One issue that is critically important to a rural State like New Mexico is the need to address the Federal mandates imposed upon the States as a condition of receiving Federal funds. 
   I have been working with Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON of New Mexico's First District on this issue since the time when she served as the Secretary of Children, Youth and Families in our State. One problem she always faced was how to deal with the Federal ``sight and sound separation'' mandate, which led to arbitrary, burdensome, and often times ridiculous restrictions placed on my State's use of juvenile facilities. 
   Let me make it clear to the critics of this bill's handling of the mandates: no one, including this Senator, wants to house juveniles in the same cell as adults or to allow adults the ability to physically or emotionally abuse juveniles held in secure facilities. 
   All this bill seeks to do is impose some common sense, to allow States the flexibility to use their facilities and staffs in a rational, but responsible way. I think Senators HATCH and SESSIONS have done a good job addressing the problem. 
   I have before me a list of the 15 Federal and 7 State gun laws already on the books which were violated by those disturbed youths in Colorado. I want my colleagues to know that I think that we should do a better job of enforcing those laws already in place, particularly at the Federal level, before we consider enacting a laundry list of new gun laws. There may be some suggestions offered this week which are reasonable, and which might be acceptable to a majority of Senators. I wait to see what will be offered. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for recognizing me. Again, I commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and the chairman of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, Senator SESSIONS, for their hard work on this bill. I do not agree with every single provision, and I may offer some amendments later in the process, but I think they have done a fine job getting this legislation to the floor. And I look forward to working with them as we continue to shape the bill. 
   Mr. President, while this bill will be contentious and we will have scores of amendments, it is the right debate at the right time in the right place. I think after we have fully debated this we are going to come up with a bill that will help our sovereign States and the governments within those sovereign States to do a better job with juvenile crime policies. We do not have  a major role, but we have certainly not had a sufficient role. This bill will expand that and modify and make more responsive some of the mandates we have in our laws today with reference to juveniles. 
   First of all, there is a great discussion taking place about firearms and guns. While I do not address that in my few remarks, in due course we will have a significant debate on this. Clearly, we will all listen attentively and pay attention. We will try to do the very best we can. I will certainly try to do that. 
   But essentially there is a much bigger issue. The issue is the criminal justice system. In our land we have an adult criminal system. We all hear about that regularly. It is jury trials for serious crimes. It is whether or not to have death penalties. It is do we have enough district attorneys to prosecute. It is what is happening to the families of these adults against whom these crimes have been committed. And it is a myriad of things that apply to adults. 
   For the most part, the juvenile justice system in America has been almost mysterious, because we have been bent on protecting the young people and protecting their rights and protecting their reputations--and properly so. But I submit much of that apprehension about disclosing what crimes teenagers and juveniles have committed, keeping their records separate such that they can have the equivalent of two or three felonies and nobody ever knows about it when they enter the next phase of life--many of these things were done in a completely different era. Clearly, we have a small portion of America's young people committing crimes. The overwhelming number, as the minority leader said, are diligently doing their jobs, trying to grow up, learning and conducting themselves in a very, very good manner. 
   There is a growing number of teenagers that has become just as dangerous as adult criminals. They commit the very same crimes from rape to murder to mayhem to burglary to robbery. Drive-by shootings are not just done by adults. Many of them are done by teenagers and young people. The time has come, it seems to me, to give a little more recognition to that and to help our States and their juvenile apparatus for helping them do a better job. 
   I held hearings in my State the year before last, and I introduced a bill, along with my colleague from the House, Representative HEATHER WILSON. Many of the ideas in it which we got from our educators, from our judges, from our policemen, are in this bill. I compliment those who put it together. It moves in the right direction, without any doubt. 
   Frankly, there are young people who commit significant crimes over and over who deserve to be treated as adults. We do, to some extent, urge the States to move in that direction--and many are--to treat as adults those young people who commit certain kinds of crimes which are just abhorrent to society. 
   We are moving in the direction of making sure that the records of severe juvenile criminals are made available so that the courts can be apprised in later years as these juvenile criminals commit other serious crimes. It is not as if the first 5 years of criminality as a youngster do not count. We are moving in that direction, and I think we are moving there correctly. 
   Likewise, it is obvious that we ought to be doing some things to help in the prevention area. I am very pleased that we are urging our schools that have great physical capacity--their gyms, their recreation centers, their classrooms--to make them available for afterschool, weekend and even summer activities so that our young people have more to do with their enormous amount of spare time, other than to spend, on average, 7 hours--it is not just teenagers, but televisions in our homes are on 7 hours a day, a rather incredible number. Probably with so many of our young people with nothing to do in the afternoons, it would not be a surprise if for a substantial number of those 7 hours, teenagers and our youngsters are watching, with no adults around, whatever they please. 
   Clearly, this bill is moving in the right direction, with reference to another area which is totally frustrating for fellow New Mexicans and for Americans, and that is victims of juvenile crime. We are now finding how abusive a court system can be to victims if, in fact, the courts do not take the victims into consideration. 
   I will be offering an amendment with reference to victims which, I believe the Senate will be pleased to hear, will take some things out of the proposed constitutional amendment that was offered with reference to victims and makes it statutory. A few of those ideas were in Dan Coats' proposal. I believe we can put in rights that victims will have under the juvenile codes of our land. 
   Let me close by suggesting one other thing. Again, if we get away from the shootings and look at the ordinary daily operation of the criminal justice system for young people, we find a problem with reference to what we do with young people who commit small offenses. Do we do nothing? It is pretty obvious that small offenses repeated yield to more serious 
   offenses, and if there is no corrective action, then it will yield to more egregious offenses. Go to one of our facilities in New Mexico and interrogate a 17-year-old boy and ask him why he is there. He will say: I am finally here, but I was arrested 17 times and I was found guilty of 14 crimes, and nothing happened to me. I ended up here. 
   This bill talks about progressive punishment--little crimes, little punishment; bigger crimes, bigger punishment--but suggests that we will help with funding in the States if they have a system that, indeed, imposes some kind of corrective measure, even for the lesser offenses. 
   This is not intended to create a situation where we are just being mean to somebody. As a matter of fact, it looks like young people learn when they are corrected, when they are told they cannot do something and when violating the law means they have to suffer in some way, be it mighty small when they are small offenses, or significant as they move up the ladder of criminality in terms of the number of times they violate our laws. 
   I hope by the time we finish this bill, we will have taken a giant step forward in helping our States which, after all, do most of the law enforcement of this criminal behavior by our young people and most of the offenses that are taking place in our school systems, such as the events that occurred in my neighboring State of Colorado. Most of the authority to do something about that is not in our hands; it is in the hands of our States. 
   We ought to be helpful to the States in this legislation by not tying their hands but giving them flexibility, and where we really think there ought to be improvements in the system, giving some benefit to a State that changes the system in a positive manner. This bill has that kind of incentive built into it which is the part I put in the bill which I introduced not too long ago, because I thought it was very important to encourage States to make changes. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding to me, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since my early days as a Senator, I have worked with Northern New Mexicans who have irrigated apple orchards, chile crops, beans, and other subsistence commodities by using a unique system of irrigation that is native to New Mexico's high desert plateaus of the Rocky Mountains. For hundreds of years, Hispanics have channeled Rio Grande River water for their crops through a complex system of ditches. I first started working with these ``acequia'' associations in 1976, when we first brought their needs to the attention of the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   Water from the Rio Grande River has been carefully syphoned off to provide a basis for Hispanic life and culture for centuries. The annual rituals of cleaning, operating, and sharing this precious water have become an integral part of northern New Mexico's cultural life. Irrigators have formed alliances and cooperative agreements to meet the many water needs of the area. ``Acequias,'' as they are known in Spanish, are the irrigation ditches that have given rise to centuries of critical life support systems. 
   Much of the beauty of cottonwood trees and apple orchards between Espanola and Taos was created by these man-made acequias. In addition to watering the orchards and fields, the acequias are a vital source of precious water for the old trees that also live off this water system.  
   The historic value of this system of cooperative watering is well known in northern New Mexico. In fact, when the acequia associations and I agreed to improve this system, our suggestions were resisted by State of New Mexico agencies on the grounds that concrete lining, for example, would alter the historic value of these acequias. 
   Of course, the state agency did not want to help with the expensive and frequent repairs and annual maintenance. They wanted the subsistence farmers to do this themselves, at their own expense. 
   Working with Las Nueve Acequias Steering Committee, and their excellent Chairman Wilfred Gutierrez, we are now celebrating a quarter century of overcoming bureaucratic barriers and making real improvements to this vast system of acequias. In the past twenty five years, I have been able to convince my colleagues in the Senate of the value of acequias to the economy and culture of northern New Mexico. 
   The Congress has been accepting of my proposals. At my urging, the Congress authorized a special program to make the needed physical improvements to acequias, while maintaining the traditional cooperative relationships. The traditional leader of an acequia is the ``mayordomo.'' Mike Martinez, the current mayordomo of the Chicos ditch in Velarde was on hand to christen the latest section of improvements in late April. This event was a milestone that marks a quarter century of a vital partnership with the federal government to keep these acequias operable for the next century. 
   We are still a couple of years away from completing $30 million worth of improvements in the Velarde area of New Mexico. Miles of acequias have been greatly improved in the past quarter century. I have been fortunate to have the support of my colleagues for many appropriations over all these years. In gratitude for the consistent support of my colleagues for funding these acequia projects, I would like them to see the attached newspaper article from the Rio Grande Sun, May 6, 1999, by Cynthia Miller, entitled, ``After 25 Years, Acequia Project Finally Finished''. This article gives us important insights into the value of the acequias to thousands of northern New Mexicans. After a quarter century of improvements, the acequia users and associations can continue to rely on this essential source of water for their lifestyles, and their livelihood.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to commend a most unique father-daughter team of New Mexicans for their excellent science and engineering accomplishments. Ernie Lopez, a teacher at Taos New Mexico Middle School and science coordinator for the Taos Municipal Schools, has consistently inspired Taos students to excel in science and engineering. That inspiration is best characterized by his record of having at least one of his students at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair for 23 of the past 25 years. 
   I know Mr. Lopez was especially proud this year when his own daughter, Michelle Lopez, won one of the top prizes in this year's fair for the project judged to be the best zoology project at this year's Fair. 
   I want to add my enthusiastic congratulations to Michelle for the dedication and hard work that she has invested in her winning project. That work should lay a solid foundation for a future career marked by major contributions in her chosen fields. 
   Ernie Lopez was also honored at the International Fair, for ``outstanding accomplishment as a science educator,'' one of seven teaching awards handed out at this year's Fair. 
   It's with great pleasure that I salute this superb father-daughter team from New Mexico. They serve as great inspiration to students and teachers in my home State.

   A filibuster for some has a little bit of a negative connotation, and the remarks made don't deserve the slightest interference from anything else, just a straight up great speech about your State. 
   I was glad to be here.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing me. 
   First, I compliment Senator GRAMM on the marvelous work he has done on a very complicated bill. And I hope we get new legislation in this area before the week is out. Coming out of conference, I hope that we will have something fundamentally positive for the banking industry of the United States. 
   Mr. President, I have been in the Senate about 27 years. And I guess I would have to say, the institution of the United States for which I have the most respect is the Federal Reserve Board. In fact, I marvel at the 1913 act, the Federal Reserve Act. Frankly, I marvel at the caliber of people that have chaired the Fed and who act with total independence once they are appointed. Only one time in my 27 years have I thought that the Federal Reserve Board Chairman and the President of the United States were negotiating among themselves about interest rates and the like. For the most part, the Federal Reserve has been a marvelous institution for stability and nonpolitical involvement in the banking industry of America and for conducting the monetary policy of America. 
   I see this issue as a very simple one. Do you want the Federal Reserve Board to continue to be a major, major player in the banking system of the United States or do you want to send responsibility over to the White House? 
   When Congress created the Federal Reserve Board, there was a different problem. But we decided to create the Fed independent of the White House and keep it out of politics. Now we are here engaged in a fight, in an argument, in a close vote on sending a big part of the Federal Reserve Board's responsibility back to the White House. This amendment would allow a substantial portion of bank policy to be dictated by the White House. I do not believe it belongs there. 
   I am not saying this because of Secretary Rubin. I have agreed with almost all of his policies. As a matter of fact, I have said his economic policies remind me of Republicans and that probably is what saved the President in terms of the policies that he has put into effect. I have told the Secretary that. I do not know whether he was pleased or not so pleased to hear that, but I congratulated him nonetheless. 
   Essentially, this is the issue: Do you want to take a big piece of American banking policy and put it back in the political arena? Because no matter what we think of the Comptroller of the Currency, he is a political appointee. And it is most amazing, in the hierarchy of those who have power in America, it is not even a powerful position. It will be powerful if the amendment before us passes, because we will be giving the Comptroller tremendous control over our banking policy instead of vesting it where it truly belongs, with the most significant independent group in America's economic recovery since 1913--the Federal Reserve Board and its Chairman. I hope we do not do that. 
   I am amazed. It seems as though the White House believes that this is one of  the most important issues it has ever faced. The lobbying pressure is enormous, with different levels of White House people--not the President,--but in the White House, Secretaries, Cabinet members. Maybe it is because they like Mr. 
   Rubin so much they do not want him to lose this one. Maybe that is it. But it can't be that kind of issue unless it is seen by the executive branch as involving such power that Presidents might want to have it, rather than leave that power in the hands of the independent, successful management of the Federal Reserve Board. 
   I thank you for yielding me time, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to submit for the sixth consecutive year a resolution on behalf of myself and 53 other Senators. My principal cosponsor is Senator DODD. In years past, when Senator Nunn was here, this resolution, which I am introducing, was known as the Domenici-Nunn resolution regarding National Character Counts Week. Senator DODD is taking the place of Senator Nunn; and 52 other Senators besides the two of us have joined in this. If any others wish to join, we will be pleased to have you. This resolution says the week of October 17 through 24 of this year, and October 15 through 22 of next year, will be known across the country as National Character Counts Week. 
   In 1992, a distinguished group of American educators, youth leaders, ethicists, religious people of all faiths, labor union leaders, and business executives met in Aspen, CO. They developed a way to instill character values in our schoolchildren. The conference marked the birth of what is beginning to be known across America as ``The Six Pillars of Character'' concept. The values comprising the Six Pillars are everyday concepts that Americans across this land wish their children would have and hope America will keep. They are simply: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They transcend political and social barriers and are central to the ideals on which this Nation was built. As a matter of fact, I think they are central and basic to any nation that survives for any long period of history. As Plato once said, ``A country without character is a country that's doomed. And the only way a country can have character,'' he said, ``is if the individual citizens in the country have character.'' 
   I could speak for all of my allotted time on the 200,000 New Mexico schoolchildren in public, private and parochial schools learning about good character. About 90 percent of the grade school children, and a significant portion of the others, are now participating in character education programs that simply and profoundly bring them into contact with each of these Pillars of Character one month at a time. 
   So if you walk the halls of some grade school in Albuquerque, you might see a sign outside that says, ``This Is Responsibility Month.'' And all the young people will be discussing the concept of responsibility in their classrooms, and they will put up posters saying, ``Responsibility Counts.'' At the end of that month they may have an assembly at which responsibility will be discussed by all the kids, and awards will be given to those who have been most responsible. 
   The next month it might be ``respect.'' The month after that it might be ``caring.'' 
   This is working wherever it is being tried. A good example can be seen in the changes that occurred at Garfield Middle School in Albuquerque. The 570 students at Garfield first received their first lessons on the Six Pillars in October 1994. During the first 20 days of that school year, there were 91 recorded incidents of physical violence. One year later, during the same period, there were 26 such incidents. This remarkable difference is evidence that students do respond to Character Counts. 
   In New Mexico, the Character Counts movement has spread from the classroom to the boardroom. Recently, a group of business professionals resolved to explore ways to implement the Six Pillars in all their business relationships in an effort to spread these values throughout the community. Through this effort, parents have an opportunity to participate in Character Counts along side their kids, thereby reinforcing lessons learned in school. Promoting the Six Pillars at work also improves productivity and morale on the job, and it pays incalculable dividends in job and customer satisfaction. 
   Every year I like to highlight a particularly exceptional example of character displayed in my State of New Mexico. For over a dozen years, Bob Martin, an Albuquerque helicopter pilot, dreamed of being the first person to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon. He made many personal, professional, and financial sacrifices to plan the endeavor. Bob worked tirelessly to involve as many New Mexicans he could in his adventure, and from scientists to schoolchildren, the entire State shared his enthusiasm for the project. Finally, after years of preparation, Bob and his fellow crew members of Team RE/MAX were scheduled for lift-off this past January. However, it soon became apparent that weather conditions and equipment problems would force one of the three-member flight crew to stay behind. As founder of the mission, Bob felt it was his duty to stay behind despite his years of preparation and commitment to the project. His heartbreaking decision was an unparalleled exemplification of each of the Six Pillars: Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Citizenship, and Caring. 
   Eventually, the launch was canceled because of worsening weather conditions, and two other balloon pilots, Bertrand Piccard of France and Brian Jones, of England, became the first team to successfully complete the trip. Although many of the hundreds of schoolchildren across New Mexico following Bob Martin's quest were disappointed he didn't have the chance to lift-off, they were given a outstanding demonstration of character in action through the deeds of Bob Martin. 
   The lead institution in America that sponsors it is a nonprofit institution called the Josephson Institute. It is a small foundation that promotes ethics. In that regard, they are the promoters of the Six Pillars of Character. Wherever I go, whenever I go to New Mexico, I pick a school and we talk about their Character Counts program. 
   It is phenomenal, the way teachers love to be part of this. Some of them said to me, 3 and 4 years ago: Why did it take so long to empower me to talk about responsibility to the children I teach in the fourth or third or fifth grade? I was absolutely astounded to  find the hunger among good teachers to share with their children what it meant to be fair, to be respectful, to have citizenship.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute one of our nation's most precious resources, our teachers and in particular New Mexico's teacher of the year, Stan Johnston of Los Alamos High School. 
   I would submit, teachers are the key to America's future. Christa McAuliffe, the teacher and astronaut put it in perfect perspective. She said, ``I touch the future, I teach.'' 
   Building upon her statement I would say: it is a simple fact that the future is prejudiced in favor of those who can read, write, and do math. A good education is a ticket to the secure economic future of the middle class. As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows ever larger almost no one doubts the link between education and an individual's prospects. 
   And today the Senate is acknowledging those on the front lines with our students, the unsung heroes, their teachers. Somewhere in this great country of ours a teacher has a future leader of the United States in his classroom. Who knows; it could be one of the students in Stan Johnston's English and Study Skills class at Los Alamos High School in New Mexico. 
   My point is simple, after parents and families, teachers play an important role in helping our children reach their potential. After our children leave home each morning, it becomes the responsibility of America's almost 3 million teachers to ensure our children are prepared for the future because in our nation's classrooms resides the future. 
   Hopefully, the future doctors who will find the cure for cancer, mental illness, and heart disease are right now in our classrooms. But, most importantly we have the next generation of our country now attending classes throughout our schools. 
   In conclusion, I would like to thank you and a job well done to all of our teachers and in particular, Stan Johnston of Los Alamos High School. Again, thank you and please continue the superb work you are doing on behalf of our country.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo,'' marks an important holiday for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans alike, and it will be observed with celebrations and festivities across the United States. Contrary to a popular misconception, Cinco de Mayo does not commemorate Mexico's independence from Spain. That holiday is celebrated on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo marks the victory in 1862 of the Mexican army over a larger, better armed and better trained invading French army at La Batalla de Puebla. 
   After gaining independence in 1821, Mexico endured a series of set backs while trying to establish a republic. By the late 1850s, Mexico was in the grips of a severe economic crisis, and the treasury was bankrupt. In 1861, President Benito Juarez placed a moratorium halting payments on foreign debt. Since much of Mexico's debt was owed to France, Napoleon III responded by invading Mexico. After landing in the port of Veracruz, the French army, which was considered the finest military force of the period, expected to march through the country and easily capture the capital, Mexico City. However, a small Mexican army, under the command of General Ignacio Zaragosa, mounted a strong defense at the town of Pueblo and routed the invading force. 
   The stunning victory was short-lived, though. The French returned with reinforcements and were able to defeat Mexican forces the following year. But they were only able to control Mexico for four years, and President Juarez regained power in 1867. 
   Although, in the end, La Batalla de Puebla had little lasting military significance, it was, culturally, a watershed event for the fledging nation, and for Latin America as a whole. After seeing Europe's best army routed by a hastily gathered and largely untrained Mexican defense, European leaders became more wary of exerting military force in the Americans. Europe never sent another invading force to the Americas after this episode. 
   The victory at Puebla also instilled a great sense of pride and patriotism in the people of Mexico. They proved their military mettle to themselves and the world, and their government, led by President Juarez, secured legitimacy in the eyes of other nations. 
   Finally, La Batalla de Puebla asserted the right of people living in former European colonies to self determination and national sovereignty, and it unified all the citizens of Mexico, from landowners to laborers, in a common cause. It marks the point when people stopped seeing themselves as subjects of monarchy in a distant land or restricted their loyalty to a particular state or region, but instead viewed themselves as citizens of a new nation, a nation united under the green, white and red colors of the Mexican flag. 
   Much has been said in recent years about the ``commercialization'' of Cino de Mayo, and it is true that importance of this holiday often has been overlooked. However, to most Mexican-Americans, or Chicanos, Cinco de Mayo has a special meaning. Many scholars believe La Batalla de Puebla produced the first military hero from the American Southwestern region in General Ignacio Zaragosa, who was born in Texas. The holiday has long been a lesson in overcoming great odds through determination and unity. Today, Cinco de Mayo is an occasion for people of Mexican descent to come together to express pride in their history, and I encourage all Americans to enjoy this opportunity to celebrate and appreciate the contributions of Mexican culture.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize the contestants of the 1999 New Mexico High School Supercomputing Challenge, an impressive group of young people from my home state of New Mexico. I want to extend a special congratulations to the five Albuquerque Academy students who won this intellectually demanding contest. In addition to their normal school work and other extra curricular activities, these students--Tom Widland, Kevin Oishi, Alex Feuchter, Ryan Davies and Ryan Duryea--diligently worked on their project for nearly a year to compete in this competition. 
   For the past 9 years, High school students from around the state have competed against each other in the Supercomputing Challenge. The student's projects are done on high-speed supercomputers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory with the winners of the competition receiving an award, a $1,000 savings bond, a plaque, several boxes of software, and a computer for their schools. 
   In light of recent events in the news, it has been easy for us to focus our attention on the problems seriously troubling our Nation's youth. That is why, now, more than ever, I believe it is essential that we encourage our kids by recognizing and praising their outstanding accomplishments. These young Americans exemplify, the character our Nation was founded on and set a positive example for their peers to follow. 
   The participants of the 1999 New Mexico High School Supercomputing Challenge, deserve to be recognized, and I am proud to salute them on this worthy accomplishment.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not a member of the Banking Committee, although I have served there from time to time. I don't have an opening statement in the normal sense of the word because I don't intend to address the specific provisions in the bill, but rather to say to those who are on the committee, and in particular the chairman of the committee, Senator GRAMM, while many may not understand and appreciate the significance of the banking and financing institutions of the United States, and some may even come to the floor, as my good friend, Senator WELLSTONE, and talk about when we might get on to some business in the Senate that really helps people, that prompted me to come down and talk about something that I think is very, very people-oriented. 
   As a matter of fact, I have given a number of talks to fellow Americans. When I have asked, what do you think is the most significant thing institutionally about the United States that contributes to the opportunities we have in our daily lives to live better lives? Then I answer for them and say, it is the financing system in the United States. 
   There is no doubt about what helps the average man buy a car, buy a house, make renovations to his house, perhaps even buy a second cabin, or a second car for his children, those things which, when added up, make America the most prosperous Nation on 
   Earth, the country that has people with more material wealth--if that is what measures the validity of a society--than any other nation in the world. It is that we can finance purchases. We can finance what we buy, we can pay for it over time, and of late we are getting the interest rates down where they ought to be, as low as possible. 
   This is the best thing for Americans in their day-by-day life which permits them to use their salary and their earnings in a way that will let them spread out the costs of items that they need over a period of time, with a reasonable and rational finance plan. 
   It is absolutely important that from time to time, even though in the Congress we don't like to legislate items like a brand-new banking and finance bill--it is tedious for some, it is difficult, and for many it doesn't even seem like anything exciting we ought to be doing in the Senate. However, realizing what it does for our people, it ought to be full speed ahead to get to the floor with a good bill to modernize the banking and financing system of this country. 
   Earlier in our history, almost everything was financed through banks and the type of institutions that are principally the subject matter of this bill. Because we didn't modernize the system soon enough, financing is done in various ways--perhaps there is more financing done outside the banking system than there is in the banking system per se. Insurance companies do financing; companies that are big  enough do their own financing of appliances; clearly, institutions that are not banks and not subject to banking rules or financing purchases. 
   When it comes to measuring a country's long-term success and the international markets and the day-by-day availability of good credit and soundness of our economy, we have to always look to the banking system. As a matter of fact, just think a moment of the past 3 years when things have gone wrong in other countries, when some of these countries went almost totally bankrupt. What led such failures? It was frequently led by the failure of their banking system. That should say something when we see that all around us. 
   Why is the country of Japan, that many people 15 years ago said we should mimic--obviously we don't choose to speak that way today; I never spoke about it even 15 years ago--what has happened to Japan today? They don't want to face up to the fact their financing institutions are in a state of chaos, if not bankruptcy. It is tough for them to admit. 
   We didn't want to admit it when our savings and loans were going bankrupt. We didn't want to come up with the money it took to bail out the depositors who were guaranteed their money, up to $100,000, who financed the S&L banking system in the United States, but we finally did it. We saved it. We spent a lot of money doing it. 
   In a very real sense, those who are managing this bill, including my good friend from Maryland, Senator SARBANES, and obviously the chairman, who I have already mentioned, are contributing a very vital quality to American life by trying to modernize the financial and banking system of the United States. 
   As my good friend from Nebraska said, what we have is too old, too ancient. It is not modern. It is not taking care of modern problems. It is not helping banks grow in a way they can and should to be modern institutions of financing. 
   I commend and laud those on the committee who have worked hard. I hope even with our differences we will get a bill. I read a letter from the President saying if certain things are in the bill, he will veto it. This letter was directed to the distinguished chairman, Senator GRAMM. We know the executive branch has a couple of strong feelings about this bill; perhaps the Senate has equally strong feelings about the same items. 
   On the other hand, I believe when we are finished and go to conference and work this through with the House and with the administration in an effort to get a bill that is sound, reform-minded, modern and yet protects certain interests that the banking system is currently helping and protecting, we will get a bill. The opportunity doesn't come very often for Congress to reform a significant portion of our capitalist system. 
   I will make one other observation. For anyone who doesn't think capital--which is the substance of banks--isn't important to a capitalist society, let me suggest that the last 3 years ought to prove it up in America in spades. While many economies in the world were in a state of bankruptcy, couldn't buy our goods and were having great economic difficulty, what happened to America? Our consumers bought more rather than less. Interest rates went down rather than up. There was more money for almost any venture desired because the banking system in our country was the greatest safe haven for capital that the world has ever seen. That meant anyone with extra money sent it here. Thus, that money was available to finance purchases in America, bring interest rates down rather than up. 
   The question is, What will happen when the world economy goes the other direction? Frankly, we ought to have a 
   modernized banking system when that occurs. It is predicted that America's prosperity may turn a little bit in the wrong direction within 3 to 5 years. If it lasts 5 years, it will be astronomical in terms of a previous growth period. We have learned that the availability of a lot of capital in a capitalist system such as ours can make this economy grow and prosper in a way we had never quite figured out until we became almost totally dependent upon that. 
   There are signs all over the place that this great opportunistic land of ours needs a good, sound, solvent, and modern banking system. I came down to make sure those listening understand this is not a bill for bankers. This is not a bill for rich people. This is a bill to let a banking and finance system work for Americans--whether they are financing a home, whether they are moderate-income people, whether they are financing an education for their kids, whatever it may be. We have to have a sound set of financial rules in America for Americans to grow and prosper. 
   American business needs to borrow money, and clearly a banking system has to be ready and able to do that for the American business people here and abroad. It cannot be done with a system that is hog tied with ancient rules and regulations that don't meet today's times.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am joining my cosponsors, Senators BINGAMAN, FRIST, LIEBERMAN, and SNOWE, in introducing the Private Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999. 
   This bill makes the research tax credit permanent and significantly improves the structure of that credit. Many Senators are for this extension, and it is high time, and for the permanentization of this credit. 
   This also adjusts the credit to today. That credit was put in place many years ago, and much of what it does doesn't fit today's industrial base, including many startup companies that cannot take the right kind of credit. 
   We have made some changes which will make it cost a little bit more, but I think the Finance Committee should take a look at some of the changes that are in this Domenici-Bingaman bill, because it will make the credit more effective and more available. 
   In March of 1998, 150 of our Nation's top decisionmakers met at MIT for the first national innovative summit. The summit leaders included CEOs, university presidents, labor leaders, Governors, Members of Congress, and senior administrative officials. 
   In essence, they conclude that in order to keep the United States of America on the cutting edge of research that can be applied to innovative things for America's future and for our businesses, that we must make this tax permanent, that dollar for dollar it is the best investment in both general research and specific research to keep America strong and competitive in the world. 
   When those people say dollar for dollar it is the most effective, they are saying it is more effective than programmatic assistance to research, which obviously is very necessary, and we continue to expand upon and have it grow. But if you don't make this permanent, you are losing a lot of research by American businesses, No. 1. If you don't correct it, you will lose the effectiveness among companies that need it the most. And third, you will see to it that more, rather than less, American companies do research overseas. 
   Research jobs are great jobs. They are just as much a part of America's basic prosperity as are the jobs that come from that research by way of products or activities. 
   Mr. President, advanced technologies drive a significant part of our nation's economic strength. Our economy and our standard of living depend on a constant influx of new technologies, processes, and products from our industries. 
   Many countries provide labor at lower costs than the United States. Thus, as any new product matures, competitors using overseas labor frequently find ways to undercut our production costs. We maintain our economic strength only by constantly improving our products through innovation. Maintaining and improving our national ability to innovate is critically important to the nation. 
   The majority of new products requires industrial research and development to reach the market stage. I want to encourage that research and development to create new products to ensure that our factories stay busy and that our workforce stays fully employed at high salaried jobs. 
   I want more of our large multi-national companies to select the United States as the location of their R&D. R&D done here creates American jobs. And since frequently the benefits of research in one area apply in another area, I want those spin-off benefits here, too. 
   Congress created the Research Tax Credit to encourage companies to perform research. But many studies document that the present form of this Tax Credit is not providing as much stimulation to industrial R&D as it could. Today, we're introducing legislation to improve the Research Tax Credit. 
   In March of 1998, 150 of our nation's top decision makers met at MIT, for the first National Innovation Summit. The Summit included corporate CEO's, university presidents, labor leaders, governors, members of Congress, and Senior Administration officials. 
   At the Summit, these experts discussed the health of the future national research base. More than three-quarters of them thought that the quality of that base would be no better or worse than it is today, with nearly one third projecting that it would be weaker. 
   The Summit participants singled out the Research Tax Credit as the policy measure with the greatest potential for a positive near-term impact. The Council on Competitiveness, who co-sponsored that Summit, stated that ``making the [Research] Tax Credit permanent reflected a widely share consensus among leaders whose companies and universities contribute decisively to the nation's economy.'' 
   The single most important change in our bill is to make the Credit permanent. Many studies point out that the temporary nature of the Credit has prevented companies from building careful research strategies. 
   Many of my colleagues in Congress have also expressed interest in making the Credit permanent. But we're urging them to go beyond that action and, at the same time, address shortcomings that have been identified in the current Credit. I want to use the current enthusiasm for permanence to also craft a Credit that will better serve the nation. 
   For example, the current Credit references a company's research intensity back to 1984-88. That's too outdated to meet today's dynamic market conditions. Many companies are involved today in products that weren't even invented in 1984. 
   Our legislation allows a company to base their credit on their research intensity averaged over the preceding eight years. It also allows companies to stay with the current formulation of the Credit if they prefer. 
   Our bill builds other improvements into the Credit as well. For example, the Alternative Research Credit component has been criticized because it only rewards the maintenance level of a company's research, it does not provide significant motivation to increase research intensity. With our proposed changes, the Alternative Credit now incorporates the same 20 percent motivation for increased research intensity that is found in the regular Credit--this is a major improvement. We also increase the base level of the Alternative Credit significantly. 
   The current Credit has a provision that severely restricts the ability of start-up companies to fully benefit. Analysis by the Congressional Research Service showed that 5 our of 6 start-up companies received reduced benefits because of a current provision that limits their allowable increase in research expenditures. 
   I'm concerned when start-up companies aren't receiving full Credit. These are just the companies that drive the innovative cycle in this country; they are the ones that frequently bring out the newest leading-edge products. Our legislation thus drops this limitation and introduces additional help for start-up businesses. 
   Our legislation addresses several other shortcomings in the current Credit as well. Now there is a ``Basic Research Credit'' allowed, but rarely used. This should be encouraging research conducted at universities. 
   But that part of the Credit is now defined to include only research that does ``not have a specific commercial objective.'' There aren't many companies that want to support--much less admit to their stockholders that they are supporting--research with no commercial interest. The idea of this clause was to encourage support of long term research, which is a fine idea. 
   This is the kind of research that benefits far more than just the next product improvement. It can enable a whole  new product or service and we need to encourage it. 
   Our legislation adds major incentives for basic research by dropping the requirement that only increments above a baseline can be used and by including any research that is done for a consortium of U.S. companies or any research that is destined for open literature publication. We're also allowing this Credit to apply to research done in national labs. 
   And finally our legislation recognizes the importance of encouraging companies to use research capabilities wherever they exist in the country, whether in other businesses, universities, or national labs. The current credit disallows 35% of all expenses for research performed under an external contract--our legislation allows all such expenses to apply towards the Credit when the research is performed at a university, small business, or national laboratory. 
   In summary, this bill incorporates all the improvement suggested in other bills that primarily make the credit permanent and provide some increase in the alternative credit. But this bill goes further and corrects weaknesses in the current formulation of the Credit. I want to seize this opportunity to make the Research Tax Credit a tool that will truly meet the goals for which it was established. 
   The fact that this bill addresses significant shortcomings in the current Credit has not gone unnoticed. Spokesman for several groups that endorse this bill are here with us today. After Senator BINGAMAN speaks, I'll invite representatives from the Council on Competitiveness, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, the National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing, and the American Association of Engineering Societies to add their perspectives. 
   With this new bill, we will significantly strengthen incentives for private companies to undertake research that leads to new processes, new services, and new products. The result will be stronger companies that are better positioned for global competition. Those stronger companies will hire people at higher salaries with real benefits to our national economy and workforce.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona and those who have joined him in this cause. 
   While I disagree, it certainly should not be taken as any diminution of the great respect I have for JOHN MCCAIN and a number of Senators who are here on the floor to support this issue. 
   But, Mr. President, I believe what we should do is to prepare a letter to the President of the United States. I think we should say to the President something like this: ``Mr. President, you are the Commander in Chief. Mr. President, we are engaged in a limited military undertaking joined by our NATO allies in the Kosovo-Yugoslavia area. 
   You, Mr. President, have decided that we should do this; you have decided the limitation and the scope of our involvement.'' 
   When the appropriations bill comes along we will make sure our military men and women get everything they need to protect themselves adequately and in the most safe manner possible, so we are going to support them with all the money they need. 
   Mr. President, we anxiously await further requests from you. If, as a matter of fact, you believe we should proceed beyond the current limited involvement to a broader involvement. If you desire to have our military men and women on the ground trying to take part in operations in Kosovo and Yugoslavia so that what you, Mr. President, say the goal is might be accomplished, you request that of the Senate. We should sign this letter and say that we await the President's request, and it will be dealt with immediately. 
   Frankly, the reason I start my comments that way is I don't believe we should say to a President of the United States and his military commanders, who apparently agree with him, how to conduct his military operations. They don't want to even plan for a land war--the President has said that many times. He has said, If you gave me authority I wouldn't use it. He has made up his mind that this is the kind of war he wants to conduct. 
   We are not privy as Senators to what relationship exists between the NATO countries and the United States of America regarding what is going on over there. What will change some people's minds about their unity of people is if America acts unilaterally or in some way inconsistent with their understandings and agreement. That is not for the Congress; we don't know about those relationships. We don't know about the negotiations taking place now to try to bring this to a conclusion. God willing, it will be brought to a conclusion sooner rather than later. 
   Why should we take unilateral action when he does not ask Congress for it. Regardless of what the Senate may tell him, he alone has the authority to conduct this war. 
   My friend from Arizona almost makes my case by saying whether we do this or not, he has the authority. I think that is what I heard him say--whether we do this or not he has the authority. What are we up to?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. He is not asking for it. That is the big difference with the Persian Gulf resolution. President Bush asked us in writing and stated what it was about. 
   My other observation--in fact, if the President of the United States and our military commander serving our Nation want to go beyond what we are doing now, I would think he would at least tell us what it means. If they sought from us what President Bush sought, to go into a land war for some reason over there--and it may be necessary--then he should request our approval. 
   As a matter of fact, I wonder from time to time why the President isn't asking for it. The point is, if we asked for it, he would specify his objectives. He wouldn't just send something up here and say he wants to have our men and women go in and do this. We would have some briefings and we would understand what the end game is. We might even understand the risks involved in his plans. Even in expeditiously treating a request, we would get some answers we don't have today. I think we should expect those answers. 
   I don't believe we should involve ourselves in a military venture into the great unknown of that area because we want to in some way tell the President of the United States and the generals and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we want to give you more authority than you think you need; we want to tell you we are giving you more authority than you think you need. 
   We are not offering them any authority that they don't have already under the commander and chief powers of the Constitution. 
   I want to make it absolutely clear that I don't agree with my friend, JOHN MCCAIN, that in order to support the men and women engaged over there in a military event that the President has ordered, that we should not vote for money to protect them and give them what they need unless we are for this resolution. Those just don't follow. As a matter of fact, I want to assure those who are wondering, this is one Senator who will give them as much money as I can justify, to make sure our military is better prepared when we come out of this skirmish than we were when we went in. I do that without any concern that I have not voted to give the President authority to do more because they  are already there; I believe I am neglectful in my duty if I did not give them emergency money. 
   First of all, it wouldn't bring them home because they could go on for a long time under the President's Commander in Chief authority. By not doing a supplemental, we wouldn't be getting them out of there. We wouldn't be ending it precipitously. 
   From my standpoint, the Members of the Senate who don't vote for this resolution ought to join in a letter to the President and tell him unequivocally, Mr. President, we understand you are the Commander in Chief, we understand you put us there. Some of us didn't agree but they are there and now here is a letter from us saying if you need more authority from us to engage in a ground war, would you send us a request and brief us adequately on why you need it and we will vote quickly and decide what are our concerted feelings about that event.

   Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of the majority leader, I make the following opening statement. 
   Today the Senate will immediately begin 30 minutes of debate relating to cloture on the Social Security lockbox issue. Following that debate, the Senate will proceed to two rollcall votes. The first will be a cloture vote on the Abraham amendment to S. 557; the second on S. Res. 33 regarding National Military Appreciation Month, which will take place immediately following the first vote. Therefore, Senators can expect two votes at approximately 10 a.m. 
   For the remainder of the day, the Senate may continue debate on the lockbox issue or any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me suggest that this idea that we are locking out any amendments with our Social Security Protection Act is nice to say, but it isn't true. If the Democrats let us vote on this, we will see whether it passes or not, but once it passes, it is subject to amendments. 
   The good Senator from New Jersey, my dear friend, can offer his substitute or his amendment, but first we have to have an opportunity to vote on this amendment, which for some strange reason, while the other side of the aisle and the President keep saying, ``Let's  not spend any of the Social Security trust fund,'' they somehow do not want to vote for a proposition that will really lock it up so it cannot be spent, it cannot be embezzled, as some Democrats called it a few years ago, when you use it. They said you were embezzling the trust fund. I would think if that is true--I never used that word--you ought to lock it up tough, you ought to put a whopping key on it that can't hardly be moved. So that is what we have done. 
   For those who say, ``If you can't spend the Social Security trust fund, you are going to destroy the economy of America,'' that is just absolutely untrue. Would anyone believe that taking a trust fund which belongs to Social Security, using it to pay down the debt until we need it for Social Security reform, would anybody submit that that is going to harm America? That is going to help us. We are going to be reducing the debt right at the right time by a huge amount, which is going to keep inflation down, which is going to keep interest rates down, all of which helps Social Security. 
   All of these arguments about cash management, and you can't pay Social Security--just read the bill. The bill says, under all circumstances the Social Security checks are forthcoming, just by specific item. The management problems that the Treasury Secretary has have been fixed. 
   The truth of the matter is, those on the other side of the aisle think it might be easy to spend this money if you do not have this lockbox. And they are right, it will be easy to spend it. In fact, the President of the United States, in his budget, spent $158 billion of it in the first 5 years. No wonder he does not want this lockbox. It wrecks his budget, because he is already going to spend it. We say, ``No. No, you can't spend it. You challenged us not to spend it. We are for real.'' That is what this is all about. 
   Last but not least, let me suggest that it is really amazing for some on the other side of the aisle to talk about saving both Medicare and Social Security in some kind of a lockbox when you see what it really is. It is sort of a Democratic position that we should not cut taxes for the American people or, if we do, we ought to do it their way--even though we are in the majority and the President has a veto pen, we ought to do it their way. 
   We say there is plenty of money outside of Social Security to give the American taxpayers back a real tax reduction over the next decade. Whenever you say, let's take more of that surplus that does not belong to Social Security, and say let's spend it on something else, you are really choosing not to give the American people a tax reduction that they deserve. 
   Frankly, I do not believe today we are going to get cloture. But I think sooner or later--and hopefully it will not be too much later--we will make this filibuster a real one. We will stay down here until we wear out, around the clock. And let's stay here a couple nights so everybody will understand this is serious business, and who is keeping us from voting on it, to protect our seniors and their money for the next decade when it is most in jeopardy. It will be those on that side of the aisle who will not vote today. 
   They will probably not vote for it the next time. But sooner or later, a lot of Americans are going to be asking, who is holding up the real lockbox that will protect our money? It is going to dawn on a few people on the other side of the aisle that they are and that the American people are cognizant and aware of it, and maybe some people will change their minds. 
   With that, if I have any remaining time, I yield it back. I understand we have agreed to start voting at this time, in any event.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use it at this point to make a couple of points. 
   Senior citizens, what some like to do is to say, to protect your Social Security trust fund, we are going to hurt other people who are entitled to Federal money because we may have a recession one of these days and things may change. 
   We are aware of that. Read the bill. It says the lockbox is held in abeyance in the event we have two quarters of economic downturn, which normally is called a recession. You hold it steady there and see where we come out. Anybody who would be looking at this kind of proposition would think that is a prudent thing to do. We did that. 
   Likewise, in case of a national emergency like a war, we have said, you cannot not spend money on that, and so there is an emergency that takes place then and you can temporarily use 
   it. Remember, we are holding $1.8 trillion for the seniors and these emergencies of which we are speaking. If they occur, they will be very small in proportion to the good we are doing under this proposal. 
   I, too, hope we can get a true lockbox put together. If bipartisan, fine; if not, I am very comfortable with this one.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the recent tragic events in Colorado, it's good for us to remind one another that there are a lot of terrific young people out there accomplishing great feats involving teamwork, academic study, and a lot of guts. 
   That's why today I want to salute the St. Pius High School academic decathlon team from my hometown in Albuquerque, NM. The St. Pius students just finished in 7th place at the national academic decathlon finals in California. That's the best finish New Mexico young people have ever scored at the decathlon nationals. 
   One of the St. Pius team members said it best about the contest. He said its the only competitive event in high school where your best chance of winning involves going home and reading a book. 
   These outstanding young people were tested based on their knowledge and scholastic skills in fine art, music, history, economics, mathematics and literature. 
   It is with great pride that I salute the St. Pius decathlon team and their accomplishments. Congratulations to team members Caleb Benton, Nicholas Jaramillo, Stephanie Piegzik, Dennis Carmody, Mark Mulder, Matt Spurgeon, Louis Rivera, Ben Sachs, Jesse Vigil and their coach James Penn.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my fellow Senators  an extraordinary exchange that occurred last week in the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee when they were conducting a hearing under your chairmanship regarding the year 2000 budget for the Department of Interior. 
   As some of you here may know, Secretary Babbitt and I, while both being from adjacent Western States, have not agreed on a lot of land management, water, and endangered species issues affecting the West. However, last Thursday a most unusual and enlightening thing took place. We both agreed that, regarding the impact of the Endangered Species Act on desert States like New Mexico, the current implementation of the law does not work.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Secretary Babbitt's testimony could open the door to some changes in the Endangered Species Act and may permit all parties to work together. I am submitting, as I indicated, this unedited transcript from the hearing for the RECORD. The Secretary's remarks are very significant because they acknowledge that this law, however well intentioned, is not working as it should. I hope we can begin serious work on improving the Endangered Species Act, certainly as it applies to dry States where water is very much in demand and where we have an imposition on those waters by the Endangered Species Act as it is currently being implemented. 
   Just last month I indicated that people and people's needs should come before the minnow, which is an endangered species in this particular Rio Grande river valley. I wrote a letter to editors of papers in our State, which appeared in multiple newspapers around New Mexico, saying it is now time to face the devastating impacts of laws such as the Endangered Species Act on people in a desert State like New Mexico, particularly in the area of water. 
   I got some real arguments and some flak for writing that letter, but I also got some very enlightened commentary on the problems facing an arid State, and I am pleasantly surprised to find that Secretary Babbitt has contributed to the debate in a very constructive way. 
   New Mexico, my home State, is very dry. I have found that people within the beltway and in eastern America are unaware of the critical need for water in the West. With the lack of snow pack and precipitation in our State this year, we are facing a severe drought this summer. In fact, parts of the Rio Grande River, the largest river in our State, which runs from north to south and through the city of Albuquerque and many other communities, which has historically gone dry at times--this river is already drying up, even this early in the season. 
   My discussion with Secretary Babbitt was extremely timely, since my office received a call this past weekend from the Fish and Wildlife representatives saying they were out trying to find out what was happening to the endangered silvery minnow in the dry stretches of the river. 
   You see, the traditional tension among water users is not only exacerbated by litigation regarding the needs of the endangered silvery minnow, but also obviously exacerbated by all conflicting water needs when you are in a drought period. 
   In a lawsuit filed by the Forest Guardians and Defenders of Wildlife, a recent 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision ordered an immediate critical habitat designation for the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The practical effect of this determination is the fish may get too much of the limited water in the river and some human users may not get any.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator NICKLES for developing this legislation. Simply stated, it stands for the proposition that there has never been, is not now, nor ever shall be a ``duty to market.'' 
   If you read a federal oil and gas lease there is no mention of a duty to market. It has been Mineral Management Services' (MMS) position that the duty to market is an implied covenant in the lease. And this legislation says that MMS is wrong. 
   Let me back up, and explain the issue and why this legislation is needed. 
   Oil and gas producers doing business on federal leases pay royalites to the federal government based on ``fair market value.'' Under the Clinton Administration, this is easier said than done. One of the long standing disputes between the Congress and the Mineral Management Service (MMS) has been the development of workable oil royalty valuation regulations that can articulate just exactly what fair market value is. 
   Cynthia Quarterman, the former director of the MMs, set out the Interior Department's position that fair market value includes a ``duty to market the lease production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor,'' but without the federal government paying its share of the costs. Many of these costs are transportation costs and they are significant. MMS calls it a duty to market, I call it federal government mooching. 
   This bill states Congressional intent: No duty to market, no federal government mooching. And let me be clear, whether there is a duty to market is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of Congress. It is not the job of lawyers at the MMS to raise the Congressionally set royality rate through the back door. 
   And, the so-called ``duty to market'' is a back door royalty increase--make no mistake about it. 
   The MMS has been unable to develop workable royalty valuation rules and Congress has had to impose a moratorium on these regulations. The core issue has been duty to market. 
   For this reason, I hope the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will act expeditiously on this  legislation. In this period of hard economic times for the oil and gas industry, the oil royalty valuation issue should be resolved with certainty, fairness and without a hidden royalty rate increase.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to reimburse U.S. military personnel for costs incurred due to cancellation of travel plans. This bill would authorize DoD to reimburse the men and women involved in Kosovo operations in any instance where they are forced to pay a fee to the airlines for changes in travel plans or purchased non-refundable tickets. 
   In those instances where military personnel are recalled from leave or forced to cancel their leave plans due to the current crisis in Kosovo, the Defense Department is not authorized to reimburse them for costs incurred to change or cancel their personal travel plans. 
   Military legal offices only pay the claims that Congress has authorized them to pay through legislation. Currently, DoD is only authorized to pay very specific claims. These claims usually involve damage to government property. Personal property is only covered if the damage or loss is related to official duty. There is no statutory authority to reimburse a member who incurs additional costs related to their leave, even if these costs are a direct result of performing their duty as members of the U.S. military. 
   I find this situation preposterous. These men and women are being asked to cover expenses incurred through no fault of their own. In response to their commitment to an international security crisis, we tell them to foot the bill for any vacation plans they might have had. 
   In light of earlier legislation we passed this year to signal to our military personnel that Congress will not short-change them for their service to this country, this measure offers one additional token of our appreciation and pride.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, me thinks they doth protest too much. That is my paraphrasing of what some great writer said applying it in the singular. I am applying it in the plural. 
   First of all, I recall vividly my very good friend and one-time chairman of the Budget Committee coming to the floor of the Senate with a big sign that said: ``Quit embezzling Social Security money.'' In fact, he said embezzlement is what is happening when we use their trust fund money for Government. Isn't it interesting that there are many Senators who at least feel that way enough to talk about it as embezzlement or stealing money from the senior citizens? 
   Today, the seniors ought to ask: If it is embezzlement, what are you all going to do to prevent the embezzlement from continuing? The answer is going to be: Little or nothing, because whatever you try to do that is really serious and makes it hard to embezzle, they have some reason on that side of the aisle for not doing it. 
   If you think this Senator, who has listened attentively and asked his staff to summarize the arguments on that side, is not frustrated when he hears, first, that a financial crisis will occur--let me tell you, the seniors think a financial crisis has already occurred because we are taking their money and spending it for Government. 
   Secretary Rubin, for whom I have the highest respect, who does not want to tie the future debt limit of the United States to whether or not you use this Social Security trust fund, has written a letter and, essentially, the letter says he needs more flexibility because the money does not come in every month at the same level. We gave him the flexibility. Read the statute before you. If Secretary Rubin is worried about that, we gave him the flexibility. 
   Now he raises a new argument: We may not be able to pay Social Security beneficiaries--an absurd argument. But we gave him the authority in this statute. We said if that the Secretary should give payments of Social Security checks priority. 
   We thought we clearly took care of the most significant problem and concern of the Secretary of the Treasury. 
   Then we hear: You have done nothing to extend the solvency of Social Security. Of course, we haven't. We said don't touch their fund until you have a reform package that helps with the solvency of Social Security, and if you have that, you can use it for that. 
   Why wouldn't the senior citizens like that? Do they want us to just leave it there or they want us to use it in case we need it for Social Security reform or transition? Of course, that is an argument in favor of this statute, not against it. 
   Then we were accused of perhaps putting Medicare in this Social Security trust fund. That was last week. It should just be for Social Security. Right? That was the big argument. We made it just for Social Security. 
   Now what is the argument? You did not take care of Medicare. This money does not belong to Medicare. This money belongs to 
   Social Security. If you want to take care of Medicare, take care of it another way. Do not use the Social Security money for Medicare. 
   Last week, the Democrats were saying that lockbox is not going to be good because you might be able to use the money for Medicare. We agreed with them. We did not put it in this statute. Now we are not doing enough for Medicare. 
   Then we are accused of making this Government live on too rigid a budget for the appetite for spending or tax cuts. We are being accused of tying the hands too tightly. 
   What do we do? We say, OK, we want to be reasonable about this. If we have a recession for two quarters, then this does not apply. Who would want this to apply in the middle of a recession if you needed money for unemployment compensation? Of course, you would not want it to. If you needed to do something to help the economy come up so the Social Security program would be helped by recovery and prosperity, who would object to that? 
   Put that alongside of having no lockbox so you could use it for anything, like the President wanted to in his budget. It is amazing. The President wants to spend $158 billion of this trust fund for just programs, not emergencies, not a war, just for programs to expand on the Government. You can count on it, seniors. You cannot do that if this lockbox is put in effect. You will have to find the money in other program cuts or do something else, but you could not use it. 
   We also said, if there is a war, if there is an emergency with reference to the defense of our country, you could use it, but not for ordinary expenditures of Government. 
   I remind everyone, this is a lot of money, $1.8 trillion going in this trust fund over a decade which belongs to the seniors and takes down our national debt while it sits there waiting for us to use it for Social Security purposes only. Now we have somebody arguing it may be some new Social Security program that just Republicans want that you would use it for. That is kind of preposterous. 
   When you have a reform Social Security program, it is going to have to clear both Houses of Congress and be signed by a President. It is obviously going to be a good program. Seniors are going to be watching it. But that is what we think this money ought too be used for. 
   As I view it, everybody on both sides of the aisle and the White House talk about not using this trust fund for anything but Social Security. I worked very hard to find a way that will clearly say: You can't do it; you can't spend it; you need 60 votes, and you are going to have to increase the debt limit in order to spend this money. 
   I thought that was something everybody would like. Frankly, I thought those running across America saying, ``We want to take care of Social Security,'' would not be for this. 
   Do you know what I think? I think it is just too tight a lockbox. It is not a loose lockbox like they are talking about. It is too tight. You are not going to be able to embezzle from it anymore. You are not going to be able to rob from it anymore. You are not going to be able--if you do not think it was embezzlement or robbery; if you just think we were spending the money--you are not going to be able to spend the money anymore. 
   What is wrong with that? I believe that is exactly what we ought to do. Frankly, I anxiously await the vote. I do not believe we will get cloture, but everybody knows by not giving us cloture, the Democratic side of this Senate is clearly saying: We want to make sure you cannot spend the money, but don't make too sure that we can't spend the money; don't make it too certain that we can't spend the money; just leave a little bit open there so in case we need it, we can spend it, because we would like some new programs or we would like to cut taxes. 
   Actually, this applies to tax cuts, too. You cannot use it for tax cuts because it says in there what it can be used for and nothing else. 
   I thank everyone for the debate. It has probably been a healthy one. In particular, I thank Senator ABRAHAM, a valid member and respected member of our Budget Committee. He is the principal sponsor of this proposal. I think he has carried the load admirably on the floor, and I thank him for his efforts. 
   Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?

   Mr. DOMENICI. I was here for most of your remarks. First I want to commend you. In my recollection of the discussions we had with those who were in the administration prior to this involvement, with reference to Russia, there was almost kind of a trite answer--don't worry, they will not do anything. 
   I want to ask you if there is not a serious problem coming about now. They are going to have elections next year. We have always wondered how long will it be before their nationalist temperaments come back to the surface and they move in the wrong direction politically. I wonder if you might speculate or reason with me about that. 
   My evaluation, based upon a number of people who have talked about Russia and an analysis that has been given to me, is that they are now so anti-American and so antiwest that they are apt to move in a rather concerted manner by large numbers of votes in a direction that is not moving toward a marketplace economy and democracy. Is that your concern also?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senators who have taken the floor and spoken on behalf of this lockbox amendment. 
   I have worked for many years with a number of Senators, some of whom are on the floor--some on the other side, like Senator HOLLINGS--in an effort to see what we could do to make it as difficult as humanly possible to spend Social Security trust fund money for other kinds of expenditures of the Federal Government, be it programs, or be it tax cuts. 
   Frankly, I have heard it said on a number of occasions that the things we tried to do heretofore were all process and didn't get the job done. I don't want to take credit for doing something extraordinary. But I will say this idea of tying the Social Security trust fund to the debt held by the public over a 10-year period, and limiting the amount of debt that can occur in each of those years for a decade, which essentially is the current debt minus the amount of Social Security trust fund subtracted each year from that debt--what is left over, that residual is the debt held by the public. But I did, at a committee hearing, for some reason come up with the idea that maybe that is what we ought to do--tie it to a debt limit. 
   There will be plenty of people who will take the floor and say this is too rigid, this is too tough, this puts too big a shackle around the Government of the United States. 
   Let me tell you honestly. If you want to tell the seniors of America we don't want to spend your Social Security money for programs, or tax cuts, or anything other than when we need it for you, we will use it for you, then you ought to really be serious about it. You ought to say that is what we are trying to do. 
   Obviously this is the first time that the rhetoric and the contentions by Senators from both sides of the aisle that we ought to not spend Social Security money has been reduced to a statute that, if it passes and is signed by the President, will govern for 10 years, whether or not the United States can easily use trust fund money from Social Security for other causes, other reasons, as just as they may be. It will become very difficult when this legislation becomes law for us to ever again in a wholesale, willy-nilly manner spend Social Security trust fund money. In fact, every time you exceed that debt limit, and even if you have 60 votes, you are going to have to tell the American people we are exceeding it; we have 60 votes now. It is something very important, and people are going to be able to look and see. Was it something very, very important, or are we back to business as usual? 
   That is the essence of this proposal. 
   When I was saying we talk a lot about it, let me say on the debate on the budget resolution on the floor of this Senate--and the occupant of the Chair helped, because he voted the right way, but on this vote it was an easy vote because 99 Senators voted for it, as I recall. There was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, kind of the precursor to this bill that was adopted by the Senate. It was an Abraham-Domenici and others sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
   It did the following things: 
   One, it reaffirmed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that Social Security trust funds are off budget. 
   Second, it provides a Senate point of order against any budget resolution that violates that section of the Omnibus 
   Budget Reconciliation Act. 
   Third, it mandates that Social Security surpluses are used only for Social Security, or reducing the public debt. 
   Fourth, it provides for a Senate supermajority vote on a point of order against any measure that would use Social Security surpluses for anything other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social Security reform, or the reduction of the debt held by the public. 
   Fifth, it ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on time. 
   Last, it accommodates Social Security reform legislation. That was passed 99-0.  
   Mr. President, what happened was we attempted in that sense-of-the-Senate resolution to encapsulate what this legislation that is before us today did. It said that it is the sense of the Senate that we should adopt a bill that does all of these things. Now we have that bill before us. 
   So those who would now want to either unduly delay this vote, or say we should not do it, or vote against it, no, it is not so easy to explain that they just less than 10 days ago voted--2 weeks ago and a few days--voted 99-0 to adopt legislation just like this. 
   I understand that there can be a lot of explaining between the language and the statute--the language in this lockbox legislation. 
   Right off, I want to mention one thing. There are a number of Senators--I am hoping it is a minimum--within the next couple of days who are going to cite the fact that our distinguished Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, said some legislation that he had seen that was the Domenici legislation on the lockbox wouldn't work mechanically, that part of the year you don't get in a real strong flow of income tax, and later on you get in a big flow of income tax, and that maybe you would not be able to control the expenditures and the need for cash during those early days if in fact you had a very rigid year-long debt limit. 
   We have done the best we can. We are open to suggestions to adjust to that need for flexibility without altering the ultimate dollar number that will be the debt held by the public. 
   Again, rather than use it to destroy this legislation, which it should not do--I read the letter, and we can fix the concerns of the Secretary--if that is all the concerns the administration has, if that is all of them, we already fixed most of them right here. But if it is not quite right, we welcome the legislative liaison from the Treasury or the White House to come and tell Mr. Rubin to tell us how to fix it better, just as long as it is understood that we don't want somebody from the administration saying that what we are really telling you is too tough, it is too rigid, it holds your feet to the fire too much, we ought to have more flexibility in terms of why and for what purpose we should use this Social Security surplus. If that is the reason the legislation is bad, we want to suggest that we are at opposite ends of the polls; for that is the reason we think it is good, because it is very tough. 
   If you are going to throw away much of the Social Security funds in the next decade instead of applying it to the debt of $1.8 trillion, it is not going to be easy, which means that Government is going to be pretty much tied to a reasonable budget that does not spend the Social Security budget surplus over time over this decade. 
   For those who say, well, you know, there will be no money for this or that or the other, maybe there won't, but maybe there will be because we are not saying that surpluses that are not Social Security surpluses are subject to any kind of restriction. They are subject to what Congress wants to do and what a President recommends. 
   So if there are surpluses that do not belong to them--and there is a very large chunk of surplus now that doesn't belong to Social Security--we are not trying to limit that. We Republicans think most of that should go back to the public in tax cuts, but that is a year-long battle with the President and others. That is not Social Security money. 
   Mr. President, that same sense-of-the-Senate language that I told you about that was adopted in the budget resolution in its final form, after it got 99 votes freestanding, it was adopted by a vote of 54-44 when the budget resolution was adopted. 
   When 99 people vote and tell the Senate what we should do, and then we do it, it would seem to me that it ought to be a rather simple proposition that we ought to do it, tell the public we meant what we said, and get on with making sure we find other ways to take care of our governmental needs, but not the Social Security trust fund for the next decade. 
   Unless the Senate and the sense-of-the-Senate resolution was meaningless, this statute should get rather broad-based support, it seems to this Senator. 
   Let me speak from the standpoint of what could be better for America than us doing this. I can think of hardly anything that could be better for America, 
   not just for the seniors, better for America. Mr. President, $1.8 trillion during the next decade, and I truly believe that if this statute is adopted it will be perilously close to $1.8 trillion, that will be cut from the national debt. 
   That is an incredible number. Senator ASHCROFT just told us how big it is, in terms of percentage of our gross national product. But $1.8 trillion of public debt during this decade will be wiped clean and there will be no public debt against that $1.8 trillion because the surplus of Social Security money will be there, only to be used for major reform for Social Security if, in fact, that occurs during this decade. 
   Why is that good? If you asked almost every rational, reasonable, mainstream American economist from Alan Greenspan to that long list that said the President was doing good things in reducing the debt, you ask them if reducing the debt by $1.8 trillion is not a very positive thing for our economy and they will all say: The best thing to use surplus for is debt reduction. Because that means we borrow less. In a very interesting way it means we save more, because if you were to spend it, you would have to be borrowing to take its place. And if you do not borrow, you are saving. Since we individually save little, it is very good, starting into the new millennium and the first few years, that we have a low debt with low borrowing which may very well keep the American economy moving ahead, strong, powerful, with lower interest rates. 
   What could be better for America? Nothing. What could be better for seniors? Nothing--other than a reformed Social Security program that was in existence for 75 years with no problems. And, frankly, an appropriate plan might use this surplus in transition for that and we might get that out of this also. 
   Why else is it good for seniors? Did anybody hear the President go to the Rose Garden when he got a statement from the trustees of Social Security and Medicare the other day and announce to America that things were looking better for Medicare and Social Security? I believe there was an announcement that we added 8 years to the longevity of the trust fund for Medicare. And we did not do a thing. We just continued to have a prospering American economy. So one can say seniors should want a prospering American economy more than anyone else in this society, because a prospering American economy, with high employment and low unemployment, is the best medicine for the Social Security trust fund and Medicare trust fund of anything, any set of activities we could do as American people, as business people, and as American taxpayers and workers, producing goods and services in this very vibrant and powerful economy. 
   So, when you look at that, this may just be, in some people's minds, some small approach to making the case that we are trying to save Social Security trust fund money from being spent arbitrarily for things that are not Social Security. It is more than that. It is a combination of things that I just described, including the very positive result of greatly reducing the national debt while we wait to see what is needed for Social Security reform; a very, very positive piece of legislation. 
   It is important to allow the Federal Government maximum flexibility in times of low growth or recession. The Federal budget is one of the most important economic policy tools we have. In fact, we have procedures in place which allow us to suspend our budgetary enforcement rules during such times. 
   This legislation contains a low-growth, recession trigger as well. If the Department of Commerce reports two consecutive quarters of real economic growth of less than 1 percent, the limit of debt held by the public is suspended. The current law statutory debt limit would still be in place. 
   The limit on debt held by the public is suspended until the Commerce Department issues a final GDP report indicating that the level of real GDP has risen back to its level prior to the low growth or recession period. The limit on debt held by the public is restored at its actual level (at the time the Commerce Department report is issued that de-triggers the suspension.)  
   The limit on debt held by the public then begins to decline at the same rate that it would have had the suspension not been triggered. 
   Mr. President, the Act is effective for 10 years and then sunsets. This is the same time period covered by the recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000--H. Con. Res. 68. It is a period of time in which the Social Security trust fund balances are expected to grow by nearly $1.8 trillion. These balances would retire debt held by the public which would help prepare the country for the retirement of the baby boom generation early in the next century. It reaffirms off-budget treatment of the social security program. 
   The act reaffirms current law that the receipts and disbursements of the Social Security trust funds shall not be counted for the purposes of the Federal budget submitted to Congress by the President or any congressional budget. 
   The act creates a new Budget Act point of order against Congress adopting a budget that uses social security surpluses to achieve balance, and requires the President to submit a budget that does the same. It uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt held by the public. The act establishes a new enforceable limit on the amount of debt held by the public over the period from 2000 to 2010. These debt limits specified in the act are current estimates of the level of borrowing from the public over this period that result from the Social Security surplus only being used to retire debt. The surplus could not be used for non-Social Security spending or tax cuts. Legislation increasing these limits would require a super-majority vote in the Senate. 
   The act establishes the first limit becomes effective as of May 1, 2000, and effectively ratchets down this limit May 1 and periodically thereafter. The effective date accommodates Treasury Department's Federal cash management responsibilities. The newly established debt held by the public limits would not disrupt the cash management operations of the Bureau of the Public Debt nor would it jeopardize Social Security benefit payments.

   Mr. DOMENICI. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection Act of 1999.'' I believe that juvenile crime is one of the most important issues facing our nation today. It's one we should address in the 106th Congress. 
   In recent years, I have held field hearings in my home state of New Mexico to hear the concerns and problems faced by all of the people affected by juvenile crime--the police, prosecutors, judges, social workers and most importantly--the victims who reside in our communities. 
   I think that the sentiments expressed by most of my constituents at the hearing are the same ones felt by people all over the country:

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I use. 
   First, let me speak to those who are wondering what the time sequencing is and when we might vote. We know of only one additional Senator on our side who wants to speak, and that will be Senator SLADE GORTON. I understand that we know, in fact, where he is. He is at a committee hearing, but as soon as he comes, he will be our last speaker. We are anxiously waiting to see how many more there are on the other side, and we are hoping that in all events we will be through debating this budget resolution within an hour or less. That will set a time certain that is accommodating to the leaderships in terms of when we vote. 
   Having said that, let me just comment a bit with respect to a few things that have been said by the distinguished Senator from Illinois. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak a few words to the Senate and anybody interested with reference to some of the comments made by my good friend from Illinois, Senator DURBIN. I do mean that. He is a very new member of our committee, and I find him to be a very dedicated and hard-working Senator. I reciprocate with my compliments to his work and effort. 
   I do believe we have a propensity on the floor to argue and, in many cases, to exaggerate so as to prove our point. Let me make sure that the American people understand the tax cut we are talking about. 
   It is projected that in the next decade we will have $2.5 trillion in surplus money coming into the Federal Government. Let's for a moment understand basically what that means, $2.5 trillion. The entire budget of the United States for everything is about $1.8 trillion a year. We will have a surplus that dramatically and extensively exceeds the total amount we are spending annually for all programs of government. 
   Where did that $2.5 trillion come from? It did not drop on 
   us from outer space, nor did a big rain cloud come over and rain came down and it was full of dollars and that is where the $2.5 trillion in surplus came from. I think most people, if given three or four things they could choose from, would choose the right answer--the taxpayers paid it in. The taxpayers pay $2.5 trillion more in the next decade in taxes than we need to run government based upon a reasonable program.  
   Obviously, if you believe there is a never-ending need for government spending, then you can whisk away that $2.5 trillion and say, let's spend it. Frankly, for all of the desires of the American people, they are not crazy. In fact, they understand implicitly what is going on. When, in fact, you have this kind of excess taxes being paid in, there is a difference, dramatic difference, between the two parties. The Republicans say don't grow government, give the money back to the taxpayer. 
   That is what all this argument is about. What do you do with that excess, which is more money per year and per the next decade from the taxpayers, all taxpayers, than we need for our current budget plans? 
   You could invent new budget plans, I say to the occupant of the Chair, and spend every cent of it. Or you can do something as wild as the President has recommended, which not even the Senate believes is responsible--indeed, both sides. You can take a huge chunk of that money and put it into the Medicare trust fund without reforming or changing Medicare, just put it in there and put out, as the President did, 15 percent of that surplus in IOUs. The IOUs have value, because what are the IOUs? The IOUs are postdated checks which are going to come due at some point. 
   Who is going to pay for them? It is the American taxpayer who is going to have to redeem them in 10, 15, or 20 years, because it is just a postdated check. You understand that, but if they understood it, they would say: What is this all about? We thought we were fixing Medicare, reforming it and making it more efficient. Sometime out there in the future, those IOUs are going to come due, and we are going to have to pay them. New taxes are going to have to be imposed. 
   What do the Republicans think? Republicans think that during the next decade you ought to take every single solitary penny of Social Security surplus, which is part of that $2.5 trillion that I have been talking about, and put it in a position in the budget where it can't be spent for anything other than senior needs. 
   There are arguments that isn't enough for Medicare, that we don't provide for Medicare in this budget. Let me just tell you what we do provide. We provide $462 billion more in that trust fund than the President did, and he heralded his budget as being responsive to the proposition that every single penny of trust fund money would be deposited in the trust fund for Social Security, excepting he had a nice little funny thing in there. That was over 15 years--we never have budgeted like that--which meant that he only put 62 percent of the Social Security surplus into a Social Security accumulating trust fund, and then he did this IOU business with Medicare. Essentially, it is as if there is a plan, an intentional approach to say to the American people: Don't worry about the taxes you are paying in and the excess; we have it all taken care of; we are going to spend it. 
   As a matter of fact, it is most interesting; the President of the United States spent in the first 10 years $158 billion of the Social Security surplus for programs. 
   Unequivocal. Nobody denies it. The President's OMB people don't deny it. They say that doesn't matter because over many years we are going to save the money for Social Security, but we will spend some of it in the first decade. In fact, that $158 billion is in the first 5 years of the budget--it is going to be spent. 
   Having said that, the other issue that seems to always come up is, if you are going to give tax cuts, it just has to be that the Republicans are going to take care of the rich people and not the middle income and family people, because there have been various Senators and House Members speaking about what they might want. I will remind everybody listening to that kind of stuff on the floor, you should know that that budget resolution, by operation of law, does not say how the taxes will be cut. It says how much. And in the processes of the Congress, later on--in fact, under this budget, it is in July of this year--the tax-writing committees, after hearings, after citizen input, after talking with Senators from both sides of the aisle, will produce the tax bill. That will be the time to decide what is in it. And it is actually a red herring to talk about what is in that tax bill--because we don't know--as a justification for not having any tax cuts. But that doesn't sound right, does it? Well, it is right. 
   Those who use the argument that it is going to be a bad tax bill, so don't have any tax cut, are essentially saying we don't want to give you a tax cut because we don't know what will be in it. But I will tell you what the budget resolution says. That is the best I can do. It recommends that such tax relief could include any or all of the following: an expansion of the 15-percent bracket, marginal rate reductions, a significant reduction or elimination of the marriage tax penalty, retirement savings incentives, estate tax relief, an above-the-line income tax reduction for Social Security payroll taxes, tax incentives for education, parity between the self-employed and corporations with respect to tax treatment of health insurance premiums, capital gains taxes, and fairness for family farmers. 
   Now, that is what we are discussing. Do we want to allow some or all of that to be debated and looked at? That is why we have a tax provision in this budget resolution. 
   Let me just quickly go through one other thing and then summarize what we have done. First, in the Medicare program, by virtue of a good economy, meaning high unemployment, a lot of people paying into these trust funds, we have extended the life of Medicare, Part A--that is the hospitalization part in the trust fund--for 8 years without Congress doing a thing. The current program lives for 8 years longer than expected just 6 months ago because the economy is powerful. 
   Now, almost everyone knows we have to reform, change, make better, make more efficient the Medicare program. There are some who would like to deposit $400 billion in the trust fund of Medicare and let it sit there as IOUs for the future, without first determining what does Medicare need or, to put it another way, without any reform or changes in Medicare. None. That is what it contemplates. And an extension of the trust fund is contemplated by just pouring that money in and taking IOUs. It isn't spent. It extends the life of Medicare some 8 or 9 years, and it doesn't contemplate or envision reform. It doesn't pay for prescription drugs. And, incidentally, as an aside, anybody who would like to ask the OMB of the United States, the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the 
   Comptroller General, ask them if the President paid for prescription drugs in his budget--zero. He suggests we might want to do that sometime as part of reform. 
   Now, one Democrat Senator said, ``Republicans want to raid the Federal tax treasury for a tax cut.'' Now, isn't that an interesting concept? Raiding the Federal Treasury for a tax cut. What is the Federal Treasury? What is the Federal Treasury into which the taxpayers are paying $2.5 trillion more than you need for Government? What is the Federal Treasury? 
   My friends, the Federal Treasury belongs to the American people. It does not belong to the Government. If we reduce the size of Government and there is money left over and we say let's give it back to the public, are we raiding the Treasury of the United States, or are we giving back to our citizens the overpayment they have paid in income taxes that is lodged temporarily, or housed in the U.S. Government? 
   I wonder how the people who are hurrying today to the post offices trying to get their tax returns in would feel if they knew that over the next 10 years as they file their returns, they are overpaying the Government; and, as a matter of fact, if you add it all up, they are paying $2.5 trillion over current expenditures. I think they would be wondering, what is the U.S. Treasury? We thought maybe it was ours. 
   In summary, we think we have a very good plan to enter the millennium. If the President would like to enter that millennium with us, that would be great. Everybody listening and everybody who follows budgets should know that there has not been a vote in this Congress, or in our Committee on the Budget, on a Democratic budget. They don't have to produce one. When I was in the minority, I didn't produce a budget every year. So everybody will know, we didn't vote on a Democrat  budget; we voted on the President's budget. While there was a lot of argument about whether we were voting on it or not, that is what it said--that we were voting on it. Now it will be interesting to know what results from that vote: No, every member of the committee; Yes, zero members of the committee. 
   Now, if in fact it was a great budget on Social Security, a great budget on Medicare--just those two--if it was great on those, Democrats would have voted for it because, after all, it is pretty clear that is what they believe to be the biggest issue going. They didn't vote for it. 
   Now, what this budget does is save Social Security and puts in a trust fund $462 billion more than the President put in, and the number is $1.8 trillion. You can't spend it. It is there. You can't use it for tax cuts, that is for sure. As a matter of fact, we will soon vote on legislation to lock it up so that it can't be used without 60 votes. 
   Save the Social Security trust fund first. That is the No. 1 plank, the No. 1 priority in the budget. Second, make sure we have done everything we can to promote Medicare reform and see to it that we do have the resources for it. We have done that. I am not going to repeat the three or four things in the budget and just say those were No. 1 and No. 2. Three, we have dramatically increased national defense. Everybody understands that. If they didn't understand it 2 weeks ago, they ought to understand it now. The costs that we are incurring in Kosovo now, over and above defense spending we contemplated year by 
   year, are astronomical. We soon may have to add to that, in an emergency, as much as $5 billion. And if we went on for a whole year, depending upon which kind of activity we have had, the number could be more than twice or three times that amount. So we have increased it substantially. 
   In our prioritizing, in our setting forth what we think should be paid for first, we have increased education $3.8 billion in the first year, $38 billion over the next 5, beyond that requested by the President. Our only hope is that none of that money will be used unless we have a new approach to public education funding, and that we would send the money down to the locales with ``flexibility and accountability.'' Those are the two new words we want to attach--to give them flexibility and make them accountable. Don't tell them how to use it because one shoe doesn't fit everything in the school districts from East to West and North to South in this great land. 
   We have sustained and added to all of our criminal justice activities, and we have added $1.7 billion to veterans' hospital care, substantially more than the President, because we think that is one of our real values in this country--to take care of veterans' health benefits. 
   I may have missed one thing or two. But I will summarize the effect of all of that. 
   We will have cut the national debt in half by creating that surplus and setting it there. We have reduced the national debt in half, substantially more than the President reduced the national debt. We think that is very, very good for our future. 
   I might say it is obvious that a number of our domestic accounts, aside from those that we treat with priority and that I have just stated, will go up. It will be very difficult to do all of the things Government is currently doing and meet this budget. In the appropriated accounts of our Government, between defense and nondefense, it is now about 30 percent of the budget, and it is going to be hard for those accounts to fit within this very tightly and stick to the balanced budget numbers. But it was my opinion, with the Senate of the United States, with one Democrat supporting us and the rest of us on our side unanimously voting for this, that we thought the best way to approach a successful American economy was to stick to the balanced budget plan in terms of people believing we meant what we said--that we were going to ``ratchet down'' Government and make sure we had a credible plan to do it. 
   Having said that, if Senator GORTON does not arrive shortly, I will be able to tell Senator LAUTENBERG that we don't have any other speakers. We will check with him right now so I can inform the Senator.

   Mr. DOMENICI. As far as the Senate is concerned, these assumptions are still valid. Although the conference report is silent with respect to the $200 million being directed to the State-side program, there is nothing to assume that the money is not for the State-side program. Indeed, the best indication of the Senate's intent with respect to the LWCF is the Senate-approved resolution.

   Mr. DOMENICI. There is no such presumption. The Senate assumptions are as equally valid as the House assumptions. The real challenge lies ahead when the Appropriations Subcommittees begin marking up their separate appropriations bills. Since our budget assumptions are just that--assumptions--and do not bind appropriators to specified funding levels for individual programs, Senators must vigorously continue to make their case for funding favored programs with the relevant Appropriations Subcommittee. I do  know that the State-side land acquisition program could not have better advocates than the Senators from Rhode Island and New Hampshire.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to alert my colleagues in the Senate to a technical error which occurred during the drafting of section 104 of the Conference Report to accompany H. Con. Res. 68--the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   Section 104 of the resolution sets out the reconciliation instructions for the Committee on Finance in the Senate. This instruction calls for a net reduction in revenues over the 10-year period of fiscal years 2000 through 2009. As is always the case with a reconciled revenue reduction, the amounts contained in the instructions to both the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means committees are intended to be the same. However, due to a technical drafting error with respect to the instruction to the Finance Committee, the amounts are not the same. Three ``zeros'' were omitted from the instruction such that the amount for fiscal years 2000 through 2009 is $777.868 million instead of $777.868 billion. 
   If my colleagues look to other sections of the budget resolution and the statement of managers which accompanies it they will see that the conferees clearly intended the amount in the instruction to the Finance Committee be $777.868 billion not $777.868 million. In addition to the language found in the statement of managers, this intent is evidenced by the figures set out in section 101(1)(B) of the resolution (which states on a year-by-year basis, the amount by which the aggregate levels of Federal revenues should be changed--the sum of these figures is $777.868 billion) and the figures set out in section 101(5) of the resolution (which displays the appropriate levels of the public debt). 
   Moreover, I have consulted with the Parliamentarian of the Senate and have been assured that for the purpose of determining whether or not the legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance complies with the reconciliation instruction contained in section 104 of the budget resolution the Parliamentarian will honor the intent of the conferees--that the 10-year figure is $777.868 billion, not $777.868 million. I am gratified that the Parliamentarian will support a rational result.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to add one response to those who criticize this budget resolution as necessary resulting in all manner of dreamed-up, horror-story kind of cuts in federal border agents, food safety inspections, and other programs selected for the maximum scare value. 
   Here is the truth instead. In 1997, just 2 years ago, the bipartisan budget agreement, and the law that implemented it, set out caps on discretionary spending for 1998 through 2002. And yes those caps were expected even then to be tight as they were encountered each year. In his budget request for 2000, the President appeared to pledge fealty to those caps for 2000, claiming that the caps could be complied with even as CBO demonstrated the President could not deliver on all his spending promises without exceeding the caps by at least $17 billion. 
   Further, the respective minority leaders of both the House and the Senate castigated the congressional majority for even exploring the idea of increasing the caps in this resolution and instead the minority leaders reiterated their devotion to the caps set 2 years ago. So this budget resolution does comply with the caps, just as the President and the Democratic congressional leadership insist it should.  
   But a fair question would be: how do we fund all the discretionary appropriation needs while complying with the discretionary cap discipline? As always, that will be up to the appropriations process. The budget resolution never dictates to the appropriations committee how individual programs or bills should be funded. What the budget resolution does do is suggest in broad categories what some spending priorities ought to be, and in some cases, it suggests, as sort of a menu, some spending reductions or other offsets that the appropriators could consider in constructing the 13 appropriation bills. For example, the Senate-passed resolution indicated that repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act would save significant construction and contract dollars that could be applied to increases in education or defense. Other sources of savings mentioned include food safety inspection fees and spectrum lease fees to encourage more efficient use of spectrum by both private and government users. And in certain specific budget functions, to offset discretionary spending, some functions call for the sale of certain federal assets and other assume specific savings amounts in mandatory programs, which include requiring securities registration for five government-sponsored enterprises and other incentives to encourage competition and rededication to their missions. Other functions call for reducing excessive flood insurance subsidies and imply reactions in certain grants to local governments that are often misdirected to those not the most financial needy. If the appropriations fairly consider these as well as many other savings items contemplated in this budget resolution, they will have opportunities to provide the increases demanded by some and avoid the decreases in vital programs imagined by others, while still complying with the caps.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that completes our work. I want to thank everyone, whether they were with the budget that I prepared or whether they were against it, for their cooperation. And I thank our leadership for getting that budget down here, and the minority leader and the majority leader for helping expedite it. 
   This is the 15th. We know it is a very ominous day out there in America. It is tax day. But on a smaller scale, the Budget Act of the United States says the budget shall be finished in both Houses on this date. I do not think it had anything to do with tax day, but they occur together every year. Only twice in the 25-year history of the Budget Act have we produced budgets in both Houses, the blueprints. 
   They are congressional in nature. They are not Presidential budgets, nor does he sign them. It is historic and significant that as we attempt to get our work done this year and make sure that the American people understand that we are on target for the issues they are concerned about--Social Security, Medicare, tax reduction, defense spending, education and the like--we want them to know that the budget is ready to lead us into a new approach for the next millennium. 
   Everyone doesn't agree, but a very large percentage of the Senators here have voted in favor of this new approach, which I believe will add significantly to the economic future, economic growth and jobs, and at the same time set a pretty good priority for the American Government's expenditures. 
   This does have a philosophical bent to it; that is, if you have excess revenues, you pay down the debt. We have done that. We have almost paid down one-half of the national debt in the next decade--rather significant, good for the economy. We believe when you have even more excess than that, some of it ought to go back to the American people by way of tax reductions, tax reform measures and the like. 
   I regret to say that I believe when the American people have understood all of this, and when they understand these surpluses are not Social Security surpluses, they are over and above that, I think they will agree with us that some of that ought to go back to the American taxpayer. I think it is a good balance between the Government's needs and the taxpayers' rights and the taxpayers' needs. 
   I thank the staff, minority and majority, for the very dedicated service in getting this complicated resolution to the floor. 
   With that, I yield the floor and thank everyone for helping.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to announce to the Senate that the budget resolution, which we have called up and which is being considered, was approved just a while ago by the House, passed there by 220-208. So the remaining real business before we leave for this weekend is to get our budget passed here. I will say, if it is passed today, it would be historic. If it is passed tomorrow, it will still be historic, because we will have produced our budget resolution through both Houses, setting the blueprint for the year before the 15th, which is the statutory date. I will say to the Senate, we have only done that once in the 24-plus years history of the Budget Act. 
   I think our commitment to the Senate was helped by our various committee members, and help came from our ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG, to get the job done. No use to delay it. We have been on the floor, gone through it. Yesterday we took a number of votes that we don't normally take, with Senators exercising their prerogatives to make us vote again on some of the issues. Today there will be a vote on final passage. 
   I remind Senators who might want to speak, whether they are on this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle, we have a unanimous consent agreement already entered into, with the full concurrence of the minority, that whenever we finish this evening--and that could be any time--there will be 5 hours remaining tomorrow. That is because there is a statutory 
   mandate of 10 hours unless agreed to to the contrary. 
   That means that tomorrow we will be on for 5 hours and then vote. If Senators do not make it to the floor in the next hour or so--obviously, they can come down here, and if they want to make it easy on everybody, maybe they can tell Senator LAUTENBERG when they want to come and tell me when they want to come on this side, and we will accommodate them so they don't have to stay down here and wait a long time while others speak. 
   Having said that, I probably will reserve most of my time to answer what others might say about this budget resolution, but I would like to give a summary of where things are. I do not think that will take over 10 or 15 minutes. Then I will yield to Senator LAUTENBERG. I have already told my friend that I have to go across the hall for a Republican policy conference, and I will try to do that as soon as my remarks are completed. 
   Mr. President, let me briefly outline the conference report on the year 2000 budget before us this afternoon. The conference report before us is very similar to the Senate-passed budget resolution back on March 25 on a rollcall vote of 55-44. A similar but different House-passed budget resolution required a conference. That conference resulted in some modifications to the Senate-passed resolution which I will highlight later in my remarks. The basic outline for entering the millennium with a fiscal policy and a tax policy and a defense policy and an education policy, the basic content of that with some modifications is, indeed, what the Senate has before it again today. 
   First, this is a 10-year budget resolution. We have done a 5-year resolution and 7-year resolution, but this year is the first time we have used 10 years to make our projections and upon which to build the building blocks for the first part of this new millennium. 
   Now, we have done 5-year budgets and we have done 7-year. Why did we do 10? Well, the President's budget presentation in February was very unique, very different than any President has ever done before. The President and his staff tried to use 15 years, and that is 15-year numbers, and in some cases, 15-year estimates. This 15-year timeframe was a very convenient way to shade the fact that they were and are counting on raiding the Social Security surplus in the early years by $158 billion over the first 5 years of the President's budget. Without any attempt to obfuscate, clearly it uses $158 billion of the Social Security surplus for programs, for expenditures, so it was, indeed, a raid on that Social Security surplus, and then leave it to future Presidents and future Congresses to reimburse that trust fund for this administration's early spending plans which would have used some of Social Security's surpluses. 
   That is most interesting, especially because the President will be claiming that he is trying to save the Social Security surplus. I put out the challenge to anyone who wants to review the President's proposal and this proposal and see if anybody is entitled to the claim that we are saving Social Security's trust fund accumulations, exempting it, can't use it for taxes, can't use it for appropriated accounts. If you would like to look at it and see which does the most, I think you will find that the President puts $400 billion, that is ``billion,'' less in the trust fund during the next decade, or let me put it another way, on a 10-year basis, it shortchanges the trust fund by $400 billion. 
   That is as compared with what really ought to be in the 
   fund. We put in what really ought to be in the fund, and that is all of it, all of the surplus year by year, not a portion of it over 15 years. 
   So we think we can properly say the first responsibility of this budget was to make sure that we did everything possible to protect the Social Security trust fund and to make it available for those who might want to reform, or in a major way change the Social Security program to add to its longevity and perhaps its fairness. But only for that purpose can any of that trust fund be used. That is the first big item. The conference agreement accomplishes that first objective, protects Social Security trust fund balances. Then we go on to three other major items. 
   Two, we didn't see any way that we could produce a budget to enter the millennium that did not maintain the fiscal discipline of the 1997 budget agreement. The distinguished occupant of the Chair, a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and other committees, knows that it wasn't very long ago that we set a fiscal discipline pattern which has brought us a great deal of success. We said we are only going to spend so much over the next 5 years. It wasn't over a prolonged period, just 5 years. That, plus some other good fortunes that are attributable to economic growth and prosperity, has brought us the best fiscal policy of any industrialized Nation in the world--sustained growth, manifold numbers of jobs, low inflation, and low interest rates. 
   We thought it was best that we stay on that path. So the second point is that the fiscal discipline is retained from the 1997 agreement. Why shouldn't it? There are those who say it is too tough. There are those who say we can't live by it. 
   There are those who say the President is going to force us to break this budget. Well, we aren't going to let the President do that. If that is what he thinks we ought to do, we will have to hear from him. We are going to try hard to live within those prescribed limits, which brought such credibility to the fiscal policy ideas of this Government that I believe we ought to stick with them for awhile. 
   Now, the third is another idea that somehow or another has been challenged here in the Congress, and that is that we want to return to the American taxpayer their overpayments to the Federal Government. Now, what we on our side of the aisle--and we hope some Democrats join us before the year is over--would like to say is that when you have an economy like this one,  with surpluses that we have, you should not just be thinking about spending money; you ought to be thinking about the taxpayer, too. In fact, maybe you ought to say let's look at government and let's look at the taxpayers and let's make sure we have as little government as possible, so that we consider the taxpayers to the maximum extent and have them paying the lowest taxes possible within a good, sound policy. 
   So while some will say, ``I would like a tax cut but not this one,'' or, ``I would like a tax cut, but not now; I would like it later, but I would like a little bit now and then wait for 5 or 6 years,'' we say the policy is a clear one. The United States succeeds when we have low taxes and we exceed our competitor countries in the world predominantly on the premise that our businesses and our individuals pay less taxes than those competing with us. That is a truism with regard to all of the European countries that try to compete. They are heavily taxed; we are taxed at a low level. They have huge burdens on 
   business to take care of social welfare programs; we have far less. 
   As a result, business is flourishing in America and we are adding, if not hundreds of thousands, then in a few of the past 6 years, even a few million new jobs. And it is interesting to note, Mr. President, as we consider this budget, if a poll were taken of American business, in particular the medium-sized businesses that are flourishing in our country, and we were to ask them, ``Can't you grow a little more?'' they would all answer, ``Yes.'' And then if we said, ``Why aren't you?'' the No. 1 answer would be, ``We can't find enough skilled workers to add to our workforce to grow as we could.'' 
   Now, that is a very interesting thing for America, and it does mean that there is one long-term problem we ought to be concerned about, which is the validity of our education system to give basic-skill education and basic-skill development to more and more of the young people and those who would like to be retrained in America. 
   I guess, as an aside, if that doesn't happen, then I know we should not be talking about how we will be able to meet the needs of our businesses. But I surmise that if we don't create more educational skill opportunities for more and more of our people within a decade, we will be looking at an American policy that is going to let more people come in from outside our country to take our jobs. 
   I hope everybody listening to these remarks knows in what sequence I have said it. Clearly, I would like very much to get to the next point in our budget, because within these fiscal restraints we have taken a look at where the priorities for the expenditure of money, even in this crimped manner, the budget following this fiscal restraint, should be. 
   I believe Americans would agree with us that we ought to increase spending on education. In fact, if you looked at the President's budget, you would probably say that is not enough; it is sort of a nominal increase. We have said that, and we have increased our recommendations for public education assistance significantly over the President's. In fact, if the recommendation of the Budget Committee were accepted, we would increase, over the next 5 years, spending on education by $28 billion. 
   Everybody should know, we don't pay for a lot of public education. Local expenditures are, by far, most of it. Perhaps our country pays 7 percent of the bill; 93 percent is paid by local school districts, States, et cetera. We asked that we put more in, but we expressed a big concern--that in doing that we not provide targeted U.S. Government programs mandating the school districts to do things our way, but rather that we have accountability and flexibility built into the education programs that we add money for. So our budget does that. 
   Next, we created a non-Social Security surplus of about $92 billion for unexpected contingencies, that is, we didn't spend it for tax cuts or on anything else. It starts in the fifth year. It is $92 billion for unexpected contingencies. That could be used for transition costs for implementing fundamental reform in Medicare. Or if we did not use it for any of those things, that is, contingencies and/or Medicare reform, then they would further reduce the national debt. 
   Understanding that I started my remarks by saying we set aside $400 billion more than the President in the first decade of the Social Security trust fund and lock it in a box that we 
   are going to vote on later, all of that is used to reduce the public debt until we use it for Social Security. It dramatically reduces the public debt. That is one of the best things we can do, and we did $400 billion more of debt reduction during the first decade than the President. 
   We are proud of that and we think it is the best use of the surplus, and the second best use is to return it to the taxpayers, so we return to them a substantial amount in tax reform, tax cuts, which is $778 billion. So there will be no confusion, add up all of those numbers I speak of and you keep the Social Security trust fund intact, you leave $102 billion for expected contingencies, and you cut the taxes of the American people by $752 billion over a decade. 
   I don't want anybody to be surprised, but the Republican tax package will not be big at the inception; it will be small. But in one bill, we will pass tax changes that will wedge out and grow each year, and in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh years, you will be providing significant tax relief to the American taxpayer. Frankly, I believe that is just about perfect. 
   Some are fearful of it because we provide it over 10 years. But I think the American economy is experiencing a tremendous boon right now. I think these tax cuts are going to trigger in --I don't mean ``trigger in'' in the sense that anything will have to happen. I will use another word. It will come into play at just about the time when we need tax cuts for the American people and American business, so we can continue the prosperity, growth, and opportunity that is so prevalent today. 
   In summary, those are the things we tried to do, and those are the things that show up in this budget resolution. After conferring, almost all of those principles that started here in the Senate are kept. I am pleased to indicate that some of the other things the Senate had in its budget resolution are kept in this resolution. So let me tell you a couple of those. 
   First, the conference adopted the Abraham-Ashcroft-Domenici sense-of-the-Senate framework for protecting Social Security surpluses through a mechanism for retiring debt held by the public and made it a sense of the entire Congress. That means that both the House and the Senate will use every effort possible to try to pass what we will nickname here today ``lockbox'' legislation, which would be statutory preservation of that fund, requiring a majority vote to dip into it. We will have more to say about that. It will then be perfected and introduced soon, after consultation with more experts. We think we will have one that is flexible enough, yet rigid enough, to make sure that we don't spend that money. 
   In addition, yesterday afternoon, for the second time, the Senate voted on a child care proposal that had passed the Senate with a 57-40 vote, including 15 or 16 Republicans. Yesterday, in revisiting it, more Senators expressed their will for that. 
   While in conference, I was not able to get the House to give on it in its entirety. We got $6 billion. Half goes for the block grant that Senator DODD and Senator JEFFORDS discussed, and half is indicated in the tax package and should be used for tax relief that is child care oriented for as many families in America as possible. 
   Now, I believe that the leadership of both the Senate and the House have made a commitment in this conference report to go beyond the resolution before the Senate today to try to pass legislation to make sure for the first time in history we truly have made it almost impossible in the future to spend the Social Security trust fund for the ordinary expenditures of our budget as a ``basket'' from which we borrow for overextending our receipts. 
   This resolution maintains the fiscal discipline required by law. Statutory caps cannot be changed by a budget resolution, and they are now written into the law. It does not assume any firewalls between defense and nondefense discretionary spending. We are  not trying to protect defense from domestic spending in this era of great demands on both. We will just let the good judgment of the Congress, in its collaborative efforts, do its will with reference to the defense spending and the domestic spending. 
   However, in our recommendations, we do substantially increase defense beyond that which the President requested. We do that forthrightly and openly. We believed, even before the Kosovo situation, that the U.S. Department of Defense was being underfunded. We finally asked the Joint Chiefs what they really needed. They expressed genuine concern, so we added most of their requests to the defense assumptions. 
   This resolution makes no decision on the expansion or extension of the caps beyond 2002. It assumes, on the other hand, that discretionary spending will grow over the decade, increasing at a rate of about half the rate of inflation and expanding to a total of $2.9 trillion over the next 5 years and $5.9 trillion over the next decade. 
   Within the aggregate numbers on the face of the resolution, and again as required by law, the level of appropriation is distributed by budget function for illustrative purposes, but everyone should know the final decision will be a matter for the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittees. Everybody is beginning to understand that the budget resolution was not intended to be a determiner of how much money each program gets, but rather the total that they must not exceed. 
   The conference report assumed the priorities I mentioned. I will add one clarification on elementary and secondary education. In the first year, we increased it $3.3 billion in our allocation assumption and $28 billion over 5 years. That would be over and above the estimated $100 billion that would be expended for these programs during the same time period. 
   We assume full funding of transportation programs adopted last year. We assume full funding of the violent crime trust fund next year. We also have assumed $1.7 billion in additional veterans' health care benefits over the President's request for this year. 
   Within the spending restraints, it is assumed that the historic pay equity between civilian and military pay will be maintained. It assumes that the Congress funds the President's request for the upcoming census, and it assumes we double the request for the National Institutes of Health--double his increase. 
   I think that clearly puts us on the side that most Americans desire. We increase defense, we increase education, we increase those functions of our Government that take care of crime and criminal justice in our country. In addition, we take care of our veterans. The President did not even increase, to any extent, the veterans' medical appropriations. We added about $1.7 billion. 
   Adding those up, and adding a return of tax dollars to the American people with the kind of protection for Social Security and Medicare that we have provided, I believe we have a very good format to begin the millennium, the year 2000 budget. 
   To maintain the fiscal discipline of the caps and reorder spending toward these and other national needs, it is clear that the Congress will need to set priorities. If not, then some of the proposals I have outlined will likely not be possible. 
   What are some of those lesser priorities on the Federal taxpayers' dollars? 
   First, last year we appropriated over $106 billion for programs whose authorizations did not exist. A good place to start looking for lower priority programs in the Federal Government might be in those areas where no authorization exists. 
   In addition to the unauthorized programs, as I have stated previously, it would be helpful if the Congress reviewed the GAO's recent high-risk series which lists 26 areas this year--nearly 40 percent which have been designated high risk for 10 years--areas that GAO has found to be vulnerable to waste, fraud, and error. 
   Second, it is clear that some programs will not grow, will remain at their 1999 level, and some will have to be reduced below a freeze as the President's budget suggested. I would suggest that committees and the administration take to heart the Government performance and results act that specifically identifies low performing and inefficient programs. 
   Some programs, such as various transportation projects funded last year outside TEA-21, were one time and we should not assume continued funding of such programs next year. 
   The conference assumes that Ginnie Mae will become a private operation and its auction creates nearly $2.8 billion in offsets next year. 
   And yes, the conference resolution assumes, some of the administration's proposed offsets, fees, are assumed for various agencies in the Federal Government--FSIS and the President's proposed $200 million broadcasters lease fee. 
   In the area of mandatory savings. The resolution does not assume any of the President's nearly $20 billion 
   reductions in Medicare over the next 5 years. Medicare spending will indeed increase from $195 billion this year by over $200 billion to a total of $395 billion in 2009, an annual increase of 7.3 percent. 
   And the resolution assumes $6.0 billion in additional resources will be allocated to the Agriculture Committee to address the issue of depressed incomes in that sector. 
   The Senate-passed resolution assumed that expiring savings provisions in 2002, that were enacted in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, would be extended. This applied to all such provisions except expiring Medicare savings provisions. Between 2003 and 2009 these provisions would save $20 billion. 
   In conference the Senate receded to the House position that did not assume any of these savings provisions. In part this accounts for the fact that the non-Social Security surplus over the next decade has declined to $92 billion. 
   The Senate-passed resolution included the Dodd-Jeffords amendment to add $12 billion to child care spending over the next decade. The spending was offset with a reduction in the reconciled tax cut. The House had no such assumption. 
   The Senate voted yesterday to instruct the conference to adopt this provision. The conference assumes half of these resources for families with children to cover child care expenditures--$6 billion. These expenditures reduced the non-Social Security surplus and did not reduce the reconciled tax reduction. 
   For revenues the conference resolution assumes that tax reductions will be phased in and over the next 5 years will return overpayments to the American public of nearly $142 billion and $778 billion over the next 10 years. For 2000, paid for tax cuts of up to $15 billion are possible. 
   How these tax reductions are carried out will, of course, be determined by the Finance Committee and ultimately the Congress and the President. 
   However, I believe elimination or reduction in the marriage penalty could easily be accommodated within these levels as well as extension of expiring R&D tax credits, self-employed health insurance deductions, certain education credits, and or general reductions in tax rates phased in over time. 
   Finally, the resolution, being cautious, over a 10-year period, projects a non-budget surplus of over $92 billion. This money could be needed for unexpected emergencies or contingencies, it also could support the cost of funding transition costs for Medicare reform, or if nothing else it will continue to further retire debt held by the public. 
   Two procedural issues need to be noted--a rule change as it relates to defining emergencies and a clarification that when there is an on-budget surplus, those amounts are not subject to pay-go rules. 
   The Senate-committee-reported resolution included a provision to make emergency spending items subject to a supermajority point of order. This provision was adopted by the conference, while exempting Defense spending. 
   Let me close by saying that under this resolution, debt held by the public will decline by nearly $463 billion more than under the President's budget. 
   This is true even if one treats the President's Government equity purchases as debt reduction. 
   Why do we reduce debt more than the President? 
   First, the President spends $158 billion of the Social Security surplus over the next 5 years. In contrast, the conference resolution saves the entire Social Security surplus. 
   And second, let me remind the Senate of one other thing about the President's spending proposal which may  surprise many--his spending costs more than the resolution's assumed tax reductions. This is true over both the 5-year and 10-year period. 
   The President's budget spends 35 percent of the Social Security surplus over the next 5 years on programs unrelated to Social Security or Medicare. 
   That is why we can save the entire Social Security surplus and why he can not. 
   Let me summarize. The conference report does four things: It protects 100 percent Social Security surpluses; it maintains the fiscal discipline this Senate overwhelmingly supported in 1997 and was most recently reaffirmed by the minority leader; it returns to the American public their tax overpayments; and finally, it prudently and cautiously projects on-budget surpluses for further debt reduction or for supporting unexpected emergencies, and possible transition costs for true Medicare reform like the one recently voted on by 11 of the 17 members of the National Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
   It is a good resolution to close out the Budget Act's 25-year silver anniversary this year. 
   It is a good fiscal blueprint for the next century. 
   Commenting for a minute about the tax proposals in this bill, in the next 5 years Congress will be permitted under this budget resolution to reduce taxes on the American people by $142 billion, and in the second 5 years the total will be $778 billion. 
   The first and second year cannot be very big, depending on what loopholes are closed by the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee. We can have a goodly tax in the first 2 years, moving up in a ``wedged'' manner to some very substantial return of taxes to the American people over this next decade. 
   There may be remarks on the floor about what these tax cuts will look like. Certain Republican Senators, including some of our leadership, may say what they prefer. That permits the Democratic leadership and Democratic Senators to get up and say they don't think we ought to give tax cuts to the rich, that we ought to spend it elsewhere rather than giving it to the rich people of our country. 
   This budget resolution gives the Congress of the United States and its committees full latitude to have a tax cut bill of whatever type the Congress and its committees ultimately approve and, hopefully, that the President will sign. I am quite sure when that package is finally put together the good judgment of the tax-writing committees, with Congress exerting its concerns, it will be a balanced package, focused on average Americans and on continuing the economic prosperity of our country. 
   If we do that, then I believe there may be disagreement between Republicans and Democrats, but I do believe it will not be the package that is constantly suggested by Democrats--that we are going to take care of only the high-bracketed people, instead of spending it on programs that are good. 
   I can do no better than that. I don't know that I will answer every time we are accused of having a tax cut that takes care of only the wealthy in our country. The facts are as I have indicated. Whether or not Senators have taken to the floor or given stump speeches or otherwise saying what they would prefer, we probably ought to give some serious consideration to reducing the brackets, with taxation more proportionally on every group of people. I am sure the package will be fair in building American prosperity by cutting taxes in the right places for economic growth. 
   I make one last comment about the return of tax dollars to the American people. I have been heard to say that as a Budget Committee member and chairman somehow or another when we finally get to that place where we can have surpluses for as far as the eye can see--according to those who estimate for us--I have been heard to say that maybe it is harder to manage surpluses than it is deficits. Yesterday my good friend, Senator LAUTENBERG, indicated that probably that is how it should be, because it is human nature that when you have real assets, you fight over them; with deficits you do the best you can. 
   I have found it more difficult to give taxpayers tax relief when we have had a surplus than I found as a budget chairman to give tax relief when we had deficits. That is rather incredible. 
   But I think the history will indicate that we have had many tax cuts, giving back money to the taxpayers, when we had deficits. Now we have a criticism of Republicans who want to give back tax money to those who have overpaid, because we have more money than we need; that we should not be doing it now. If you cannot do it when you have a surplus, when can you? If you cannot do it with a surplus, when should you? 
   It seems to me the answer is we probably ought to have a major tax reduction bill. I would think before the year is out the President of the United States will get into the act. He is probably still looking back to his first campaign, before he was elected, when he promised a middle-income tax cut. I know, in reading about the politics of the White House during the intervening years, that some of his consultants brought up that issue regularly during his campaign and first year in office--what about the tax cuts? Maybe they were not right in his scheme of things then, but I submit, with this kind of surplus, they are right now. 
   We look forward, after this budget resolution is passed--and hopefully that will be tomorrow--to working within the Congress--and hopefully Congress with the Executive--to take care of our public needs and take care of our taxpayers' needs. But we will always be vigilant that we not put one over the other, since it is the taxpayers who make our Government capable of doing what it does. 
   With that, I yield the floor and repeat to Senators, if you do not get to speak this evening, there are 5 hours tomorrow. We will be glad to start taking names for tomorrow.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Missouri, I appreciate your leadership in protecting Social Security. After the President's budget was released and it proposed to raid $158 billion from the Social Security trust funds, you told me that Congress needed to protect Social Security. You were right. If memory serves me correctly, you introduced the first bill in the Senate this year to protect Social Security by using a point of order mechanism. I was pleased to be your first cosponsor. The inclusion in this conference report of the point of order is the first step to protect Social Security. I look forward to working with you, Senator ABRAHAM and other Senators in putting into law, not just the House and Senate rules, provisions that will further protect the Social Security trust funds.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise with great pleasure to introduce the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999. I also thank Senator WELLSTONE, my cosponsor, and the other Senators who have already joined me in an effort to make this case. This will say to the insurance companies and the businesses of America, unless they have 25 or fewer employees, their insurance coverage of their employees and their employees' families, if there is going to be mental illness or mental disease coverage, they will have to, as to severe illnesses, have coverage with full parity. As to other mental illnesses, they will have to stop trying to get around the parity law by cutting some of the copays and the like. This will prohibit that. 
   Essentially, we are going to take a piece of America that is currently discriminated against in health care because those Americans do not have a disease that is a disease of the heart but have a disease of the brain. We now can define it sufficiently that there is no reason to cover one and not the other, and in the process we will stop discriminating against about 10 million American families. 
   Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure and excitement to introduce the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999. I would also like to thank Senator WELLSTONE for once again joining me to cosponsor this important piece of legislation. 
   The human brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other organs of our body, it is subject to illness. And just as illnesses to our other organs require treatment, so too do illnesses of the brain. 
   Medical science is in an era where we can accurately diagnose mental illnesses and treat those afflicted so they can be productive. I would ask then, why with this evidence would we not cover these individuals and treat their illnesses like any other disease? 
   We should not. So, I would submit there should not be a difference in the coverage provided by insurance companies for mental health benefits and medical benefits. 
   The introduction of this bill marks a historic opportunity for us to take the next step toward mental health parity. As my colleagues know, this is an issue I have a long involvement with and I would like to begin with a few observations. 
   I believe that we have made great strides in providing parity for the coverage of mental illness. However, mental illness continues to exact a heavy toll on many, many lives. 
   Even though we know so much more about mental illness, it can still bring devastating consequences to those it touches; their families, their friends, and their loved ones. These individuals and families not only deal with the societal prejudices and suspicions hanging on from the past, but they also must contend with unequal insurance coverage. 
   I would submit the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 is a good first start, but the act is also not working. While there may be adherence to the letter of the law, there are certainly violations of the spirit of the law. For instance, ways are being found around the law by placing limits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits. 
   That is why I believe it is time for a change. 
   Some will immediately say we cannot afford it or that inclusion of this treatment will cost too much. But, I would first direct them to the results of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. That law contains a provision allowing companies to no longer comply if their costs increase by more than 1 percent. 
   And do you know how many companies have opted out because their costs have increased by more than 1 percent? Only four companies out of all the companies throughout the country. 
   Mr. President, with that in mind I would like to share a couple of facts about mental illness with my colleagues: 
   Within the developed world, including the United States, 4 of the 10 leading causes of disability for individuals over the age of 5 are mental disorders. 
   In the order of prevalence the disorders are major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. 
   Disability always has a cost and the direct cost to the United States per year for respiratory disease is $99 billion, cardiovascular disease is $160 billion, and finally $148 billion for mental illness. 
   One in every five people--more than 40 million adults--in this Nation will be afflicted by some type of mental illness. 
   Nearly 7.5 million children and adolescents, or 12 percent, suffer from one or more mental disorders. 
   Schizophrenia alone is 50 times more common than cystic fibrosis, 60 times more common than muscular dystrophy and will strike between 2 and 3 million Americans. 
   Let us also look at the efficacy of treatment for individuals suffering from certain mental illnesses, especially when compared with the success rates of treatments for other physical ailments. For a long time, many who are in this field--especially on the insurance side--have behaved as if you get far better results for angioplasty then you do for treatments for bipolar illness. 
   Treatment for bipolar disorders--this is, those disorders characterized by extreme lows and extreme highs--have an 80-percent success rate if you get treatment, both medicine and care. Schizophrenia, the most dreaded of mental illnesses, has a 60-percent success rate in the United States today if treated properly. Major depression has a 65-percent success rate. 
   Let's compare those success rates to several important surgical procedures that everybody thinks we ought to be doing: Angioplasty has a 41-percent success rate; atherectomy has a 52-percent success rate. 
   I would now like to take a minute to discuss the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999. The bill seeks a very simple goal: (1) provide full parity for severe biologically based mental illnesses; (2) prohibit limits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits; and (3) eliminate the Mental Health Parity Act's sunset provision. 
   The bill would provide full parity for the following mental illnesses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive and severe panic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, autism, and other severe and disability mental disorders. 
   Like the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, the bill does not require a health plan to provide coverage for alcohol and substance abuse benefits. Moreover, the bill does not mandate the coverage of mental health benefits, rather the bill only applies if the plan already provides coverage for mental health benefits. 
   In conclusion, the bill expands full parity to those suffering from a severe biologically based mental illness and it closes a loophole in the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 by prohibiting limits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits and I would urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just make a couple points for everyone. First, I think everybody here understands that when you go to conference, you go to conference with the House. You do not go to conference with yourself. If that were the case, we would rule supreme and there would be no need to go to conference, and whatever the House thought about any of these measures would be totally irrelevant. I think everybody understands that isn't the case. We have to go to conference with them. 
   Secondly, I would like to make two points about what we do in our budget and what the President did so everybody will understand. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG talks about the Republican budget and the lockbox that we contemplate and speculates that he does not know what it might be used for. Let me tell everybody so they will understand. For starters, in the first 10 years the Republican budget, and that which will be locked in to be spent as we determine in conference, is $300 billion--you got it, $300 billion--more than the President proposes to set aside for safekeeping for the Social Security trust account. 
   Why is that the case? Because we say, put 100 percent of 
   the accumulated surplus that belongs in the trust fund in the trust fund. For all the rhetoric about who is saving what, we put $300 billion more in there than the President, because the President concocted a 15-year payout for this trust fund. We have never even had a budget that contemplates 15 years. In fact, the President, when he goes beyond 5, he does  not even have the programs enumerated in his budget, but he is telling us all, wait 15 years, and we will put enough money in that trust fund that is supposed to be there for some security. We said, put it in now as it accrues year by year--not 62 percent of it; 100 percent. 
   In addition, for those who are wondering what we are doing about Social Security and what the President does about it, let me remind you, we do not spend one nickel of Social Security, of their money, for any new program. The President of the United States, in his budget, decided that it was not important to save Social Security by keeping their money. He had contemplated spending out of the Social Security trust fund $158 billion. Let me repeat, we now have a motion by the other side of the aisle, our good Democratic friends, challenging what we are doing, when the President of the United States spent $158 billion, in the first 5 years, out of the Social Security trust fund without any apologies--just said, ``Spend it.'' We say, ``Don't spend it. Keep it in the trust fund, and put it in a statutorily created lockbox that will be tied to debt limits so it can never be spent.'' 
   Having said that, it is really ironic that the other side of the aisle claims the President is doing so much for Social Security, and they would like to join on his coattails, so much for Medicare, and they would like to join on his coattails, and the facts are what I have just told you. The facts are what I have just told you. 
   Fellow Senators, you do not have to be worried about whether that Social Security trust fund is going to be used for tax cuts, because we cannot direct that any of that money be used for tax cuts. In fact, go read the resolution. It says tax cuts are to come from a mandated reconciliation pot of money that is called on-budget surplus. 
   Mr. President, forget all the jargon. It means that tax cuts, if any, come out of surpluses that have nothing to do with the Social Security trust fund, by definition. So tax cuts are going to accrue over a decade, and they will come out of surpluses, not the surplus that is accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. 
   Having said that, once again, the amendment is calculated to play politics, and I see no reason why we should not accept the instruction. So if the distinguished Senator would like us to accept it, we can get on with our business and we can accept it right now. If he would like a vote on it, we will tell all our people to vote 100 percent for it because, remember, we have to go to conference with the House, and we will do our very best, but we will be glad to accept it. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield down to 4 1/2 , and then we can both yield back the remainder. 
   Let me say, first of all, I heard that the Senator from California had recently been to my State. Incidentally, I was quite surprised. I walked into the airport in New Mexico, our international airport. I ran into the Senator and asked her if she was coming all the way to New Mexico to try to defeat the budget that we prepared. She told me, ``No. I am here for other purposes.'' I was kind of glad of that, and I surely didn't want New Mexicans to listen to her about the budget when I worked so hard to try to get them to listen to me. She did not quite do that, because I looked around to see how much she got and it was pretty Democratic, what she did, with a big D. 
   Anyhow, let me suggest, Senator, that you should be careful when you use these percentages. You say that what we want, speaking for you, we wanted 62 percent that the President wanted to set aside, and then we wanted 15 percent for Medicare. The budget is a big document, big numbers, but I just added those two up, and that is 77 percent. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-20-19990413</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, we have 100 percent in the first 10 years. So the 15 percent that would have gone to Medicare under the proposal in the committee, added to the percent that the President saved of the Social Security trust fund, is the astronomical percentage of 77 percent of the Social Security trust fund. Guess what we did in our  budget resolution. One hundred. Let's do that one. What is the difference there? Twenty-three percent additional accumulated surplus in the first 10 years is in the lockbox as we prescribed in our budget. Having said that, I relinquish the remainder of my time, if the Senator will relinquish his.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I apologize to Senator KENNEDY for not being here. I assume it is fair to say that I probably heard his argument as we put the budget through. It is similar to the one he made before. That doesn't mean I shouldn't have been here. But I just couldn't. When the time is up, let me ask if we could get a unanimous consent on stacked votes. 
   Mr. President, I would like to talk just for a moment about the Republican budget as it pertains to a blueprint for our country's future. When I have used up about 6 minutes of my 15, will the Chair advise me? I appreciate that. 
   First of all, let me say to those who are listening that we have a situation that is pretty unique in our country, and it is a situation that we ought to look at very carefully to see what the public policy ought to be and what would be best for America's future. 
   The American taxpayer has received a bonanza in new taxes. As a matter of fact, there is now going to be over the next decade a huge surplus. ``surplus'' means the taxes collected exceed the expenditures. That is a surplus. We were used to living in a deficit. ``Deficit'' means the expenditures, the program costs, are more than the taxes that come in. 
   For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is a sustained recovery; low interest rates, partially attributable to good, sound, budget policies; high productivity, because we have added new machines and equipment to  the production of service organizations and what they sell to the American people, we have more money coming in than we are going to spend. Over the decade, it is going to be a very large amount of money. 
   Where we depart from the Democrats who have been arguing on the floor--not all Democrats--the principal position on our side is that we think we don't need some of that big surplus paid in by the taxpayer, which means they are paying more than we need to run the Government year by year; we think a portion of that should go back to the taxpayer by way of tax changes that will help our taxpayers and will help the economy continue to grow and produce jobs and be a strong economy. 
   We say there are three very important things to take care of, one of which is to give back some taxes to the American people, who are paying in more than they expected in terms of our Government. There are some who say we shouldn't do that or the budget resolution ought to state exactly how we are going to change those tax laws. 
   Frankly, in the Congress we do things a little differently. There is a committee that will determine our tax reductions and our tax changes. All we can do is say we are making some money available for doing that. What we do is take all of the Social Security surplus--not 62 percent of it as does the President, but 100 percent of it--and we say that accumulation, that surplus, is set aside and cannot be used for tax cuts. Under our budget resolution, it is to be used for Social Security reform to pay for any additional costs. We think that is very exciting, and we think that is better than what the President has in mind. It is 100 percent of that surplus. 
   There is a Medicare program which is very important to seniors. We have done three things in this budget regarding Medicare. One, the President cut $20 billion more out of Medicare during the next decade, and we said cut nothing, don't cut any more by way of expenditures out of the Medicare trust fund--$19 billion over 10 years. In addition, our budget plan increases Medicare spending by $200 billion over 10 years, an average of $20 billion a year. Then, starting in the sixth year of this budget, there is an additional $100 billion that does not go to tax cuts, does not go to the Social Security fund, that could be used by Medicare if Medicare needed it. In fact, we believe this is a very, very, ambitious program to make sure Medicare is taken care of. 
   I remind everyone that a strong, powerful economy is one of the best tools to keep Medicare strong. Just a few weeks ago, the trustees in charge said, because things have been going so well, we have increased the life of the Medicare fund from the year 2008 to 2015. We have added between 7 and 8 years by keeping the economy going with a lot of employment and people 
   paying into the Medicare system. 
   We believe this budget is good policy for America. We think it is just as important to talk on the floor of the Senate about who pays all these taxes as what programs we ought to spend the money on. We don't want to just discuss how we can spend the money; we want to discuss the taxpayers. 
   We are saying it is time to fix the Tax Code and make it more fair for married couples, put some other reductions in and return some of those tax dollars to the American people, because we are worried about taxpayers; they deserve our concern. 
   At the same time, we have adequately provided for Medicare and adequately provided for an assured Social Security; that when the changes are made, and only then, will this trust fund money be used for Social Security. 
   We are involved in an air war over in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, and we are going to need more money for that war. Everybody understands we are going to do that when we are asked. We will have it. It will change how much can go for taxes and how much can be held in reserve. It will change some of that, but actually that is a very high priority. 
   I say to Senators and my fellow Americans that in our regular budget we provided for some very significant increases in defense and some significant increases in education. If you add that up, it is a pretty good package. We will go to conference with the House. I don't know what we can get out of them, but we will get a good budget. It will be very much like the one we produced. 
   Having said that, I reserve the remainder of my time and hope the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts might yield back some of his time at some point.

   Mr. DOMENICI. We will make a copy of that amendment and distribute it. 
   What we are going to do with this amendment is simply add to the end of the Kennedy amendment two provisions that were voted on by the Senate during the debate, just as most of his instruction was already voted on. These two sections are essentially as follows: No. 1, the Roth, Breaux, and others amendment regarding a bipartisan proposal on Medicare; and, No. 2, an amendment offered by the Budget Committee in behalf of the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, which essentially said that any additional on-budget surplus, non-Social Security money, that existed beyond the tax cut--which is, as I understand, about $102 billion starting 5 years from now--could be available for prescription drugs. 
   Essentially, what we will then do is we will get a request for the yeas and nays on our amendment. I understand, pursuant to the unanimous consent, when it gets called up in order, we will get an additional 2 minutes, 1 minute per side, to explain it. 
   So, essentially I am just asking we add to the end of yours, two proposals that have already been adopted by the Senate: One, the Roth-Breaux et al. on the bipartisan Medicare proposal; and, second, the Budget Committee portion, which was Senator SNOWE's amendment, which said any excess surplus beyond the tax cut and Social Security could be used for prescription drugs. 
   So we will vote on ours first and see what happens to yours. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. That does not mean I do not get excited about things. Look, everything we are talking about here on the floor we just voted on. You either won or you lost. You happen to have won. Senator KENNEDY has a proposal. That already was voted on. He lost. Let's see, what else do we have? Oh, Senator LAUTENBERG has an instruction. We already voted on that. 
   It is interesting. I would just put in perspective for the Senators and for those listening, normally--I have been here for a while; I have wrapped up a lot of budget resolutions--we appoint the conferees. That is what we are doing here, this little administrative job of appointing conferees. We normally do it at the same time we pass those resolutions. So if we finish at 10 o'clock at night, by 10:15 this is gone, they have been appointed. Nobody moves to instruct the conferees, because they just voted on it; they already got their instructions through their votes. 
   We made a mistake. We made a mistake. We should never have seen the press last night. We were not obligated to tell the press we had a meeting. We like to keep them informed. But now, because of everything they said about what we discussed, Senators are saying, ``Well, maybe they are not going to do in that conference what the Senate said we should do, so we are coming to the floor and reproposing the whole thing,'' bringing the issues all back up, even if they lost on them or even, in Senator DODD's case, where he won on them, and we are going to have to vote again. 
   Actually, everybody should understand, an instruction to the conferees, through the process we are doing this afternoon, is nice. It is a wonderful thing. You should be very pleased if you win. But the House isn't bound by it. That is just the simple truth of it. The conference is not between Senators asking for a second vote which will make their will the law; they are asking that we do something with the House to make them go with us. 
   I am not promising that I can do that. If you win here on the floor, I am not promising that I can do that. As a matter of fact, some Senators think I can, that if we are to vote again on Dodd-Jeffords, I should just go over there and I will win that. 
   Well, it isn't quite that easy. I do a little better here on the floor sometimes with all these Senators from both sides than I do sometimes in those conferences. I am not going to offer a second-degree. We all understand the issue. If you want to vote, we will have a vote. 
   I guess I could tell you for myself, I understood very clearly who voted. There were some Republicans who voted with you. I didn't happen to be one. But I am not going to be able to carry any more water with any more assurance or any more power in the water that I carry because we vote again this afternoon than to go to that conference and wrap it up and say, Senator DODD and Senator JEFFORDS won--not that they won this instruction. That would be there. So if you want to save some time, you might just urge me to do it better than the news reports, and I tell you I am going to try. I tell you that if we can't do that, I am going to find some way in the tax instructions to see if we can't do something significant in the area of child care through the Tax Code. But if you would like a vote, that may be an easier way. 
   I say, though, there is a reason that we do not need to vote in additional money for this program. I will tell you what it is. I do not know the ultimate number, but I understand that almost all the States have a very large surplus in the TANF program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. That is the successor to the welfare program, Mr. President. When we sent them the money, we sent them a block of money predicated upon a significant caseload and estimates about how much it would be reduced. 
   It turns out that almost every State has a very large surplus there. What they plan to do with it, not every State but a very large number of them, is to use it for this program. As a matter of fact, I understand the regulations have been approved just yesterday which will authorize the States to use their TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, excesses for the block grant program, which we would still be funding for child care. So essentially I think we are going to have an expanded child care program. I do not think we need to do this, but I do not go to conference based on that. That is just an explanation to the Senate as to why a number of Senators did not think we needed to vote for that when it first appeared and won. 
   Now I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to say, whatever time Senator JEFFORDS needs, a few minutes, we will make sure he gets them. I would like to tell you, since you indicated that you and I have worked together on a lot of things, do you know what you could do for me that would be the best thing going? Not to have so many votes on budget resolutions. What is happening, we spend so much time voting on them that Senators are wondering what this whole process is all about. This year probably 50 percent of the votes, maybe 60 are all on the budget resolution and the four or five today. My job is getting more difficult because of that. Pretty soon Senators will be saying maybe it is not worth all this trouble.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I greatly appreciate the kind remarks of my good friend, and I say to him that on some of the issues he cares about, such as agriculture and the problems of the family farm, he has as much tenacity as anybody around here. I compliment him for that. 
   We are going to accept his motion because it says we ought to try to do better in conference than we did here, and everybody understands that we will do that. If the Senate accepts this, we will try to do that. However, in defense of the budget resolution, I will make two big points that are very important. 
   The budget resolution increased the mandatory spending, the spending for agriculture, $6 billion over what it would have been but for the change we have made--$2 billion in each year, more or less, in this budget resolution. 
   At first we decided we would do $4 billion at the behest of some Senators from the middle of the heartland of the agriculture country. They asked for more. We put $2 billion more in. That has been done. Why do I say that? Because the President of the United States, who has his agriculture Secretary traveling all over the United States in agriculture country talking about the needs of the family farm and the needs of the farmers, did not put one penny of increase for agriculture in their budget. I don't know whether they expected that we would come along because we have Senators who really pushed this and we would put the money in. 
   But I believe for a President of the United States in the midst of an agriculture disaster, more or less, to leave it up to Senators to have to put more money in for agriculture--but you can count on it. They won't be remiss in going out there and talking to the farmer about what they did. They should put up their hand, like this, and say they did zero. At least we put $6 billion new money in for which the distinguished Senator has thanked the Budget Committee when we put it in. And so did his colleague from his State. He thanked the committee. You put in $6 billion. Nobody did at the White House. There was nothing. 
   So it isn't as if we are not concerned and as if we did nothing. As a matter of fact, we have been spending a very healthy amount of money for agriculture. And we are going through some cyclical problems in agriculture, with parts of the worldwide economy not in very good shape. And they used to buy a lot of our agricultural products. We know that. We are getting better at producing more with less acreage, and there seems to be no limit to that. We get better all the time. In other words, the farmer is producing prolifically in the United States, be it the family farmer or the corporate farm. We are producing large amounts. 
   Having said that, I don't know ultimately how we resolve this issue, but for now we are going to conference with this proposal saying we ought to do more, if we can. And, frankly, I appreciate the Senator bringing it to all our attention. 
   It will be accepted now, if he doesn't mind. 
   I yield any time I have.

   The Domenici instruction takes into consideration the Breaux-Thomas bipartisan plan which includes prescription drugs as part of the reform. And this instruction includes that we adopt the Snowe-Wyden provision which allows budget surpluses not currently allocated to the Social Security trust fund, because it is not needed there for taxes, that those surpluses may be used for major Medicare reform. 
   I hope we will adopt this motion. It will be followed by a Kennedy motion that I will speak to later.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate rejected an amendment on this by a vote of 56-43 just a few days ago. It is the identical issue. 
   Senator KENNEDY would have us believe that the President's approach to putting 15 percent of the surplus into IOUs in the Medicare trust fund will help Medicare become solvent. He also suggests, Mr. President, that leading economists support the President's IOU; that is, we will pay for it later. They support that. They support it because we are not spending the money. But we already save $400 billion more than the President and we would apply it to the national debt, which is what the economists thought was good. Our budget is better than this in that regard and it does not put IOUs into a fund, which in this case is a postdated check that somebody will pay for later on--our kids and grandkids. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President and fellow Senators, we have before us a historic resolution, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with historic and brave Senators on it. If we adopt this and follow it, we will save the Medicare program instead of arguing about it. The basic contention here, plain and simple, is that prominent Democrat Senators are joining with Republicans saying let's quit arguing; let's fix it. 
   That is the principal thrust of this resolution. I say to Senator BREAUX, Senator KERREY, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator FRIST, you are to be commended and lauded, because I predict on this day we have started down a short path before the year ends of fixing Medicare for the seniors permanently. We do not have to sit around here and argue about IOUs that the President wants to transfer to a trust fund without dedicating any revenue to the trust fund. 
   How do you fix a trust fund by putting in IOUs when it is all based on revenues coming into the trust fund to pay the bills? 
   I join Senators--I am the fifth Member--as the Budget chairman, because I believe you are on the way, on the road to real success for our seniors. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say, we can leave time for more debate on this. The problem is, we are going to run out of time, and people are not going to get any time on a score of amendments that they think are very, very important, also. From my standpoint, you have control of plenty of the time. If we can get on with the next one, you can reclaim time and use it off the bill if there is somebody who wants to discuss this issue.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say I don't have any objection. Obviously, even if I did, probably I couldn't do anything about it. But I do want to ask Senators if they would be somewhat helpful. I know, now that Senator KENNEDY has a chart up that describes the Democrat plan that doesn't exist, and a Republican plan that doesn't exist, that everybody wants to come to the floor and talk about this. I remind everyone and ask their indulgence and help: We have about 35 to 40 amendments that people want to be heard on. They are legitimately as interested as are colleagues on this issue, which we have already debated three times on three amendments. 
   I am not going to argue about it. I say go ahead, we will give you 10 minutes, but when you take it off the bill, it means it is not available for anyone at the end of this bill. So I ask we be a little bit helpful in that regard. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I think our next Senator with an amendment has arrived. We have agreed your amendment would be next, I say to Senator GORTON. But we have to finish the Kennedy amendment in just a minute here. 
   Just give me a moment, I say to the Senator. 
   First, as I indicated earlier this morning, something very significant happened, and I am sure it will be adopted when we vote later on. That is the introduction of a bipartisan amendment to this budget resolution whereby the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, joined by Senator FRIST, on our side, and two very distinguished Democrats, Senator KERREY of Nebraska and Senator BREAUX of Louisiana, indicated in an official way, for the first time, that the Senate is going to be asked, because of their amendment, to proceed in a bipartisan manner to reform and fix Medicare so that it will be effective for our senior citizens for decades to come. 
   I must say that when we vote on that--and I believe it will be agreed to--we will have started down a path. But it will not be a long path; it will be a very short path. That path is going to lead, before the year is up, to a resolution in the Senate of the Medicare program for our senior citizens and for our children and for the taxpayers, all of whom have a very big stake in making sure this Medicare program is reformed and fixed. 
   So I once again congratulate those four Senators. They have permitted me to join them, so I am the fifth man on the team. I hope, before the day is out, many others will join. But I am certain by our vote we will indicate that that is precisely the path we want to take. 
   Some will get up and say it is very specific and precise. But ultimately, it lays down some markers. It says to the Finance Committee, let's get on with it; let's quit talking about it; let's fix it. 
   It is interesting that as soon as that amendment got 
   debated, a kind of a furor occurred, and it was not on our side of the aisle, it was on the other side of the aisle. That is because that was a significant amendment that people in this country are going to understand. It is not politics; it is not talking; it is a commitment to fix Medicare for our senior citizens. 
   If there are new ideas beyond what the Commission--there are two commissions that are recalled in that amendment--if there are ideas beyond  it, it is going to come out of that bipartisan committee, who are so committed to repairing and fixing and modifying that program. 
   Having said that, the commotion got quick, and the Senator from Massachusetts arrived on the floor. Let me suggest, I have great respect for the distinguished Senator. I do know--I do know--that I am as concerned about Medicare people in America--our people, our friends, our neighbors, our relatives--as he is. I am just as compassionate and just as concerned. But I do believe--I do believe--we have to talk a little bit about reality. 
   Let me tell you the first reality. When the vote starts and the Senator is through with his charts, I would like very much for the rule to be applied and they be taken down, because they are only supposed to be up for a little while. Frankly, whatever little while, they should not have been up at all, because those charts are not true. Those charts state things that are not true. 
   Let me just tell you, ``Republican Plan Would Slash Medicare'' --there is no Republican plan. We are waiting for the Finance Committee to produce a plan. We have given them latitude in the budget resolution, but there is none. It is a bipartisan plan. So he might have said that up there, ``The Bipartisan Plan,'' if it is that plan that he does not like. 
   The chart says that cuts under the Democratic plan are zero. What does that mean? What in the world does that mean? There will be no reform that saves any money, that changes anything in Medicare under a Democratic plan--can't be, can't be. Everybody that is for fixing Medicare is going to have something in that column because they will repair it so it is more efficient. Some will legitimately call that a cut. 
   The next column in the chart is really preposterous, ``Cuts under Republican plan, 1999-2020.'' We have not even been talking about the year 2020 on the floor. There is no budget resolution for 2020 and there is no Republican plan. How can it be that we have $686 billion in cuts by the year 2020? Perhaps that number is if you leave the program alone for 20 years, it needs $686 billion worth of resources--that might be the number. 
   What does that have to do with our Republican plan, what we are talking about on the floor? Is the Senator suggesting we ought to put $686 billion into Medicare out of general taxes to America? It will never happen. That will not happen. Everybody knows that. 
   We have debated this issue. I should stop debating it because I have done it three times, but every time they bring up an amendment I have to get up because they get up. I don't want anybody out there listening to this debate to think that is accurate because that is not accurate. 
   We can put up charts and claim whatever we want, but that chart is not accurate. It does not adequately describe nor appropriately describe anything with reference to where we are. 
   Having said that, we debated and voted an amendment very similar to this amendment. The only thing is it was subject to a point of order. Perhaps Senator KENNEDY has doctored this up so it is not subject to a point of order. The Senate rejected by a majority a plan of Senator CONRAD's which is very similar, except for one thing. It is a little better in terms of trying to protect Medicare than this one. It establishes a point of order of some kind which makes it difficult to spend this extra money that is sitting around, or this surplus that is sitting around. The Kennedy amendment does not even do that. 
   I need no more time. I have used about 5 minutes; the Senator has used 2 1/2 minutes. I hope we get on with the rest of this and let other Senators have a chance to debate.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Senator KENNEDY, I don't know if you were paying attention, but I did say to you that I compliment you on your compassion and your concern in this area. All I indicated was that you in your Irish way are compassionate; I, in my Italian way, am just as compassionate and I compliment you for trying to save Medicare. 
   I now know where the $686 billion came from. So everyone will know--I was wondering where the figure came from--it came from the President's budget, the dollar number that he is going to transfer to the Medicare fund and take back IOUs. 
   Let me tell Members what that is, I finally understand it. It is like postdating a check for all these billions and then saying to the American people, ``You are going to wake up one day when we have to pay them, but we are telling you now in advance you will pay them,'' and the only thing that can happen is we will pay a huge amount of new taxes, or we will have to cut the Medicare program dramatically. 
   I don't think that is how we ought to do business. That is what the number represents. 
   I yield the floor.

And there is absolutely no relationship between this amendment and Medicare, no matter how much the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts wants to say that there is. There is no relationship. This money sits around, can be spent. It is applied to the debt. We already apply more of the surplus to the debt than the President did with the Kennedy amendment. And last, we have already voted on it. We voted on Conrad. It is almost identical.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that a Governor occupies the Chair while I make this statement. 
   Those Governors are friends of ours. The Republicans have been increasing the funding for special education. We do not need a lecture from the Governors about it. What we need is help from the Democrats who have resisted it every time. The President didn't even put an increase in his budget last year. We put the whole increase in. I don't remember if he did much this year, but it is mighty small. It is Senator JUDD GREGG and others who have been leading the parade around here on IDEA. 
   Now, frankly, we would like to ask those Governors who signed that letter, would you like us to cut the extra $3 billion in this budget that we put in and the extra $27 billion that we put in here? If you would like that cut, we will make room for more IDEA money for you. That is an increase in education, and it is left up to the committees to do what they would like, except we would like to make a sense-of-the-Senate resolution binding, adopted by us, that says, let's reform the Federal program and let's make sure that they are more responsive by focusing them in at the local level with local control. 
   Now, we ought to pass that, because it is time we reform it. There is no IDEA issue in this amendment. They are going to raise IDEA in a later amendment. They are going to raise something on special education. 
   So with that, I wish their amendment well when they bring it up. It is high time that they are for significantly increasing funding under special education, but for now we have raised it and we ask that the local control be attached to that with one of the qualities being that it be accountable, that there be accountability in those laws.  
   I yield back the remainder of time so we can move on.

We will see if we can't put ourselves in a position where we might finish a little earlier, perhaps even tonight. I am not sure. This has been worked out by the majority leader, minority leader, and those of us on the floor. I assume there has been consultation elsewhere.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader I ask unanimous consent that following the previously allotted debate times, the following debate times be in order: Hollings amendment on debt reduction; Craig amendment No. 146; Durbin amendment, emergencies; Crapo amendment No. 163; Boxer amendment No. 175; Sessions amendment No. 210--I ask each of the above-listed amendments be limited to 7 1/2 minutes equally divided in the usual form. I ask unanimous consent that, following the conclusion of those debates, I be recognized in order to yield back all remaining debate time on the budget resolution. 
   Therefore, the Senate will then proceed to a stacked series of votes on the remaining pending amendments. I further ask that the first vote be 15 minutes in length, with remaining votes in sequence limited to 10 minutes each, with 2 minutes equally divided between each vote for brief explanations of the amendments. 
   Finally, I ask the votes alternate between Republicans and Democrat amendments.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise with great empathy and sympathy and heartfelt concern about the farmers of the United States. That is why in the budget before you we put $6 billion of new money for crop insurance and other things which was, indeed, modified in the committee so as to accommodate farm Senators by even making sure it was available this coming year. 
   Now, I guess there is an adage around that it is harder to manage the surplus than it was a deficit. I agree with that statement without a question. And here today it is very, very interesting. My wonderful friends on the other side of the aisle, I am sure joined by some on my side of the aisle, are here on the floor about 2 1/2 months after the President of the United States sends his budget to us, and they are lamenting the terrible state of economics for the farmers of America. 
   I did not ask any of them, as they spoke--and I do not know that I will--but frankly, the President of the United States knew about all this. Isn't it interesting he asked for not one red cent for the farmers--zero. Typical. Typical. There is a crisis prevailing. If there is one, the President ought to know about it. He puts nothing in the budget. We put $6 billion in thinking we are being helpful. The President claims he lives within the caps, he isn't breaking any budget. Of course he is not. He did not even provide the $6 billion we did in our budget resolution. 
   Now, $6 billion isn't enough. Hold on, everybody. This is $6 billion a year. This is $30 billion. When is enough enough? So $30 billion of new money on top of the $6 billion we put in is $36 billion in 5 years in new money for agriculture. 
   Frankly, I am fully aware that there is a problem. There are some other sectors of America with problems, big problems--steel, oil and gas. All kinds of pieces of the American economy are having trouble because of the world economy. We are doing a little bit here and there, but we cannot go in and make everybody whole everywhere in America when we are having a downturn that adversely affects their business. 
   If the Senators proposing this want to spend more money because they want a new agriculture program, then I submit they ought to go to the Agriculture Committee and get a new agriculture program written into the laws of this land. I believe they would not get it done. I believe that is why they did not do it. 
   So each year they come along and add a few more billions, and while saying we still have a law around they, little by little, destroy it. If that is what they want, they ought to say it. If they think this amendment is repealing the law we have on the books, let them say it, so then we can at least add this as an amendment to repeal the competitive agricultural reforms that we put in place not too many years ago. 
   Frankly, it will be difficult for some not to vote for $30 billion more in support money for farmers when there is already $6 billion in the bill and when the President of the United States asks for none--zero--zip. No. It is kind of interesting. When is enough enough? It seems to me that this amendment is an indication that for some it does not matter what you put in a budget resolution because it will not be enough. 
   I believe $6 billion in new money for agriculture, addressing the most significant issue they have, crop insurance, is sufficient at this point. Maybe we have an emergency, maybe the President should have looked at the emergency before he sends us a budget with nothing in it for farmers so we have to come along and put it in, cut other programs in our arsenal, or in this case reduce the tax cuts that we planned for the American people. 
   I just do not think that is right. I would hope some would listen today. I am not sure how many. Normally I try to accommodate, but I don't think, as one trying to write budgets, that I can accommodate today. Either they win or my position 
   prevails. If I could find another way, I would try it. I just do not think there is one. 
   Either we decide that in an era of surpluses the American taxpayer does not matter a bit--you remember what some of us said, why it would be difficult to manage a surplus. You remember? Because we will spend it all; we will spend it all. Why did the Senator from New Mexico say, ``Yes, you can claim you put it all on the surplus and it's sitting there to get rid of the debt.'' Why did I say, I do not choose that method. I choose it for all the Social Security money, but I do not choose it for everything. I said, ``Because you know what, we'll spend it. Then we'll have bigger Government, the public will be paying for bigger Government, and they'll be paying more and more taxes.'' And that isn't the right kind of America. 
   So, Mr. President, I have some additional time, and depending upon what is said in the remaining 5 minutes that they have on the other side, that the proponents have, I may yield back the remainder of my time. But for now I reserve it.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senator is right, that this is a question of priority. 
   The Senator mentioned missile defense. He said it will cost $1.5 billion. We don't need it; we shouldn't pay for it. What would be prioritizing would be if he would move to strike the missile defense system. The problem is, if he did that, he would find that not only the American people would say no, but 65 or 70 Senators would say no. He picked the wrong program, because most Americans think we have a missile defense system. They think if a rogue country or North Korea or China sent a missile to the United States that we could destroy it. The truth of the matter is, whoever thinks that is wrong. We don't. 
   Republicans have been saying, and now we are joined by Democrats, use every single technological achievable end to get a missile defense system started. That is a high priority, too. 
   I don't know what else the Senator mentioned, but whatever he mentioned, the truth of the matter is he could come to the floor and say farmers have a higher priority than this whole list of things in the Government. That is not what is being done; it is just making the Government bigger. 
   In fact, it is very interesting. It is a tax-and-spend proposal. It is increasing the taxes on the people of this country because we intend to give them back some to pay for more Government. I think Government is about as big as it ought to be. I remind everyone, the President put nothing in for the state of emergency. For a President who is worried about Main Street, and everything else alluded to on the floor, isn't that interesting? 
   We did what we thought was right and put in $6 billion. The first amendment that was sent to the desk would have cost $60 billion. I was in error--now it is $30, it has been modified. The price is cut in half in about 26 minutes. I laud the Senator for modifying it. I wish it were still at 60--we could argue about 60. That sounded like a good, round number. 
   Having said that, I reserve my time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say that I believe, after talking to Senator LAUTENBERG, the staffs can work together on this and that the sense-of-the-Senate part of this amendment, advocating the kind of tax cuts that were referred to by the Senator in his sense-of-the-Senate paragraph, might be acceptable to Senator LAUTENBERG, and we can then accept it without a vote. But I would just like to make an observation while we wait to see whether that will happen. I hope it doesn't make the Senator from New Jersey change his mind. I don't think it will. 
   Frankly, I said a while ago it is easier to manage a budget when we are not in surplus. I am almost prepared to say it is easier for the taxpayer to get a tax cut when we do not have a surplus than when we do. 
   Now, I haven't checked the history of the last six or seven tax cut bills, but obviously we were not in balance because we just got in balance. We gave tax cuts because we thought they were necessary, prudent. To the American people, our businesses, large and small, others--maybe those who have their businesses at home--ought to be able to deduct their health care like everyone else. We come around and say those things ought to be done. 
   Now we have a surplus, and I will be darned; it is tougher to get concurrence that we ought to give some of it back to the people than when we borrowed it to give it back to them. So I was thinking as the debate occurred, who has been forgotten by this Government? Who is looked upon as sort of a silent partner in all this but shouldn't be terribly worried about it? It seems to me it is the taxpayer. 
   Asked on our side, we would say reducing taxes, making sure Social Security is fixed--and we have done that. Everybody is now joining us on 100 percent of the surplus when held for that --Medicare; we have had a bipartisan approach here saying let's get it done--and that leaves the taxpayer. I kind of say, poor taxpayers. We ought to put them right up at the top, and that is sort of what the intention of my friend from Minnesota was. Whatever the language, laudatory or, as Senator NICKLES said the other day, precatory--if you want to look it up in the dictionary, it is pretty much like laudatory. And if you don't know what that means, I don't know what to tell you. But there is a lot of that. In any event, the sense of the Senate at the bottom says we recognize the taxpayers are very important and we ought to look at them just as we look at new programs. I certainly say it is important that we do that. 
   I yield back whatever of the 2 minutes I did not use.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to use very much time. 
   Mr. President, first of all, as I read the amendment, I wondered, I could not quite figure out what was going wrong. Essentially this amendment is subject to a point of order, because we do not have authority to tell the Finance Committee in a reconciliation instruction to do this. The law says what we can do in a reconciliation bill, and it does not include ordering them to trigger taxes. It says reduce taxes by a given amount over the period of time reflected in the reconciliation agreement. So it is subject to a point of order which I will raise when we come around to voting. 
   But aside from that, it seems to me if you write a tax law for the Nation, that any tax law you write is an ongoing tax law. Once you put it in, it is ongoing, at least the general tax provisions, unless you want to sunset it or the like. Frankly, I do not believe it would be appropriate to trigger a tax on and off depending upon what the onbudget surplus is. 
   In addition, I do not want to say too much about this, but our lockbox is a pretty good safeguard that we will not be spending Social Security surpluses in the future, because if you have to borrow any extra money, then you need a 60-vote point of order. So I think the Senator can rest assured if we vote for the lockbox as contemplated wherein the debt limit is going to be affected and you will have to raise it, I think it will be a pretty good indication we cannot go significantly in the red in future years, even with a tax cut that occurs in years prior to that. Something will have to be done. 
   I compliment the Senator for his concern about fiscal responsibility. I am sure inherent in this is his concurrence we ought to have some tax cuts. I am not sure which of the various amendments he has agreed to heretofore on how much. But I compliment him for being concerned, but I could not accept it and I do not think it would be valid if we did.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will use 1 minute and yield back my time so the Senator can have the rest of the time. 
   Frankly, many years ago I came to the floor--Senator Nunn helped me; he wasn't even on the Budget Committee--and I did something like this for entitlement programs. 
   I said, if the projections in the outyears are that it is going up so high that it creates a bigger deficit, then maybe we ought not spend the money, having programs that we spend money on automatic pilot. Maybe when we come around and say we are going to do that to taxes, we are going to do that to entitlements, we are going to do that to everything we spend on, we are going to trigger them all and, if we get a deficit, we cut them all so we are right back down to zero and incurring no debt. 
   Why should we do this to the taxpayer on the most important thing they can ask of their Government, and that is that they not be taxed too much? That is what they are looking up here asking us for. The big broad base that keeps America going and pays for all these programs, they would like some tax relief. We say, we will trigger you, we will give you some, but in case the deficit goes up, we will take it away from you, or at least it won't continue to grow, even though we passed it and it is in the law. 
   I think maybe that would be a great idea so we could stay in balance forever. Let's apply that to everything. Just think of that. We are in balance. Nothing could ever grow, if it puts us in the red again. Everything would get stopped that year. No entitlements could grow, nothing could. That would be treating everybody kind of fairly. 
   We would never do that. We shouldn't do that to the taxpayer. 
   Mr. President, I yield my time.

And he will get 1 minute, and Senator LAUTENBERG or his designee on the other side, if they oppose it, will be given 1 minute, and so on down the line. 
   Now, we have already indicated previously that the first vote tonight will be a 15-minute vote, and the amendments after that will be 10 minutes each. I do not know what we are going to do about dinner, but perhaps we will reconsider dinner at 6:30 or 7 and see what we do. But in the meantime, we are going to proceed with that format, and I urge Senators to stay in the Chamber if they have amendments because if we want to get out of here at a reasonable time, we can't take 20 minutes on each rollcall. We just agreed it would be 10. That is very hard to do. We have timed it. Some people say, why don't you make it 7 1/2 ? Remember last year. You cannot even get it done and get the Senators up to vote in 7 1/2 . Ten is the best we can do. But we have to work at it. We still don't know whether we can finish tonight, but we are working very hard to do it.

We had two Republican amendments listed, Ashcroft-Gorton 242. That is an error. We had already accepted that amendment. So what we would like to do is put, in lieu of Ashcroft-Gorton, which had been accepted, it was already adopted, Fitzgerald 217. Then if we go down on our list, Dorgan is next. Then Grams-Roth, we had also accepted that, and somebody on our staff put it on here. So we are going to substitute Ashcroft 240. So everybody should be on notice, including the proponents of those amendments, when they come up. I will try to announce the list just before the vote as to who is next, maybe two in advance, so everyone will know. I think we are prepared. 
   Have the yeas and nays been ordered?

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not think I am going to argue the substance, other than to say this amendment increases taxes by $64 billion. This amendment increases taxes by $64 billion, relative to the committee bill before us. It suggests it be spent for community and regional development. 
   Frankly, it would not have to be. The appropriators have their own judgment. They can do what they want with it. Essentially, I do not believe we ought to be raising taxes to pay for programs like this. 
   In addition, this is not germane and is subject to a point of order, which I now make under the Budget Act. It would exceed the caps that we have agreed to and that are written into statutory law.

   Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator would yield for some housekeeping, we are having a degree of success with the list of amendments. If your name is not on this list, then it means you are insisting on a rollcall vote. That means there are still about 15 or 20 of you we are looking for to sit down and talk, so we will not have to have so many rollcall votes. These are all generous Senators on this list. They have decided--and the other side has agreed--to accept them. We will do that right now, en bloc. 
   So that Members might be thinking about this, maybe we ought to find a new way to take care of sense-of-the-Senate amendments that show up on a budget resolution. I had an idea that maybe we should change the law and have a second budget resolution after we have done the real one, and anybody that has a sense of the Senate can offer them to the second budget bill and ask the leader to set this up in a recess period, and people can file these. When we return from the recess, we will vote on them en bloc. 
   I think that would be an excellent solution. The leader and I will be talking about it soon. 
   In the meantime, we thank you for great cooperation.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from Ohio knows of the great respect I have for him. Over the years, I have worked with him when he was Governor. But I just can't agree with this amendment, and I hope the Senate doesn't. 
   This amendment says that the American taxpayer deserves no tax relief and, yet, we can spend the money that is in surplus, but we can't give the American people any tax relief. This strikes the entire tax relief program that we have planned in this budget resolution. We have heard some say that we should have only half. We have heard others say we should only have two-thirds of it. This one says none. While in the budget we spend money for Medicare, we spend money out of the surplus for other programs. But now it is being said that we cannot spend any of it on tax cuts. I don't believe this is good policy, and I don't think that is where we ought to end up this year. We will spend and spend and spend that surplus, and there won't be any left for the American people in the not-too-distant future.

Some others aren't. I merely ask that we not do this and save some of the money for the American taxpayers.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been keeping track on how much of the surplus we have spent. We spent $430 billion. If we adopt the Democratic amendment, this is $30 billion more. So the surplus would have had $460 billion already spent, if this amendment were adopted. We will increase the mandatory expenditures under agriculture from about $39 billion, to $40 billion, to $75 billion. That will be fixed and permanent, because it is an entitlement. And actually there are many who say this agriculture economy will recover in a couple of years. Yet, we have this built in for 5 years. 
   I don't think we ought to do this tonight. There is ample time to consider. 
   I remind you that the President didn't ask for one nickel. We put $6 billion new money in, and now this is $30 billion more.

Mr. President, I agree with both of my distinguished colleagues, the Chairmen of the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees, that the Administration's defense budget request is inadequate to meet our national security requirements. My intent is that this Budget Resolution would fully fund the $17.5 billion requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the next five years. This additional spending would be devoted to restoring military readiness to acceptable levels. it is also my intention that the funding in this resolution would also provide money, at least in part, to begin the modernization of the currently aging inventory of U.S. weapons, and to fund priority quality of life initiatives for the servicemen and women in our Armed Forces.

Sufficient outlays are necessary to execute the level of budget authority for National Defense in the Budget Resolution to address the serious readiness, recruitment, and retention problems in our military services. I intend to review scorekeeping differences between the OMB and CBO on outlays prior, outlay rates, and policy to resolve this issue. I will consult with the two distinguished Chairmen and keep them informed during this process. I assure the Chairmen of the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees that this problem will receive my full attention until it is resolved to our satisfaction. 
   In addition, I know both Chairmen share my concerns about atomic energy defense capabilities in an increasingly unstable world.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations subcommittee is quite correct in his observations and I appreciate his raising this issue at this time. Indeed, there are dramatic differences in the outlay estimates associated with the highway and transit firewalls, as scored by CBO and OMB. 
   The Budget Act provides that the budget resolution cannot set outlay levels in excess of the amounts set forth in TEA-21 as adjusted by OMB. The difference between OMB and CBO outlay estimates presents a problem for meeting the highway and transit outlay limits under CBO's estimates. 
   I thank the Senator for raising this issue. We need to find some way to address this issue prior to the Senate taking up the Transportation Appropriations bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate your support for this budget. Given current estimates the budget resolution will show a $2.9 billion deficit. That $2.9 billion represents only 1.7% of the entire $1.7 trillion budget, and even that small deficit will probably be eliminated when we get CBO's updated estimates this summer. With the numbers available at the time of the production of this resolution, specifically CBO's February baseline, it was impossible to declare that the budget we produced would be fully in balance according to those numbers. 
   I want to salute the Senator from Missouri's efforts to make absolutely certain that we balance the budget excluding the Social Security surplus and I look forward to working with him to bring about that result.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Fellow Senators, this amendment sets up a reserve fund for any taxes that might be forthcoming from cigarettes without requiring any reform or any changes in the Medicare program. It just says that is out there to be used for Medicare. And whatever you want to call it, prescription drugs or what, it just doesn't seem to this Senator we ought to be doing that when we have a bipartisan Commission and many others saying let's reform Medicare and then let's see where we are.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the simplest way I can explain this is this is the kind of tax cut we give, but we take it way. It is kind of a reverse trigger. Instead of putting a tax on, we put tax on and then we stop it in the event we get an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that the surpluses are not quite what we figured out. 
   We do not do that for spending. Spending can go on up. We have no triggers on or off. But when it comes to tax cuts, we kind of give them, but we do not quite give them. I do not think that is the way we ought to treat the taxpayer. 
   Having said that, the amendment violates the Budget Act. It is not germane and I make the point of order it does not comply with the Budget Act.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for participating and for permitting us to get this bill done today. It has been a big struggle for many of us. And while we had a lot of fun with many of the amendments and many of the concepts, it is a serious budget resolution. It has been a pleasure serving you as chairman of the Budget Committee. And I thank all of those who vote for it. For those who do not vote for it, I think you are missing the boat, missing a great path. It is the best budget we have produced in an awful long time. 
   I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for all his cooperation and certainly all the good he has done in bringing this budget to the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has again passed legislation to convey unwanted federal land to Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. While identical legislation passed the Senate last summer, it was unable to get through the House of Representatives due to political wrangling in the waning days of the 105th Congress. 
   Meanwhile, Rio Arriba has been waiting for access to this much-needed land and facilities. The vast majority of this Northern New Mexico county is in federal ownership. Communities find themselves unable to grow or find available property necessary to provide local services. This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretary of the Interior real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus administrative site for the Carson National Forest to the County. The site is known as the old Coyote Ranger District Station, near the small town of Coyote, new Mexico. 
   The Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes, including a community center, and a fire substation. Some of the buildings will also be available for the County to use for storage and repair of road maintenance equipment, and other County vehicles. 
   Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of no further use to them, since they have recently completed construction of a new  administrative facility for the Coyote Range District. The Forest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the improvements on the site were considered surplus, and would be available for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this particular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been built is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. 
   The Administration is supportive of the legislation. Since neither the Bureau of land Management nor the Forest Service have any interest in maintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, and Rio Arriba County desperately needs them, passage of S. 278 is a win-win situation for the federal government and New Mexico. I hope this meritorious bill will be passed promptly in the House, and quickly become law to give Rio Arriba County the necessary community land to grow.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mrs. President, I once again rise to express pleasure that the Senate has passed S. 291--the Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer Act. I, along with Congressman SKEEN, have been working to convey tracts of land--paid for by Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred to as ``acquired lands''--back to the district, during the past several congresses. Identical legislation passed the Senate last year, it enjoys bi-partisan support, and hopefully will pass in the House of Representatives soon. 
   The Carlsbad Irrigation District has had operations and maintenance responsibilities for this Bureau of Reclamation project for the past 66 years. It met all the repayment obligations to the government in 1991, and it's about time we let the District have what is rightfully theirs. This legislation will not affect operations at the New Mexico state park at Brantley Dam, or the operations and ownership of the dam itself. Furthermore, the bill will not affect recreation activities in the area. 
   This legislation accomplishes three main things: it allows conveyance of acquired lands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; allows the District to assume management of leases and the benefits of the receipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180 day  deadline for the transfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying out the transfer. 
   Unfortunately, after years of testimony from the District and support from the Administration, this legislation failed to pass the House of Representatives in the waning days of the 105th Congress. With such continued support for this logical and fair bill, I hope the House will put aside its differences and pass this worthy legislation soon. The Carlsbad Irrigation District has been waiting more than long enough to begin getting the benefits for that which they have paid.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, once again this body will take an historic step in preserving one of America's cultural treasures--Route 66. Passage of S. 292, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Act, will preserve the unique cultural resources along the famous Route and authorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance through the Park Service. Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON of Albuquerque, New Mexico, reintroduced a companion bill (H.R. 66) in the House of Representatives. This legislation almost became law at the end of the 105th Congress, but failed to pass in the House of Representatives due to last minute political wrangling. However, I believe that unfortunate turn of events had more to do with political grandstanding than to any question of merit. 
   I introduced the ``Route 66 Study Act of 1990,'' which directed the National Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, commemorate and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I introduced legislation last summer authorizing the National Park Service to join with federal, state and private efforts to preserve aspects of historic Route 66, the nation's most important thoroughfare for east-west migration in the 20th century. 
   The Administration once again testified in favor of this legislation, which is identical to last year's bill. S. 292 authorizes a funding level over 10 years and stresses that we want the federal government to support grassroots efforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway. 
   Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to Santa Monica, Calif. It rolled through eight American states, and in New Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants and Gallup. New Mexico added to the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of Americans their first experience of our colorful culture and heritage. Route 66 allowed generations of vacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. This bill is designed to assist private efforts to preserve structures and other cultural resources of the historic Route 66 corridor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased my colleagues have again passed this important legislation allowing for transfer of an unwanted piece of federal property to an educational institution which needs it. The Old Jicarilla Site Conveyance Act of 1999 allows for transfer by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus ranger station to San Juan College. This college, located in a county that amazingly is 90% in federal ownership, has been waiting for use of this land. 
   Finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can be difficult in predominantly federally-owned areas. The site that is the subject of this legislation is in the Carson National Forest near the village of Gobernador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Site will continue to be used for public purposes, including educational and recreational purposes of the college. 
   The Forest Service determined that the acreage is of no further use to them because a new administrative facility has been located in the town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. In fact, the facility has had no occupants for several years, and the Forest Service testified last year that enactment of this bill would ``provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan County and the students and faculty of San Juan College.'' 
   While an identical bill passed the Senate last Congress, and was reintroduced this January, the Forest Service last week indicated it wished to make some last minute changes. The substitute amendment incorporates these technical corrections as to the acreage, and I hope the House of Representatives will quickly act on this noncontroversial bill and the land can readily be put to good use for San Juan College and the area residents. We also need to put this property in the hands of the college soon so it can protect the area from further deterioration and fire.

   Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of the majority leader, I would like to make the following announcement. 
   This morning, the Senate will begin consideration of S. Con. Res. 20, the budget resolution, with up to 35 hours for debate. Members should expect the next couple of days of session to be longer than usual, with rollcall votes beginning early each morning and continuing late into the evening. The cooperation of all Senators will be necessary in order for the Senate to complete its work prior to the beginning of the Easter recess. Senators who plan to offer amendments to the budget resolution should contact the managers of the bill in order to facilitate a smooth and orderly process during the consideration of the resolution. 
   I thank colleagues in advance for their cooperation. 
   Mr. President, yesterday my good friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, asked if he might make a statement this morning that he considers very important, historically. I yield the floor to let him make that statement. I yield him as much time as he desires.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am quite sure my friend Senator LAUTENBERG would concur that we all know, more or less, what the issues are. We have gone through the Budget Committee and most of the major issues have been debated there and amendments offered--some accepted, some failed. I don't think there is really any reason we cannot finish at a reasonable time and take this recess if Senators on both sides cooperate. 
   I urge that on my side also. There is tentatively, on my side--I know when we talk to them that it is not going to  remain this way, but they are talking about 30 or 40 amendments, almost all of which are sense-of-the-Senate amendments. We will never get out of here if that happens. Normally the minority has about twice as many. So add that up and we will have 120. We could just start voting now and we would not go home for the recess. So I urge we consider our own well-being and what is really necessary to get this job done.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator KERREY, leaves the floor, I want to congratulate him on his efforts on behalf of sound fiscal policy and good principles for the future and a vision of the future which I believe is an exciting one if we will just bear with it and do what we must do. 
   It is pretty obvious from the comments he has made here that we ought to be able to reform Medicare and make it live and available for many decades to come. And we ought to do it this year. There is absolutely no reason why we cannot. All we need to know is what the President wants to do. The President has not told us what he wants to do. This budget resolution contains a very valid program, very live and very capable, if the committees can put it together. It doesn't put a plan together; it just says what the resources are and how much is available. I will go into that in a little more detail in my opening remarks, which I will not give now. 
   There are two Senators who would like to speak now. I ask, on our side, if Senator HELMS could proceed and then I see Senator KENNEDY here. I think he would like to proceed. I do not want to limit him. I wish to make my opening remarks after him and then we will try to stir up an amendment. 
   If others have opening remarks, I hope they will hurry down here, because I suggest we are talking about our recess. I want to tell you a little bit. What if we have 60 amendments? People will now say we have plenty of time; we have all day today, all day tomorrow, which is Thursday. We have Friday. But people want to start leaving. They say that is 35 hours, 15 each day; that will do it. 
   Mr. President, if we have 60 amendments, the vote time and the quorum time surrounding them, since they do not count, the vote time does not count and quorums do not count, that could be 20 hours on its own; 35 hours of debate plus 20 hours to vote, that is 55 hours. This would mean at least 5 full days, well into Sunday, because we do not actually use 15 or 20 hours out of a day. We try to do 8 or 9 or 10. But even if you stay late, you do not get in 15 hours. 
   So we have to limit our amendments. We are working on that on our side. We also, at some point, have to agree to take less time on amendments than the 2 hours allowed under the statute. 
   With that, I yield whatever time Senator HELMS needs and then a Democrat can proceed. It will be Senator KENNEDY. Then I would like to be recognized after Senator KENNEDY. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am convinced that, for some obvious reason, the President and some on the other side of the aisle do not want to fix Medicare. I think it might be fair to say they would rather have an issue than to fix it. It is not true of everybody, obviously. I have heard a number of Senators on both sides saying this is the year to reform Medicare. And, clearly, it can be reformed and fixed. There is no question about it. We saw that 10 Members out of 17--bipartisan--came up with a proposal. 
   I am hoping that after this budget resolution is completed--everybody knows there is plenty of latitude within this budget resolution to reform Medicare; there is nothing about this resolution that denies the opportunity to reform it, repair it, fix it, for many decades to come--I am hopeful that perhaps the White House will tell us what their plan is. I think some of us, in due course, might like to sit down and talk to the President about it. We have all been very, very busy, and clearly this issue has, instead of getting the attention it deserves, sort of slid by, and here it sits with accusations and insinuations instead of reform. 
   Having said that, I would like to talk just a little bit before I give my remarks about the policy for our Nation for the next 10 years. I would like to make sure that everybody 
   understands this is the only bill or resolution that, under the law, has a time limit and has a limit on how much you can speak on amendments. 
   That means that, literally, the time will run out, and the more amendments we have, obviously, the more time it is going to take, because every vote and every quorum call does not count against this statutory timeframe. So if we are not careful and do not try to work together, we could be here well into Saturday, which I do not think anyone wants. We want to get our work done. 
   I have just stated for the RECORD, so nobody will misunderstand, that we have the rest of today and the rest of tomorrow--and then that is Thursday night. Many think we want to be finished by that time. With the amount of time it takes to vote and the amount of time for debate, we could have very little done by tomorrow night and still have 20 hours left, I guess, or 25, 21. But clearly it puts us a long way from finishing. 
   I hope amendments will be germane. I intend this year, in a way that will challenge the Senate, to raise some issues about germaneness if some of the proposals have no impact on the budget and are just here to be provocative and to have a vote on something. 
   Having said that, Mr. President, fellow Senators, I suggest that the United States of America's fiscal policy, economic policy, as far as our Nation's jobs and there being an abundance of jobs for our people, as far as there being good and even better jobs for our people, if they are educated and have some basic skills, when we look at our policy today--our fiscal, economic, monetary policy--we are in absolutely fantastic condition versus the rest of the industrial world. 
   In fact, we read with genuine concern--not enthusiasm but concern--how a great country like Germany is in the condition they are in. And, frankly, it bears talking about for a minute, because the United States is, and our economy is, strong and vibrant, because essentially we have a probusiness policy in many respects as compared with those who seek under other policies to compete in this world. 
   We have low taxes compared to Germany. We have many things that promote our competitiveness and help our businesses, large and small, compete, make money, hire people, pay them better, and pay more taxes. 
   We ought to look out and see what is going wrong in the other parts of the world where their economies aren't working. It is profoundly troublesome to see that the third largest economy in the world, Germany, is floundering. Watch what people are saying. They are saying: ``We are overtaxed. We don't have any freedom with reference to labor policies.'' They are saying: ``We have the longest holidays, the longest vacations, people retire the  earliest, they start to work later.'' That great productive country, built mostly on the high productivity of their people, is faltering. 
   We ought to learn from that. We ought to look at the next decade and say, How do we keep this prosperity going? I want to say right upfront, regardless of what the White House says about this budget, one way to make sure this prosperity machine and our jobs continue into the next decade is to recognize that there is a genuine surplus besides the Social Security surplus, and we ought to think about how do we use that to make sure that America continues with a prosperity machine and growth. 
   I submit that to put on hold cutting taxes for the American people is the wrong way to ensure that growth, prosperity, and the creation of jobs. Our opposition, the Democratic Party and the White House, can use every bit of language they can muster to talk about us having the wrong approach to tax cuts. Nobody knows what the tax cuts are going to be under this budget resolution, because the committees of this Congress have to make that decision. 
   They can get up and talk about tax cuts for the rich all they want, but there is room in this budget resolution to fix the marriage tax penalty. There is room to fix the research credits that our American businesses ought to take. We ought to make it permanent and say they are there so you can grow and prosper and make more and more breakthroughs. There is allowance there for a capital gains change. Yes, there is money there, if it is the will of the Congress, to cut marginal rates. 
   To say this budget resolution, in that regard, is to cut the taxes of the rich is untrue. Unequivocally, we believe when there is a surplus that is this big, and an American economy that we want to continue to flourish and grow--we have been told there are only three things you can do with a surplus for the good of America. 
   They are, one, applying the surpluses to the debt to reduce the debt held by the public. People such as Alan Greenspan say if you could find a way to do that, that is the best way. We have put $1.8 trillion of this surplus, every cent of the Social Security surplus, against the debt. 
   The President bragged about his budget, reducing the debt held by the public, and how putting money in trust funds but not spending it and waiting to redeem it later with an IOU would reduce the public debt. He said it recently again as he summarized an answer to a question. He reduces the debt held by the public less than this budget because he doesn't put it on the debt. He puts it somewhere where it can be spent. As a matter of fact, in the first 5 years of the President's budget, he spends more than the whole surplus that was accumulated during that period of time, the whole onbudget surplus, that which could be used for tax cuts. Because it doesn't necessarily belong to seniors, he spends more than the accumulation of that surplus in this budget. 
   Now, frankly, there are some who will say the President's budget isn't before the Senate. We are going to make sure it is brought before us. Let's see if we can vote on it, because the President has been claiming things about his budget that are not true. Let me start with one. 
   There is not one nickel, not one penny, not one dollar, in this budget for prescription drugs. As a matter of fact, there are no new expenditures for Medicare in his budget because he decided to put the surplus away so you couldn't use it for anything else and put it in a trust fund that is not spent for Medicare. Two Cabinet members have told us there is not a nickel in here to be spent on prescription drugs. You wouldn't believe that. That means you have to reform the program to get the prescription drugs. 
   Mr. President, the Republican budget does a great job with reference to Medicare as compared to the President's. We anxiously await a real plan. Since I don't think there really is one here, we anxiously await his plan. We anxiously await the plan of those on the other side who are critical. 
   Let's see what their plan is. We increase Medicare spending $200 billion more than the President over the next decade. He cuts about $20 billion over the next 10 years, but he would say it is just removing payments from hospitals. That is where the money goes for the Medicare people of this country: It goes to hospitals, doctors, x ray equipment, MRIs, and all the other things. We don't cut that $20 billion; it is still in the budget. On top of that, about $100 billion of the surplus is left unused--$100 billion--to be used in our budget, if 
   necessary, for a Medicare reform package. 
   I remind Members that the 10 members of the special committee on Medicare, which the President wholeheartedly joined last year in saying let's let them tell us how to do it, didn't even use any extra money and they covered the poor with prescription drugs through the reform of the program. I am not suggesting that the whole thing can be fixed that way, but I give you that example, and we left $100 billion there for that purpose. 
   We can go on. But I will proceed now to just evaluate our budget, little by little. First of all, we are beginning to ask the Senate to vote also on whether they want to save and apply to the debt 100 percent of the Social Security surplus. We do that. The reason it is important is because the President doesn't do it. 
   Now, the President, in the first few years of this, spends Social Security money. But he says if you wait 15 years, there will be enough of it to make Social Security's trust fund whole. Year by year, he uses portions of it until some point out in the future when the amount is small and then he leaves it all in the trust fund. 
   As I see it, we are going to confront the issue of Medicare here on the floor. We are going to be delighted and pleased to tell the senior citizens of this country that very major Medicare reform awaits the cooperation of the President and that there is ample resources in this budget to take care of that. 
   I compliment the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE. She encouraged and got passed unanimously with every Democrat supporting it this source of money that won't be used for anything else but can be used, if desired, to help reform the Medicare. 
   Let me quickly tick through what we do that we are proud of. One, the budget accounts for every penny of the Social Security trust fund and leaves it in the budget unspent to reduce the debt. Later on, we will introduce legislation to make it near impossible to spend it. 
   We followed the leadership of the President, the minority leader, and many others, who said maintain the fiscal discipline established in the 1997 agreement. 
   The minority leader challenged us: Don't break the caps, don't break the agreement we entered into 3 years ago. Stick to the caps. 
   We did that. Now, watch, as the debate progresses; there will be innumerable amendments saying they want more money in domestic accounts. Our question will be, if you are going to stick with the caps, as recommended by your own leader on the minority side, what are you going to cut to make sure you can pay for more than we provided? We provided the caps, the exact amount required by law. Incidentally, some think a budget resolution is in control of these budget spending limits. That statute says if you violate them without changing the law, you will cut every program in the Government. It is called a sequester to enforce the agreed-upon limits. 
   We return to the American taxpayer overpayments they made to the Federal Government, not only because they are entitled to it, but they should not wait 15 years for a tax cut, as implied or recommended by some. We create a non-Social Security surplus of more than $100 billion, which I have just described. It preserves the Social Security surplus balances of $1.8 trillion over the next decade. It is not touched in the expenditure or the tax side of this budget because it belongs to the Social Security trust fund for use in reform and certainly not to spend. 
   It is interesting on that score, while I am moving along, that nobody is going to vote for the President's budget because, as a matter of fact, in the first 5 years he spends $158 billion of the surplus belonging to Social Security. After they all vote down here to keep 100 percent, how are they going to vote for the President's budget when it spends it? 
   The budget resolution has another challenge in it for us. We do not put a  wall up between the defense expenditures and domestic expenditures because things are tight. Senators want the opportunity--and the Budget Committee members wanted to preserve the opportunity--to argue over defense numbers versus domestic numbers. We will see some amendments today that will seek to take money from defense and spend it on something else; that is, if the amendments offered in committee are offered here. That probably won't pass no matter on what you are going to spend the money on the domestic side because we are on the verge of a war, and I am quite sure everybody would be frightened to take money out of defense for domestic programs at this point. But we will probably hear the argument. 
   So we have increased spending on national security. And, yes, for those who say it is too tight a budget, I repeat, we followed the admonition of the minority leader who said, ``Don't break the caps,'' and it is a fixed dollar number. We used the number. We divvied it up among all the programs of Government. Some don't like the way we apportioned it, but I will tell you that we decided to put more in education, knowing that it will not go for categorical programs in education of the past but will go down to the local level to be spent on reform measures, so long as there is accountability as one of the qualities. 
   We put $3.3 billion more in the first year and $28 billion over the next 5 years. That is over and above the $100 billion we would expend in the next 5 years. That is far in excess of what the President was able to do. Yet, the President said, ``I am bound by the same caps and I am following them.'' So we are following them also. We just decided other parts of Government could be cut more than he suggested, and we put it in priorities 
   like defense and education. 
   And, yes, the President speaks of what values do you reflect in the budget. I have just expressed them. The taxpayers--we worry about them. One of our values is to see that they don't overpay their Government. Secondly, we want more for education. We are in an era of reform, and we are willing to say let's put more in because it will be helpful to reform the educational process. We said the President didn't put in enough for veterans. We put in $1.1 billion more for veterans. That is our value. How can you take the medical system for veterans and cut it and not give it a slight increase, which everybody knows it needs? We fully funded all the crime prevention laws, the trust-funded money that goes into crime prevention. These are good priorities. 
   There will be some who will stand up and say, yes, they are good, but you had to reduce foreign aid. Well, so be it. If we are going to all live by the same numbers, then let's all talk about priorities. I remind everyone, if they want to exceed the targets, those caps, those limits on expenditures, clearly they need 60 votes to do it because it violates the Budget Act. That is how important it is. It is a major hurdle because we wanted fiscal responsibility. I am willing to listen to how difficult it will be to live within those limits. I understand it is. I don't have a solution right now because I don't see how you can report a budget resolution out that violates the budget law of the land. I don't see how you can do that. I choose not to do that. The committee chose overwhelmingly not to do that. 
   I might just suggest, if people are wondering about where the money might come from to establish the right priorities and still have to reduce other programs, the GAO recently reviewed the budget and they have a high-risk series which lists 26 areas in this budget this year--nearly 40 percent--which have been high risk for 10 years. High risk, by definition, is programs that are vulnerable to waste, fraud and error. We leave them there. For the most part, we increase them every year, and we ask GAO to tell us which are the risky programs that we probably won't get our dollar's worth from. Then we do nothing about it. 
   Second, it is clear that some programs won't grow and will remain at the 1999 level and will have to be reduced below a freeze, as the President's budget requested. We are going to take some of where he cut and reduced. I suggest that the committees and the administration take to heart the Government Performance and Results Act, which specifically identifies low-performing and inefficient programs. I am sure some Senators are hearing for the first time that such lists and assessments and evaluations exist. 
   This resolution assumes reduced funding for political appointees in the administration. It assumes some mandatory savings scored to appropriators in the area of the SSI Program and child support and enforcement. 
   The resolution assumes repeal of the depression era and arcane Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Act and other administrative savings. 
   The resolution assumes that Ginnie Mae will become a private operation and its auction creates nearly $2.8 billion in offsets next year. 
   And, yes, the resolution assumes some of the administration's proposed offsets, fees, are assumed for various agencies in the Federal Government--FSIS and the President's proposed $200 million broadcasters lease fee. 
   In the area of mandatory savings. The resolution does not assume any of the President's nearly $20 billion reductions in Medicare over the next five years. Medicare spending will indeed increase from $195 billion this year by over $200 billion to a total of $395 billion in 2009, an annual increase of 7.3 percent. 
   And the resolution assumes $6.0 billion in additional resources will be allocated to the Agriculture Committee to address the issue of depressed incomes in that sector. 
   Finally, the resolution assumes that expiring savings provisions in 2002, that were enacted in the 1997 Balanced Budget agreement, will be extended. This applies to all such provisions except expiring Medicare savings provisions. Between 2003 and 2009 these provisions would save less than $20 billion. 
   For revenues the resolution assumes that tax reductions will be phased in and over the next five years will return overpayments to the American public of nearly $142 billion and $778 billion over the next ten years. For 2000, paid for tax cuts of up to $15 billion are possible. 
   How these tax reductions are carried out will of course be determined by the Finance Committee and ultimately the Congress and the President. 
   However, I believe elimination or reduction in the marriage penalty could easily be accommodated within these levels as well as extension of expiring R&D tax credits, self employed health insurance deductions, certain education credits and or general reductions in tax rates phased in over time. 
   Finally, the resolution, being cautious, over a 10 year period, projects a non-budget surplus of over $100 billion. This money could be needed for unexpected emergencies or contingencies, it also could support the cost of funding transition costs for Medicare reform, or if nothing else it will continue to further retire debt held by the public. 
   Two procedural issues need to be noted--a rule change as it relates to defining emergencies and a clarification that when there is an on-budget surplus, those amounts are not subject to pay-go rules. 
   Let me close by saying that under this resolution, debt held by the public will decline by nearly $463 billion more than under the President's budget. 
   This is true even if one treats the President's government equity purchases as debt reduction. 
   Why do we reduce debt more than the President? 
   First, the President spends $158 billion of the Social Security surplus over the next 5 years. In contrast, the committee reported resolution saves the entire Social Security surplus. 
   And second, let me remind the Senate of one other thing about the President's spending proposal which may surprise many--his spending costs more than the resolution's assumed tax reductions. This is true over both the 5 year and 10 year period. 
   The President's budget spends 35 percent of the Social Security surplus over the next five years on programs unrelated to Social Security or Medicare. 
   The resolution before us today assumes that we return to the American taxpayer their overpayments and this sum of money is less smaller than the President's spending increases. 
   That is why we can save the entire Social Security surplus and why he can not. 
   That is also why the administration is opposed to the Social Security lock  box idea, because that would stop them from spending the Social Security surplus. 
   We will have more to say about the President's budget plan later in the debate, when we let the full Senate consider whether they want to support his budget plan or not. 
   For now however, what is before the Senate is S. Con. Res. 20. It is a good resolution. It is a reasonable resolution. 
   Once again it does four things: 
   It protects 100% Social Security surpluses. 
   It maintains the fiscal discipline this Senate overwhelmingly supported in 1997 and was most recently reaffirmed by the minority leader. 
   It returns to the American public their tax overpayments. 
   And finally, it prudently and cautiously projects on-budget surpluses for further debt reduction or for supporting unexpected emergencies, and possible transition costs for true Medicare reform like the one recently voted on by 11 of the 17 members of the National Commission on the future of Medicare. 
   It is a good start on budgeting into the next century. 
   Mr. President, I will also comment on those from the agricultural sectors. We got your letter and your concerns of a bipartisan nature. The resolution assumes $6 billion in additional resources to be allocated to the Agriculture Committee to address issues of the depressed parts of the agricultural community. 
   I am going to stop at this time and merely indicate that this debate will proceed. Amendments will be forthcoming. I am hopeful that when the day ends, we will have a budget resolution similar to this one, and let's see how the year evolves as we try to implement it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield as much time to Senator GRAMM as he would like, although I am going to ask him in the interest of others to do a little less than the 1 hour he would give to his class in economics over there at Texas A&M. 
   But I want to read something to the Senate before I yield to him, just in response to my good friend, Senator BOXER from California. She suggested we would not accept her resolution with reference to what the tax cut should be all about. Let me read what the committee adopted unanimously. I think it is a pretty good definition of what we ought to do with the tax cut:  
   It is the sense of the Senate that this concurrent resolution on the budget assumes any reductions in taxes should be structured to benefit working families by providing family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth.  
   I think those are the kinds of things we all ought to be looking at in a tax package as it moves its way through. 
   I yield to Senator GRAMM.

   Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is absolutely correct. In the first year, we recommended that $3 billion, in addition to what the President recommended, be spent for education, and over 5 years, $28 billion in new money on top of about $100 billion in the programs today. 
   We do express our concern in the event this money were used in the traditional way that we have done for the last 25 years of telling them exactly how to do it with a lot of strings. We are hoping it will move down to the classroom level with only accountability as to what the Federal Government requires.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to proceed for 3 or 4 minutes on my time awaiting the arrival of Senators with whom Senator LAUTENBERG is in touch. 
   First of all, everybody should know this amendment, offered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, is not germane to the budget resolution. So at an appropriate time, when all the time has been yielded back, I will raise a point of order, at which time I assume the Senator from New Jersey will seek to waive that. 
   I will suggest some things now about why our budget is right and why this amendment, even though it is not germane, is not the right thing to do. I want to start by quoting a Democratic Senator who spent a great deal of time and effort trying to reform the Medicare program. The amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey says, ``I like the spending part of Senator DOMENICI's budget,'' although I am sure he would not like to see it in effect for awhile. He said, ``Leave that alone.'' If he had not done that, we would have said you can spend all the surplus. Obviously, he did that. 
   Then the Senator said, ``You can't return any of this surplus tax money to the American taxpayer unless and until you have a reform for both Social Security and Medicare.'' Here is what one of the Democratic Senators, Senator BREAUX from Louisiana, said:  
   Medicare must not be used as a wedge issue any longer. The question before this Congress is not whether to cut taxes or whether to save Medicare. That is not the choice we are facing. I support a tax cut [although he says targeted] and I am dedicated to saving Medicare. It is not an either/or proposition.  
   I am glad that is not the Senator from New Mexico making that statement, although I could make it. There is no question 
   in my mind that is correct. As a matter of fact, it seems to this Senator that if all we had before us was the President's proposal on Medicare, which gradually, bit by bit--most of the proposals of the President's budget are going to be refused in the Senate. We are going to adopt the Abraham amendment. That says to the President: ``You were not right in saying you were saving Social Security trust funds; you were saving only a part of it and you were spending a part of it.'' This first vote is going to say you cannot spend any of it and proposes how a lockbox might be structured if and when we can get the legislation up to vote on that. 
   Now we are talking about Medicare and, obviously, before we are finished here, no one is going to be for the President's Medicare proposals--or few are--because actually it does not do anything. It purports to do something, but it does nothing. It does not spend a penny on prescription drugs. As a matter of fact, it does not spend a penny of new money to fix Medicare at all. 
   The budget before us spends $190 billion to $200 billion more than the President and fully funds Medicare. It does not cut $20 billion out of Medicare, which the President cut out. 
   Then it says: ``Let's get on with reform and fix it; let's stop talking about things in the air; let's put it on paper and let's start voting.'' 
   We say there is another $100 billion left over, not from Social Security, not for returning money to the taxpayers, another 100 that we say can be used, if needed, for Medicare. 
   That is going to solve Medicare well beyond the 12 years that the distinguished Senator from New Jersey seeks. He seeks a 12-year extension of the program. That program, which is described in our budget, can solve it for much longer than 12 years. 
   The problem is, we do not want to give the American taxpayers a break unless and until we have the reform accomplished, and we do not even have a proposal from the President of the United States. It is grossly unfair, in my opinion. 
   Clearly, the time has come to reward the taxpayers who have been working hard to keep this economy going, putting in more and more of their tax dollars. They ought to get some of it back. We ought to be for keeping the economy expanding and growing, producing jobs and vitality. 
   If you look around the world, West Germany is in trouble, and that means most of Europe is going to be in trouble, not just Asia, and we are going to be the bastion of growth and prosperity. We better be ready with some tax cuts for American business and for the American taxpayer if we want another 6 or 7 years of prolonged, sustained recovery. That is the kind of thing we ought to be doing, and it is done by this budget, leaving the Congress to decide what kind of tax reductions they want in the future. 
   This budget does not prescribe that. Certain Republicans have ideas, and certain Democrats have ideas. This Senator, my good friend from Louisiana, has ideas. His would be for targeted tax cuts. I do not know what the occupant of the Chair would be for, but he would have some. 
   Only one set of ideas is going to be passed. It is going to be passed ultimately by committees after debate and committee hearings and the like. The question is not whether some of us are for an across-the-board tax cut like John Kennedy was for; the question is, Are we going to provide anything for tax cuts? The Lautenberg amendment says no. I believe we should not adopt it, and we should get on with the budget format and plan contained in the budget before us. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will reserve as best I can the decibel level until later in the day when I feel more like arguing with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, but he will hear it before we are finished, as I will hear his. 
   The Republican package is by far better than anything the President of the United States has offered to the people of this country on Medicare. Let me suggest that maybe before we are finished, we will put the President's Medicare package before the Senate and see how many Senators vote for it. As a matter of fact, it doesn't pay a penny of prescription drugs and doesn't provide for any method or manner of doing it. The 15 percent of the surplus that is put in there is clearly identified as being placed in there to elongate the trust fund. But you can't spend it under the President's plan. You get back IOUs, which means generations to come will have to pay whatever it is that is spent on Medicare over the years. 
   We did better than the President in that he cut $20 billion out of Medicare and we did not during the next decade. When you add that together with more than $100 billion that is not allocated anywhere out of the surplus that can be used for Medicare reform, including prescription drugs, we have a very good package. 
   The only thing missing is a proposal, a reasonable proposal, by the President of the United States to put into effect the use of 
   that money and the kinds of reforms that are suggested by the committee which worked so long and was one vote short of what they needed. 
   We can go on forever this year debating Medicare, but the truth of the matter is, we have a solution in mind. There are others who talk about the problem and indicate that it will be fixed in some miraculous way when they don't have a plan. 
   I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Michigan.

<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-47-19990324</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me assure Senators here on the floor, I do not intend to use 35 minutes. I am fearful if I say anything, we will have to hear the same song and dance over again from the other side. We have heard it about 10 times today, but that is all right. 
   First of all, we all know what this is about. Last year the President of the United States said to the Congress, Democrat and Republican, we have taken Medicare out of politics. Let us move arm in arm and let us fix Medicare. Everybody said great. The President was active in this regard, and he said, let us have this commission look at it. We have taken it out of politics, because we want to fix it. 
   The truth of the matter is, the President decided to make Medicare a political issue in his budget this year. He didn't wait around for the commission. He made it a political issue in his budget. 
   Those who are now arguing on the floor about the budget we produced in committee are continuing the political fight rather than a factual fight. 
   I want to say a couple of things. There is a lot to get excited about here, but I promise myself I will not do that, other than I will say to my good friend, you should never, never have put the Social Security lockbox money in the same lockbox with yours. If you would like to have a second lockbox and call it yours, you are welcome to do it. But it is a fraud to put it in the same lockbox with the Social Security trust fund. It is nothing similar to it. It has no relationship to it, and all it does is say, ``We're going to reduce the debt more than the Republicans want to, and we're hoping that by reducing that debt, there will be money available for Medicare.'' That is it plain and simple. 
   In case anybody is interested, on this chart, this red line is the President's debt reduction for which he is taking credit and have Nobel laureates saying it is great. The committee bill before you is the blue line which reduces the debt $400 billion more than the President, which, incidentally, is more than the distinguished Senator is going to take out of the tax cut to make a case--not a case for Medicare--a case against giving back to the American people any of their hard-earned money. 
   This amendment, which will fall because it is not germane, is an antitax amendment. Let me tell you, I am tired of Democrats getting up and saying, ``We don't want to vote for tax relief because Republicans are talking about an across-the-board tax cut.'' I am tempted to offer an amendment to strike the 10-percent tax cut from this tax cut and put in marriage penalty and any other family-related tax cuts. Take it out. Let's see if they are for it then. 
   What will the argument be? The argument can't be 10 percent because it is not even mentioned in this resolution. What they can get up and say is, ``We have a better idea for tax cuts than the Republicans.'' And we say, ``Wonderful, if you do, that's fine.'' But it is not a wonderful idea to cut the tax cut almost in half and claim you are for tax cuts and you did something for Medicare when, as a matter of fact, all we need to do for Medicare is to get the Democrats and the President--and I will not include every Democrat because there are some who already know what they want to do--but all we need to do is get them to tell us what we ought to do for Medicare. 
   This idea that my friend, Senator KENNEDY, got up and said, ``We are in the red $860 billion over,'' I don't know how many years, Mr. President, that is saying if the program stays just like it is and there is no reform, that is what we would need to keep it going like it is. 
   Let me assure you that not even the distinguished Senator who is proposing this so-called Medicare amendment thinks we should leave the Medicare program like it is. In fact, there is a quote--we are going to find it in a minute--where the distinguished Senator said Medicare does not have a chance to survive unless we reform it. That is what he was saying last year. 
   Reforming it means you save money by making the program more efficient, less apt to have fraud injected into the program and, yes, being realistic. There are those who say this commission that worked on this didn't come up with a good product and they used that one idea. Thirty years from now, the age for receiving Medicare will go up piecemeal, and in 30 
   years, it will be up 2 years. Maybe they can fix that if they are serious. But, Mr. President, that reform package saved enough money to pay a prescription benefit. They did not need to take away this tax cut to do it. They had $61 billion left over from reform, and they said, ``Let's use it for prescription drugs.'' 
   Any talk on the floor that the Conrad amendment is going to fix Medicare like it has never been fixed before is pure, absolute demagoguery and speculation at the highest. Nobody has any idea what that is going to do for Medicare, if it is even available for Medicare. It might not even be there. It can be spent for anything else. 
   I submit, talking about what the American people want most and coming down here and telling us that 20 times does not mean that that is what they are getting in that amendment by my good friend, Senator CONRAD, because it is not doing what he says the American people want. If you look at it, it does not accomplish what he continually claims the American people want. 
   Frankly, I believe we ought to get serious and we ought to take the politics out of this, but if you do not want to, we will take this one as far as we can because we understand what is right, what is fair, and what is fair to future generations, not just our senior citizens. 
   From my standpoint, the truth of the matter is, this is plain and simple: an effort to increase taxes that would otherwise be reduced by $320 billion over 10 years. What is really incredible about it is that it does not provide $1 for Medicare. Not one. It reduces the debt of the United States temporarily until it is spent by someone with no real way of saying it is to go to Medicare because there is no way to do that. 
   It is no lockbox; it is a wish box. In fact, you should take it out of my lockbox and make your own wish box out of it, and maybe mine should be green and yours should be--I don't know what color--surely a shade of yellow, something slightly brown, something like that. 
   In any event, all this amendment purports to do is to reduce the debt held by the public because the Senator could not even put it into the Medicare fund, as the President did, in his phony budget because if he did that, he would have to raise the gross debt of the United States and would be vulnerable here on the floor for having done that, so it doesn't even do that. 
   I understand my friend, Senator CONRAD, is anxious to get up and talk again. He has made so many arguments today, I don't know if he needs any more, but the Senate accommodates him because that is the way the budget process works. 
   Let me conclude. The budget before us fully funds Medicare assuming no reform. Reform will save a lot of money, and there will be money around from these numbers in this budget  which is fully funded. We do not cut the $20 billion that the President does, and regardless of what they say on that side, within the 10-year period, there could be up to $100 billion. And if we get on with reform, that $100 billion will be available. If we wait around forever with no proposal, then who knows. 
   I believe we are going to get serious. The President is going to send us a package. I only hope he does not send us one that is irresponsible because of this debate. I don't think he will. He understands the issue. We can get on to doing Medicare right, not act like this amendment fixes it.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to go on to the next amendment, which I understand is an amendment regarding veterans. But I just want to take 3 or 4 minutes and talk about the President's budget. I note my good friend, Senator LAUTENBERG, was talking about Senators should not use words like ``embezzlement'' and that kind of thing to describe other people's motives. I do not think he should use the word ``gimmick'' either. He called this proposal a gimmick. It is no gimmick at all. 
   In the committee, we just adopted the President's budget by a sense of the Senate. In this one, they actually prepared a budget that looks like our kind of budget; that is, the President's budget. It took a lot of time. We used the Congressional Budget Office, and it is right. If you want the President's budget, in a broad sense, you vote aye on the Bond amendment. 
   Frankly, it is difficult for me to see those who have been praising the President with reference to two very, very important things--Social Security and Medicare--vote against this budget, because I do believe that is a recognition that on neither count does the President's budget do what it says. Because I believe if it was a good Social Security proposal and 
   a good Medicare proposal, those who are advocates for those two programs on the other side would be voting for it even if the rest of it was not right up to snuff because those are the big issues. 
   The truth of the matter is, 100 Senators already said, in an early vote, on Senator ABRAHAM's amendment--100 Senators--the President's approach to saving the Social Security trust fund is wrong. Now, they might want to turn around and vote for the budget anyway, but they already said, ``We don't want to spend $158 billion of the Social Security's money on programs.'' That was the vote. 
   Senator BOND says, ``Do you like the President's budget enough to vote for it?'' That is one of the things you would be voting for. I guarantee you, if that budget of the President's really fixed Medicare, there would be no one on the other side who would be voting against this, because they would be ashamed and embarrassed to find somebody to ask them, ``How come you voted against this wonderful fix, reform, saving of the Medicare system by the President?'' It is because it does not do that. That is why. 
   So I do not think we need a lot of time trying to find excuses. It is a pure, simple vote, up or down. Do you want the President's budget, with all its claims for Social Security and Medicare, or do you not? I do not think there would be very many Senators who say they do. And that ought to take care of the issue once and for all as to this President running around saying what he does and what we don't do. Now, he can talk about what we don't do, but he surely can't talk about what he does. I guess he can, but he would have to acknowledge, if he wants to be fair, that nobody in the Senate agrees with him. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to vote at 8:01. Before we proceed, let me ask unanimous consent, so everybody will know where we are going. This has been cleared with the two leaders, and Senator LAUTENBERG obviously, and whoever else needs to be conferred with. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the next four votes occur in a stacked sequence, with 2 minutes between each vote for an explanation, 1 minute on each side, that the other votes in the voting sequence be limited to 10 minutes each. 
   I further ask that when the Senate resumes the concurrent resolution at 9 a.m. on Thursday there be 10 hours remaining for consideration. 
   However, for the information of all Senators, these votes will be the last votes of the evening. But any Senator who wishes to remain, we plan to be here open for business all night, if it is necessary. If Senators want to come and offer amendments, we will be here. If they will come and offer them tonight, they will be stacked for an orderly hour tomorrow. 
   I am hopeful that some Senators--a few--will avail themselves of that time. But I am certain that it will not be 4 o'clock in the morning with Senators still around offering amendments. That is why we proposed the unanimous consent as we have.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I think anybody who wants to join this amendment ought to join it. We are going to let you have a vote, but not without my making an observation about it. 
   I have been asked not to use strange words to describe amendments. So I will try to be very accurate. 
   This is a feel-good, do-nothing amendment, and the veterans of the United States ought not think that they are getting $2 billion. As a matter of fact, there is $1.1 billion more than the President in this budget. But, for some, whatever you put in--I should have put $4 billion in. Then we want $7 billion. 
   The truth of the matter is, this amendment is a do-nothing, feel-good amendment because it requires that we cut some other programs, following the format of the budget. That would mean we would have to cut education, environment, NIH, international affairs, housing, WIC--all of which we heard complaints all day long have been cut too much already. Nonetheless, this amendment chooses to cut none of them and just says we will find it in an allowance, which means all these programs will be cut for this $2 billion. 
   I do not think that is right. But neither do I want Senators to vote against veterans. So let us all vote ``aye'' and have a great big hurrah about the amendment. 
   I ask for the regular order.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this amendment is an anti-tax-relief amendment, plain and simple. Compared to the chairman's mark, which is before you, this amendment increases taxes by $320 billion over 10 years. 
   As to Medicare, let us get it straight once and for all. What is really incredible is that there is no lockbox for Medicare. There is a wish box. All we do with the money that is claimed for Medicare is apply it against the debt so that it can be spent by anyone anytime. As a matter of fact, if it is done to reduce the debt so as to strengthen the economy, our budget does more than the President plus this amendment by way of deficit reduction. 
   There is not one nickel in it that is spent on Medicare. It is a wish and a hope. We don't even know we need $320 billion over 10 years. 
   It violates the Budget Act because it is not germane to the budget, and the vote will be on a motion to waive, which I recommend Senators vote no on.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for decades Los Alamos, Sandia, and Lawrence Livermore have attracted the greatest scientists in the world. That has not changed with the end of the Cold War; the knowledge and skills in those laboratories are unequaled in the world and the envy of the world--for that reason, others will always try to gain that information. The directors and scientists have, since the inceptions of the laboratories, been cognizant of the fact that they are the target of spying. 
   As we consider how to respond to these recent allegations--and some steps have been taken including: the initiation of an aggressive counter-intelligence program at the laboratories that has had its funding increase substantially in the last 24 months and we have halted a declassification initiative until its implementation can be reviewed--we have to ensure that our actions do not undermine the excellence of the laboratories. 
   Interactions with experts outside the laboratories and outside the United States are critical to the pursuit of scientific knowledge and underpin the vitality of the laboratories. Cutting off those interactions will cause the capabilities at the laboratories to fade with time until, at some point, no one would spy on our labs there wouldn't be anything worthwhile in them. 
   I have been briefed by: 
   The Director of Central Intelligence; 
   The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; 
   Department of Energy officials, and others on the recent allegations of spying by the Chinese at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I will await the final report of the panel of experts appointed by the Administration before I assess what damage has been done by this latest episode, but some facts are evident. 
   We do know, without doubt, that China's intelligence program against the United States has yielded some results--they have gained access to classified nuclear weapons design information. However, we do not know how much information they have gained or how much that information benefited their nuclear weapons program. 
   I must also say that it is unclear how China gained that information. The Chinese do target our nuclear weapons laboratories, but they also target other potential sources of the same information including other parts of the government, its contractors, and the military branches. 
   It is also unclear how useful information China may have gained, about the W-88 in particular, is to China. The W-88 is extremely advanced; the product of fifty years of our best scientific and engineering know-how. In many ways, China's nuclear weapons program is not capable of utilizing the W-88 design. 
   That is not reassuring when you look out over the coming decades, and in any case, knowing where our years of work led our designers will allow the Chinese to avoid some of the mistakes we made, but the Chinese do not currently have warheads anything like the W-88. 
   Despite the fact that the Chinese capability today does not come anywhere near matching ours, the Chinese nuclear weapons program is threatening. China does share its nuclear weapons technology with others along with its missile technology, and it continues to develop more advanced nuclear weapons designs. 
   Chinese nuclear capabilities threaten its neighbors and limit the opportunities to pursue broad arms control  agreements--for example, Russian negotiations on a START III treaty will be strongly influenced by the growing Chinese capability on Russia's eastern border, and India continues to develop more advanced nuclear weapons partly in response to China's program. 
   I will say very little about the allegations against a specific scientist at Los Alamos. However, given what we know about China's intelligence program, it is not unreasonable to assume that scientists at all three weapons labs have knowingly or unknowingly been approached to provide classified information to China or its intermediaries. The laboratories are cognizant of that threat. Frankly, I don't know if the steps the laboratories, working with the Department of Energy and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are taking are sufficient to prevent espionage at our laboratories. 
   I have met with Director Freeh I, and he assures me that the FBI is doing all it can in this regard. I am certain that, no matter what steps we take, the Chinese and others will continue their efforts.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and Senator STEVENS, before he leaves the floor, I am going to ask a question of the Senator from Texas on the speech that he just made, although it is not directly on point. I thank Senator GRAMM for the comments he made about Social Security and protecting it and the lockbox. He has explained the lockbox as legislation he has reviewed in my behalf, and described it as making it very difficult, if not impossible, to spend the Social Security surplus, because to do so one would have to increase the debt beyond that which is agreed upon, the debt held by the public, and in so doing they would need a supermajority. 
   Since the administration says they want to save the Social Security trust  fund, do you have any idea--can my colleague imagine why the Secretary of the Treasury would be against it?

<DOCNO>106-domenici-nm-6-19990323</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, you don't think that should be the case? Who knows. My heart's content may be only 3 or 4 minutes on this issue. 
   Mr. President, I believe under the guise of the Constitution, which gives the President, as Commander in Chief, some very, very strong powers over what he does, where he places, and what he asks our military to do, that we are beginning now, in this President's administration, to go down the slippery path that the President can engage our military almost anywhere, any time, so long as it pleases him and he decides it is in our national interest. 
   I say, shame on the President. If this is such an important matter, why could he not trust the Senate and the House to ask us whether we concur? 
   Let me say, Mr. President--not the President who occupies the Chair, but our President down on Pennsylvania Avenue--with your last budget, we will have spent $12.3 billion in Bosnia--$12.3 billion. There was not even enough money in the defense budget. At one point we had to declare it an emergency, after 3 years of being involved, to pay for it, because to pay for it would have stripped our military of other things that they desperately need to be our strong military force. 
   What are we up to? We are going to take up the budget on the floor, and I predict that if we authorize, or do not authorize the President, he is going to do it anyway. And there will be Senators from the other side of the aisle who will stand up and want to take money out of the Defense Department to spend on domestic programs. But they will vote here tonight to send our men and women off to this war and claim they will never go in there. 
   But let me tell you, this is a very, very unintelligible plan. You cannot rationally accept the President's reasoning unless you conclude that they do not want to tell you where it is going to end up. It does not take a lot of sense to say airstrike No. 1 may not work, airstrike No. 2 may not work. We have been told by military experts years ago that airstrikes would not work in this area of the world. 
   So what then happens? That is the extent of our plan? Who believes that? I ask those who believe in the great United States of America, with its President leading the way, who sent the bombers in, sent in the stealth fighters, sent in the Tomahawk missiles--and the big leader who has caused all the trouble is not dead yet and will not quit, what are we going to do? 
   I asked the question already of the leaders representing the President, and they say there is no plan. Wait a minute. No plan? Well, NATO may have a plan, but America does not have a plan for the third phase, which is probably putting military men and women in harm's way. 
   What is NATO without America? They have just described, NATO without America in these airstrikes probably could not get the job done. The whole of NATO without us probably would not undertake it. So do you believe the third phase, which we do not want to talk about, is going to get done without America, if there is a third phase? 
   And will there be a third phase? I do not know. I have a hunch that phase 1, of airstrikes from a distance through Tomahawk missiles, and phase 2, with actual airplanes of one sort or another, may not work. I would think it would be fair 
   for the President of the United States, since we have been at this issue for months--as it got worse they threatened and then pulled the threat--to ask the Senate, as George Bush did, and get concurrence. And if we did not concur, wouldn't it be a pretty good signal that we do not think it is right? What is wrong with that? 
   As I understand it, there will be an amendment, there will be a proposal, freestanding perhaps, asking that we concur with the President of the United States in airstrikes. I am not going to vote for it, because I do not think that is the end of it. 
   I ask one simple question: Is this not a declaration of war without asking us, who, under the Constitution, were given authority to declare war? Isn't it an invasion of a sovereign country by a military that is more than half American? I believe it is. You can make all kinds of rationalizations that it is not an invasion, but it is. Is it not a civil war? Yes, it is. Is it not a civil war of long lasting? It did not start last week. 
   These people have been at civil war for God knows how long. And they are going to be there after the airstrikes unless there is a large contingent of soldiers to keep the peace. Is that what we are going to do? Are we going to have soldiers in there under the third phase or the fourth phase? What if they just do not agree to a peace treaty after all these bombs? Do we walk away? I do not believe we will. From my standpoint, we never should have gone in. 
   So, Mr. President, I believe the President of the United States, once again, has waited so long that he has us right in a spot. He does it all the time. He has us in the spot that a terrible tragedy is going to occur unless we agree with him in the next 24 hours, or perhaps he even thinks unless you have already agreed with me today. But who knows, the Tomahawks may be flying tonight. At this point it is dark over there. And that is when they will start. Everybody knows that. 
   So I say to the President of the United States, since you like us to consider your prerogatives under the U.S. Constitution--and we do it all the time--why don't you consider ours? Why don't you ask us? And why don't you wait until we give you an answer? That seems fair to me. What we are doing is not fair to the Congress. And if it isn't fair to us, it is not fair to our people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't believe Senator WARNER, with all the respect that we hold for him, should stand on the floor of the Senate and say that anyone who votes that we should not go in there will not be in support of the military people who happen to go in there because the President prevailed. 
   As a matter of fact, most of the Senators who have supported the military of the United States to the highest extent over the years will probably be voting against sending them in, but will be right there supporting them, and the Senator knows that and they should know that. 
   I do my share in my little role as a budgeteer to see that the military gets sufficient money, and I will do that again this year. I hope you all come down here when people want to take the money away from them. Just because I don't like what they are doing doesn't mean I don't love the military and the men and women out there doing it. We will support them, but we have a right to warn the American people and tell them what this is all about. 
   If you say, What is going to happen if we don't? I ask you, what happened in the other countries of the world that had revolutions where hundreds of thousands of people were killed and we didn't go in because it wasn't in our national interest? 
   I happen to think that is the case here. It is not in our national interest.

   Let me say, I had no reluctance to ask the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee to read the President's letter. Without having seen it, I know it would not contain words saying ``and if you do not vote in support I will not send them in.'' It merely said, ``I sure would like to have you joining me.''

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I spoke at length today, so I will try very hard to not even use the 2 minutes. 
   Mr. President, this President has decided that he doesn't need our approval. This vote tonight has nothing to do with whether we agree or disagree, and we are sending that message to him, because he has already told us he is going to do it. So it is a different request. It is a request saying, ``I am going to do this. Would you tonight 
   concur that it is OK?'' 
   What a difference a President makes. George Bush didn't do that when the United States had a far more serious problem dependent upon oil--oil in jeopardy in the Middle East, Iraq invades a sovereign country. And what does he do? He sends us a letter and says, ``Would you concur, and if you do not I will not do it.'' Now that is the kind of true, dedicated President that gives credit to the elected representatives of the American people. 
   We talk about this great Senate. Well, there is a great House, also. And they deserve the right to pass judgment on this. And for us to sit around here tonight saying we finally made the point, and we are going to get to decide whether he is or isn't, that is just a hoax. I do not believe we ought to meddle in civil wars that have been going on for 800 years. We are not going to solve it unless we commit to have a military force on the ground for perhaps 100 years, because we are going to get involved through NATO. In fact, I think we ought to begin to ask our NATO general, we ought to begin to wonder how in the world does he get in the middle of these negotiations and then he makes commitments through NATO and we say we have to live up to what has been committed through NATO? I think we ought to be able to commit that, too. It is our law. It is not the other countries. They are putting in very little. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last year, despite opposition from me, Senator CAMPBELL, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and Senator INOUYE, Vice-Chairman of our committee, the Enzi amendment succeeded in suspending Secretarial authority to establish a regulatory route for Indian gaming compacts until March 31, 1999. This prohibition prevents the Secretary of the Interior from proceeding with a regulatory route for tribes who have asked states to negotiate compacts and find the state to be unwilling. 
   Tribes lost their right to sue states under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, in 1996, when the Supreme Court, in the Florida Seminole case, determined that IGRA was unconstitutional in its provisions allowing tribes to sue states. The Supreme Court upheld states rights under the 11th Amendment. 
   If a state refuses to negotiate for compacts and that state allows gambling by any person for any purpose (all do in some form, except Utah and Hawaii), the Secretary of the Interior would have an alternative route to compacts, essentially negotiated through his Department, where he also has trust responsibility for Indian tribes. 
   New Mexico Indian tribes are opposed to the Enzi amendment, even though there is no immediate effect in New Mexico. As Governor Milton Herrera of Tesuque Pueblo wrote, ``Section 2710 (d)(7)(B)(vii) of IGRA specifically allows tribes to go directly to the Secretary and ask for alternative procedures to conduct Class III gaming.'' 
   The Governor also objects to Congressional action on this issue without a hearing and as a violation of Senate Rule 16, which prohibits authorizing legislation in an appropriations bill. 
   Governor Herrera goes on to say,  
   Gaming is to Indian tribes what lotteries are to state governments. Indian gaming revenues are used to fund essential government services including law enforcement, health care services, aid for children and elderly, housing and much-needed economic development. Through gaming, tribal governments have been able to bring hope and opportunity to some of this country's most impoverished people. Contrary to popular opinion, gaming has not made Indian people rich; it has only made some of us less poor.  
   As written, the Enzi amendment before us today would delay any Secretarial actions to develop alternative regulations until 8 months after the expected report from the National Commission on Gambling (June 1999), or until February of the year 2000. If this amendment fails, lawsuits are expected over whether the Secretary has the legal right to develop these regulations that essentially skirt states rights to object to compacts. 
   Mr. President, given the delicate balances between sovereign states and tribes in IGRA, I would rather see a judicial determination of the Secretary's  rights under IGRA to develop such regulations. Like Governor Herrera has pointed out, without a hearing, it is difficult for the Senator to make this judgment. For these reasons, I remain opposed to the Enzi amendment.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to expand the State of New Mexico High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) to include three counties in the north that are under siege from ``black tar'' heroin. This amendment designates Rio Arriba County, Santa Fe County, and San Juan County as part of the New Mexico HIDTA and provides $750,000 for the remainder of fiscal year 1999 to these counties to combat this serious drug problem. This amendment is fully offset for both budget authority and outlays according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Mr. President, this is part of an overall effort to combat the serious drug epidemic in northern New Mexico. Rio Arriba County leads the nation in per capita drug-induced deaths. The rate of heroin overdoses is reportedly three times the national average. 
   Last month, I held meetings with State and local officials and community representatives to assess the overall illegal drug situation in northern New Mexico. I am pleased to say that the State and the communities have been aggressive in trying to address this problem. Our task now is to marshal additional resources to the problem so that there is a comprehensive strategy to get this drug problem under control. This comprehensive strategy will include law enforcement, such as this HIDTA designation and the additional, targeted resources in my amendment, as well as programs for prevention, education, after school activities for our children, and treatment. It will take all of these steps, with prosecution and jail time for drug traffickers, to combat this drug epidemic in New Mexico. 
   I have also enlisted the assistance of Federal agencies in this battle. The Department of Justice law enforcement agencies can assist with the illegal trafficking of ``black tar'' heroin and other drugs, some of which are smuggled into the United States by illegal Mexican nationals. The Department of Health and Human Services is also a valuable ally in this fight through the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. I am committed to marshaling both federal and state and local resources to tackle this serious problem. 
   This amendment also provides additional resources for a national program to crack down on illegal methamphetamine laboratories and trafficking. This is another serious drug problem for the nation, but my own home State of New Mexico, has seen a marked increase in these illegal activities. As a largely rural State, and so close to the border with Mexico, New Mexico has been inundated with methamphetamine. Many States are in this same predicament, and I applaud the subcommittee for boosting the resources for this important national effort. 
   Mr. President, illegal drug trafficking and use is a serious problem for our nation. In spite of the significant federal and state and local resources targeted to these illegal activities, the problem remains overwhelming in some of our communities and states. I urge the adoption of my amendment.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be managing the time on our side until Senator JEFFORDS arrives. I yield myself 6 minutes and then I will yield to the distinguished Senator. 
   Mr. President, first, I rise in strong support of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. I begin with a brief quote:  
   An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.  
   Benjamin Franklin stated that in the early years of our Republic. 
   Building upon this statement, I say it is a simple fact--which the occupant of the Chair, as a distinguished Governor in a State that has seen great economic growth and prosperity and better jobs and more opportunity--it is a simple fact that the future is prejudiced in favor of those who can read, write, and do math. 
   A good education is a ticket to a secure future in this United States. And obviously, the opposite is equally true. As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows even larger, almost no one doubts that there is a link between education and the individual's prospects, even in this great land of opportunity. 
   Today, the Senate is taking a first step to improve our Nation's educational system, because everyone acknowledges that our children are the  future of this country and we must make every effort to provide them with the tools to succeed. Our action provides States with increased flexibility to ensure that our students have an even better opportunity to succeed. I submit that because we have so many programs at the national level, small and large--and I will allude to the number shortly--that if you are looking for a place to reform, maybe you ought to start right here. 
   Maybe we ought to look at the whole package of targeted educational programs at the national level and see how far off the mark they really are when it comes to helping children in the United States. This takes some of our programs and says that one size doesn't fit all, and Washington bureaucrats and interpreters of these various laws don't always know best, so we are going to give local teachers and administrators who know the problems the opportunity to create flexibility in terms of how these various programs are used in the field for our children. 
   I want to move ahead to a summary that was given to us by the GAO that, in conjunction with the Budget Committee staff and under the leadership of Senator FRIST, looked at a whole myriad of U.S. Federal programs to see just what we were doing and what we were not doing. And so, Mr. President, I want to inform you that your concern when you were Governor of Ohio of all the bureaucracy and paperwork and missing the target by Federal programs, if you wondered why, this is why. Our National Government has funded over 86 teacher training programs in 9 agencies and offices; 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs in 15 agencies and offices; and over 90 childhood programs in 11 Federal agencies and 20 offices. 
   Now, it is quite obvious that the U.S. Government, our committees, and our Secretary, are not the know-all and end-all of good education occurring in Ohio, New Mexico, Arizona or Massachusetts. How could we be the end-all and the know-all when, essentially, we contribute less than 7 percent of the funding? Now, it almost makes us, standing on the floor speaking so eloquently about what the Federal Government is doing with its money on education, to some extent, borderline unreasonable in terms of credibility, because how can you change this big education system--and I am going to estimate that we are spending $427 billion a year on kindergarten through 12 in all our sovereign States and all the school districts. You tell me how that $200 million or $300 million targeted in some way--Mr. President, a former Governor, tell me how that $200 million or so spread across this land can have a real impact on a system that is as diverse as America and into which we are spending $417 billion and we can't get the job done. It can't be that the million dollars is going to help. It is only that we make it appear as if it is going to help. We invent the amendments and the bills, and sometimes we even take a poll before we invent them to see what it is the people want. 
   Who can be against more teachers? But if you fund the States with more money for IDEA, the disabled children, which we are already obligated to do, it relieves an equal number of dollars for them to use for teachers if they would like. Some are frightened, however, that the States and the schools might not use it for more teachers. They might use just a little piece of it for that because they already might have sufficient teachers. 
   It is not a new thing in education that we dreamt up here in Washington that we need more teachers in our schools, although it is still not unequivocal as to whether reducing the size to the level we contemplate nationally is what every school system thinks would do the job best for their children. That is not decided yet. That is still out there feverishly being tossed around with many other concepts in terms of education. 
   So, Mr. President, this is just the beginning--this flexibility--of what I hope is a real effort by the U.S. Government to reform its own education commitment to our States. We are all saying we want the States to reform, we want them to be more accountable. Well, when the bill comes up this year on primary and secondary education, it is my hope that we will not do more of the same. It is my hope that we will seriously consider a total reform of those programs, because if we are asking the States to do better, it is pretty obvious that we can do better also. As a matter of fact, I believe it is borderline these days as to just how much the Federal Government's assistance is really raising the education level of our children. 
   I repeat, if I had my way, and we could focus it into the right channels, I would be for more Federal aid to education, not less. But I guarantee you, with the myriad of programs, as I have described them, spread throughout Government with no accountability, one program to another, I would not be for spending more money to feed that kind of educational assistance when I have very serious doubts as to whether it has contributed significantly to helping our young people. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Domestic Oil and Gas Crisis Tax Relief and Foreign Oil Reliance Reversal Act of 1999. 
   It is a comprehensive, graduated approach to ensure that the United States retains control of its foreign policy and its economic destiny. 
   I believe that oil is essential to our way of life. Oil is power. 
   It has been pointed out by numerous commentators that major oil reserves and political volatility go together. The Middle East has the world's most abundant and cheapest oil, unfortunately, the U.S. does not. 
   Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are our current allies, but Iran and Iraq are not. Russia is a major natural gas producer, but reliable Russia is not. 
   Our dependence on foreign oil is reaching 57 percent, projected to reach 68 percent by 2010 if current prices prevail. 
   This isn't the usual boom and bust that the oil and gas industry goes through. The price has dropped by half in the past two years. In real terms, oil now costs roughly what it did before 1973. And prices could stay low or drop lower according to the March 6th, Economist magazine. 
   Chairman Greenspan, thus, far has been more cautious. 
   At a Budget Committee hearing recently, I asked Chairman Greenspan about the oil and gas depressed prices. For the first time that I can remember, Greenspan blessed Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) numbers. 
   Greenspan said, ``In the short term, profits for the oil and gas industry are likely to come under pressure. According to industry surveys, exploration and production spending in the U.S. is projected to decline 21 percent this year to $22.6 billion from $28.2 billion in 1998. A recent survey by the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) estimates that over 36 thousand crude oil wells and more than 56 thousand natural gas wells have been shut down since November 1997. During the same period, the IPAA estimates that 24 thousand jobs in the industry have been eliminated *.*.* The financial pressures are most serious among small producers in the United States.'' 
   Let me describe the financial pressures facing New Mexico. 
   One of the city officials told me that oil and gas revenues were so low that the town of Eunice has to decide which it will keep open--the school or the hospital. There isn't enough tax revenue in the coffers to do both! In New Mexico, the oil and gas industry is a major source of revenue. For some communities it is the only significant source. 
   The bill I am introducing today is a comprehensive, graduated response to the problem of the shrinking domestic oil and gas industry. It builds upon, and includes all of the provisions included in S. 325 introduced by Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON and cosponsored by Senators NICKLES, MURKOWSKI, BREAUX and LANDREU and myself. 
   The Hutchison bill focuses on helping our independent producers and maintaining marginal wells. These are wells that produce less than 15 barrels a day by IRS definition, but in reality, on average produce about 2.2 barrels of oil a day. There are a lot of marginal wells in the United States, and together they produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi Arabia. 
   I am also told if prices stay where they are the state could lose half of those wells by the end of the year. 
   Title I of the bill I am introducing today is part of S. 325. It includes a marginal well tax credit designed to prolong marginal domestic oil and gas well production. The credit is equal to $3.00 a barrel. 
   The bill also provides a Federal income tax exclusion for income earned from inactive wells. It is an incentive for producers to keep pumping and not to plug the wells because low prices make them uneconomic. Once a well is plugged, the oil from that well is lost for ever. 
   The bill expands the Enhanced Oil Recovery credit (EOR) that was enacted in 1990. 
   Enhanced oil recovery techniques can recover the other seventy-five percent of the oil left behind when regular techniques have pumped as much oil as they can from a well. The EOR credit is expanded to cover additional techniques and to be used by AMT taxpayers. 
   The oil and gas industry is a capital intensive industry. 
   When the price of oil drops, the cash flow for small producers dries up. There are countless producers who haven't been able to make an interest payment on their operating loans in months and as loans come due, the banks haven't been willing to renew them. 
   The world is feasting on cheap oil, and yet the oil patch is starving for capital. This credit crunch is made all the more painful because producers know that they have accumulated tax  benefits and credits that they have not been able to use, first, because they were Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) taxpayers, and more recently, because low prices have devastated their bottomline. 
   The AMT was intended to make sure that profitable companies paid their fair share of taxes. It has not worked as it was intended. In practice, the AMT imposes four penalties on investments made by U.S.-based taxpayers who explore for and produce oil and natural gas. Penalties are imposed on drilling investment and asset depreciation. These penalties significantly increase the after-tax costs and the business risks of drilling new wells. This is a very imprudent policy at a time when the U.S. is experiencing historically low drilling activity and growing import dependency. 
   The AMT increases the cost of capital of AMT taxpayers by approximately 15 to 20 percent over what it would be under the regular corporate income tax according to testimony given before the Senate Finance Committee.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like pay tribute to one of the most widely admired and respected Members of Congress of this half of the century, Morris `Mo' Udall. 
   It has been said that Mo Udall represented a time when friendships mattered more than politics. Indeed, he was an honest and straightforward person in a town notoriously short on such people, and he always tried to foster cooperation, especially among representatives from the Western states. We collaborated on many issues over the years, and I considered him a very good friend. 
   During the 1980's we served as co-chairman of the Copper Caucus and worked to help address the serious issues facing the American copper industry at the time. Together, we championed the cause of a new dollar coin, which, I'm pleased to say, is scheduled to go into circulation next year. We also worked to craft a sound nuclear waste management policy, and as Chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, his help was invaluable in designating parks, wilderness, and other recreation areas in New Mexico. 
   I believe it is this area--land stewardship--where he left his most indelible mark. He cherished the land not only for the natural resources it can provide, but for its recreational and ecological value as well. Under his 14 year leadership, the House Interior Committee became one of the most efficient and effective committees in Congress, sometimes responsible for a quarter of the legislation passed by the House of Representatives. It is true that every person who stops to take a picture at a national park or hikes through a wilderness area owes a debt of gratitude to Mo Udall. His efforts in this area have touched us all. 
   Perhaps the second greatest legacy Mo Udall leaves behind is his legendary humor. In his 1988 book ``Too Funny to be President,'' he wrote ``It's better to have a sense of humor than no sense at all.'' Mo put this ``sense'' to good use, often employing it to make a point or defuse a tense situation. His philosophy was that the best political humor always ``has a little love behind it,'' and I can hardly think of a man more loved by his peers than Mo Udall. 
   Today, a new generation represents the Udall name in Congress. Mo's nephew, TOM UDALL, is the newest member of the New Mexico Delegation, and I look forward to working with him in the same manner as I worked with his uncle. TOM and Mo's son, MARK UDALL, do have big shoes to fill, but they also have an exemplary model to follow, and I trust they will carry on the Udall tradition of unswerving integrity and honor. 
   Arizona has lost a beloved native son, and New Mexico has lost a good friend and neighbor. His wit, grace and unflagging passion for the West will be missed by all of us who had the privilege to work with him.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I have listened carefully to the arguments of the House Managers and the counter-arguments by the White House counsel during this impeachment trial. I have taken seriously my oath to render impartial justice. 
   While the legal nuances offered by both sides were interesting and essential, I kept thinking as I sat listening that the most obvious and important but unstated question was: What standard of conduct should we insist our President live up to? 
   Only by taking into account this question do I believe that we in the Senate can properly interpret our Founding Fathers' impeachment criteria comprised of ``bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Clearly, the Constitution recognizes that a President may be impeached not only for bribery and treason, but also for other actions that destroy the underlying integrity of the Presidency or the ``equal justice for all'' guarantee of the Judiciary. 
   All reasonable observers admit that the President lied under oath and undertook a substantial and purposeful effort to hide his behavior from others in order to obstruct justice in a legal proceeding. My good friends and Democratic colleagues, Senators JOE LIEBERMAN, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, BOB KERREY, DIANE FEINSTEIN, and ROBERT BYRD, among others, have bluntly acknowledged publically that the President lied, misled, obstructed, and attempted in many ways to thwart justice's impartial course in a civil rights case. The sticking point has been: Does this misbehavior rise to the level of impeachable offenses? 
   I have concluded that President Clinton's actions do, indeed, rise to the level of impeachable offenses that the Founding Fathers envisioned. 
   I am not a Constitutional scholar, as I have told you before. But, more than 200 years ago, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Jay summed up my feelings about lying under oath and its subversion of the administration of justice and honest government:  
   Independent of the abominable insult which Perjury offers to the divine Being, There is no Crime more pernicious to Society. It discolours and poisons the Streams of Justice, and by substituting Falsehood for Truth, saps the Foundations of personal and public rights....... Testimony is given under solemn obligations which an appeal to the God of Truth impose; and if oaths should cease to be held sacred, our dearest and most valuable Rights would become insecure.  
   Lying under oath is an ``insult to the divine Being ..... It discolours and poisons the Streams of Justice ..... and ..... saps the Foundations of personal and public Rights.'' 
   How can anyone, after conceding that the President lied under oath and obstructed justice, listen to this quotation and not conclude that this President has committed acts which are clearly serious, which corrupt or subvert the political and government process, and which are plainly wrong to any honorable person or to a good citizen? 
   We must start by saying that this trial has never been about the President's private sex acts, as tawdry as they may have been. 
   This trial has been about his failure to properly discharge his public responsibility. The President had a choice to make during this entire, lamentable episode. At a number of critical junctures, he had a choice either to tell the truth or to lie, first in the civil rights case, before the grand jury and on national television. Each time he chose to lie. He made that fateful choice. 
   Truthfulness is the first pillar of good character in the Character Counts program of which I have been part of establishing in New Mexico. Many of you in this chamber have joined me in declaring the annual ``Character Counts Weeks.'' This program teaches grade school youngsters throughout America about six pillars of good character. Public and private schools in every corner of my state teach children that character counts; character makes a difference; indeed, character makes all the difference. 
   Guess which one of these pillars comes first? Trustworthiness. Trustworthiness. 
   So what do I say to the children in my state when they ask, ``Didn't the President lie? Doesn't that mean he isn't trustworthy? Then, Senator, why didn't the Senate punish him?''  
   Let me quote one of the most critical passages from Charles L. Black, Jr., and his handbook on impeachment, one of the seminal works on the impeachment process. He ponders this question: what kinds of non-criminal acts by a President are clearly impeachable? He concludes that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' are those kinds of offenses which fall into three categories: ``(1) which are extremely serious, (2) which in some way corrupt or subvert the political and governmental process, and (3) which are plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor, or to a good citizen, regardless of words on the statute books.'' 
   Well, there you have it in my judgment. The President lied under oath in a civil rights case, he lied before a grand jury and he lied on national television to the American people. 
   Regarding Article II, obstruction of justice the House Managers proved to my satisfaction the following facts:

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senator KENNEDY and a group of bipartisan cosponsors to introduce the ``Program for Investment in Micro-Entrepreneurs'' or ``PRIME Act of 1999.'' 
   Starting one's own business long has been viewed as a realization of the American dream. Right now, thousands of creative and hardworking men and women across the country believe that they have a solid idea for building a new business. However, starting a small business takes more than a good idea, hard work, and luck to make it work--many of these men and women need help turning their ideas into a viable business enterprise. 
   These would-be small and micro entrepreneurs face overwhelming obstacles, due in part to the complexity of local, state, and Federal laws, and the difficulty of finding adequate sources of capital. Often, they have no experience dealing with the intricacies of marketing, feasibility studies, and bookkeeping practices. Entrepreneurs usually need basic technical assistance, training, and mentoring to be successful. 
   Under this bill, grants will be available through the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, matched at least 50 percent in non-Federal funds, to help experienced nonprofit organizations provide the assistance these new businesses so urgently require. Fifty percent of these grants will be awarded to applicants serving low-income clients and those serving equally both urban and rural areas. 
   From so many case studies and histories of successful businesses, we know that enthusiastic entrepreneurs can build and sustain their businesses when they have access to critical training and professional technical assistance at the outset of their endeavor. 
   During the past few years, I have had the pleasure of visiting countless new micro-level businesses in my State of New Mexico. A great majority of these businesses received assistance from the WESST Corp. organization, now located in five different sites throughout our State. This organization provides key technical assistance and training, as well as access to low interest revolving loans. But WESST Corp. also goes a step further in providing guidance and information about sound business practices to ensure that the creative ideas of micro-entrepreneurs become sound business endeavors. 
   Micro and small businesses are absolutely critical components of our national economic growth. They often embody the ingenuity and innovation central to the American spirit. Investment in the ideas of these enterprising Americans has long been recognized as a worthwhile endeavor. The Small Business Administration, for example, lends excellent support to entrepreneurs. The PRIME Act will establish a complementary program which enables intermediary organizations to serve more micro-level entrepreneurs who need specialized and hands-on assistance. 
   This is a good investment for the future, and will be rewarded many times over by the creation of businesses that can contribute to the growth of family, local and national economies. We all can recall success stories about business that began with the inspired idea of a single person and eventually grew in to a major global corporation. In every story, the basic tenacity of a businessman, woman, or family allowed the fledgling business overcome initial obstacles and achieve great success. We have no way of knowing how many more such success stories will be told in the future. It is guaranteed, however, that there are thousands of such extraordinary entrepreneurs willing to provide the ideas and hard labor to make it happen, and with a little help, they can realize their dreams. 
   Senator KENNEDY and I came up with this concept in legislation we introduced during the 105th Congress, and I understand that the President has made room for it in his budget this year. I am pleased to join Senator KENNEDY in cosponsoring the PRIME Act again in this Congress. Owning one's own business remains a vital part of the American dream. Whatever we can do to continue this legacy and assist those who want to be self-reliant and successful entrepreneurs is an investment worth making.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just weeks after the calamity hit Central America last year, Senate Majority Leader LOTT asked me to lead to bipartisan fact-finding mission to the region. The objective of our trip was to assess Mitch's impact on the region's economy, priorities for U.S. aid, and the potential ramifications of this disaster on future trade with the region.  
   Senator FRIST joined me on this trip. His knowledge of health care and medicinal needs was a valuable addition to the trip. We were fortunate also to be joined by three individuals form the Administration: Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Harriet Babbitt, Deputy Administrator at USAID, and the Honorable Josh Gotbaum, Office of Management and Budget. 
   I believe this tour was invaluable to all who participated. First, because of what we learned about the region and the devastation caused by Mitch. Second, because it expressed the spirit of bipartisanship that I hope will carry through in our efforts to help Central Americans rebuild and flourish as democratic neighbors. 
   As unlikely as it might sound, the ravages of Hurricane Mitch in Central America may have a silver lining. But the United States and other countries must act quickly and decisively. This is the message we heard form Central Americans themselves, as well as relief workers and American government officials, when we visited that storm-torn region in December. That's also the message I would like to convey to my Senate colleagues. 
   This relative optimism is remarkable. More than 10,000 lives were lost to the storm; 40 percent of the GDP in Nicaragua and Honduras was swept away; 3 million persons in the region now live in temporary shelters or without shelter at all. And, that's in a region with fewer people than the state of California! 
   Yet, even those 1,000 persons we saw crowded into a single small school, those 104 jammed in a cemetery chapel, agreed that a golden moment now exists to move forward in this historically troubled region. 
   The response from the United States already has been both effective and generous, with the first 30 days of the relief efforts exceeding the Berlin airlift. Our 6,000 military personnel have performed heroically, in a relatively unheralded but extraordinary operation. The military and other agencies delivered two thirds of the world's donations already in-region and have helped avoid the disease and starvation that usually takes root within a few weeks following such a calamity. 
   The response from Central American governments has been heartening, too. Don't forget that the United States has worked for more than a quarter of a century to help develop democratic movements in this region. If we fail to move quickly now, elements that oppose democracy could gain a foothold, rendering the sacrifices of money and arms of the past 25 years useless. Thus, we were gratified to hear all important government agencies and relief groups emphasize over and over again, ``We want your help, not forever, but so we can begin to help ourselves and continue building stable and democratic societies.'' 
   As the initial relief phase of the effort comes to a close, and a period of reconstruction and rebuilding begins, the United States faces some tougher decisions about the nature of our assistance. These decisions are not simply whether we help our friends rebuild the bridges, houses, roads and towns they lost. We must also decide how we assist them in rebuilding the young and fragile institutions which are the products of the region's remarkable shift to democracy and functioning, growing economies. 
   Our policy must first offer debt relief under which these governments struggle. Nicaragua's government spends $220 million a year to pay its creditors and Honduras pays $341. Freeing up those resources, even temporarily, is more valuable to them than a simple infusion of cash. 
   Second, we must expeditiously pursue a reasonable option to allow these countries to strength mutually beneficial trade relationships. Relief and reconstruction are meaningless without an expectation of sustaining their benefits through the growth such trade will undoubtedly foster. 
   Third, we must push the European Union to uphold their promise to aid these countries by ending their discrimination against Central American bananas and other agricultural exports in favor to those from their former colonies. 
   Fourth, Central American governments must continue creating incentives for new investment and broader credit availability to the people through their own domestic legislation and regulation. The began on such a path before Mitch, and we must push and assist them in redoubling those efforts. 
   Finally, the need to rebuild the devastated infrastructure of the region cannot be underemphasized. Over 70 percent of the roads in Honduras were washed away. Crops cannot be harvested without roads to carry the produce. Poor water sanitation has brought about a public health nightmare. In addition to the direct assistance, we can offer the technology, financing and expertise at a level which these countries simply do not have at their disposal. 
   In pursuit of these goals, we commend the Administration for acting quickly and for using their authority to reprogram already enacted funds for the relief efforts. However, we must remember that the work is not done when the news cameras move to the next story, and a sustained, bipartisan effort with Congress will be required. This bill builds on the bipartisan necessary to formulate effective assistance to our neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean. 
   Carinal Obando y Bravo of Nicaragua best summed up for us the hope of the Central American people. Over 30 years they lived through natural disasters, wars, totalitarian governments, and now Mitch. Like before, he said the people will ``rise like a phoenix form the ashes.'' If we are committed and resourceful in that shared goal, we can help guarantee that the mythical image is not simply a myth.

   Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator COVERDELL very much. I hope I will not use 10 minutes because there are other Senators here. 
   Let me say to the distinguished occupant of the Chair, Senator GREGG, I was here when he made his remarks. I think the most salient aspect of those remarks--while I agree with almost all of it--the most salient area can be formulated into a question. 
   My question is this: For at least 10 years we have been struggling in this land with commission after commission, study group after study group trying to tell us how we could repair Social Security so that it will be available in the next millennium, because of the terrible impact on that Social Security fund, of the actual demographics of America, and the baby boomers hitting pension time. Now, does it seem logical that after all of that discussion that essentially we don't have to do anything to save Social Security? 
   I asked the question so I can answer it because I believe everybody that is working so hard at it would say the answer is, no; you can't fix Social Security by doing nothing for or to or in any way reform or change it.  
   Now the only thing the President of the United States did in this budget is make a proposal that will never pass the Congress, that a tiny piece of this so-called surplus that belongs to Social Security be invested in the equities market of America by a government-controlled board, who would be subject to all kinds of pressures that would distort the market of America. I don't say that singularly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has used far stronger words than these: that it won't work, that it will be detrimental. So in a sense, that is the only thing proposed. 
   Now, I am going to lower my voice and say, on the other hand, the President is going to say that he transfers some of the surplus of America to the Social Security fund and it is there and thereby it extends the life. But the Senator has so adequately stated, What is being transferred? In the end, what is being transferred is going to result in debts that have to be paid by somebody, some time, because we have neither enhanced Social Security by investing a significant portion in the equities market, nor have we, in any way, if one seeks to reform it otherwise, made any changes to it except to add to it. 
   Frankly, that is a missed opportunity. I think I might say it is a missed opportunity, perhaps, because of the clamor that we are in today politically. 
   I think last year the President was on the right track. He had meetings and bipartisan seminars and everybody went. They held one in Albuquerque, NM. And forthrightly, the President used to say to people who opposed investing it in the equities market, in as safe a way as possible, Why should the Social Security trust fund yield so much less to the Social Security recipients than investing in other pension plans? He used to ask that question when people were against investing it. What happened, however, as this budget came rolling through under the political turmoil that exists, the President sent us nothing but some words that say we hope we can work together. 
   I hope we can, too, because I think if we did it would be a far different proposal than what is in this budget, which is borderline nothing with reference to Social Security. 
   There are so many other things to talk about, but I am only going to talk about three and do it very quickly. Fellow Republicans, conservatives and moderate conservatives in America, this budget presents the best opportunity for those who think conservatively and Republican and moderately conservative, to present a basic issue that disagrees with the President and those who follow him in the Democratic Party. 
   My friend from Idaho, it is basically this: When you have a very large overpayment by the taxpayers of America, an unexpected tax burden that yields billions of dollars that were unexpected, that we don't need, that are now building up a surplus, what do you do with it? And one approach is to save it. The President says he is being conservative and saving it. But I add to that, saving it so it can be spent. And in some instances, spending it under the President's budget or give it back to the American taxpayers in proportion to how they paid it to us. 
   That falls simply under the rubric of a tax cut. I have explained it as well as I could as to why the time has arrived. Why is this an opportunity to debate a difference? Because if you don't give it back to the taxpayer, no matter what contortions you go through about transferring it to trust accounts with new IOUs and the like, it is available to be spent, 
   and I am not going to be anymore positive about that, other than to ask another question: Does anyone think that that kind of surplus sitting around is going to really stay sitting around, or is it going to do something else? I submit that the President is on a path to showing us already that it is going to be spent. 
   My last one--I will do one additional one--is this: Anybody in this Chamber or across this land who has heard the President speak and has heard his budget presented, answer this question for me: Did the President propose spending some of the surplus which he is going to put into Medicare? Did he propose spending it for prescription drugs? Frankly, I surmise that already, among those who are interested, 95 percent would answer that question that he proposed spending it for prescription drugs. But that would be inconsistent with saving it, right? So, as a matter of fact, if you read his speech attentively and listen to two of his witnesses--OMB and Treasury--it is now obvious that he does not propose to spend any of it for prescription drugs. 
   But isn't it interesting? You put it in the trust fund to make the trust fund more solvent, but then you don't propose that any of it gets spent. That is what is going to happen to the surplus. That is one example--the big surplus, over and above the Social Security surplus. It is going to find niches in this country, special interest groups of all types, small and large, and it is going to be spent. 
   Now, are we undertaxed? Of course not. We would not have this kind of surplus if we were undertaxed. This surplus indicates what a surplus of this size should indicate, which is that tax receipts are very high. In fact, the total tax receipts of the Federal Government are the highest percentage of the gross domestic product that they have been in 50 years. You can pick pieces of the taxpayers and draw different conclusions for different groups. But essentially it is true that the total tax take is going up as a percentage of our gross domestic product, and that sends a signal: It is time to take a look and make sure you don't spend at that level, because then you move America into a high tax country. Our success is not as a high tax country; our success is as a low tax country. That is why we are succeeding over and above other countries in the world. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to introduce ``The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act of 1999.'' 
   The introduction of this Bill marks a historic opportunity for rural communities to create jobs within the telecommunications industry. The Bill establishes a program to train residents of low income rural areas for employment in telecommunications industry jobs located in those same rural areas. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have an initiative called ``rural payday'' and I believe this Bill is yet another step in creating jobs for our rural areas. All too often a rural area is characterized by a high number of low income residents and a high unemployment rate. 
   Moreover, our rural areas are often dependent upon a small number of employers or a single industry for employment opportunities. Consequently, when there is a plant closing, a downturn in the economy, or a slowdown in the area's industry the already present problems are only compounded. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment and talk about New Mexico. 
   While New Mexico may be the 5th largest state by size with its beautiful mountains, desert, and Great Plains and vibrant cities such as Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces it is also a very rural state. The Northwest and Southeast portions of the state are closely tied to the fortunes of the oil and gas industry. Additionally, a community can be dealt a severe blow with the closing or downsizing of an employer or manufacturing plant. 
   I would also like to mention that communities like Clovis and Roswell are already taking steps to lay the foundation for creating jobs through the Call Center Industry. Just recently in Clovis, over a 1,000 people participated in a Career Expo that focused on attracting Call Center companies to the area. 
   As I stated before, all too often rural areas do not possess the resources of more metropolitan areas and can be devastated by a single event or downturn in the economy. The Bill I am introducing today will allow communities, like those I just mentioned, to apply for Federal aid to assist them in taking the next step in attracting telecommunications jobs. 
   The Bill will allow the Secretary of Labor to establish a program to promote rural employment in the telecommunications industry by providing grants to states with low income rural areas. The program will be a win win proposition for all involved because employers choosing to participate in the project by bringing jobs to the rural area will be assured of a highly skilled workforce. 
   The program will provide residents with intensive services to train them for the new jobs in the telecommunications industry. The intensive services will include customized training and appropriate remedial training, support services and placement of the individual in one of the new jobs created by the program. 
   And that is what this bill is about, providing people with the tools needed to succeed. With these steps we are embarking on the road of providing our rural areas throughout our nation with a vehicle to create jobs. We are creating opportunities and an environment where our citizens can succeed and our communities can be vibrant.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I'm pleased to see the Federal Research Investment Act introduced in the 106th Congress. This bill is one that I've supported throughout its history, because it addresses the health of our nation's science and technology base. 
   Our science and technology base is vital to the nation's future. Any number of studies have confirmed its importance. As one excellent example, the National Innovation Summit, organized by MIT last March with the Council on Competitiveness, confirmed that the integrity of that base is one of the cornerstones to our future economic prosperity. At that Summit, many of the nation's top CEOs emphasized that the nation's climate for innovation is a major determinant of our ability to maintain and advance our high standard of living and strong economy. 
   Advanced technologies are responsible for driving half of our economic growth since World War II, and that growth has developed our economy into the envy of the world. We need to continually refresh our stock of new products and processes that enable good jobs for our citizens in the face of increasing global challenges to all our principal industries. 
   This bill emphasizes a broad range of research targets, from fundamental and frontier exploration, through pre-competitive engineering research. This emphasis on a spectrum of research maturity is absolutely critical. The nation is not well served by a focus on so-called ``basic'' research that can open new fields, but then leave those fields without resources to develop new ideas to a pre-competitive stage applicable to future commercial products and processes. 
   The new bill addresses a spectrum of research fields with its emphasis on expanding S&T funding in many agencies. We need technical advances in many fields simultaneously. In more and more cases, the best new ideas are not flowing from explorations in a single narrow field, but instead are coming from inter-disciplinary studies that bring experts from diverse fields together for fruitful collaboration. This is especially evident in medical and health fields, where combinations of medical science with many other specialities are critical to the latest health care advances. 
   This new bill has additional features that were critical components of last year's S. 2217. It proposes to utilize the National Academy of Science in developing approaches to evaluation of program and project performance. This should lead to better understanding of how Government Performance Results Act goals and scientific programs can be best coordinated. The new role for the National Academy can help define criteria to guide decisions on continued and future funding. The bill also sets up procedures to use these evaluations to terminate federal programs that are not performing at acceptable levels. 
   The new bill incorporates a set of well-developed principles for federal funding of science and technology. These principles were developed by our Senate Science and Technology Caucus. Those principles, when carefully applied, can lead to better choices among the many opportunities for federal S&T funding. The new bill also incorporates recommendations for independent merit-based review of federal S&T programs, which should further strengthen them. 
   Many aspects of the Federal Research Investment Act support and compliment key points in the study released by Representative VERN EHLERS last year. His study, ``Unlocking our Future,'' will serve as an important focal point for continuing discussions on the critical goal of strengthening our nation's science and technology base. 
   This Federal Research Investment Act continues the goals expressed in S. 1305 last year. That was followed by S. 2217 that proposed a more realistic time scale for achieving this expanded support, added GPRA performance goals, and included language that recognized the importance of the budgets caps. This new bill is very similar to S. 2217. 
   The new Federal Research Investment Act builds and improves on the goals of the previous bills. With this act, we will build stronger federal Science and Technology programs that will underpin our nation's ability to compete effectively in the global marketplace of the 21st century.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the recently introduced Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I would like to begin by making an observation about the impact of any potential changes to the managed care system. 
   I would submit that whether a decision relating to healthcare is made by business or the government, the results will always have consequences on the those actually utilizing the system. Let me put that another way, we must always proceed with what the impact of any changes will mean to families and beneficiaries. 
   Thus, when decisions are made, they must be thought out and done so in a responsible manner. And I believe the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights does just that by: holding HMO's accountable, increasing access, improving quality and, expanding choice. 
   At the same time we must work to ensure that: costs are not unnecessarily increased, more Americans are not forced into the ranks of the uninsured and, additional layers of bureaucracy are not placed between patients and their doctors. 
   Let me take just a moment to talk about the state of health care in New Mexico. 
   Health care is close to a $5 billion a year industry in New Mexico. Almost 3,000 physicians practice in the state and overall the industry employs close to 52,000 New Mexicans. Over 600,000 New Mexicans are enrolled in managed care plans. 
   With this in mind, I would like to make several points about New Mexico as a whole, that are relevant to any debate relating to managed care: 78% of New Mexico businesses have 10 or fewer employees and 96% of all businesses have 50 or fewer employees. New Mexico ranks 40th in the nation in terms of the number of people uninsured, a full 25% of the population. 
   The preceding merely emphasizes a point that we must take into consideration and that is the potential impact upon a state and its people. 
   I think everyone would agree that the managed care system is not perfect and we have all heard one or another of those so called HMO horror stories. As a result, there is now a debate going on here and around the country about the need for HMO/Managed Care reform. 
   I also want to take a moment to point out that New Mexico is already at the forefront of HMO/Managed Care Reform. 
   New Mexico has already implemented many of the so called ``patient protections'' like: no gag clauses; a prudent layperson standard for emergency care; direct access to an OB/GYN; choice of providers; access to prescription drugs; confidentiality of medical records and; a grievance and appeals procedure. 
   I think it is important to stop and make a point that I believe is extremely important in light of the large number of small employers and high rate of uninsured not only in New Mexico, but the rest of the country. For every 1% increase in premium costs, 400,000 individuals will lose their health insurance coverage. 
   That is an extremely sobering thought when one realizes that small employers often have the most difficult time providing insurance for their employees because of the already high cost. 
   The Republican bill simply addresses Americans' concerns that their rights be assured in health care coverage, in addition to increasing access to care, improving quality of care, and expanding choice. 
   However, there is one thing the Bill will not do, create a new right to go into the courts and sue managed care companies for unlimited damages. I believe that we on this side of the aisle have adopted a sense about health care and it says: lawyers and lawsuits do not deliver health care. Rather, lawyers and lawsuits generally make health care cost more. 
   I also think that it is very important to note that under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) a participant or beneficiary can already sue a managed care company. Let me repeat that, the right to sue a HMO is already available. 
   Now why would we want to create even more lawsuits, when for years we have been attempting to enact tort reform. 
   I know many New Mexicans share in the fears expressed by many Americans about the availability and quality of their health care. That is why I support the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights because it will ensure that patients receive: more affordable care and more choices; greater access to more and better information about health plans, benefits and the doctors that provide their care; and the advantages of a system that holds health plans accountable for medical decisions through a strong internal and external appeals process. 
   The Bill reforms the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, renaming it the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research (AHQR). It will make annual reports on the state of quality and cost of America's health care, support primary care research in underserved rural and urban areas, provide technology assessment, and coordinate federal quality improvement efforts. 
   Furthermore, the Bill includes a provision that will prohibit insurance plans from using predictive genetic information to deny coverage or to set premium rates. 
   Finally, the Bill would provide relief to those New Mexicans and Americans who are self-employed by allowing them to deduct 100% of their health insurance costs. More than 25 million people live in families headed by a self-employed individual (5.1 million of whom are currently uninsured). 
   In closing, I believe that the key to improving our healthcare system and to improving our HMO/Managed Care System is to work together. 
   As I have said, we must find a solution that would most benefit not only New Mexicans, but everyone across our country. However, at the same time we must remember that our decisions cannot affect these same people in an adverse manner.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that will provide long-term benefits for the people of Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. In November of 1997, I introduced the Rio Arriba, New Mexico Land Conveyance Act of 1998. The bill would have transferred unwanted federal land and facilities to a community desperately seeking the ability to grow. The bill had bipartisan support, and created a win-win situation. After incorporating suggested changes from the Administration, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported the bill unanimously in May 1998, and the Senate passed S. 1510 on July 17, 1998. 
   Unfortunately, despite the logic and benefit of the legislation, the bill failed to pass the House of Representatives in the waning days of the 105th Congress. I am hoping that this body can promptly pass this needed legislation again, and that the House will agree that this type of transfer is logical and should be quickly passed since it provides facilities and lands for community use while removing unwanted and unused land and facilities from federal ownership. 
   Over one-third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal government, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can be difficult. More than seventy percent of Rio Arriba County is in federal ownership. Communities in this area have found themselves unable to grow or find available property necessary to provide local services. This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretary of the Interior real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus ranger station for the Carson National Forest to Rio Arriba County. The site is known as the Old Coyote Administrative Site, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico. 
   The Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes for the County, potentially including a community center and a fire substation. Some of the buildings will also be available for the County to use for storage and repair of road maintenance equipment and other County vehicles. 
   Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of no further use to them, since they have recently completed construction of a new administrative facility for the Coyote Ranger District. The Forest Service reported to the General Services Administration that the improvements on the site were considered surplus, and would be available for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this particular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been built is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. 
   I worked closely in the last Congress with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to make this transfer a reality. The Administration is supportive of the legislation and the changes made to the bill at their suggestion. Since neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the Forest Service have any interest in maintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, and Rio Arriba County desperately needs them, passage of this bill is a win-win situation for both the federal government, New Mexico, and the people of Rio Arriba County. I look forward to prompt passage of this legislation again in the Senate, the House's agreement, and Presidential signature as soon as possible.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am again introducing the Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer Act. I, along with Congressman SKEEN, have been working to convey tracts of land--paid for by Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred to as ``acquired lands''--back to the district, during the past several congresses. 
   I introduced this bill in May of 1997 in order to transfer lands back to the rightful owners. This legislation transfers acquired land without affecting operations at the New Mexico state park at Brantley Dam, or the operations and ownership of the dam itself. Furthermore, the bill allows the Carlsbad Irrigation District to utilize proceeds from oil and gas leases on the transferred lands and moves land management responsibilities from the federal government to a local entity. 
   The Carlsbad Irrigation Project is a single-purpose project created in 1905 by the Bureau of Reclamation. The district has had operations and maintenance responsibilities for the irrigation  and drainage system since 1932. This legislation directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage the lands as they have been in the past, for the purposes for which the project was constructed. It met all the repayment obligations to the government in 1991, and it's about time we let Carlsbad Irrigation District have what is rightfully theirs. 
   This is a fair and equitable bill that has been developed over years of negotiations. This legislation accomplishes three things: conveys title of acquired lands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; allows the District to assume management of leases and the benefits of the receipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180 day deadline for the transfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying out the transfer. 
   This bill passed the Senate near the end of the 105th Congress, but unfortunately did not get through the House of Representatives due to political wrangling at the end of the session. However, this bill has strong bipartisan and administration support, and it is about time that we pass this legislation to provide the Bureau of Reclamation with the ability to accomplish their stated goal of logical transfer such as this. 
   This transfer shifts responsibility from the federal government back to a local entity, and creates opportunity for the district to improve and enhance the management of these lands. I hope that both the Senate and the House of Representatives will act quickly on this legislation so that the Carlsbad Irrigation District will promptly begin getting the benefits for that which they have paid.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill which will help preserve an important part of American history for future generations--Route 66. This legislation, which passed in the Senate at the end of the 105th Congress, will protect the unique cultural resources along the famous Route 66 corridor and authorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance  through the Park Service. Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON of Albuquerque, New Mexico, has reintroduced a companion bill (H.R. 66) in the House of Representatives, and we hope this Congress will act promptly in passing this legislation aiding grassroots efforts to maintain this important part of American culture. 
   The road system of a nation links its people together. Without such a road, the movement of goods and services would be impossible. History is replete with examples of pioneers, such as those that forged the Santa Fe Trail, trying to find passage across this great country. 
   John Steinbeck referred to Route 66 as the ``Mother Road'' in ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' and many in this Chamber may recall traveling across country on this road in their youth. New Mexico added to the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of Americans their first experience of our colorful culture and heritage. Starting in Chicago, Illinois, and winding 2,200 miles across the United States to Santa Monica, California, Route 66 linked the urban centers of the Midwest and West. Services sprung up along the route to provide for travelers crossing the heart of the country. 
   It rolled through eight American states, and in New Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants and Gallup. Route 66 allowed generations of vacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the natural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. Route 66 symbolized freedom and mobility for an entire generation of Americans in their automobiles. This bill will facilitate greater coordination in federal, state and private efforts to preserve structures and other cultural resources of the historic Route 66 corridor, the 20th Century route equivalent to the Santa Fe Trail. 
   I introduced the Route 66 Study Act of 1990, which directed the National Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, commemorate and interpret Route 66. The study, which was completed in 1995, determined that Route 66 had historic national significance, and the structures along the disappearing asphalt should be preserved. As a result, I introduced a bill last June authorizing the National Park Service to join with federal, state and private efforts to preserve aspects of the historic Route 66 corridor, the nation's most important thoroughfare for east-west migration in the 20th century. 
   The Administration testified in favor of this legislation, with some modifications. We made some good changes to the bill, which passed the Senate, and prompt passage will ensure success of this Park Service program. This legislation authorizes a funding level over 10 years and stresses that we want the federal government to support grassroots efforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway. 
   This bill authorizes the National Park Service to support state, local and private efforts to preserve the Route 66 corridor by providing technical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, and making grants. The Park Service will also act as a clearing house for communication among federal, state, local, private and American Indian entities interested in the preservation of the Route 66 corridor. 
   As we draw to the close of this century, there is more interest in trying to save Route 66. I once again ask this body to promptly pass this legislation, and sincerely hope the House of Representatives follows suit. The time is now to provide tangible means of assistance to preserve this special part of Americana.

    Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to again introduce important legislation allowing for a transfer of an unwanted piece of federal property to an educational institution which needs it. The Old Jicarilla Site Conveyance Act of 1999 allows for transfer by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior of real property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus ranger station to San Juan College. The site is in the Carson National Forest near the village of Gobernador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Site will continue to be used for public purposes, including educational and recreational purposes of the college. 
   Over one third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal government, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can be difficult. The Forest Service determined that these ten acres are of no further use to them because a new administrative facility has been located in the town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. In fact, the facility has had no occupants for several years, and the Forest Service testified last year that enactment of this bill would ``provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan County and the students and faculty of San Juan College.'' 
   I am hoping this bill will again move swiftly through this body. Clearly, this legislation deserves prompt approval in the House and signature by the President because it is noncontroversial and the land can readily be put to good use for San Juan College and the area residents. We also need to put this property in the hands of the college so it can protect the area from further deterioration and fire.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Let me start by saying in the past the President has said the era of big government is over, and last night what he meant was that he was proposing an era of really big government and no tax cuts for the American people for 15 years. Frankly, I don't believe that will sell. I think when the American people understand what the President recommended last night, they will ask: What happened to the surplus that is not needed for Social Security, that we paid to the Government in taxes? Why don't we get some of it back? 
   That is the issue. They should get some of it back. We have underestimated the tax take of this country; thus, we have an excess of taxes in the coffers of the United States. Who paid that money to us? The taxpayers. They should get some or all of it back. I believe the best way to do that is an across-the-board tax cut. I don't write tax laws here, but obviously what we are talking about is equity and fairness; but, in addition, something that is very good for the American economy. 
   The world is in some kind of strange recessionary mood, with whole pieces  of it not working. The United States has been immune from that. Now is the time to have a tax cut, and the best kind is across-the-board to make sure that we are adding to the American economy an ingredient that is apt to keep us going at this formidable rate of sustained growth and jobs and prosperity. That means a tax cut now for the American people and for the future prosperity of our country. 
   In addition, I suggest that people ought to look at what the President proposed to do with this surplus. I am amazed. This surplus--which is taxpayers' money, that is in excess of Social Security--the President has now decided he knows precisely how to use it. Every bit of it is spent, I say to my friend, Senator THURMOND: New programs, new ideas, new needs, even some money for Medicare. And we have never heretofore put general taxpayers' money in Medicare. So he wants to spend it all and the taxpayers will get none of it back. 
   It seems to this Senator that that is a good issue to take to the public, to take to the people of this land. What do you want to do with this surplus? Do you want a bigger Government and spend more of it? Or spend all of it? Or do you want to give some of it back to the taxpayers who work hard in this land to make ends meet and truly, truly are the engines of this growth period we have had? Hard-working Americans caused this to happen. There is higher productivity because they are more skilled and their employers are using new equipment and new technology--higher productivity, more jobs. 
   Surplus means to me that taxpayers should get some benefit. We are going to work very hard to see to it that the people understand it and we have a real opportunity to help them if they will help us. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator THOMPSON, the distinguished Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator LIEBERMAN, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee and 13 other Senators, I rise to introduce the ``Biennial Budget and Appropriations Act,'' a bill to convert the budget and appropriations process to a two-year cycle and to enhance oversight of federal programs. 
   Mr. President, our most recent experience with the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act shows the need for a biennial appropriations and budget process. That one bill clearly demonstrated Congress is incapable of completing the budget, authorizing, and appropriations process on an annual basis. That 4,000 paged bill contained 8 of the regular appropriations bills, $9 billion in revenue provisions, $21.4 billion in ``emergency'' spending, and 40 miscellaneous funding and authorization provisions. 
   Congress should now act to streamline the system by moving to a two-year, or biennial, budget process. This is the most important reform we can enact to streamline the budget process, to make the Senate a more deliberative and effective institution, and to make us more accountable to the American people. 
   Mr. President, moving to a biennial budget and appropriations process enjoys very broad support. President Clinton supports this bill. Presidents Reagan and Bush also proposed a biennial appropriations and budget cycle. Leon Panetta, who served as White House Chief of Staff, OMB Director, and House Budget Committee Chairman, has advocated a biennial budget since the late 1970s. Former OMB and CBO Director Alice Rivlin has called for a biennial budget the past two decades. Both of the Senate Leaders support this legislation. And, at the end of last year, 37 Senators wrote our two Senate Leaders calling for quick action to pass legislation to convert the budget and appropriations process to a two-year cycle. 
   The most recent comprehensive studies of the federal government and the Congress have recommended this reform. The Vice President's National Performance Review and the 1993 Joint Committee on the Reorganization of Congress both recommended a biennial appropriations and budget cycle. 
   A biennial budget will dramatically improve the current budget process. The current annual budget process is redundant, inefficient, and destined for failure each year. Look at what we struggle to complete each year under the current annual process. The annual budget process consumes three years: one year for the Administration to prepare the President's budget, another year for the Congress to put the budget into law, and the final year to actually execute the budget. 
   Today, I want to focus just on the Congressional budget process, the process of annually passing a budget resolution, authorization legislation, and 13 appropriation bills. The record clearly shows that last year's experience was nothing new. Under the annual process, we consistently fail to complete action on the 13 appropriations bills, to authorize programs, and to meet our deadlines. 
   Since 1950 Congress has only twice met the fiscal year deadline for completion of all thirteen individual appropriations bills to fully fund the government. 
   The Congressional Budget Office's recent report on unauthorized appropriations shows that for fiscal year 1999, 118 laws authorizing appropriations have expired. These laws cover over one-third or $102.1 billion of appropriations for non-defense programs. Another 10 laws authorizing non-defense appropriations will expire at the end of fiscal year 1997, representing $10.4 billion more in unauthorized non-defense programs. 
   We have met the statutory deadline to complete a budget resolution only three times since 1974. In 1995, we broke the Senate record for the most roll call votes cast in a day on a budget reconciliation bill. The Senate conducted 39 consecutive roll call votes that day, beginning at 9:29 in the morning and finishing up at 11:59 that night. 
   While we have made a number of improvements in the budget process, the current annual process is redundant and inefficient. The Senate has the same debate, amendments and votes on the same issue three or four times a year--once on the budget resolution, again on the authorization bill, and finally on the appropriations bill. 
   I recently asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to update and expand upon an analysis of the amount of time we spend on the budget. CRS looked at all votes on appropriations, revenue, reconciliation, and debt limit measures as well as budget resolutions. CRS then examined any other vote dealing with budgetary levels, Budget Act waivers, or votes pertaining to the budget process. Beginning with 1980, budget related votes started dominating the work of the Senate. In 1996, 73 percent of the votes the Senate took were related to the budget. 
   If we cannot adequately focus on our duties because we are constantly debating the budget in the authorization, budget, and appropriations process, just imagine how confused the American public is about what we are doing. The result is that the public does not understand what we are doing and it breeds cynicism about our government. 
   Under the legislation I am introducing today, the President would submit a two-year budget and Congress would consider a two-year budget resolution and 13 two-year appropriation bills during the first session of a Congress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to consideration of authorization bills and for oversight of government agencies. 
   Most of the arguments against a biennial budget process will come from those who claim we cannot predict or plan on a two year basis. For most of the budget, we do not actually budget on an annual basis. Our entitlement and revenue laws are under permanent law and Congress does not change these law on an annual basis. The only component of the budget that is set in law annually are the appropriated, or discretionary, accounts.  
   Mr. President, the most predictable category of the budget are these appropriated, or discretionary, accounts of the federal government. I recently asked CBO to update an analysis of discretionary spending to determine those programs that had unpredictable or volatile funding needs. CBO found that only 4 percent of total discretionary funding fell into this category. Most of this spending is associated with international activities or emergencies. Because most of this funding cannot be predicted on an annual basis, a biennial budget is no less deficient than the current annual process. My bill does not preclude supplemental appropriations necessary to meet these emergency or unanticipated requirements. 
   Mr. President, in 1993 I had the honor to serve as co-Chairman on a Joint Committee that studied the operations of the Congress. Senator BYRD testified before that Committee that the increasing demands put on us as Senators has led to our ``fractured attention.'' We simply are too busy to adequately focus on the people's business. This legislation is designed to free up time and focus our attention, particularly with respect to the oversight of federal programs and activities. 
   Frankly, the limited oversight we are now doing is not as good as it should be. We have a total of 34 House and Senate standing authorizing committees and these committees are increasingly crowded out of the legislative process. Under a biennial budget, the second year of the biennium will be exclusively devoted to examining federal programs and developing authorization legislation. The calendar will be free of the budget and appropriations process, giving these committees the time and opportunity to provide oversight, review and legislate changes to federal programs. Oversight and the authorization should be an ongoing process, but a biennial appropriations process will provide greater opportunity for legislators to concentrate on programs and policies in the second year. 
   We also build on the oversight process by incorporating the new requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 into the biennial budget process. The primary objective of this law is to force the federal government to produce budgets focused on outcomes, not just dollars spent. 
   Mr. President, a biennial budget cannot make the difficult decisions that must be made in budgeting, but it can provide the tools necessary to make much better decisions. But, under the current annual budget process we are constantly spending the taxpayers' money instead of focusing on how best and most efficiently we should spend the taxpayers' money. By moving to a biennial budget cycle, we can plan, budget, and appropriate more effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, and improve the efficiency of government agencies. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a description of the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act be made a part of the RECORD along with a copy of the bill.

   Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Budget Enforcement Act of 1999. The time has come to conform our budget laws and procedures to a new fiscal environment. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act was enacted 25 years ago. Amendments to the Act, including the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation in 1985, established new enforcement procedures that were further expanded and modified in the 1990 budget agreement. Those laws and procedures have served us well. In combination with a strong economy and robust revenue growth, not only have we balanced the Federal budget, we will shortly produce a surplus even excluding the current balances generated by Social Security program. 
   Laws and procedures developed over the last 25 years for a fiscal environment of deficits, cannot be appropriate for a fiscal environment of surpluses. 
   As an example, while the President a year ago in his State of the Union Address pledged to reserve ``every penny'' of the Social Security surpluses for the reform of that program, he and the Congress did not live up to that pledge last year. In one piece of legislation last fall, we spent $21.4 billion of these surpluses for so-called ``emergencies''. Moreover, in order to get appropriations bills signed into law, we relied on innovative financing mechanisms, a charitable characterization, to meet the spending limits. The fact that we will have difficulty meeting these limits in the coming year is not the fault of the limits that we agreed to on a bipartisan basis in 1997, it will be largely due to the reluctance to face the hard choices in appropriations last year. 
   This is not to say we have not accomplished a great deal in recent years. Since 1994, we curbed the rate of growth in spending through the enactment of legislation such as Freedom to Farm, welfare reform, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. While I am very proud that we have stemmed the growth rate in federal spending, we did not balance the budget by actually cutting spending. We did stop the explosive and unsustainable rate of growth in spending that begun in the 1960's with the help of the budget laws and amendments of the past 25 years. But even so, it should be clear that the current balanced budget is largely due to an unexpected growth in federal revenues due to our robust economy. 
   Beginning in 1990, we enjoyed the peace dividend with the end of the Cold War. The taxpayer did not see a dollar of that dividend. In 1998, we saw the balanced budget dividend, and we should produce a balanced budget dividend excluding the transactions of the Social Security trust fund in the very near future. It is time for the American taxpayer to collect a dividend. 
   In my view, the current budget process allows us to spend the taxpayer's money more easily than it is to let the American taxpayer keep what he has earned. We will collect more in taxes this year as a percentage of the economy than we have in any year since World War II. 
   We need to find a way to change our budget process in such a manner to stop the erosion on the spending side, while finding a way to return at least something to the American taxpayer. 
   Some will argue that we should abandon all of our budget laws and find a way to cut taxes at any cost. Others will demagogue Social Security and hope it can stop any tax relief and fight any changes to tighten controls on spending. We need to find a way to steer the middle course. We should reduce taxes, but in a way that ensures we set aside the entire Social Security surplus for legislation that restores the long-term solvency of this program. 
   With these objectives in mind, I am introducing today the Budget Enforcement Act of 1999. This bill would:
