   Mr. BIDEN. Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I want to personally thank him. I want to thank the minority leader, the Democratic leader, and I guess most of all I want to thank Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS as well. 
   I have been here for 28 years. I have never once come to the floor to threaten to engage in an extended debate on a matter. I did that this morning in our caucus. I am not suggesting my colleagues responded because I did that. I am suggesting that I believed my colleagues who are on their feet felt extremely strongly about what was about to happen; that is, Amtrak cannot make it through the year 2001 and meet the obligation that has been imposed upon it without being brought up to speed, figuratively and literally, in terms of equipment, track, and the like. 
   When this proposal that had 56 cosponsors and passed in another vehicle with 60-some votes and with 260-some votes in the House was not going to be included in this omnibus bill, I must tell my colleagues, I was very upset. 
   In light of the fact that the leadership of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate as a whole and of the Commerce Committee, at least on one side of the Commerce Committee, have indicated to me they will introduce and move rapidly, as best they can, funding for Amtrak--I will not take the time to go into what it all does and what it means--then that is good enough for me. I will withdraw any attempt to delay consideration of this final bill. 
   Also, I know Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator LAUTENBERG are leaving. Senator LAUTENBERG has been Mr. Amtrak. Senator LAUTENBERG, since he has been here, in large part because of his disposition and in no small part because of the particular position of authority he occupied on the Appropriations Committee, has been--I ride a train every day and people say to me: You know, JOE, thanks for defending Amtrak. 
   I say: No, don't thank me, call Senator LAUTENBERG. I literally say that because it is true. 
   Also on the floor is a Senator who is Mr. Transportation. He has given us all a lesson, as only he can, for the past 18 years on the necessity of Amtrak not merely in the Northeast corridor, but there is no alternative in this Nation to not have a mass transit interstate system. 
   I want everybody to understand--again, I will put something in the RECORD; I won't take the time now--this is not just parochially important to the Senators from Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, all of whom are on the floor. This is important to Florida; it is important to the Southeast corridor; it is important to Oregon, Washington, Nevada. This is the only alternative we have. 
   It seems to me, after discussion with the men I have named today--the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Mississippi, the Senator from North Dakota, and others--that we are all singing from the same hymnal now. There seems to be for the first time in my recollection, I say to my friend from New York who is standing, a genuine acknowledgment that there is no transportation scheme in America that will serve America without a major component of it being a rapid transit interstate system for passengers. 
   I am looking forward to this being the first bipartisan effort next year. I sincerely hope the incoming President will understand our regional needs. 
   I conclude by saying I thought federalism was about one section of the  Nation helping other sections of the Nation that, in fact, had needs but needed additional assistance. There would be no water flowing in Arizona were it not for the people of Massachusetts, the people of New York, the people of New Jersey, Delaware, and other States subsidizing that water extensively to the tune of probably somewhere above $16 billion over time, and we should do that.

   Mr. BIDEN. We should do that. I get the feeling--maybe because it is the Christmas season and I want to believe it--there is a growing recognition that rail service in our neck of the woods, as well as other parts of the country, are as essential to our interests as water is to the far west. It is as essential. 
   I thank my colleagues for their commitment and absolutely close by saying to Senator BYRD that I appreciate the fact that he understands, maybe better than anyone in this place, when another colleague cares about an issue that he believes is absolutely indispensable for his region. I thank him for acknowledging that. 
   I thank him for his--it is no new commitment; he has always been committed to Amtrak--acknowledgment of that and for his continued pledge of commitment to Amtrak. With this combination of the majority leader, the Democratic leader, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, if we cannot get it done, then shame on us. 
   I thank all of my colleagues. Sorry to have taken so much time, but as my colleagues said all day, this is a big, big, big, big deal to me personally, to my State, and I think to the Nation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations legislation that is contained in this bill. Unfortunately, I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that this bill recognizes the need to dedicate more resources to foreign policy needs; the bad news is that the bill fails to contain funding for three important programs in the Justice portion of this legislation. 
   The State Department does important work--protecting our citizens and pursuing our foreign policy objectives--in some of the most dangerous and difficult places in the world. Unlike the U.S. military, State Department employees go into areas of conflict unarmed, and generally unprotected. We have State Department officials in Sierra Leone, in Syria, in Lebanon and Liberia, and throughout the war-torn corners of the former Yugoslavia.  
   That is why I am particularly pleased to see that funding for embassy security in the Commerce-Justice-State bill is at the levels requested by the Administration. I strongly support full funding of two critical accounts--embassy security and maintenance, and embassy security equipment and personnel--in the legislation to authorize State Department activities which was initiated by the Committee on Foreign Relations last year. 
   Failure to fully fund the State Department's security account would have had a devastating effect on the safety of the Americans who serve us overseas, both in the number of security agents who protect them against terrorist threats and construction of new, safe embassies. Fortunately both these security programs will be well-funded. I regret, however, that agreement was not reached to fund a new Center for Anti-terrorism and Security Training. I hope we can give this careful consideration next year. 
   In addition, after many years of decline, funding for the State Department's most basic needs--including salaries and administrative expenses--has been increased. The final funding for this account exceeds the Administration's original request by $65 million, which should help offset the many reductions in the State Department budget during the 1990s. 
   As the Secretary of State has said numerous times, diplomats are our first line of defense. Just as we are concerned about military readiness, so we must be attentive to diplomatic readiness overseas. We need to do as much as we can--and in my opinion, this funding goes only part way--to ensure that we retain the best and the brightest in our Foreign Service. 
   I am pleased that the amount of money dedicated to United Nations Peacekeeping operations exceeds the Administration's original request. The final figure is based on more recent calculations of the U.S. dues to the United Nations and will allow us to help fund these important missions, thereby alleviating suffering and improving stability around the world. 
   I understand the frustration that many of my colleagues feel toward the United Nations. Earlier this week, I visited the UN. I want to assure my colleagues that reform is happening. Ambassador Holbrooke has kept his commitment, made to the Committee on Foreign Relations during his confirmation hearings, that reform will be his ``highest sustained priority.'' He and his team in New York continue to push effectively for needed reforms in the areas of peacekeeping and general operations. The recommendations made by the Brahimi panel, in particular, will result in better focused, trained and equipped peacekeeping missions--changes I believe that we all agree are needed. 
   I wish that I could be as positive about the Justice Department portion of the bill, but I cannot. I am disheartened that the legislation does not contain three crucial provisions--reauthorization of the COPS program, the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, and full funding for the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Although we have 49 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle and letters of support from every major law enforcement organization, a few powerful members on the other side have refused to allow a vote on the continuation of the COPS program. 
   In 1994, we set a goal of funding 100,000 police officers by the year 2000. We met that goal months ahead of schedule. As of today, there have been 109,000 officers funded and 68,100 officers deployed to the streets. 
   Because of COPS, the concept of community policing has become law enforcement's principal weapon in fighting crime. Community policing has redefined the relationship between law enforcement and the public. But, more importantly, it has reduced crime. And that is what we attempted to do. 
   All across the country, from Wilmington to Washington--from Connecticut to California, we are seeing a dramatic decline in crime. Just a few weeks ago, the FBI released its annual crime statistics which showed that once again, for the eighth year in a row, crime is down. In fact, crime was down 7 percent from last year and 16 percent since 1995. But we can't become complacent. We have to continue to help state and local law enforcement by putting more cops on the street. Mark my words, the day we become complacent is the day that crime rates go up again. And refusing to even allow a vote on this bill is even worse than complacency--it is irresponsible. 
   And I will say again that I firmly believe that reauthorization of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund is the single most significant thing that we can do to continue the war on crime. 
   Since the Fund was established in the 1994 Crime Act, Congress has appropriated monies from the fund for programs including the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program and numerous programs contained in the Violence Against Women Act. The money has gone to hire more cops and it has brought unprecedented resources to defending our southwest border. It has funded runaway youth prevention programs and numerous 
   innovative crime prevention programs. And there are many more. 
   The results of these efforts have taken hold. Crime is down--way down. And we didn't add 1 cent to the deficit or the debt. 
   This was the single most important paragraph in the 1994 Crime bill because no one can touch this money for any other purpose. It can't be spent on anything else but crime reduction. It is the one place where no one can compete. It is set aside. It is a savings account to fight crime. 
   This fund works. It ensures that the crime reduction programs that we pass will be funded. It ensures that the crime rate will continue to go down instead of up. It ensures that our kids will have a place to go after school instead of hanging out on the street corners. It ensures that violent crimes against women get the individualized attention that they need and deserve. It gives States money to hire more cops and get better technology. 
   This bill also is unsatisfactory because it leaves the landmark Violence Against Women Act underfunded, seriously jeopardizing the tremendous strides we have made in every State across this country to reduce domestic violence and sexual assault against women. Congress originally approved this legislation in 1994 and then reauthorized it unanimously this past October. In the bill before us, however, Congress fails to live up to its commitment to women and children who are the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault by not appropriating the necessary funds authorized in the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. 
   Reauthorization of the COPS program, the Trust Fund, and full funding for the Violence Against Women Act should have been a part of this package, and I'm disappointed that some on the other side have decided to put politics ahead of the people.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today we reach a point that has been far too long in coming: a vote on final passage of bankruptcy reform. Just two days ago, the Senate voted overwhelmingly--67 to 31--to end debate on this legislation. 
   I expect the same strong endorsement in today's vote. 
   For reasons that we are all aware of, it has been a prolonged and complicated process that has brought us to this point today. In one of our very first votes this year, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform legislation by the overwhelming margin of 83 to 14. Similar legislation passed the House last year, 313 to 108. I personally believe that we should not have waited for legislation that passed both Houses by overwhelming margins, many months ago, to finally reach the floor of the Senate in the last hours of this session. 
   For vast, bipartisan majorities of both houses, the idea that we need to restore some balance to our bankruptcy code is not controversial. 
   The legislation before us today does indeed tighten current law. It assures that those who have the ability to pay--but only those with the ability to pay--will have to complete at least a partial repayment plan. This fundamental change will affect probably fewer than 10 percent of the people who file for bankruptcy, and only those who have the demonstrated ability to pay. 
   I would bet, that most of our constituents would be surprised to find that is not the case today. Today's code makes no clear distinction between those who have the income to pay some of their debts and those whose only recourse is to sell off whatever assets they have to pay their creditors. The bill before us corrects that basic flaw. 
   I am convinced that flaw has a lot to do with the fact that bankruptcy filings have been at record levels in recent years, in spite of the strongest economy we have ever enjoyed. And--contrary to some of the assertions we have heard recently, those filings are not going down. After a leveling off, following interest rate reductions a couple of years ago that made credit easier, the latest statistics show a revival in the record wave of bankruptcy filings in recent months. The problem has not gone away--and the growing evidence of a slowing economy means we should expect even more filings in the coming months. 
   The fact is, Mr. President, that we have before us legislation that is the result of weeks of debate and amendment here on the Senate floor last year. Although we could not convene a formal conference, further bipartisan discussions continued this summer, including the direct participation of the White House. I ask my colleagues to consider how closely the legislation before us today matches the letter and the spirit of the bill that had such overwhelming support earlier this year. 
   I also strongly urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto this legislation, that contains many provisions that are the product of direct negotiations with his White House. I know that important voices in his administration continue to support bankruptcy reform, and I hope that he will heed their advice. 
   We still have a strong safe harbor, to protect families below the median income, along with adjustments for additional expenses that will assure that only those with real ability to pay will be steered from Chapter Seven to Chapter 13. Senate language, that gives judges the discretion to 
   determine whether there are special circumstances that justify those expenses, prevailed over stricter House language. 
   Beyond that, the Senate-passed safe harbor provision has actually been strengthened, with additional protection for those between 100 and 150 percent of the national median income, who are largely exempted from the means test. 
   Compared to current law, this legislation provides increased protections against creditors who try to abuse the reaffirmation process. This bill also imposes new requirements on credit card companies to explain to their customers the implications of making minimum payments on their bills every month. 
   And a feature of this legislation that I think deserves much more emphasis is its historic improvement in the treatment of family support payments--child support and alimony. Compared to current law, there are numerous specific new protections for those who depend on those payments. 
   The improvements are so important that they have the endorsement of the National Child Support Enforcement Association, the National District Attorneys Association, and the National Association of Attorneys General. 
   These are the people who are actually in the businesses of making sure that family support payments are made. One passage from a letter sent to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves repeating here, Mr. President. Referring to the very real advantages which this legislation would provide to the women and children who depend on those support payments, they say that, and I quote ``defeat of this legislation based on vague and unarticulated fears'' would be ``throwing out the baby with the bathwater.'' 
   I think this last line from the letter deserves special stress: ``No one who has a genuine interest in the collection of support should permit such inexplicit and speculative fears to supplant the specific and considerable advantages which this reform legislation provides to those in need of support.'' 
   Mr. President, I can think of no stronger rebuttal to the arguments we have heard recently about the supposed effects of this legislation on the women and children who depend on alimony and child support. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to briefly address two issues that have been raised by the President, and by opponents of this legislation. I honestly believe that compared to the many substantial victories for Senate positions, those two issues fall far short of justifying a change in the overwhelming support bankruptcy reform has received in the last two sessions of Congress. 
   First, there is the issue of the homestead cap. One of the most egregious examples of abuse under current law is the ability of wealthy individuals, on the eve of filing for bankruptcy, to shelter income from legitimate creditors by buying an expensive house in one of the handful of states that have an unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy. 
   It is one of the most egregious abuses, Mr. President, but it is actually pretty rare, involving only a very  few of the millions of bankruptcies that have been filed in recent years. Nevertheless, it is an abuse that should be eliminated. Senator KOHL and Senator SESSIONS have been the leaders in the Senate on this. They are the reason why the Senate 
   included a strong provision--a ``hard cap'' of $100,000 on the value of a home that could be exempt from creditors in bankruptcy. 
   That provision is not in the bill before us today, Mr. President, but the worst abuse--the last-minute move to shelter assets from creditors--has been eliminated. To be eligible for any state's homestead exemption, a bankruptcy filer must have lived in that state for the last two years before filing. If you buy a home within two years of filing, your exemption is capped at $100,000. That is a huge improvement over current law. 
   So I say to my colleagues: if you want to eliminate the worse abuse of the homestead exemption, then you will vote for the conference report before us today. 
   That brings us to the last of the major issues--one that we have come to call the Schumer Amendment, because of the energy and dedication of my friend and colleague from New York. 
   We all know of the confrontations--sometimes peaceful, sometimes tragically violent--that have occurred in recent years between pro-life and pro-choice groups over access to family planning clinics. Because of the threat to the Constitutional rights of the people who run those clinics and their patrons, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Free Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1993. That law makes it a crime--punishable by fines as well as imprisonment--to block access to family planning clinics. 
   Some of those who have been arrested and prosecuted under that law have brazenly announced that they plan to file for bankruptcy, to escape the consequences of their crimes--specifically, to avoid paying damages. Some of these individuals have in fact filed for bankruptcy. 
   But in no case--in no case that I am aware of, Mr. President, or that the Congressional Research Service has been able to find--has any individual escaped a single dollar's liability by filing for bankruptcy. Not a dollar, not a dime, not a penny. It hasn't happened, and it won't happen. The reason is simple: current bankruptcy already states that such settlements--for ``willful and malicious'' conduct--are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. 
   If that were not enough, current case law supports a very strong reading of that provision of current law. When one clinic demonstrator--who violated a restraining order--attempted to have the settlement against her wiped out in bankruptcy, her claim was rejected out of hand. The violation of a restraining order setting physical limits around a clinic has been ruled to be ``wilful and malicious'' under the current code. The penalties she was assessed were not dischargeable. 
   Mr. President, the Congressional Research Service, as of October 26, conducted an exhaustive, authoritative search which, and I quote: ``did not reveal any reported decisions where such liability was discharged under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.'' 
   So the current bankruptcy statute--and the most recent case law on this point--all say that the Schumer Amendment is not needed. That is to take nothing away from the hard work and dedication of my friend and colleague on the Judiciary Committee, or to minimize the frustration and outrage many Americans feel at the announced attempts to abuse the bankruptcy code. It is simply to say that the women who use and who operate family planning clinics are not without recourse, and not without the full protection of the law, under the current bankruptcy code. 
   I repeat, Mr. President: no one has escaped liability under the Fair Access to Clinics Entrances Act through an abuse of the bankruptcy code. No one. 
   So, Mr. President, we will vote today on a conference report that has a strong Senate stamp on it, that contains important victories for Senate positions, victories that make the bill in some ways fairer and more balanced than the version that passed here in January by an overwhelming vote. 
   While the homestead provision is not what I hoped it would be, I will vote for closing the worst aspects of the homestead loophole in the current code. I will not let the best be the enemy of the good. 
   And I will vote for this conference report confident that family planning clinics, and the women who need and use them, will continue to enjoy the full protection available under current law. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David B. Hermelin, former U.S. Ambassador to Norway, who passed away on November 22.  
   After a distinguished business and philanthropic career in his native Michigan, Mr. Hermelin was nominated as envoy to Norway by President Clinton in 1997 and confirmed by the Senate that same year. 
   Members of this Chamber know that, as might be expected with any large group, over the years the performance of our ambassadors, both career diplomats and political appointees, have varied widely. By any standard, David Hermelin's tenure was spectacularly successful. 
   In the short space of two years, Ambassador Hermelin managed a remarkable feat: strengthening the already close ties between our ally Norway and the United States. His diplomatic and personal charm led to unprecedented reciprocal visits within three weeks of each other last year--the Norwegian Prime Minister's to Washington, and President Clinton's to Oslo, the first ever visit of an incumbent President to Norway, in this case in pursuit of a Middle Eastern peace settlement. 
   But Ambassador Hermelin's accomplishments were not limited to such highly publicized events. Through behind-the-scenes daily efforts, he was directly instrumental in the success of Lockheed Martin's bid, as part of a consortium, to sell the Norwegian Navy five new frigates equipped with the Aegis missile system, a sale worth more than one billion dollars. 
   Ambassador Hermelin was recognized for his many contributions by being awarded the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit, the highest honor the country bestows upon non-Norwegians. 
   Even after Ambassador Hermelin was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he vigorously played a major role to help others through an international initiative to provide prostheses to victims of civil conflict, such as in Sierra Leone. 
   On his visit to Oslo in November 1999, President Clinton, in speaking of Ambassador Hermelin, reflected on this kind of behavior: ``I don't know anyone who has such a remarkable combination of energy and commitment to the common good.'' 
   After diagnosis of his terminal illness, he and a group of friends donated ten million dollars to establish a brain tumor center at Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan. 
   Ambassador Hermelin felt deeply connected to Israel and to Jewish causes, raising millions of dollars for local Detroit and overseas needs. 
   After the Ambassador's death, the U.S. State Department's Norway desk officer offered this heartfelt testimony: ``David Hermelin was the kind of man who made a friend out of everybody he met, and the people who worked for him at the embassy regarded him with an affection that is unmatched by the feelings I've seen for any other ambassador at any time to any country.'' 
   Ambassador Hermelin is survived by his wife, five children, and eight grandchildren. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him, particularly by his colleagues in the U.S. Government.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not use all of the time. 
   We will hear from our friend from Massachusetts and others on this floor about how this has harmed women and children in support payments. That is simply, flat out not true. We have improved the position of women. We have improved the position of children. We have improved the position of people who do not have much money. 
   We have included a safe harbor provision, saying that unless you meet a certain minimum income level, you don't even get considered in this process. 
   This is a good bill subject to a lot of exaggeration. 
   My good friend from New York had a very good provision which I supported relating to abortion clinics and bombs.  There can't be any intimidation of any kind. 
   You cannot declare bankruptcy in this country under present bankruptcy law if you engage in activities which under the FACE Act are prohibited. 
   There is no court in the Nation that has said that. People are trying to get out of bankruptcy. They are trying to be discharged. But the courts have not discharged them and will not discharge them. 
   I would like to see the Schumer amendment become law. But, in fact, it is not necessary to protect the very people we want to protect and to hold responsible those who engage in that kind of activity under the FACE Act. 
   I hope reason will overcome passion. I hope the truth will overcome exaggeration. But I have been in this institution 28 years and who knows? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor our respected colleague, my friend, and a true gentleman of the United States Senate--BILL ROTH. 
   I have had the honor to serve side-by-side with the senior senator from Delaware for nearly 28 years. Never once have any of you nor anyone in our home State of Delaware--ever heard me say an ill, unkind or negative word about him. And I might add --nor he of me. In my case, there is a good reason for this. He has never given me cause to say anything negative. 
   I, personally, and my state collectively--genuinely respect and like BILL ROTH. He is a true gentleman--with all the politeness, honesty and integrity that word connotes. 
   Personally, I will greatly miss his companionship and friendship. We have racked up more miles on Amtrak between Wilmington and Washington than probably anyone in history! On our train rides, we would often talk about how we could best work together on a project for Delaware. And we would discuss pressing legislative business. But we'd also talk about family and children and grandchildren.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we just had a vote on a cloture motion on the bankruptcy bill, which did not prevail; that is, cloture was not invoked. I just want to make a short statement now because we will be back at this again. 
   This has been a prolonged and complicated process that brought us to this point today. I personally believe it need not have been so long nor have been so complicated. We should not have had to wait for this legislation as long as we have. We should have just stepped up to this earlier. But here we are. 
   I heard a number of things stated in the well of the Senate as we were voting on cloture relative to this legislation about which I think people were misinformed. A lot of statements were being made that did not reflect what is actually in this bankruptcy bill. 
   I know many of my colleagues are not happy with the bill. But on balance the bankruptcy reform bill still deserves the strong support of the Senate. We will return to this issue later this month, and I would like to put to rest some of the assertions made. 
   We have what we call a very strong safe harbor provision in this bill, to protect families that are below the median income, along with allowing them adjustments for additional expenses, that will assure that only those with the real ability to pay in bankruptcy are steered from chapter 7 to chapter 13. 
   The Senate language, giving judges the discretion to determine whether or not there are special circumstances that justify those expenses, prevailed over the very strict House language. The bottom line is, if you are someone who is listed by the national statistics as being poor--many folks keep saying poor folks will be hurt by this--you are not even in the deal here. You are not even in the deal. You are protected. That is what we mean by the safe harbor. 
   This provision has been strengthened with an additional protection for those between 100 and 150 percent of the national median income. So if you have  an income that is 150 percent above the median income, you will get only a very cursory means test. 
   I heard on the floor today people saying how poor folks and lower middle income folks were really going to be hurt by this. That is simply not true. 
   Compared to current law, this provision provides increased protection against creditors who try to abuse the so-called reaffirmation process. 
   This bill imposes new requirements on credit card companies to explain to their customers the implications of making minimum payments on their bills every month. 
   A feature of this legislation that I think deserves much more emphasis is historic improvement in the treatment for family support payments, child support, and alimony. I heard my colleagues on my side of the aisle down there saying this hurts women and children. 
   Compared to current law, there are numerous new, specific protections for those who depend on support payments and alimony payments. The improvements are so important that they have the endorsement--I want everybody to hear this--they have the endorsement of the National Child Support Enforcement Association. This is the outfit that comes to us and says: Look, you have to provide additional help in seeing to it that child support payments are paid by deadbeat dads. The National Child Support Enforcement Association, the National Association of District Attorneys, the National Association of Attorneys General, they all support this 
   bill because of these protections. These are the people who actually are in the business of making sure family support payments are made. 
   One passage from the letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves repeating. Referring to critics of the legislation, those men and women who are on the front lines of the struggle to enforce family support agreements say:  
   For the critics appear content to sacrifice the palpable advantages which this legislation would provide to support creditors--  
   That is, the women and children who depend on support payments.  
   to defeat of this legislation, based on the vague and unarticulated fears that women will be unfairly disadvantaged as bankruptcy creditors--in more ways than one, the critics would favor throwing out the baby with the bath water.  
   This is a letter from the people who go out on behalf of women, collecting child support payments for their children. 
   They say this bankruptcy bill is a good bill. 
   I think the last line from the letter deserves special stress. I quote:  
   No one who has a genuine interest in the collection of support should permit such inexplicit and speculative fears to supplant the specific and considerable advantages which this reform legislation provides to those who need support.  
   I can think of no stronger rebuttal to the arguments we have seen and heard recently about the supposed effects of this legislation on women and children who depend on alimony and child support.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to briefly address two issues that have been raised by the President and by the opponents of this legislation. I honestly believe, compared to the many substantial victories for the Senate position in this legislation, these two issues fall short of justifying a change in the overwhelming support bankruptcy reform has received in the last two sessions of Congress. 
   First, there is the issue of this homestead cap. I heard people on the floor voting, saying: There is no protection in here, no protection at all. You just let people get away. You allow the Burt Reynolds of the world to go out there and buy multimillion-dollar homes and then declare bankruptcy. This is unfair. 
   First of all, do you think any of the creditors want that to happen? The companies are concerned about this, along with interest groups that are concerned about this. And on the consumer side, do you think they want people being able to escape having to pay what they owe because they are able to bury assets in a multimillion-dollar home? 
   So where is this coming from? First, the homestead cap. One of the most egregious examples of abuse under the current law is the ability of wealthy individuals, on the eve of filing for  bankruptcy, having the ability to shelter their income from legitimate creditors by buying an expensive home in one of a handful of States that have an unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy. This is one of the most egregious abuses, but it is actually pretty rare, involving only a few of the millions of bankruptcies that have been filed in recent years. Nevertheless, it is an abuse that should be eliminated. 
   There are reasons that the Senate included a strong provision. That was a hard cap of $100,000 in the value of a home; that is, if your home was worth more than $100,000, your creditors could go after the remainder of that money, but if it was $100,000 or less, your creditors could not get it because we have a principle in this country of not taking away your home based on bankruptcy. 
   This provision, though, was struck by the House. They did not like the hard cap of $100,000. So what we did was we reached a compromise to avoid the worst abuses as a last-minute move to shelter assets from creditors. That last-minute move to avoid legitimate debts has been eliminated. 
   To be eligible under any State's homestead exemption, a bankruptcy filer must have lived in that State for the last 2 years before filing. If you buy a home within 2 years of filing, your exemption is capped at $100,000. Put another way, you have to have a pretty good estate plan in order to escape bankruptcy by buying a multimillion-dollar home. 
   You have to know, under the law, if we had passed it today--and 2 years from now you go bankrupt--so you go out 2 years ahead of time and move into a State that allows you to buy a multimillion-dollar home to escape bankruptcy. So you move into that State 2 years ahead of time, and 2 years ahead of time you buy the home. You take all your assets that you are worried it is going to cost you, and you put them into a home. 
   Let me tell the Senate, that is a pretty good plan. I don't know how many people know over 2 years ahead of time that they are going to go bankrupt and take all their money out and put it into a home. Granted, I would prefer a hard cap, but the truth is, if you don't buy the home 2 years prior to declaring bankruptcy, the cap is $100,000. So there are a lot of canards that have been used to defeat this cloture motion. I might say to my colleagues, if they want to eliminate the worst abuse of the homestead exemption, then they should have voted for the conference report. 
   That brings me to the last major issue, the one that has, unfortunately, generated a lot more heat than light. That is what we have come to call--and I saw my colleague a moment ago--the SCHUMER amendment, because of the energy and dedication of my friend and worthy opponent, in this case--hardly ever in any other case--Senator SCHUMER. We all know of the confrontations, sometimes peaceful, sometimes tragically violent, that have occurred in recent years between pro-life and pro-choice groups over access to family planning clinics. Because of the threat to the constitutional right of the people who run those clinics and their patrons, Congress, with my support and President Clinton's signature, passed a bill, the strongest proponent of which was the Senator from New York, the Free Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1993. The law makes it a crime punishable by fines as well as imprisonment to block access to family planning clinics. 
   Some of those who have been arrested and prosecuted under the law have brazenly announced that they plan to declare bankruptcy to escape the consequences of their crimes, specifically to avoid paying damages. Some of those individuals have, in fact, filed bankruptcy. But in no case--in no case that I am aware of or anyone else can show me or no case that the Congressional Research Service was able to find--has any individual escaped paying a single dollar of liability by filing bankruptcy. Not a dollar, not a dime, not a penny, it hasn't happened. I don't believe it will happen. 
   The reason is simple: Current bankruptcy law already states that such settlements for ``willful and malicious conduct'' are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. If that were not enough, current case law supports a very strong reading of the provisions of the current law. When one clinic demonstrator who violated a restraining order attempted to have a settlement against her be wiped out in bankruptcy, her claim was rejected out of hand by the court. The violation of the restraining order setting physical limits around the clinic has been ruled to be willful and malicious under the current code. The penalties assessed against the violator were not dischargeable in bankruptcy. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from the Congressional Research Service confirming, as of October 26, that an exhaustive authoritative search did not reveal any reported decisions where such liability was discharged under U.S. bankruptcy code.

   Mr. BIDEN. Again, Mr. President, the only case I could find, in fact, held, as I had predicted, that willful and malicious conduct denies you from being discharged in bankruptcy, in a case where a woman was arrested for violating a restraining order or getting too close to the clinic, tried to discharge the fines against her in bankruptcy, and could not. 
   I repeat: No one has escaped liability under the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances Act through the abuse of the bankruptcy code, not one. As strongly as feelings are on both sides of this issue, the Schumer amendment is, I must say, a solution in search of a problem. I would support it just to make sure we have the extra protection, but in the absence of the Schumer amendment, there is no reason for the Senate to reverse its opinion on the legislation that had received such strong support. 
   We voted today on trying to get to a conference report that had a strong Senate stamp on it. I think we made a mistake. I think part of the reason why we made a mistake in not invoking cloture was we had a number of absences. There are 16 or 17 or 18 absences, as I count it; 15 or thereabouts were for cloture. But we will come back to it again, as the majority leader has said. 
   This does not in any way do anything to allow people to violate the free access to clinics law. And it actually helps women and children who depend on support payments and alimony payments. I will speak to it more later. 
   I see the majority leader is on the floor for important business. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I have great respect for my friend from Oregon. I know he knows I think he is dead wrong on this issue. For two reasons I think he is dead wrong: On the facts and I think he is dead wrong on the approach he has taken. 
   The fact of the matter is, the administration at the time this aide memoire--a fancy phrase for saying this agreement--was signed by GORE and Chernomyrdin, a follow-on to a verbal agreement made by Clinton and by Yeltsin in 1994--that agreement was made known to the public; it was publicly stated, and that was actually offered. The House of Representatives was briefed at the time. 
   Here we are less than 10 days before an election and it has become a cause  celebre. I don't have the time, and I am sure my friend from Oregon doesn't have the inclination, to listen to why this is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. And this is not a binding obligation. There are distinctions between binding obligations and agreements. One requires disclosure; the other does not. The fact is, this was a good deal and it was disclosed and made available to be disclosed. 
   Let me cut to the chase. The fact of the matter is we did have a closed meeting with members of the State Department. I was present, my friend from Oregon was present, our colleague from Kansas was present, Senator BROWNBACK, and maybe someone else; I can't recall. I indicated at the time that although the White House and the State Department were not required to share these documents, in my view they were making a tactical political mistake not doing it. 
   I am here to tell my friend from Oregon what I told Senator LUGAR and what I told Senator HAGEL, and I understand it is being communicated to the majority leader. The State Department is going to make available to the leadership of the House and the Senate--which is the way we do these things--the so-called annexes. If there is any violation of law--which there is not, but if there is any--the only violation could flow from there being a weapons system that was transferred on the annex, that falls within the purview of the law, that covered certain weapons systems and destabilizing systems under the McCain-Gore legislation. So if there is nothing in that annex that was transferred, there can be no question there was no law broken here. 
   This will be the test to know whether this is politics or not. This will be the test. If the administration makes that available to the majority leader, minority leader, Speaker of the House, and the minority leader of the House, the leadership of the House, then, in fact, we will find out. They will bring the document up, and they can see it. 
   If they really want to know the answer, if they really believe a law was broken, then it is really clear; they can sit down and look at it and find out. But if the offer is made and it is refused--I will say and challenge anyone to give me a good reason why I am wrong--that is pure politics. 
   I really mean this; I have an inordinately high regard for my friend from Oregon. That probably hurts him back home, but I like him a lot. The fact of the matter is, we have worked closely together on a whole number of items. I have never misled him and he has never misled me. I got off the phone with Strobe Talbott. The Secretary of State is intending to call the majority leader, going to make the offer tomorrow to come up and show the documents. 
   It is interesting that the letter requesting documents says they basically want these annexes. I know we need more time to explain this to someone listening because this is kind of confusing. My friend from Oregon knows what I am talking about because he knows the area well. The annex lists all those weapons systems that would be sanctionable if transferred by the Russians to the Iranians, if that were to occur. 
   We will find out whether anything was transferred. By the way, unlike in any other administration, it has been pointed out that 10 times as many weapons were transferred to the Iranians when Bush was President than since Clinton has been President. But we will find out whether anything was violated. 
   I want to make it clear, the offer will be made. If the offer is rejected, I want everyone to know--and the press who may be listening--that a big neon light should go on, ``Politics, politics, politics.'' If the offer is accepted, then, in fact--and my colleagues look at it, the majority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, if they look at it and they say this looks like a duck, to use my friend's phrase, that is a different story. That is debatable; that is something that warrants concern. 
   To reiterate: 
   The Senators' letter says that ``the Vice President pledges to `avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law.' '' 
   The letter omits the words immediately preceding that quote from the leaked understanding: ``take appropriate steps'' to avoid penalties. That meant that the United States would not circumvent U.S. law. Rather, if necessary, we would sanction Russia, but waive the penalties, pursuant to the law. 
   But in fact, there was no need to waive penalties at all, because Russia was not proposing any conventional arms transfers that would trigger sanctions under U.S. law--and the Vice President was assured of this by the Department of Defense before he signed the understanding. 
   One relevant law was the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992, the so-called ``McCain-Gore Act.'' That law requires sanctions against governments that transfer ``destabilizing numbers and types'' of ``advanced conventional weapons'' to Iran or Iraq. Thus, you must find both the sale of advanced conventional weapons to Iran, and that these are a number and type so as to tip the balance of power in the region. 
   We have been assured--by experienced, career officials--that the Annex listing planned Russian arms transfers to Iran contains nothing that would meet all those tests. 
   But we don't have to trust the Government on this. Anthony Cordesman, who was JOHN MCCAIN's national security assistant in 1992, working on the McCain-Gore bill, wrote recently: ``Iran ..... has not ..... received destabilizing transfers of advanced conventional weapons.'' 
   The third Kilo-class submarine to be sent to Iran was specifically considered by the Pentagon, which decided that it would not be destabilizing. 
   In any case, submarines are not listed in the 1992 law's definition of advanced conventional weapons; and even President Bush made no move to add them to the list, even though the law permits such additions. 
   The Senators' letter quotes Secretary Albright's letter to Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov, in which she says we ``upheld our commitment not to impose sanctions'' and that ``without the Aide Memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.'' As you said yesterday: 
   One reasonable interpretation is that Secretary Albright is saying, ``if you hadn't obeyed the Aide Memoire, you would have gotten in trouble.'' And that's true. If Russia had signed new deals to sell ``lethal military equipment'' to Iran, or if it had sold lots of ``advanced conventional weapons'' to Iran, it would have forced us to invoke sanctions under our law. But they basically did obey the Aide Memoire, and stayed out of trouble in this regard. 
   Another reasonable interpretation is that the Secretary was overstating her case, using U.S. law as a club with which to beat the Russians. If so, more power to her. 
   A third reasonable interpretation is that Secretary Albright was thinking of those sanctions, based on other U.S. laws, that do not require any trigger other than a Presidential determination that the national security warrants them. 
   The Albright letter does not show any violation or circumvention of the 1992 Iran-Iraq law, and there is no evidence of any such action. 
   The Senators' letter rejects Vice President GORE's point that Russia's arms transfers were pursuant to previously-signed contracts, because the McCain-Gore law does not exempt such transfers. 
   That misses the point. There are other laws that would require sanctions for any transfer of ``lethal military equipment'' to Iran. Those laws exempt transfers under pre-1996 contracts. 
   The administration never claimed that it was cutting off all Russian arms transfers to Iran. But it did put a cap on those transfers, limiting them essentially to ones contracted for during the Bush administration. 
   The Senators' letter says that the Congress must review all the relevant documents, renews a demand for all the previously requested documents, and threatens a subpoena if these are not produced by noon Monday. 
   The fact is, however, that only the Annex to the Aide Memoire is cited as a really necessary document. 
   I think the executive branch ought to find a way to let appropriate senators review the Annex and the Secretary's  letter to the Russian Foreign Minister, while maintaining the confidentiality of those documents. 
   Once that is done, I believe that there will be no good reason to seek further documents. 
   Tony Cordesman, the expert in Middle Eastern military affairs who was Senator MCCAIN's national security assistant, summed up this case admirably a couple of weeks ago:  
   Political campaigns are a poor time to debate complex military issues, particularly when the debate is based on press reports that are skewed to stress the importance of the story at the expense of objective perspective and the facts.

   Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I don't know a lot about matters over which I don't have jurisdiction as a Senator. So I don't expect all Senators to know as much about sanctions as the Senator from Oregon and I because we spend probably 20 percent of our time working on that in the Foreign Relations Committee. My friend from Massachusetts forgot more about HCFA than I will ever know. It took me a while to know what HCFA was. They set the rates for everything, and it affects the American people a heck of a lot more than sanctions policy. 
   There are discretionary sanctions available to the President of the United States. I emphasize ``discretionary.'' The comment made by the Secretary of State refers to those discretionary policies.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as everyone in this room knows all too well, I have devoted much of my career to fighting crime. And if there is one thing that I have learned over the course of the past 30 years in public service, it's this: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I have  watched as the Boys and Girls Clubs and other non-profits have worked to make certain that kids have a safe place to go after school. I have been supportive of countless crime prevention initiatives to protect our children, our parents and those unable to protect themselves. And guess what, these programs have worked to prevent crime. But even those programs whose single purpose is to do good, have seen some bad times. And that is why today, I am introducing the National Child Protection Act. 
   Today, more than 87 million kids are involved each year in activities provided by child and youth organizations which depend heavily on volunteers to deliver their services. Millions more adults are also served by public and private voluntary organizations. Places like the Boys and Girls Clubs rely on volunteers to make these safe havens for kids a place where they can learn. But, while these non-profit organizations are doing God's work, there are some volunteers who have a different agenda--and there are abuses that occur. 
   The National Mentoring Partnership reports that incidents of child sexual abuse in child care settings, foster homes and schools ranges from 1 to 7 percent. This is basic stuff--these organizations can not function effectively without a safe infrastructure in place. 
   Currently most child-service organizations do background checks on volunteers, but they may have to wait weeks or months for the result of a state or national criminal background check. Conducting these checks is also costly and therefore many organizations conduct only a limited check of their volunteers. And some organizations don't have access to national fingerprint databases which means that while a volunteer may pass a name-check in one state, he may have been convicted of atrocities in another. Our children, our parents and the disadvantaged are at risk and they need help. 
   That is why my bill authorizes $180 million over five years for the FBI to establish a national center to conduct national criminal history fingerprint checks. Their checks will be provided to volunteer organizations at no cost and to all other organizations that serve children at minimal cost. This national center would screen 10 million volunteers each year and will make these volunteer-oriented organizations a safer place for all. My bill also authorizes $5 million to provide states with funds to hire personnel and improve fingerprint technology so that they can update information in national databases. 
   This should be an easy one for all of us. Most of us already understand the positive impact that these non-profits are having. Now, we have a duty to make these places safe for those most at-risk. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would authorize the establishment of nonprofit entities to provide grants and other assistance for international educational, cultural and arts programs through the Department of State. This is an initiative I have discussed with officials of the Department of State and introduce today to initiate discussion on how to best stimulate a vibrant exchange of international educational, cultural and arts programs. 
   We are in a era in which cultural issues are increasingly central to international issues and diplomacy. Trade disputes, ethnic and regional conflicts and issues such as biotechnology all have cultural and intellectual underpinnings. 
   Cultural programs are increasingly necessary to promoting international understanding and achieving U.S. national objectives. American multinational companies and other Americans doing business overseas welcome opportunities to show their support for the unique cultures of nations in which they do business, as well as their interest in telling the story of America's diversity in other countries. 
   One way they could do this is by helping to sponsor cultural exchange programs arranged through the Department of State. The problem is that there is apparently no clear easy way to do that--no point of contact for corporations or others interested in supporting cultural diplomacy--no clear avenues to assist cultural programs supported by our government. There also are concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Moreover, many people in our own government are uncertain whether they should engage in presenting the creative, intellectual and cultural side of our nation. 
   Under this legislation Congress would authorize the establishment of private nonprofit organizations for the support of international cultural programs, making it both easy and attractive for private organizations to support cultural programs in cooperation with the Department of State. In so doing, we would affirm support for the promotion and presentation of the nation's intellectual and creative best as part of American diplomacy. 
   This initiative would support a broad range of cultural exchange programs--projects that send Americans abroad and that bring people from other countries to the United States. Its priority would be to support the organization and promotion of major, high-profile presentations of art exhibitions, musical and theatrical performances which represent the finest quality of creativity our nation produces. These should be presentations that reach large numbers of people, which contribute to achieving our national interests and which represent the diversity of American culture. 
   There would be authority to solicit support for specific cultural endeavors, offering individuals, foundations, multinationals corporations and other American businesses engaged overseas the opportunity to publicly support cross-cultural understanding in countries where they do business. 
   The nonprofit entity would work with the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs as well as the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the Department of State. 
   Mr. President, that is the overall purpose of this legislation. I am sure we will be able to improve on how to encourage a vibrant exchange of cultural programs, and I welcome suggestions on how best to do that. It is for that purpose that I introduce this legislation at the end of this Congress, with the intention of reintroducing it next year with the benefit of those suggestions.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in June of this year I expressed my displeasure with the foreign operations appropriations bill when it came to the floor of the Senate. The overall funding level was too low, security assistant accounts were unfunded, burdensome conditions were placed on contributions to international organizations and an inadequate appropriation was made for debt relief. 
   I'm pleased to find that the conference report has corrected some of these problems in a very satisfactory way. Appropriators have done the right thing on debt relief, by fully funding the amounts requested. As the wealthiest nation in the world, there is no excuse for us ignoring the plight of the world's poorest countries which are laboring under an untenable debt burden. 
   I'm also relieved to see that the overall funding level of the bill comes far closer to the administration's request than the bill that the Senate passed in June. That bill, to my dismay, was $1.7 billion short of what was asked for. The conference report is a vast improvement. It is still some $200 million below what the executive branch has projected that it will need to undertake foreign operations. Obviously this is quite a large sum and there is a very serious need for Congress to reverse the trend of undercutting State Department and Agency for International Development programs. However the conference report brings the money requested and the money appropriated substantially closer. 
   The bill contains a provision for assistance to Serbia with which I am in agreement. To unilaterally lift sanctions, or to open up the aid spigot fully would be both premature and naive. The United States should adopt the more measured response reflected in this provision. The language in the conference report sends the right message that we must condition our aid to the new regime in Serbia until it has clearly demonstrated that it will cooperate with the Hague War Crimes Tribunal, respect the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and not undermine the Dayton Accords, and that it will unequivocally renounce the use of force in Kosovo and take steps to implement policies that reflect a respect for minorities and rule of law. 
   Finally Mr. President, let me say that I am also relieved to see that the level of funding dedicated to the Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, De-mining and Related Programs (NADR) has been increased substantially. The amount is almost $100 million more than the level in the Senate passed bill, and slightly higher than the President's request. Although I would like to see more resources dedicated to the International Science and Technology Centers program, I welcome the plus up in the larger account. These programs are a crucial element in our strategy to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, and combat terrorism. 
   One NADR account that received more than the amount requested was export control assistance, and I truly applaud that. The assistance that we give to other countries in developing export control laws, regulations, and enforcement is absolutely crucial from the non-proliferation standpoint, and it can also help combat international terrorism. As we plus up that program, however, we must remember to provide the personnel to implement it. Many of those personnel are in the Department of Commerce, and more are needed. Unless appropriators provide elsewhere the requested 7 additional personnel (which translates into 5 additional FTE in Fiscal Year 2001) for the Bureau of Export Administration, the additional funds that we make available in this bill simply will not be implemented as effectively as we would wish.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the volatile situation in Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslav dictator is history. The long nightmare is over. The Serbian people have spoken and, although Milosevic's ultimate fate is still uncertain, Kostunica's victory marks a sea change in Serbia's current history, a clear choice for democratic change over a stagnant and morally bankrupt dictatorship. 
   As Kostunica works hard to secure and stabilize his fledgling government, the final outcome is not yet certain. The United States must not fumble the opportunity to support the new Serbian government as it navigates a potentially treacherous transition. With Milosevic's party still controlling the Serb parliament and Milosevic himself still lurking in the political shadows, we must engage in an open and constructive dialogue with Kostunica and his allies. 
   To this end, I welcome the recent move by the administration to lift some of the sanctions that specifically targeted the Milosevic regime, namely the flight ban and the oil embargo, while retaining the so-called ``outer wall'' of sanctions. I also commend the State Department's decision to send a delegation to Belgrade to discuss the Kostunica government's assistance needs. 
   Mr. President, extending a helping hand does not, however, mean giving Kostunica and his new government a free pass when it comes to accounting for the terrible crimes of the Milosevic regime. To unilaterally lift all sanctions, or to open up the aid spigot fully would be both premature and naive. Instead, the United States should adopt a more measured response, recognizing as well the fact that a too forward-leaning or heavy handed policy could risk undermining Kostunica before he is able to consolidate power. The following immediate steps would, I believe, help lay the correct groundwork for future cooperation. 
   First, the United States must maintain its insistence that Milosevic be delivered to the Hague to stand trial for war crimes. Anything less would fatally undermine the International Tribunal. 
   Second, even as we congratulate Mr. Kostunica and recognize him as an inestimable improvement over his predecessor, we must emphasize to him that his democratic credentials alone will not be a sufficient qualification for Serbia to reenter the international community. A Kostunica government must fully respect the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and not undermine the Dayton Accords. Kostunica's recent meeting in Sarajevo with the three members of Bosnia's collective presidency gives some grounds for optimism. Serbia must also unequivocally renounce the use of force in Kosovo and take steps to implement policies that reflect a respect for minorities and rule of law. 
   The foreign operations bill for fiscal year 2001 will, in fact, condition U.S. assistance to Serbia on meeting the above benchmarks. I support this section of the bill because it is the right thing to do and the right message to send. But while we should remain firm in our policy, we must also be flexible in our evaluation, recognizing what Kostunica is able to do and what he is unable to do while pro-Milosevic forces still wield considerable power in the Serbian government. 
   Third, the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe must be given a jolt. Too much time has been wasted on conferences and working groups. Assistance must begin to flow in the next few months. A long-needed measure to help the front-line states would be a crash-effort to clear the Danube River of  bombed-out bridges, thereby reopening vital trade links from Bulgaria and Romania to Western Europe. 
   Finally, we should strongly encourage the European Union to make good on this commitment to expand its membership to candidates as soon as they meet the qualifications. In Southeastern Europe this means Hungary and Slovenia. Brussels must not squander a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
   Mr. President, there is another reason I wanted to take the floor today, one that touches on the future of our commitment to the Balkans and, indeed, to a stable and secure Europe. 
   As we continue to work towards a Serbia that will meet the necessary criteria to rejoin the community of western democracies, it is just as important to remember why we are engaged in the Balkans in the first place. This is, after all, an election year, a time when Americans should rightly question the policies and decisions of the current administration when making their decision about the next. 
   U.S. military engagement on the European continent since the end of World War II has provided the security umbrella under which democracy and free-market capitalism have been able to develop and flourish. The Balkans, however, are a world away from that reality, the last remaining area of instability in Europe. During the last decade several hundred thousand people have been killed in three bloody wars there. The NATO-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo are designed to provide the same kind of umbrella as in post-war Western Europe to allow democracy, civil society, and capitalism to take root and develop. 
   Without American leadership, this region would most likely still be mired in civil war, ethnic cleansing, and ultra-nationalist aggression, with Milosevic firmly ensconced at the center of it all. 
   I remember well when in September 1992, reacting to the mass murders an ethnic cleansing that Milosevic directed in Croatia and Bosnia, I called for lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and, six months later, for hitting the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes. I was joined by Bob Dole and JOE LIEBERMAN, but for three years ours was a lonely fight. Finally, after hundreds of thousands killed and massacres in Srebrenica and Sarajevo that galvanized public opinion, our government undertook a bombing campaign that led to the Dayton Accords. 
   Just as that American military action in 1995 served as the catalyst for change in Bosnia, so did Operation Allied Force in 1999 dash the myth in Serbia of Milosevic's invincibility. If he had gotten away with purging Kosovo of most of its ethnic Albanians, those in Serbia who found Milosevic to be odious would have had no reason to believe that anything could be done to stop his immoral and ruinous policies. 
   American leadership has been indispensable for successful military action in the Balkans. The bombing campaign our government undertook in 1995 led to the Dayton Accords for Bosnia. Operation Allied Force in 1999 forced Milosevic to withdraw his military and paramilitary units from Serbia, destroying the myth in Serbia of his invincibility. This leadership goes beyond the purely technical military assets that only the U.S. can deploy; it also involves intangibles. SFOR in Bosnia and KFOR in Kosovo contain thousands of highly qualified soldiers from many countries, but the American troop presence on the ground gave the mission its ultimate credibility with the Balkan peoples. This fact I have witnessed firsthand from my many trips to the region. 
   I am, therefore, alarmed by the recent calls for a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Balkans. Such a radical shift in our policy, I believe, would have a catastrophic effect not only on the very real progress we have made in stabilizing both Bosnia and Kosovo, but on U.S. leadership in Europe and on the Atlantic Alliance as a whole. U.S. participation on the ground in the Balkans is essential to our overall leadership in NATO, which is an alliance not only of shared values, but also of shared risk and responsibility. To begin a disengagement from the Balkans would not only guarantee the loss of American leadership in NATO, but also, I fear, lead to the premature end of Western Europe's commitment to stabilizing the Balkans. 
   As my colleagues surely know, the vast majority of the troops in SFOR and KFOR--approximately eighty percent--are European. Yet despite this minority participation, the United States retains the command of both Balkan operations in the person of U.S. General Joseph Ralston, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). 
   Let me be blunt: it is naive to believe that we could retain command of these operations--or, more importantly, leadership of NATO itself--if we would cavalierly inform our allies that we were unilaterally pulling out of the Balkans. It just won't work. 
   If the U.S. withdrew, like it or not, the future of SFOR and KFOR would be in jeopardy, and the likelihood of renewed hostilities and instability beyond the borders of Bosnia and Kosovo would greatly increase. 
   We are entering into a very sensitive period for the Balkans, one that could either strengthen or tear apart the fragile peace that KFOR and SFOR have helped secure. Local elections will take place in Kosovo later this month, in Bosnia in November, and in Serbia in December. The anti-democratic, ultra nationalist forces in the region are now no doubt biding their time and hoping for a new administration that has already laid its withdrawal cards on the table. 
   The assertion that our Balkan operations are a heavy drain on our resources is also completely off base. Our Bosnia and Kosovo operations together amount to little more than one percent of our total defense budget. This hardly constitutes a ``hollowing out'' of the military. 
   The argument that our commitment to the Balkans is open-ended is equally misleading. There are detailed military, political, economic, and social benchmarks set in place. Our ``exit strategy'' is crystal clear: a secure, stable, democratic Balkans with a free-market economy that can join the rest of the continent, a Europe ``whole and free.'' These are the ideals for which the greatest generation fought and died. We dare not embark upon a policy that fails to recognize the most important international lesson of the twentieth century: America's national security is inextricably linked to the maintenance of a stable and peaceful Europe. 
   To pull the plug on a Balkans policy that has finally begun to yield real dividends and at the same time to put NATO, the most successful alliance in history, at risk would jeopardize America's national security. 
   It would also betray the brave crowds in Serbia, who have struggled to open up great possibilities for their country, the Balkans, and all of Europe. This is no time for Americans to retreat from the struggle out of ill-conceived, artificially narrow definitions of national security. The American people have shown time and again that they lack neither vision nor patience when they are convinced of the importance of a cause. A Europe unified by democracy is such a cause.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the momentous changes underway on the Korean Peninsula and to take note of the contributions of one extraordinary American public servant to the cause of peace there. Former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry stepped down this month as special adviser to the President on Korea policy, a role he assumed when our relations with North Korea were in crisis and when congressional faith in our approach to the Korean challenge was at a nadir. 
   It was a job no one coveted. North Korea ranks as one of the most difficult foreign policy challenges we face. 
   It was a job fraught with risk. Err too far towards confrontation, and you might send North Korea over the brink and start another war. Err too far towards conciliation, and your initiative might be mistaken for appeasement, emboldening the North and undermining political support at home. 
   Under Bill Perry's leadership, the U.S. launched a hard-headed initiative designed to test North Korea's willingness to abandon the path of confrontation in favor of the road to peace. From its inception, the Perry initiative was predicated on maintenance of a strong military deterrent. But Dr. Perry recognized that deterrence alone was not likely to lure North Korea out of its shell and reduce the threat of war. 
   The Perry initiative was designed and implemented in concert with our South Korean and Japanese allies, and it continues to enjoy their full support. 
   The results of this comprehensive and integrated engagement strategy have stunned even the most optimistic observers. 
   The year began with a mysterious and unprecedented visit by Kim Jong-il to the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang. Over the course of a four-hour dinner, Kim made it plain that the year 2000 would see a shift in the North's approach to reviving its moribund economy and ending its diplomatic isolation. 
   In quick succession, Kim hosted Russian President Putin and then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. The historic Korean summit meeting in Pyongyang was a tremendous victory for South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's ``Sunshine Policy'' and a validation of Perry's engagement strategy. It is fitting that President Kim Dae-jung was just awarded the Nobel Peace prize for his life-long efforts on behalf of peace and democracy on the Korean peninsula. 
   With the rapid emergence of Kim Jong-il from what he admitted was a ``hermit's'' existence in North Korea, the prospects for a lasting peace on the peninsula are better today than at any time since the Korean War began more than 50 years ago. Time will tell. 
   If fully implemented, the agreement reached in Pyongyang by President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il promises to reduce tensions in this former war zone and enhance economic, cultural, environmental, and humanitarian cooperation. 
   There are encouraging signs that the summit meeting was not a fluke: 
   Family reunification visits are proceeding, albeit at a pace that is slower than the families divided for 50 years desire or deserve. 
   Ground will be broken soon to restore rail connections across the DMZ, restoring trade and communication links severed for 50 years. 
   A follow-on meeting of the North and South Korean Defense Ministers in September led to an agreement to resume military contacts and to explore confidence building measures along the DMZ, including notification of exercises and creation of a North-South hot-line. 
   Planning is proceeding smoothly for next year's North-South summit meeting in Seoul. 
   There has also been progress in U.S.-North Korean relations. An historic meeting between President Clinton and senior North Korean military officer Cho Myong-nok occurred this month in Washington, setting the stage for next week's first ever visit to the North by an American Secretary of State. 
   Mr. President, this flurry of diplomatic activity has been dismissed by some critics as all form, and no substance. They marvel at our willingness--and that of our South Korean ally--to provide food aid to a despotic regime that continues to spend precious resources on weapons and military training rather than tractors and agricultural production. 
   No one condones the North Korean Government's callous disregard for the suffering of its own people. And obviously, much work remains to be done--especially in the security realm--to realize the hope generated by the summits. The North has not withdrawn any of its heavy artillery poised along the Demilitarized Zone. 
   It has not halted provocative military exercises. It has not yet ended all of its support for terrorist organizations. 
   And, although the North did reaffirm its moratorium on long-range missile testing this month in Washington, it has not stopped its development or export of long-range ballistic missile technology. North Korea's missile program continues to pose a serious threat not only to our allies South Korea and Japan, but also to other nations confronting the odious clients of North Korea's arms merchants. 
   All of these issues must be addressed if we are to forge a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. 
   Our efforts to engage North Korea must ultimately be matched by reciprocal steps by the North. Engagement is not a one-way street. 
   But the question is not whether North Korea is a desirable partner for peace. Kim Jong-il has all the appeal of Saddam Hussein. The question is how we manage the North Korean threat. 
   I can't imagine how the situation would be improved if we did not offer North Korea a chance to choose peace over truculence. I can't imagine how the situation would be improved in any way if North Korean children were dying in droves from malnutrition and disease as they were prior to the launch of the U.S.-funded World Food Program relief efforts. 
   Mr. President, we should not discount the importance of the recent diplomatic developments on the peninsula. How soon we forget that it was a process called glasnost--openness--combined with maintenance of a strong NATO alliance, which ultimately brought about the demise of the Soviet  Union and the reunification of East and West Germany. 
   Information about the outside world is hard to come by in North Korea, just as it was hard to get in the Soviet Union before detente opened the window and let the Soviet people catch the scent of the fresh air of freedom. 
   Perhaps dialog with North Korea and greater openness there will bring about a similar result. If so, we will have Secretary Perry to thank for his role in getting that dialog jump-started after it had stalled amidst mutual suspicions and acrimony during the mid-1990s. 
   Mr. President, in closing I would like to extend my profound thanks to Bill Perry for the way he carried out his responsibilities. He answered the call to public service two years ago, trading the comfort of northern California for the landmine-strewn terrain of Washington and North Korea. He has conducted himself with honor and a strong sense of duty. He will be missed. 
   The stakes on the peninsula are high. Events there will not only shape the security environment of Northeast Asia, but also affect our decision whether to deploy a limited national missile defense, and if so, what kind of defense. From my perspective, it would be a great accomplishment if we could neutralize the North Korean missile threat through diplomacy rather than spend billions of dollars to construct a missile defense system which might do more harm to our national security than good. 
   I wish Secretary Albright and her new Korea policy adviser Wendy Sherman well as they strive to build on the momentum generated over the past few months. It is a tough job, but it is incumbent on us to test North Korea's commitment to peace.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on October 18 the Voice of America broadcast an editorial entitled ``Terrorism Will Fail,'' strongly condemning the terrorist bomb attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Aden harbor, which took the lives of 17 U.S. sailors. The editorial concluded: ``U.S. policy remains unchanged. The U.S. will make no concessions to terrorists. The U.S. will bring to justice those who attack its citizens and interests. The U.S. will hold state sponsors of terrorism fully accountable.'' 
   This is unambiguous language, which reflects not only United States government policy but also the feelings of all Americans. Unfortunately, however, the bureaucratic road from writing, to approval, to broadcasting this editorial was anything but unambiguous. In fact, it revealed both initial bad judgment by the State Department, and the need for better vetting procedures of VOA editorials by the appropriate authorities. 
   VOA editorials are statements of American policy, so they are rightly cleared by the State Department for consistency with official U.S. Government policy. Regrettably, in this case the State Department initially vetoed the editorial's language. The reason for stopping the editorial was totally unjustified. It was dead wrong to stop the editorial because of fighting and casualties that were occurring elsewhere in the Middle East. American service men and women were tragically killed in this terrorist attack and a clear statement by Voice of America condemning the action should have gone out immediately. 
   Subsequently, the State Department fortunately disavowed the earlier veto of the editorial memo, saying that the initial veto memorandum ``in no way reflects the views of the Secretary of State, the Department or the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.'' Moreover, it stated that the initial veto memorandum had not been vetted or approved through appropriate channels. 
   It is inconceivable to me how anyone could advocate deleting an editorial condemning the cruel, cowardly, terrorist murder of American service men and women. 
   I hope and trust this occurred because of the understandable stress officials at the Department of State were under due to the tragic deaths from this dastardly act of terrorism in Yemen occurring at the same time the crises in the Middle East was also absorbing the attention of the Department. 
   Fortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the Voice of America did broadcast the editorial in its entirety.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the last days of this Congress, as we scramble to compete our work, I am worried that one of the most important issues before us may slip through the cracks. 
   Last week, I attended an extraordinary meeting at the White House, where President Clinton called together religious and political leaders to discuss the urgent need to provide debt relief for the poorest countries of the world. Looking around the table, it was clear that this was no ordinary issue, no ordinary meeting. 
   Just a partial list of the people in that room speaks volumes about this issue. There were bishops of several denominations, and a rabbi. The Reverend Pat Robertson was there, as was the Reverend Andrew Young. Democratic Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS was at the table, not far from Republican Congressman SPENCER BACHUS. A few seats from the President himself sat near the rock star Bono, who has become one of the most prominent spokesmen for the cause of debt relief. 
   President Clinton called us together because the need for debt relief is great, the logic of debt relief is compelling, and time left for us to pass debt relief legislation is alarmingly short. Failure to act now would be nothing less than a failure of the United States to lead what could be the most important international effort to bring the poorest nations of the world into a more positive, constructive role in the world economy. 
   Here are the facts, Mr. President. Around the world today, many poor nations actually pay more in interest payments to advanced industrial nations, and to international development banks, than they do on childhood immunizations, primary education, and other essential services. 
   Tragically, Mr. President, many of these countries are suffering through an AIDS epidemic that dwarfs any public health crisis the world has ever seen. No responsible person can argue that we have no interest in helping such countries fight against communicable diseases that are just a jet flight away from our cities. No moral person can argue that we should sit idly by while a continent loses a generation to disease. 
   The debts these countries owe are often the legacy of earlier governments, propped up by lending that suited the purposes of Cold War geopolitics, but that did precious little for the poorest of the poor in those countries. Today, the prospects of repayment by these countries is so small that the loans are now carried on our books at just a few cents on the dollar. A sensible business decision--made every day in this country and around the world--is to simply write off bad debts, and let both borrower and lender move on. 
   Following that sound economic logic, with the leadership and commitment of the United States, the major creditor nations of the world agreed several years ago to forgive some of the debt owed by the poorest of these countries. That program, known as the HIPC Initiative--for the ``Highly Indebted Poor Countries''--requires significant commitments by the poor countries if they are to qualify. They must commit to market-oriented economic reforms, reduce corruption, and use the savings from debt relief for essential poverty reduction programs. 
   Already under way in several countries, the HIPC program has achieved tangible results--the kind of results we all want to see, and the kind of results that will be put at risk if we fail to fully fund our participation. In Uganda, money saved by debt relief under the HIPC program has 
   allowed the government to end the fees for primary school students, fees that had kept enrollment down. Over the last four years, primary school enrollment there virtually doubled. That is what a well-designed debt relief program can do. 
   Because those debts are such a large part of the poor countries' income--often as high as thirty or forty percent--and because those same debts are realistically worth so little to us, a relatively small financial commitment on our part buys important economic assistance many times over. And because we are the leading economy in the world, Mr. President, our leverage is even greater. Other nations are waiting for us to act--the only prudent course for creditors working out this kind of deal--and that means that our relatively small contribution will trigger a major international initiative. 
   But that leverage works both ways. Without us, the viability of the whole initiative remains in doubt. Our inaction has stalled any further action on debt relief in Latin America, and will prevent all but a few eligible African countries from participating. 
   Something more than sensible, effective foreign policy is at stake here, Mr. President, which brings me back to that extraordinary meeting at the White House. The world's religious leaders, from the Pope to Billy Graham, in an interfaith, ecumenical unanimity rarely seen on any issue, have joined to challenge our nation's conscience. They have asked us to face the embarrassing fact that while we talk about providing assistance to the poorest nations--while in fact we do send a tiny fraction of our own record income and wealth abroad--at the same time we continue to collect interest payments on those nations' old debts. 
   They have challenged us to follow the Biblical injunction to lift the burden of debt, in effect to put our money where we say our values are. They call on us to deal with the least fortunate in the way all of the world's great religions command. Now, when we are enjoying the best economic times in our history, as we stand as the most fortunate of nations, surely we can underwrite less than four percent of the overall cost of debt relief. That's right, Mr. President: our share is less than four percent of the total cost of the whole HIPC program. 
   For that contribution, we will assure the full implementation of nearly 30 billion dollars of debt relief for the poorest 33 countries of the world. 
   This program presents us with a powerful combination of economic logic and moral imperative. Here, in the last days and hours of this session of Congress, we must not let this opportunity slip away. 
   Earlier this year, the Foreign Relations Committee passed full authorization of two key funding mechanisms for our participation in the HIPC program. First, we authorized use of the balance of the funds made available through a revaluation of the IMF's gold holdings, to provide them with the resources to finance their share of the debt forgiveness--an action that will have no budgetary impact, that will not cost us a dime. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee also authorized the appropriation of $600 million for our share, between 2000 and 2003, of the HIPC initiative. Senator HELMS, Senator HAGEL, and Senator SARBANES and I agreed on a set of conditions that would hold the Administration accountable for policies that will promote more focused, better monitored international financial institutions. But we agreed, in the end, that the program was too important to impose unworkable conditions or to require the kind of delay that could be fatal. It took compromise and good faith to achieve that agreement, which was reported out of our committee unanimously. 
   Mr. President, I am here today to say that those principles must guide any final agreement. That means there must be no new, unworkable demands for overhauling international financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank before debt relief can go forward. That will require the spirit of bipartisan accommodation that we achieved in our committee. 
   So far the Senate has only appropriated $75 million for debt relief. This is only a place holder for a final amount, now under negotiation. The House has done somewhat better, but is still far short of the mark. One of the problems is that full authorization has not reached the Senate floor, where I  am confident it would receive overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   Right now, as I speak, there is still hope that we can reach an accommodation on authorizing language that the Appropriations Committee is seeking before it provides the full amount of debt relief needed to make the HIPC program a reality. 
   But time is running out, Mr. President, and we are dangerously close to forfeiting our international leadership on this issue. That means forfeiting not just our leadership in international financial affairs, Mr. President. If we fail to provide full funding for our participation in the international debt relief effort, we will forfeit something even more valuable: our moral leadership.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Dangerous Biological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000. Similar legislation was originally submitted by the Administration in 1999 as part of a larger anti-crime proposal. 
   Today a terrorist attack in the United States using chemical or biological weapons is one of the most significant terrorist threats we face. In recent years, through the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the enactment of the related implementing legislation, we have provided several statutory safeguards designed to prevent and deter against an attack using chemical weapons. But gaps remain in our laws regulating biological pathogens. It is essential not only that America be fully prepared to respond to such an attack, but also that we take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place. 
   Currently, federal law bans only the development and possession of biological agents for use as a weapon. But there are sensible things that we can do in the near term to give federal law enforcement the tools that they need to protect our country from these threats--before they materialize into unspeakable scenarios. 
   Earlier this year, the National Commission on Terrorism reported to Congress. Among its conclusions was that the federal laws regarding the possession of dangerous pathogens are currently insufficient. The Commission specifically recommended, among other things, that Congress make it illegal for anyone not properly certified to possess certain critical pathogens. And they were right. 
   The bill I introduce today fill several gaps in the law. 
   First, the bill will make it unlawful for anyone to possess biological agent, toxin or delivery system of a type or in a quantity that under the circumstances is not reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purpose. Second, the bill makes it unlawful to handle a biological agent with conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk to public health and safety. Third, the legislation makes it unlawful to knowingly communicate false, but believable information, concerning an activity which would constitute a violation of this statute. Finally, the bill requires people to report to the federal government their possession of listed biological agents, prohibits the transfer of a listed biological agent to a person who is not registered and makes possession by certain restricted persons--such as convicted felons--unlawful. 
   Closing these gaps in the law would be a modest but important step to prevent and deter a terrorist act involving biological agents. This should not be a partisan issue. This is an issue of governance, not politics. From Wilmington to Washington State, our constituents need protection and expect and deserve nothing less. 
   Mr. President, I recognize that the Congressional session is about to end, and therefore it is too late for the bill to be considered this year. But I wanted to introduce the bill now so that it would be available for review by my colleagues and other interested parties inside and outside of government. In particular, I invite comment by interested parties in the scientific community, the business community, and the civil liberties community. I regard the bill I introduce today as an initial draft that is a work in progress, and I welcome constructive comments and suggestions for improvement. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary early in the next session of Congress.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what a difference a year makes. Last year, I came to the floor and indicated I thought in light of the resistance taking place regarding the Violence Against Women Act and its reauthorization and the Violence Against Women II Act, it would be a tough fight to renew and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. Thanks to  the help and support of a number of folks in and out of this Senate--from attorneys general in the various States, to police, to victims advocates, doctors, nurses, Governors, women's groups--I am proud to say we finally arrived at a point where the Violence Against Women Act 2000 is on the verge of passing the Senate as part of the sex trafficking conference report. 
   I thank particularly my good friend from Minnesota. Since he has arrived in the Senate, he has been the single strongest supporter I have had. Along with his wife, who is incredible, she has been the single most significant outside advocate for the Violence Against Women Act in everything that surrounds and involves it. 
   I dealt him a bit of advice. When I went to a conference on a bill he was working very mightily for, along with our friend and Republican colleague, the sex trafficking bill, which is a very important bill in and of itself--by itself it is important--if we were doing nothing else but passing that legislation that he and Senator BROWNBACK have worked so hard on, it would be a worthy day, a worthy endeavor for the Senate and the U.S. Government. 
   I realize people watching this on C-SPAN get confused when we use the ``Senate speak.'' We talk of conferences and conference reports and various types of legislation. The bottom line is, I was part of that agreement where we sat down with House Members and Senate Members to talk about the sex trafficking legislation. I didn't surprise him--I told him ahead of time, but I am sure I created some concern--by attempting to add the Violence Against Women Act to that legislation. We ultimately did. 
   It is the first time in the 28 years I have been in the Senate that I have gone to a conference and added a major piece of legislation in that conference, knowing that it might very well jeopardize the passage of the legislation we were discussing. And it is worthy legislation. I am a cosponsor. I can think of nothing--obviously, you would expect me to say that, being the author of this legislation--I can think of nothing of more consequence to the women of America and the children of America than our continuing the fight--and I am sure my friend from Minnesota agrees with me--regarding violence against women. 
   I thank Senator HATCH for working so hard with me to pass 
   this legislation. This legislation was not a very popular idea on the other side of the aisle 8 years ago when we wrote this, and 6 years ago when we got close to passing it, and 5 years ago when we passed it. Senator HATCH stood up and led the way on the Republican side. And I thank my Republican colleagues, about 25 of whom--maybe more now--cosponsored it. I attribute that to Senator HATCH's leadership, and I thank him for that. 
   This legislation is very important. I will try as briefly as I can to state why it is important. 
   First of all, it reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, referred to as landmark legislation. I believe it is landmark legislation. It is the beginning of the end of the attitude in America that a woman is the possession of a man, that a woman is, in fact, subject to a man's control even if that requires ``physical force.'' This clearly states, and we stated it for the first time on record in 1994, that no man has a right under any circumstance other than self-defense to raise his hand to or to use any physical force against a woman for any reason at all other than self-defense. 
   One might think: Big deal; we all knew that. No, we didn't all know that. It has begun to shape societal attitudes. What has happened is that we have seen a decline of 21 percent in the violent acts committed by significant others against their spouses and/or girlfriends and/or mate. That is a big deal. What happens if we don't pass this today? The Violence Against Women Act goes out of existence. It is no longer authorized. So this is a big deal, a big, big deal. 
   No. 2, I promised when I wrote this legislation in 1994 that, after seeing it in operation, I would not be wedded to its continuation if it wasn't working, and that I would propose, along with others, things that would enhance the legislation. That is, places where there were deficiencies we would change the law and places where the law in place was useless or counterproductive, we would eliminate that provision of the law. We have kept that promise. 
   This legislation does a number of things. It makes improvements in what we call full faith and credit of enforcement orders. Simply stated, that means if a woman in the State of Maryland goes to court and says, ``This man is harassing me,'' or ``He has beaten me,'' or ``He has hurt me,'' and the court says that man must stay away from that woman and cannot get within a quarter mile--or whatever the restriction is--and if he does, he will go to jail, that is a protection order, a stay away order. 
   What happens in many cases when that woman crosses the line into the State of Delaware or into the State of Pennsylvania or into the District of Columbia and that man follows her, the court in that district does not enforce the stay away order from the other State for a number of reasons: One, they don't have computers that they can access and find out whether there is such an order; two, they are blase about it; or three, they will not give full faith and credit to it. 
   This creates a development and enhancement of data collection and sharing system to promote tracking and enforcement of these orders. 
   Big deal. 
   Second, transition housing. This is a change. We have found that we have provided housing for thousands and thousands and thousands of women who have gotten themselves into a dilemma where they are victimized but have no place to go. So we, all of us in the Congress, have provided moneys for building credible and decent and clean shelters, homes for women where they can bring their children. 
   I might note parenthetically the majority of children who are homeless, on the street, are there because their mothers are the victim of abuse and have no place to go. So they end up on the street. We are rectifying that. 
   We found out there is a problem. There is a problem because there are more people trying to get into this emergency housing and there is no place for some of these women to go between the emergency housing--and they can't go back to their homes--and having decent housing. So we provide for a transition, some money for transition housing. In the interest of time, I will not go into detail about it. 
   Third, we change what we call incorporating dating violence into the purposes that this act covers, where there is a pro-arrest policy, where there are child abuse enforcement grants, et cetera. The way the law was written the first time, an unintended consequence of what I did when I wrote the law is, a woman ended up having to have an extended relationship with the man who was victimizing her in order to qualify for these services. That is an oversimplification, but that is the essence. If a woman was a victim of date rape, the first or second time she went out with a man of whom she was a victim, she did not qualify under the law for those purposes. Now that person would qualify. 
   We also provide legal assistance for victims of domestic violence and sexual harassment. We set aside some of the money in the Violence Against Women Act, hopefully through the trust fund which, hopefully, the Presiding Officer will insist on being part of this. We provide for women getting help through that system. We provide for safe havens for children, pilot programs. 
   As my friend from Minnesota knows, most of the time when a woman gets shot or killed in a domestic exchange, it is when she is literally dropping off a child at the end of the weekend. That is when the violence occurs. So we provide the ability for the child to be dropped off in a safe place, under supervised care--the father leaves, and then the mother comes and picks the child up and regains custody--because we find simple, little things make big, giant differences in safety for women. This also provides pilot programs relating to visitation and exchange. 
   We put in protective orders for the protection of disabled women from domestic violence. Also, the role of the court in combating violence against women engages State courts in fighting violence by setting aside funds in one of the grant programs. 
   And we provided a domestic violence task force. We also provide standards, practices, and training for sexual forensic examinations which we have  been doing in my State, and other States have done, but nationwide they are not being done. So much loss of potential evidence is found when the woman comes back into court because they did not collect the necessary evidence at the time the abuse took place. 
   Also, maybe the single most important provision we add to the Violence Against Women Act is the battered immigrant women provision. This strengthens and refines the protections for battered immigrant women in the original act and eliminates the unintended consequence of subsequent charges in immigration law to ensure that abused women living in the United States with immigrant victims are brought to justice and the battered immigrants also escape abuse without being subject to other penalties. 
   There is much more to say. 
   We have worked hard together over the past year to produce a strong, bipartisan bill that has gained the overwhelming support of the Senate--with a total of 74 cosponsors. All of my Democratic colleagues are cosponsors, along with 28 of my Republican friends. 
   Passage of this bill today would not have been possible without the effort and commitment of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend ORRIN HATCH, who has dedicated years to addressing the scourge of violence against women. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to thank our committee's ranking member, Senator LEAHY, for his constant support of my efforts to bring this bill to a vote, and my friends in the House, Representatives JOHN CONYERS, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, and CONNIE MORELLA, for their leadership on this important legislation. 
   The need for this law is as clear today as it was more than a decade ago when I first focused on the problem of domestic violence and sexual assault. 
   Consider this: In my state of Delaware, I regret to report that more than 30 women and children have been killed in domestic violence-related homicides in the past three years. 
   No area or income-bracket has escaped this violence. To stop domestic violence beatings from escalating into violent deaths, more than one thousand police officers throughout Delaware--in large cities and small, rural towns alike--have received specialized training to deal with such cases. 
   Every State in this country now has similar police training, and the Violence Against Women Act is providing the necessary funding. 
   To ensure these officers collect evidence that will stand up in court, they are being armed with state-of-the-art instant cameras and video cameras. 
   The Violence Against Women Act is providing the necessary funding for these cameras--nationwide. 
   The National Domestic Violence Hotline handles 13,000 calls from victims per month and has fielded over half a million calls since its inception. The Violence Against Women Act is providing the necessary funding. 
   We are also working hard to create an army of attorneys nationwide who have volunteered to provide free legal services to victims--from filing a protection order, to divorce and custody matters. But many, many more women need legal assistance. The Violence Against Women Act of 2000, which is before us today, authorizes and provides the necessary funding to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault obtain legal assistance at little to no cost. 
   Don't take my word for the need for this legislation. You have heard from folks in your states. Listen to their stories and the programs they've put into place over the past five years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994--with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   Unless we act now--and renew our commitment to stopping violence against women and children--our efforts and successes over the past five years will come to a screeching halt. The Violence Against Women Act expired September 30. 
   If the funding dries up--make no mistake--the number of domestic violence cases and the number of women killed by their husbands or boyfriends who profess to ``love'' them--will increase. 
   Domestic violence has been on a steady decline in recent years. U.S. Department of Justice statistics show a 21 percent drop since 1993. 
   Why? 
   From Alabama to Alaska--New Hampshire to New Mexico--Michigan to Maine--California to Kentucky--Delaware to Utah--police, prosecutors, judges, victims' advocates, hospitals, corporations, and attorneys are providing a seamless network of ``coordinated response teams'' to provide victims and their children the services they need to escape the violence--and stay alive. 
   In National City, California, family violence response team counselors go directly to the scenes of domestic violence cases with police. 
   Violence Against Women Act funds have facilitated changes from simple, common sense reforms--such as standardized police reporting forms to document the abuse ..... to more innovative programs, such as the Tri-State Domestic Violence Project involving North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. This project includes getting the word out to everyone from clergy to hairdressers to teachers--anyone who is likely to come into contact with a domestic violence victims--so that they can direct victims to needed housing, legal, and medical services. And the services and protections are offered across State lines. 
   Such coordinated projects have different names in different States--in Oregon, they have domestic violence intervention teams. 
   In Vermont they have ``PAVE.'' The Project Against Violent Encounters. 
   Washington State has developed ``Project SAFER''--which links attorneys with victims at battered women shelters to ``Stop Abuse and Fear by Exercising Rights.'' 
   In Washington, D.C. they formed Women Empowered Against Violence--known as WEAVE--which provides a total package for victims, from legal assistance to counseling to case management through the courts. 
   Utah has developed the ``CAUSE'' project, or the Coalition of Advocates for Utah Survivors' Empowerment. It is a statewide, nonprofit organization that has created a system of community support for sexual assault survivors. 
   In Kansas, they've funded a program called ``Circuit Riders,'' who are advocates and attorneys who travel to rural parts of the State to fill the gaps in service. 
   Different names for these programs but the same funding source and inspiration--the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Experience with the act has also shown us that we need to strengthen enforcement of protection from abuse orders across state lines. 
   Candidly, a protection from abuse order is just one part of the solution. A piece of paper will not stop a determined abuser with a fist, knife, or gun. 
   But look at what states like New York and Georgia are doing to make it easier--and less intimidating--for women to file for a protection from abuse order. 
   They have implemented a completely confidential system for a victim to file for a protection from abuse order without ever having to walk into a courtroom. 
   It is all on-line over the internet. After the victim answers a series of questions and describes the abuse, the information is deleted once transmitted to the court--with no information stored electronically. 
   This project is part of specialized domestic violence courts established in many states--where one judge handles the entire case--from protection orders, to divorce, custody, and probation issues. 
   The Center for Court Innovation is working with the New York courts to develop customized computer technology that will link the courts, police, probation officers, and social service agencies--so that everyone is on the same page, and knows exactly what's happening with a domestic violence case. 
   We need to take this technology nationwide. And the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 before us today will provide funding to states for such technology. and not all our solutions are high-tech. 
   To help victims enforce protection orders, states and cities across this country have teamed up with the cellular phone industry to arm victims with cell phones. 
   In my state of Delaware, I spearheaded a drive to collect two thousand  used cell phones, so that every person with a protection from abuse order can get a cell phone programmed to automatically dial 9-1-1 if the abuser shows up at her house, place of work, at the school yard when she picks up her child, the bus stop or the grocery store. 
   Commonsense solutions--all sparked by the Violence Against Women Act this body passed overwhelmingly in 1994. 
   Again, listen to the voices of victims we have helped. 
   Phyllis Lee from Tennessee says she is alive today thanks to the battered women shelter in Dayton. Without it, she is certain her abusive husband would have killed her with his violent beatings. After enduring 17 years of torturous abuse, including severe beatings to her head and body, rape, and the withholding of needed medical care, Phyllis finally escaped. 
   After a particularly severe beating, she hid in the woods for 20 hours, paralyzed with fear that her husband would find her. She crawled to a nearby farmhouse and asked for help. 
   With the help of the woman who lived there, she contacted Battered Women, Inc.--an organization that assists victims of domestic violence. This program, which includes a hotline, counselors, and a shelter, is heavily funded by the Violence Against Women Act. It provided a way out for Phyllis and her children, whose lives were in grave danger. 
   Battered Women, Inc. also helped Phyllis get her GED and she is now working as an advocate for other battered women. She says that without this program, she never would have known that the option to live without abuse existed. 
   States with large Indian reservations--such as California and Nevada--have formed Inter-Tribal Councils so that Native American women no longer have to suffer in silence at the hands of their violent abusers. One victim in California writes:  
   If it were not for the Inter-Tribal Council's efforts, I would be dead, homeless or living in my car, with my children hungry.  
   In California, the Inter-Tribal Council has reached out to Native American communities to establish the ``Stop and Take Responsibility'' program. 
   First, and foremost, this program is about education--educating Native American men that hitting your spouse is a serious crime, and educating mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters--that no man has a right to lay a hand on them. 
   This past May, the shooting of Barry Grunnow, an English teacher in Lake Worth, Florida--by a seventh grade honor roll student named Nathaniel Brazil--shocked the nation. 
   Recently, Lake Worth police released reports showing a history of domestic violence in the Brazil home. 
   As the Palm Beach Post wrote recently in an editorial--  
   While violence in the home can hardly be directly blamed for the tragic shooting ..... this case does demonstrate the way in which domestic violence affects society at large, how violence in the home increased the likelihood for violence in the surrounding community. It is about time that we push for bipartisan Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization in Congress to combat domestic violence and its horrible consequences.  
   And if any of you doubt the link between children growing up in a home watching their mother get the living hell beat out of her--and that child growing up to be violent as well, consider this recent case two months ago in San Diego. 
   A prosecutor was in her office, interviewing a mother who was pressing charges against her husband after suffering years of abuse. As the questioning stretched on, the woman's 8-year-old son grew restless. 
   Just as little kids do--the boy tugged at his mother's sleeve, saying, ``Let's go. I'm hungry ..... can we leave yet.'' 
   He became even more agitated and said: ``Come on, Mom, I want to go.'' 
   Finally, the 8-year-old boy shouted: ``I'm talking to you?'' Then, he curled up his fist and punched her. 
   Now, where did he learn that? 
   That prosecutor not only had a victim in her office. She had a future domestic violence abuser. 
   But states are not giving up on these kids. For example, in Pasco County, Florida the Sheriff's Office has developed a special program just to focus on the children in homes with domestic violence. 
   It's called KIDS, which stands for Kids in Domestic Situations. The sheriff hired four new detectives, a supervisor, and a clerk. They review every domestic violence call to see if a child lives in the home. They are specially trained to interview that child and get him or her the needed counseling--to break the cycle of violence. 
   Unfortunately, the abuse does not stop for women once they are divorced--particularly when the father uses the children to continue the harassment. All too often, Kids caught in the crossfire of a divorce and custody battle need safe havens. 
   One woman in Colorado had to confront her former husband and abuser at her son's soccer games--to exchange custody for the weekend. She had to endure continued mental and emotional abuse, putting herself in physical harms-way. Finally a visitation center opened. Now she drops off her son into the hands of trained staff in a secure environment. 
   In Hawaii, Violence Against Women Act funding has allowed officials to open three new visitation centers in the island's most rural counties. 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 adds new funding for safe havens for children to provide supervised visitation and safe visitation exchange in situations involving domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, or stalking. 
   Of course, there are also the battered women's shelters. Over the past five years, every State in this country has received funding to open new and expand existing shelters. Two thousand shelters in this country now benefit from this funding. 
   In my State of Delaware we have increased the number of shelters from two to five, including one solely for Hispanic women. 
   For as much as we've done, so much more is needed. Our bipartisan Biden-Hatch bill increases funding for tens of thousands of more shelter beds. It also establishes transitional housing services to help victims move from shelters back into the community. 
   And let's not forget the plight of battered immigrant women, caught between their desperate desire to flee their abusers and their desperate desire to remain in the United States. A young Mexican woman who married her husband at the age of 16 and moved to the United States suffered years of physical abuse and rape--she was literally locked in her own home like a prisoner. Her husband threatened deportation if she ever told police or left the house. When she finally escaped to the Houston Area Women's Center in Texas, she was near death. 
   That shelter gave her a safe place to live, and provided her the legal services she needed to become a citizens and get a divorce. 
   Our bipartisan bill expands upon the protections for battered immigrant women. 
   Thanks to nurses and emergency room doctors across this country--we have made great strides in helping victims who show up at the emergency room, claiming they ran into a door or fell down the stairs. 
   The Kentucky General Assembly has made it mandatory for health professionals in emergency rooms to receive three hours of domestic violence training. 
   The National Hospital Accreditation Board is encouraging all hospitals to follow Kentucky's lead. 
   The SANE program, sexual assault nurse examiners, are truly angels to victims. They are specially trained to work with police to collect needed evidence in a way that is sensitive and comforting to victims. 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 facilitates these efforts by ensuring that STOP grants can be used for training on how to conduct rape exams and how to collect, preserve, and analyze the evidence for trial. 
   Finally, I am very pleased to report, this legislation expands grants under the Violence Against Women Act to states, local governments, tribal governments, and universities to cover violence that arises in dating relationships. Hopefully, this important change will help prevent tragedies like the death of Cassie Diehl, a 17-year-old high school senior from Idaho, killed by a boyfriend who left her for dead after the truck he was driving plunged 400 feet of a mountain road. 
   What is especially tragic about this story is the great lengths to which Cassie's parents went, before her death,  to seek help from local law enforcement agencies and local prosecutors in putting an end to the boyfriend's constant abuse of their child, even seeking a protection order from a judge. All of these efforts failed because Cassie was a teenager involved in an abusive dating relationship. Law enforcement officials believed that because Cassie was a 17-year-old high school student living at home she could not be abused by a boyfriend, that she was not entitled to protection under the law. 
   The legislation we will vote on today will help avoid future horror stories like Cassie's by providing training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors to better identify and respond to violence that arises in dating relationships and by expanding victim services programs to reach these frequently young victims. 
   Thanks in part to the landmark law we passed in 1994, violence against women is no longer regarded as a private misfortune, but is recognized as the serious crime and public disgrace that it is. We have made great strides to putting an end to the days when victims are victimized twice--first by their abuser, then by the emergency response and criminal justice systems. We are making headway. 
   I have given you plenty of examples, but there are hundreds more. 
   In addition to the battered women's shelters, the STOP grants, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and other grant programs I have mentioned, the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of 2000 reauthorizes for five years the Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement grants, campus grants, the rape prevention and education grant program, and three victims of child abuse programs, including the court-appointed special advocate program (CASA). 
   So, let us act now to pass the Biden-Hatch bill. 
   There is one thing missing, I must point out, from this legislation. Unfortunately, the conference report does not extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund that would guarantee the funding for another five years--so that these innovative, effective projects can continue. 
   I believe that extending the trust fund is critical. Remember, none of this costs a single dime in new taxes. It's all paid for by reducing the federal government by some 300,000 employees. The paycheck that was going to a bureaucrat is now going into the trust fund. So I will continue to work to extend the trust fund to ensure that these programs actually receive the funding we have authorized. 
   Let me just close by saying that it has been a tough fight over the past 22 months to get my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to focus on the need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. But we have finally done it. 
   I greatly appreciate the support, daily phone calls, letters, and e-mails of so many groups--who are the real reason we have been able to get this done this year. The National Association of Attorneys General, every law enforcement organization, all the many women's groups, the National and 50 individual State Coalitions Against Domestic Violence, the American Medical Association, the National Governors Association, nurses, the list goes on and on--more than 150 groups total. 
   If you'll allow me one more point of personal privilege, this act--the Violence Against Women Act--is my single greatest legislative accomplishment in my nearly 28 years in the United States Senate. 
   Why? Because just from the few examples provided above--it's having a real impact in the lives of tens of thousands of women and children. You see it and hear the stories when you're back home. 
   So let us today pass the bipartisan Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act now, and renew our national commitment to end domestic violence. 
   Mr. President, I am happy now to yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that. The beginning of my comments was a polite way of apologizing for my being so persistent. I have been here 28 years. I have never threatened a filibuster. I have never threatened to hold up legislation. I have never once stopped the business on the floor--not that that is not every Senator's right. I have never done that. I care so much about this legislation that I was prepared to do whatever it would take. I apologize for being so pushy about it. But there is nothing I have done in 28 years that I feel more strongly about than this. I apologize to my friends for my being so persistent.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we will not have the opportunity to vote today on the merits of Aimee's Law, but instead, on a jurisdictional issue regarding whether the bill was properly included in the Sex Trafficking Conference Report. Because I believe the jurisdictional objection is unfounded and I am unwilling to jeopardize the passage of the other significant pieces of legislation included in the Conference Report--most importantly, the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women  Act of 2000--I will vote against Senator THOMPSON's point of order. 
   I supported a similar version of Aimee's Law in the form of an amendment to the Juvenile Justice bill last year. Upon reflection, however, I believe that my support was misplaced. I am troubled by this legislation from both a practical and a constitutional perspective. 
   Aimee's Law requires the Attorney General, in any case in which a State convicts an individual of murder, rape, or a dangerous sexual offense, when that individual has a prior conviction for any one or more of those offenses in another State, to transfer federal law enforcement assistance funds that have been allocated to the first State in an amount equal to the costs of incarceration, prosecution, and apprehension of that individual, to the second State. The bill contains a ``safe harbor'' exempting from this substantial penalty those States in which No. 1 the individual offender at issue has served 85 percent or more of his term of imprisonment, and No. 2 the average term of imprisonment imposed by the State for the prior offense at issue is at or above the average term of imprisonment imposed for that offense in all States. 
   As a practical matter, this bill can only promote a ``race to the top,'' as States feel compelled to ratchet up their sentences--not necessarily because they view such a shift as desirable public policy--but in order to avoid losing crucial federal law enforcement funds. Ironically, those States that are apt to benefit most from federal law enforcement assistance may well be those with the poorest record of keeping dangerous offenders behind bars, the same States likely to lose these valuable crime-fighting funds. Nor can States readily assess where they stand relative to other States since they are always striving to hit a moving target and maintain sentences at or above an elusive average of all state sentences for various qualifying offenses. 
   The law also will spawn an administrative nightmare for the Attorney General, who is charged under the legislation with the responsibility of constantly tabulating and retabulating the average sentences across the nation for a host of different serious offenses, as well as with the responsibility of keeping track of which State's federal funds should be reallocated to which other States every time a released offender commits another qualifying crime. The law even requires the Attorney General to consult with the governors of those States with federal funds at risk to establish a payment schedule. It's no wonder that the nation's governors so strongly oppose this law. 
   As a constitutional matter, I have grave concerns about Aimee's Law's seeming disregard of basic principles of federalism. Congress's spending authority is undeniably broad. But I have serious reservations about the wisdom and constitutionality of a law that, instead of clearly conditioning a federal grant upon a State's performance of a specific and clearly stated task, penalizes a State for conduct that occurs after the fact and that is not entirely within the State's control--the offender's commission of another serious crime in another State. In this sense, Aimee's Law is far more onerous and far less respectful of fundamental principles of federal-state comity than a straightforward law conditioning federal spending upon the States' adoption of more stringent sentencing laws--the likely result of this legislation. In a climate in which the U.S. Supreme Court is quick to strike down Acts of Congress that, in the Court's view, infringe upon the States' prerogatives, Aimee's Law, I fear, presents an all too inviting target and needlessly risks creating bad precedent regarding the scope of Congress's spending authority. 
   It is my hope that Congress and the President will monitor the operation of this law and revisit it if necessary.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have had many debates on the floor of the Senate, genuinely heartfelt debates about the role of the United States of America in the world and the use of American force in the world. 
   We have had a split in this body between the parties, and within the parties, about whether or not it is appropriate for the United States to take a leadership role in Europe, including, on occasion, the use of force to promote our national interest and that of our allies. 
   There are several political cancers that exist in various parts of the world. And the one remaining cancer on the continent of Europe--the primary one--is Slobodan Milosevic. 
   I suggest that we all take a lesson from what is going on now in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia--in Serbia. Many of us, Democrat and Republican, have argued--myself; Senator MCCAIN; Senator LIEBERMAN; Senator Dole, when he was here--that the United States had an obligation, in its own self-interest and in the interest of our allies, and in the interest of humanity, to intervene, to stop the genocide and the ethnic cleansing that was being perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic's vile nationalism. 
   I have been arguing for some time now that, absent our involvement in that region of the world, there would be chaos in, if not the heart, then the belly of Europe, and that if we acted with dispatch--swiftly and with resolve, and a willingness not to back away--Slobodan Milosevic, as with most thugs, would be stopped and would be eliminated. 
   Some have said on this floor, and some will say in the various Presidential and Senatorial and House campaigns that are going on, that we did not have an exit strategy when we committed American forces in Kosovo or American forces in Bosnia. Some will say that we have not succeeded because all is not tranquil, and if we were to withdraw American forces, things would revert to the chaos that existed before, and that this serves as proof that what we had done had not worked. The press and others declared early on in the bombing campaign in Kosovo--3 days into the 70-some day campaign--that it was a failure. 
   I am told, time and again, by some of my colleagues on the floor and I have read some pundits who state that, in fact, the American people are not patient, that they want instant results. 
   I say this. The end of Slobodan Milosevic is evidence of a number of things. One, our involvement was not only positive and good and successful, it was absolutely necessary. Without the leadership of the United States of America, I respectfully suggest our European allies would not have been as aggressive, they would not have been as united, and they would not have been as resolved. 
   Second, I hope we take a lesson from this as well to demonstrate that the American people have a great deal more patience and wisdom than we give them credit for. I have not heard, nor have I heard anyone else tell me that, while they have been home in the last 4 years, they have been told, as they walked from the grocery store, or to the drugstore, or home, that it is urgent we withdraw American forces from the Balkans. 
   Quite frankly, the opposite has occurred. The American people intuitively knew this was a place where wars have started before, this was a place where if chaos reigned it could not be contained, this was a place where a man such as Slobodan Milosevic could do nothing but ultimately harm the interest of Europe  and the United States. They were resolved, and they are resolved, to keep American forces in that area to maintain the peace and security of the region, along with our allies. 
   I might add, parenthetically, that we make up only, roughly, 7,000 of the nearly 41,000 troops that are in Kosovo, and that, in fact, we are doing the Lord's work there. It is kind of 
   interesting that, in the six or seven trips I have made to the region--the last one being a trip to Kosovo--after I came back I remember having discussions here on the floor, and I would hear about how down the morale was of the American forces and how circumspect they were about whether we should be involved. 
   That is not what I found, whether it was at Camp McGovern in Bosnia several years ago or at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo last year. What I found was that these young women and men knew exactly why they were there. They knew why they were there. They did not have to be told. And they felt good about it. They knew they were doing the Lord's work. They understood. They understood there was a purpose and meaning for being there. All they had to do was ride through the streets and they understood it. It is interesting that the retention rate and reenlistment rate is higher for those who have been in Kosovo or Bosnia than for any other segment of the military. 
   So I would argue that what is happening in Yugoslavia now is making a lie of some of the assertions that were taken for granted around this place by a majority of the people on the floor, as well as a majority of the press, as well as a majority of the people who are so-called pundits. 
   This is the point I want to make. 
   We should not now, at this moment, change policy. Slobodan Milosevic is a war criminal. We should not, as former Secretary Eagleburger--a man for whom I have great respect--said yesterday on television, accommodate his departure from Serbia by winking and nodding and essentially letting him off the hook on the War Crimes Tribunal. We should not do that. 
   The newly elected President of Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, is a lot of things that are good. But his record shows that he is also a fierce nationalist. 
   We should lift sanctions, but only when Milosevic goes. But again, just a word of caution, we should not lift all sanctions until we are clear that the new leadership in Serbia, in Belgrade, will honor the Dayton accords and will not use force in Kosovo. This is no time to relent. None--none--of us should relent now. 
   We have been right so far. A steady course, firm hand, U.S. power, U.S. leadership, and U.S. resolve have brought us this far. Without it, none of what has happened would be, in fact, what the history books will write about 2, 5, 10, and 20 years from now. History will record that what we did was the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, and, even more importantly, in a Machiavellian sense, right for the national interests of the United States, and essential for any prospect of long-term peace and security in Europe. 
   I said a week ago that Milosevic could not be sustained, no matter what he did from this point on. The tides of history have moved. We saw it some years ago in Bulgaria. We saw it in Romania. We saw it occur again in Croatia. We saw it again in Bosnia. And we now see it in Serbia. For the first time in modern European history, there is a prospect--a serious prospect--that the Balkans will be integrated into Europe as a whole. 
   I can think of no more significant foreign policy initiative that this Government has taken since the Berlin Wall came down that has been so clearly vindicated--so clearly vindicated. So now is not the time to take an easy road out. Lift sanctions partially, make it clear to the Serbian people that we love them--our fight was never with them; they are a noble people--but I think we should have a steady hand. We are prevailing. The West is prevailing. Yugoslavia, in particular--most people refer to it as Serbia--is about to come into the light of day. We must not now send the wrong signal and let people in Serbia conclude that there is not a price to pay for those who violate, in a massive way, the human rights of their fellow citizens and that we expect the new government to behave in a way consistent with international norms. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are now in the midst of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and the air has been filled with new and sometimes confusing statistics, new treatment, new research advances, and ever-present warnings about the seriousness of this dreaded disease. 
   One aspect of this issue that is close to my heart is National Mammography Day--a day to increase awareness of how routine periodic mammography and early diagnosis of breast cancer are responsible for huge increases in the numbers of long-term survivors of this disease. 
   I note parenthetically that my wife started an organization in my State to increase awareness--it is named after her, not me--called the BIDEN Breast Health Initiative, where she and her group of advisers bring oncology nurses and oncologists into the local high schools throughout the State to make young women in high school aware of breast health examinations and self-examination because the key to survival is early detection. 
   Breast cancer is now an illness not to be feared as a death sentence but to be conquered commonly and routinely. This year, National Mammography Day, which I sponsored years ago, will occur on Friday, October 20. As in previous years, 
   the Senate has adopted a resolution that I introduced affirming this designation. 
   This year's National Mammography Day will see the beginning of a tremendous new advance in early detection of breast cancer--digital mammography. This new technique offers many advantages over standard film-based mammography. From the patient's point of view, the usual 40-minute examination time can be cut in half, and the exposure to radiation can be reduced in almost all instances. 
   For many women, the mammogram images with digital technology are considerably more precise. The digital technology makes it possible for the radiologist to manipulate the images and to zoom in on questionable areas, thus providing more accurate diagnosis in reducing the need for repeat examinations. 
   The digital technology does away with the cost and the disposal problems as well of x-ray film. 
   In addition, the retrieval of prior film for comparison with current images no longer require the time-consuming manual search through an x-ray room. 
   Finally, by switching to the digital approach, this new technique allows all future advances in digital computer technology to be applied directly to saving women from breast cancer. 
   It is impossible, in my view, to overstate the importance of this digital technique's adaptability to new technological advances. Those of us old enough to remember how the first personal computers were a huge advance over the slide rule are also aware of how the incredible subsequent advances in computer technology meant that those first PCs were now useful only as doorstops. I look forward to a similarly rapid advance in the new digital technology as it moves into the field of breast cancer diagnosis. 
   Digital mammography is a revolutionary technology that must be offered to seniors and disabled who obtain their medical care through Medicare. And it should be done as soon as possible. I strongly encourage the Health Care Financing Administration to evaluate this product expeditiously and to set appropriate payment rates under the Medicare program. 
   What I don't want to see happen--I realize this may seem somewhat premature--is that digital mammography is only available for those who are able to pay, while all those on Medicare or Medicaid, because the reimbursement cost is not sufficient to cover a digital mammography, will have to settle for what will prove to be an inferior test. The lives of many women who have yet to discover they have breast cancer may hang in the balance. 
   Therefore, I look forward to HCFA establishing a reasonable price at which reimbursement can be made under Medicare for those women on Medicare or Medicaid who seek a breast examination by use of digital mammography, the new emerging science, rather than one that is film based. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, section 303 of S. 2507, the Intelligence Authorization bill, as amended by the managers' amendment, establishes a new criminal offense for the unauthorized disclosure of properly classified information. Existing criminal statues generally require an intent to benefit a foreign power or are limited to disclosures of only some types of classified information. Administrative sanctions have constituted the penalty for most other leaks. 
   While I support the basic objective of this provision, we must ensure that it will not be used in a capricious manner or in a manner that harms our democratic institutions. 
   I see two respects in which some caution is merited. First, it could be applied to trivial cases. I believe that former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger once said that he told everything to his wife. If his discussions with his wife included classified information, he surely would have violated the letter of this bill. But so-called ``pillow talk'' to one's spouse is common, and I don't think we mean to throw people in jail for incidental talk to a person who has no intent either to use the classified information, to pass it on to others, or to publish it.

   Mr. BIDEN. My second concern is that section 303 not be used as a justification for investigations of journalists. Our republic depends upon a free press to inform the American people of significant issues, including issues relating to foreign policy and the national security. If a leak statute were to become a back door for bringing the investigate apparatus of the federal government to bear on the press, we would be sacrificing our democratic institutions for the sake of protecting a few secrets. Much as we are dedicated to the protection of classified information, that would be a terribly bad bargain.

   Mr. BIDEN. Section 305 of S. 32507, the Intelligence Authorization bill, provides, in brief, that no future ``Federal law . . . that implements a treaty or other international agreement shall be construed as making unlawful an otherwise lawful and authorized intelligence activity of the United States Government . . . unless such Federal law specifically addresses such intelligence activity.'' This provision is necessary, the Committee report explains, because ``[t]here has been a concern that future legislation implementing international agreements  could be interpreted, absent the enactment of section 305, as restricting intelligence activities that are otherwise entirely consistent with U.S. law and policy.'' The concern arises from an opinion issued in 1994 by the Office of Legal Council (OLC) of the Department of Justice. In that opinion, the Office interpreted the Aircraft Sabotage Act of 1984--a law implementing an international treaty on civil aviation safety--as applying to government personnel. Although the OLC opinion emphasized that its conclusions should ``not be exaggerated'' and also warned that its opinion ``should not be understood to mean that other domestic criminal statutes apply to U[nited S[tates] G[overnment] personnel acting officially,'' the Central Intelligence Agency, out of an abundance of caution, wants to avoid cases in which legislation implementing a treaty might criminalize an authorized intelligence activity even though Congress did not so expressly provide. I understand the Agency's concern that clarity for its agents is important. At the same time, however, we should take care to specify how section 305 is intended to work. 
   One question is this: how do we tell when a Federal law actually ``implements a treaty or other international agreement?'' My working assumption, in supporting section 305, is that we will be able to tell whether a future law ``implements a treaty or other international agreement'' by reading the law and the committee reports that accompany its passage. If the text of that future law or of the committee reports accompanying that bill states that the statute is intended to implement a treaty or other international agreement, then section 305 is pertinent to that statute. If there is no mention of such intent in that future law or in its accompanying reports, however, then we may safely infer that section 305 does not apply. Is that the understanding of the Select Committee on Intelligence, as well?

   Mr. BIDEN. another question is how to tell that a U.S. intelligence activity ``is authorized by an appropriate official of the United States Government, acting within the scope of the official duties of that official and in compliance with Federal law and any applicable Presidential directive.'' I am concerned that this could be misinterpreted to mean that some intelligence bureaucrat could authorize some otherwise illegal activity with a wink and a nod. It is not the intent of the Select Committee on Intelligence that there be written authorization for a U.S. intelligence activity?

   Mr. BIDEN. My final question to the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence relates to how other countries may view section 305. I interpret section 305 as governing only the interpretation of a certain set of U.S. criminal laws enacted in the future and whether those laws apply to government officials. Is that also the understanding of the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence?

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor for the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1999, which would authorize and expand the programs first set up under the Older Americans Act of 1965. 
   The Older Americans Act authorizes a series of absolutely essential services for our country's seniors. Among others, the Act provides nutrition services, legal assistance, disease promotion, elder abuse prevention, employment assistance, and numerous informational programs, including the long-term care ombudsmen. There is hardly a senior in this country that is not touched, directly or indirectly, by one or more of the provisions of the Older Americans Act. These programs have become an integral part of the infrastructure that helps keep our most experienced citizens vital and constructive members of society. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill includes a much-needed new service, the National Family Caregivers Program. The major medical advances of the past 50 years have led not only to an overall aging of the population but also to an increasing proportion of the elderly who are living with chronic diseases and disabilities. Many of these infirm elderly are cared for at home, putting a severe financial and emotional strain on family caregivers. This new program will provide such caregivers with a panoply of assistive services, including provision of information, assistance with access, counseling and training, respite care, and other supplemental services (home care, personal care, adult day care). 
   It is absolutely essential to assist caregivers as much as possible in order to allow our infirm seniors to maintain their autonomy and sense of self-worth, to permit them to live in the company of their loved ones and in the least restrictive environment compatible with their needs. This is what our seniors fervently desire and it is the right thing to do; the likelihood that such programs will save the government money in the long run is an added bonus. 
   There is little time left in this session of Congress, and there are many things that must be finished before adjournment. Yet as we struggle with our workload, I hope we can take a few minutes to find a way to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments this year, on behalf of all of our older loved ones.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend from Ohio, Senator VOINOVICH, and other colleagues in co-sponsoring a Sense of the Senate Resolution regarding the recent elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), including advocating the resumption of economic assistance, once democracy is restored in that country. 
   The Voinovich-Biden resolution congratulates the people of the FRY for their courage in participating in the September 24, 2000 elections; applauds the clear decision of the people of the FRY to embrace democracy, the rule of law, and integration into the international community by rejecting dictatorship and isolationism; reasserts the strong desire of the Senate to reestablish the historic friendship between the American and Serbian peoples; and expresses its intention to support a comprehensive assistance program for the FRY to speed its economic recovery and European integration and access to international financial institutions, once a democratic government that respects the rule of law, human rights, and a market economy is established. 
   Slobodan Milosevic, one of the most despicable individuals I have ever met, is on the ropes. Even as we meet here today, tens of thousands of brave men and women are refusing to work and instead are demonstrating in the streets of cities throughout Yugoslavia for Milosevic to honor the results of last month's elections. The democratic opposition has called for people to stage a massive rally in Belgrade on Thursday, October 5, in a final push to drive Milosevic from power. 
   The Voinovich-Biden resolution, Mr. President, puts the United States Senate on record on the side of the people of Yugoslavia and its largest nationality, the Serbs, against Milosevic's tyranny. 
   As I have said several times on this floor, for the last decade our quarrel has never been with the Serbian people, who were allies of the United States in two world wars in the twentieth century. Vojislav Kostunica, whose victory in last month's elections Milosevic and his cronies tried to steal and are now trying to deny, is an honest man who should be given a chance to cooperate with the Western democracies. 
   The Voinovich-Biden resolution is a signal to all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the path to their country's rejoining the international community, and thereby to restoring their shattered economy, is to honor the results of the elections by immediately and formally installing Mr. Kostunica as President.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend Senator HAGEL in introducing the Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger Improvement Act of 2000. 
   The challenge facing developing nations whose people live in hunger today is no longer just how to increase food production. As we enter the new millennium, those countries must also confront the problems of inadequate income, lack of access to markets for both producers and consumers, and unsustainable natural resource management practices. 
   One of the keys to all these issues must be a new, more productive relationship between educational institutions--here in the U.S. and in the affected countries--and their private partners involved in agricultural development. In short, they must become part of the new, higher-tech, international agricultural economy. This bill, an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act, is designed to move us in that direction. 
   Mr. President, when delegates from around the world gathered in Rome in 1996 for the World Food Summit, they pledged to reduce by half the number of people suffering from hunger by the year 2015. At that time the number of hungry people was estimated to be between 830 and 840 million. Now, four years later, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that there are 790 million people in the developing world who do not get enough the eat each day. This is positive news, but it is painfully evident that more needs to be done. 
   Title XII of the FAA, Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger, was written in 1975, at a time when there was a significant level of famine and hunger in the world. Its aim was to involve U.S. universities in the fight to increase food production. Mr. President, that mission has achieved a large degree of success. It is time to go beyond the basic issue of production, to take on the further challenges of increasing access to markets, improving shipping and storage, promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture, and turning farming in developing nations from a subsistence activity into a source of income.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. As I indicated to the majority leader, this may be a unique bill not unlike the one my friend, the Presiding Officer, has on sex trafficking on which he has worked so hard. This doesn't even have those problems. This has 415 Members of the House voting for it; 3 voting against it; 71 cosponsors in the Senate. I am willing to predict, if we can agree to bring it up without amendment, we will get 85 to 95 votes. This is in the category of a no brainer. HENRY HYDE is a sponsor of it. It is the Biden-Hatch bill. 
   The only point I make, and I will be brief, time is running out. The Violence Against Women Act expires this Sunday, September 30. It took me 8 years to get this thing done. It took 3 years after it was written just to get it considered. It took that long to get it passed. It has been in place for 5 years. There are no additional taxes required to pay for this bill because there is a trust fund that uses the salaries that were being paid to Federal officials who no longer work for the Federal Government; it goes into that fund. 
   As I said, if there was ever a no brainer, this one is it. Democrats like it; Republicans like it. As Senator Herman Talmadge from Georgia, said to me one night regarding another issue when I walked into the Senate dining room: What's the problem, JOE? I guess I looked down. He was chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I said: I'm having problems with such and such an issue. He said: What is the problem, son? I repeated; I thought he didn't hear me. He said: No, you don't understand. Republicans like it; Democrats like it. So just go and do it. 
   Well, that is where we are tonight. Democrats like the bill; Republicans like the bill; the House likes the bill; the Senate likes the bill; women like the bill; men like the bill, business likes the bill; labor likes the bill. So why don't we have the bill? And I have been hollering about this for 2 years now. 
   Hopefully, in light of what the majority leader said, maybe we will get to it. I was beginning to get a little despondent. I was even thinking of attaching the bill to the Presiding Officer's bill to make sure we get it done. 
   Today the Washington Post, in an editorial entitled ``Inexplicable Neglect,'' noted: ``There seems to be no good reason, practical or substantive, to oppose the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.''

   Mr. BIDEN. The act of 1994 signaled the beginning of a national--and, I argue, historic--commitment to women and children in this country victimized by family violence and sexual assault. 
   The act is making a real difference in the lives of millions of women. The legislation changed our laws, strengthened criminal penalties, and facilitated enforcement of protection orders. 
   I see my friend from California is here. When she was in the House of Representatives, she was one of the few people, man or woman, on either side that fought for 2 years to get this passed. I say to the Senator, the majority leader indicated he plans on making sure that this gets voted on this year. ``This year'' means the next couple of days or weeks. He says he wants to attach it to another bill. 
   I have been making the case, I say to my friend from California, that based on the vote in the House, 415-3 and 71 Senators cosponsoring the Biden-Hatch bill here in the Senate, we should bring this up free-standing. I was presumptuous enough to speak for you and others and say we would agree to a 5-minute time agreement on the bill.

   Mr. BIDEN. In response to the question of the Senator, I fully agree with her. I indicated that to the majority leader. To give the majority leader the benefit of the doubt, which I am prepared to do, I am not sure he understands how much support this has. When I indicated it should be freestanding, he cited other bills he thought were going to go through and they didn't go through and that was what he was worried about. 
   He had to leave here necessarily and so didn't hear my response, which is, this is not like any other bill. I have not heard of any problem. If any staff is listening--staffs of all one hundred Senators listen to proceedings. They are assigned to listen to them. I ask anybody in the Senate who has any problem with the Biden-Hatch bill to please come and let us know, to debate it. I do not know anybody who is even willing to debate it, to say they are not for it. 
   I would be dumbfounded, when in fact we bring this up, if we bring it up freestanding, if it didn't get everyone in the Senate voting for it. I would be astounded if it got fewer than 85 or 90  votes. I would not at all be surprised if it got 100 votes. But I am not sure the majority leader understands that. 
   Frankly, what the Senator from California and I could do with Senators HATCH and SPECTER and others who are supportive of this bill--maybe we can go see the majority leader tomorrow and lay out for him why we are so certain he will not get himself in a traffic jam if he brings this bill up and why he doesn't need to attach it to anything else.

The thing I am most proud of is that it has become a national consensus. It is not a Democratic issue; it is not a Republican issue; it is not a women's issue, not a men's issue. We have taken that dirty little secret of domestic violence out of the closet.

   As the Senator well knows, the hotline that she and Senator KENNEDY, Senator SPECTER, and others have worked so hard to put in place, that hotline has received literally hundreds of thousands of calls--300,000 all told--tens of thousands of calls over the years since we passed this, saying: Help me, help me. I am trapped. 
   I say to men who say: Gee, whiz, why don't women just walk away; Why don't they just walk away from this abuse they get; There are a lot of reasons they don't, from being physically intimidated, to being psychologically intimidated, to having no place to go and no financial resources.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. President, I will not go through the whole of my statement. Let me just make a few other points. 
   I must say I compliment the Chair for his work and his, not only intellectual dedication but, it seems to me, passionate commitment to do something about the international sex trafficking occurs. This is a women's issue internationally. 
   I suspect he feels the same way I feel about this legislation. I suspect he believes there is probably not much more that he has done that is as tangible and might affect the lives of people, that you could look to, you could count, you could touch, you could see. When I said there are a lot of calls, literally over half a million women, over 500,000 women have picked up the phone and called, probably huddled in the dark in the corner of their closet or their room, hoping their husband or significant other is not around, and said in a whisper, ``Help me, help me''--given their name and address and said, ``Help me.'' 
   Think of that. Think of that. A half a million women have picked up the phone. How many more have not picked up the phone? 
   The thing we should be aware of--and I know the Chair knows this--it is counterintuitive to think a child who watches his mother being beaten to a pulp would then beat his wife or girlfriend later. That is counterintuitive. Wouldn't you think that would be the last thing a child would do? But the psychologists tell us it is the first thing. They learn violence is a readily available and acceptable means of resolving power disputes. 
   You know, as the Chair I am sure knows--I am not being solicitous because of his work in this generic field--about 60 percent of the people in prison today have been abused or were in families where they witnessed abuse. 
   This is not rocket science. I hope we get on with it. 
   There are a few things I want to mention. This bill does not merely reauthorize what we have done. I made a commitment, when I wrote this bill and we finally got it passed as part of the Biden crime bill, that I would go back and look at it--and others have, too, but personally since I was so involved in it--and the parts that were working I would try to beef up; the parts that were weak and did not make sense, I would jettison. In the reauthorization, I would get rid of them. 
   I hope my colleagues will see we have kept that commitment. We take the parts we found were lacking in our first bill and we, in fact, beefed them up. We kept the police training, the court training, and all those issues. We kept the violent crime reduction trust fund which, by the way, gets about $6.1 billion a year from paychecks that are not going to Federal employees anymore and go into this trust fund. It trains attorneys general and the rest. 
   What it does beyond all it has already been doing is it provides for transitional housing for women. We have over 300,000, in large part thanks to Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania, who has been so dedicated in his appropriations subcommittee to this. We have built all these new shelters. We do not send women to shantytowns. This is decent housing with anonymity, giving them an opportunity to get out from under the male fist abusing them, and they can bring their children with them. 
   Seventy percent of children on the street are homeless because their mothers are on the street, a victim of domestic violence. We realized there is a gap here because there are so many women knocking down the door to get into these shelters to get out of abusive circumstances. We can only keep them there for 30 days, 60 days, sometimes longer. They cannot go back home because their husband has either trashed the home or tried to sell the home or they have to move back in with the husband. We tried to find some transitional housing that takes them down the road for the next couple of years and gives them some hope. 
   We also beef up cross-State protection orders. For example: God forbid there is a woman staffer in ear shot and she lives in Virginia or Maryland or a nearby State and she went to the court and said: Look, my husband or my boyfriend or this man has harassed me or beaten me, and I want him to  stay away from me. The court issues what they call stay-away orders, victim protection orders. 
   That woman may work in the District of Columbia. Now she crosses the line from Virginia or Maryland into D.C., and she gets harassed. The man violates the order, and she goes to a D.C. cop or D.C. court. They do not have any record of it. There is no record or they do not honor it. I am not talking about D.C. particularly. One State does not honor another State. 
   What we have done is beefed up the requirement that States honor these stay-away orders when women cross the line, literally cross a State line, cross a jurisdictional line. 
   There is a very well-known reporter at the Washington Post--although he has written about this, I am not going to take the liberty of using his name without his permission. His daughter was in a similar situation in Massachusetts. She was abused by someone. A stay-away order was issued. She was in Massachusetts. She was in a different county. The man, in fact, violated the order. They went into a local court. The 
   local court, because there were not computerized records, did not know there was a State stay-away order. 
   By the way, the stay-away order says if you violate the order, you go to jail. If a man follows a woman into a different jurisdiction and the jurisdiction knows that order exists and he violates the order, they can arrest him and send him to jail on the spot because it is part of the probation, in effect, to stay away. It is part of the sentence, if you will; not literally a sentence. They can put him in jail. 
   George's daughter said: This guy has an order. He is not supposed to be near me. 
   The judge said: We have no record of that order because they are not computerized for interchange of these records. 
   They walked outside the courtroom, and this man shot her dead. He shot dead on the spot the daughter of this famous Washington reporter because there was not the honoring, even within the State, of these orders. We beefed that up. 
   By the way, in my State of Delaware, which has a relatively low murder rate, 60 percent of all the people murdered in the last 2 years were women murdered by their husband or their boyfriend. Did my colleagues hear what I just said? Murdered by their husband or boyfriend. The vast majority of women who are murdered in America are murdered by a significant other or their husband. This is not a game. 
   We are now in a position where there is, in fact, no authorization for the continuation of this law for which we worked so hard. Come October 1, which is what, how many days? Today is the 26th. The point is, in less than a week, this law is out of business. 
   I have much more to say about this, but I will not take the time of the Senate now. I am encouraged, I am heartened by what the House did. I am encouraged by what Senator LOTT said to me today on the floor, and I look forward to the opportunity to convince the leader to bring this up in whatever form that will allow us to pass it because, again, this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This literally affects the lives of thousands and thousands of women.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on another matter which relates to another form of human rights, I wish to speak to the legislation we are going to bring up tomorrow, the Serbian Democratization Act of 2000. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation. I am told that tomorrow we are going to get a chance to deal with this issue. 
   As everyone knows, Slobodan Milosevic is on the ropes. Despite Milosevic's massive systematic effort to steal Sunday's Yugoslav Presidential election, his state election commission had to admit that the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won at least the plurality of the votes already counted; 48.22 percent to be exact. 
   According to opposition poll watchers, Kostunica in all probability actually won about 55 percent of the vote, which would have obviated the need for a two-candidate second-round runoff with Milosevic, which now seems likely. 
   It is still unclear whether the democratic opposition will go along with this semi-rigged, desperation plan of Milosevic's to hang on by rigging the runoff. Even if Milosevic loses the runoff and is forced to recognize the results of the election, he may still attempt to hold on to the levers of power through his control of the federal parliament and of the Socialist Party with its network of political cronies and corrupt businessmen. 
   He may use the classic tactic of provoking a foreign crisis by trying to unseat the democratically elected, pro-Western government in Montenegro, a move I warned against on this floor several months ago. 
   We will have to wait and see for a few days before knowing exactly how the situation in Yugoslavia is going to develop, but there is no doubt whatsoever as to who the primary villain in this drama is. It was, it is, and it continues to be Slobodan Milosevic, one of the most despicable men I have personally met, and, as everyone in this Chamber knows, a man who has been indicted by The Hague Tribunal for war crimes and is the chief obstacle to peace and stability in the Balkans. 
   Therefore, it should be--and has been--a primary goal of U.S. foreign policy to isolate Milosevic and his cronies, and to assist the Serbian democratic opposition in toppling him. 
   Earlier this year, with this goal in mind, the Serbian Democratization Act of 2000 was drafted in a bipartisan effort. It is particularly timely that the Senate consider this legislation tomorrow, precisely at the moment when the Serbian people have courageously voted against Milosevic's tyranny that has so thoroughly ruined their country during the last decade. 
   I would like to review the main provisions of the legislation we will be voting on tomorrow and then propose alternative strategies for our relations with Serbia, depending upon the outcome of the elections. 
   The act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing $50 million for fiscal year 2001 to promote democracy and civil society in Serbia and $55 million to assist the Government of Montenegro in its ongoing political and economic reform efforts. It also authorizes increasing Voice of America and Radio Free Europe broadcasting to Yugoslavia in both the Serbo-Croatian and Albanian languages. 
   Second, the act prescribes assistance to the victims of Serbian oppression by authorizing the President of the United States to use authorities in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide humanitarian assistance to individuals living in Kosovo for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, and to refugees and persons displaced by the conflict. 
   Third, the act we will vote on tomorrow codifies the so-called ``outer wall'' of sanctions by multilateral organizations, including the international financial institutions. 
   I talked about this with Senator VOINOVICH of Ohio, and we agreed that we have to give the President more flexibility in this area. 
   Fourth, it authorizes other measures against Yugoslavia, including blocking Yugoslavia's assets in the United States; prohibits the issuance of visas and admission into the United States of any alien who holds a position in the senior leadership of the Government of Yugoslavia of Slobodan Milosevic or the Government of Serbia and to members of their families; and prohibits strategic exports to Yugoslavia, on private loans and investments and on military-to-military cooperation. 
   The act also grants exceptions on export restrictions for humanitarian assistance to Kosovo and on visa prohibitions to senior officials of the Government of Montenegro, unless that Government changes its current policy of respect for international norms. 
   The act contains a national interest waiver for the President. The President may also waive the act's provision if he certifies that ``significant progress has been made in Yugoslavia in establishing a government based upon democratic principles and the rule of law, and that respects internationally recognized human rights.'' 
   Clearly, if the democratic opposition triumphs in the current elections, the chances will increase dramatically that the President will exercise this waiver option.  
   We, the Congress, are saying to the people of Serbia that they are our friends, not our enemies. It is their Government, it is Slobodan Milosevic that is the problem, not the Serbian people. 
   Today in the Committee on Foreign Relations, we discussed at length with Madeleine Albright what we should be doing about Serbia. I have discussed it as well with Senator VOINOVICH. 
   I see the Senator from Iowa is on the floor. He may be here for other reasons, but I know his keen interest in Serbia, the Serbian people, and the need for us to render assistance if they, in fact, move in the direction of democracy. 
   The act calls for Serbia to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
   It also contains two important Sense of the Congress provisions. The first is that the President should condemn the harassment, threats, and intimidation against any ethnic group in Yugoslavia, but in particular against such persecution of the ethnic Hungarian minority in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. 
   The second voices support for a fair and equitable disposition of the ownership and use of the former Yugoslavia's diplomatic and consular properties in the United States. 
   Finally, in a move to facilitate the transition to democracy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Congress authorizes the President to furnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that a post-Milosevic Government of Yugoslavia is ``committed to democratic principles and the rule of law, and that respects internationally recognized human rights.'' 
   Mr. President, the Serbia Democratization Act offers the President ample flexibility in dealing with Serbia. If Milosevic should succeed in frustrating the will of the Serbian people by stealing this election, the act will give the President of the United States a complete kit of peaceful tools to continue to try to undermine his oppressive regime. 
   If, on the other hand, the democratic opposition led by Mr. Kostunica manages to make its electoral victory stick, then the final provision of the act becomes the operative one in which we open up the spigot of increased assistance to a democratic Serbia. Obviously, this would be the preferred option. 
   Unfortunately, however, foreign policy is rarely so black and white. The apparent winner of the election, Mr. Kostunica, is vastly preferable to Milosevic, but this may be a case of damning by faint praise. As many of my colleagues have heard me say on other occasions, I met Milosevic in Belgrade during the Bosnian war and called him a war criminal to his face. Not only is he a war criminal, but he is thoroughly corrupt and anti-democratic. 
   Mr. Kostunica, by all accounts, is honest and democratic, a dissident in Communist times and a man with a reputation for probity. He seems, however, to represent a democratic, honest variant of a rather extreme Serbian nationalism. 
   His language describing NATO's Operation Allied Force has been strident. Like Milosevic--and most other Serbian politicians--he calls for the return of Kosovo to Belgrade's rule. But I am prepared to have an open mind on what he said. I can understand why, in running for President, being labeled by Mr. Milosevic as the ``dupe of the West'' and ``a puppet of the United States,'' he would feel the need to openly condemn the United States. 
   I also do not have a problem with the fact that he may have used tough language with regard to Kosovo. There is a difference between words and his actions. So I will have great problems with him if, in fact, he tries to again suppress the Kosovars, who, if he comes to power will probably increase their agitation for independence. 
   Moreover, Kostunica has repeatedly said that if he is elected he would refuse to hand over The Hague those Serbs indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal. 
   To a large extent Kostunica's criticism of Milosevic's policies toward non-Serbs in the old Yugoslavia--Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks, and Kosovars--is that those policies resulted in four failed wars. There is no indication, for example, that Kostunica would cut off Belgrade's support for the radical Bosnian Serbs who on a daily basis are trying to undermine the Dayton Agreement. 
   Of course, as I have indicated earlier, Kostunica's policies must be seen in the context of an electoral campaign. Nonetheless, they do reflect what the traffic will bear. In other words, they reflect his view of contemporary Serbian society. 
   During the Bosnian war and after it, I often stated publicly that in my opinion Croatian President Franjo Tudjman was cut from the same cloth as Milosevic--an aggressive, anti-democratic leader. The only reason I advocated helping to rebuild his army was because, unlike Serbia, Croatia did not represent a major threat to the region. In fact, in the summer of 1995 the reorganized Croatian Army provided the Bosnian Army and the Bosnian Croat militia the support necessary to rout the Bosnian Serbs and bring all parties to the negotiating table. 
   Since Tudjman's death, Croatia has proven that beneath the surface of Tudjman's authoritarianism a genuine, Western-style democratic body politic survived. The newly elected government of President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivica Racan has utilized this mandate not only to enact domestic democratic reforms, but also to cut off support for the radical Herzegovina Croats who have done everything in their power to undo Dayton. The government has also taken the much less popular step of handing over to The Hague Tribunal several high-ranking Croats who were indicted for alleged war crimes. 
   The United States has a great deal invested in a democratic, multiethnic Bosnia, and if Serbia and the rest of the world is lucky enough to be rid of Slobodan Milosevic, we should not give him an ex post facto victory by applying a looser standard of behavior on his successor than we have to Tudjman's successors in Croatia. To be blunt: respect for Dayton and cooperation with The Hague Tribunal must be litmus tests for any democratic government in Serbia. 
   I fervently hope that Mr. Kostunica emerges victorious in the Yugoslav elections. If he does, the United States should immediately extend to him a sincere hand of friendship, with the assistance outlined in the pending legislation. 
   We should make clear to him that if he chooses to cooperate with us, a ``win-win'' situation would result, with tangible benefits for the long-suffering and isolated Serbian people who, we should never forget, were this country's allies in two world wars during the twentieth century. 
   If, on the other hand, Mr. Kostunica comes to power and thinks that his undeniable and praiseworthy democratic credentials will enable him to pursue an aggressive Serbian nationalist policy with a kinder face, then we must disabuse him of this notion. 
   Should our West European allies choose to embrace a post-Milosevic, democratically elected, but ultra-nationalistic Serbia, then I would say to them ``good luck; we'll concentrate our policy in the former Yugoslavia on preparing democratic and prosperous Slovenia for the next round of NATO enlargement, on continuing to help reconstruct Bosnia and Kosovo, and on supporting the democratic governments in Macedonia, Croatia, and Montenegro.'' 
   Mr. President, the long-frozen, icy situation in Serbia appears finally to be breaking up. I genuinely hope that Serbia is on the verge of democracy. I urge my colleagues to support the Serbia Democratization Act of 2000 in order to enable our government peacefully to deal with any eventuality in that country.

   Mr. BIDEN. In response to my friend, the answer is absolutely yes. I will tell him that because I was the one who authored that act. The President was very gracious in calling me and asking me who I would like to see be the one to oversee that office. I recommended one, and only one person, the former attorney general of the State of Iowa who helped me write the act in the first instance, Bonnie Campbell. 
   I cannot tell you how disappointed, dismayed, and angry, quite frankly, I have been, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, about the fact that--I will be blunt about it--our Republican colleagues in the committee and here will not allow this woman to have a vote on the floor of the Senate. The ABA rates her highly. As you said, everyone I know in the Midwest who knows her, everyone, Republican and Democrat, likes her. 
   I see my friend SLADE GORTON on the floor. He knows a little bit about the process of picking judges. I am confident he and others, as my other colleagues in this room, would agree that qualified judges should not be kept from being on the bench for politics. 
   People say: Well, this is the usual thing. We hold up these judges all the time near the end of a session when there is going to be a Presidential election. 
   That is flat malarkey. Ask the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, who is a good friend of mine. He and I are on opposite ends of the political spectrum. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. My friend from Iowa may remember this. We went into a caucus in the last 2 days when President Bush was the President of the United States. We were about to go out of session, as we say in the Senate, and adjourn sine die. What happened? We walked out onto the floor of the Senate. The Senator from Texas said he had several qualified judges in Texas, Republicans, and why were we holding them up. 
   I went to our caucus and said: We should pass those judges. Several in our caucus, two who are no longer here, said they opposed this. I said: Well, you are going to have to oppose me to do it. On the floor of the Senate, the last day, the last hour, the last session, we passed those Texas judges. 
   I will never forget, the reason I love him so much, the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM--who I kiddingly call ``Barbwire'' GRAMM; we kid each other--he walked up on the floor and put his hand out to me and he said: JOE, I want to thank you. You are one of the nicest guys here--that is not true--but he said: You are one of the nicest guys here. I want you to know one thing: I would never do it for you. 
   That is literally a true story, and he will repeat that story for you. The truth is, it is not good politics. It is not good justice. It is not good anything, just to hold up somebody. 
   By the way, it has been held up for a year. It is not as if they have held up this woman for the last 10 minutes, the last 10 days.

   Mr. BIDEN. This is in the waning hours. This last one, we were literally going out of session. I mean, we could have shut this place down easily and walked away and pretended to have a clear conscience and said: We have done the Nation's work. 
   To be fair about it, there were three members of our caucus who ripped me a new ear in the caucus for doing this, three of them. Two are gone; one is still around. No, we shouldn't do this. But this is an example of what happens. 
   I have been here since 1972. It started in October of the 1972 election. I wasn't here in the 1972 election. Then in the 1976 election, they started to hold up judges. They started holding up judges somewhere around September. And then it moved; by the 1980 election, they were being held up in July. This year, our Republican friends started 18 months ago to hold these folks up. 
   This is what I am worried is going to happen, and I will end with this. I am worried if we take back this place, we are going to have a lot of new women and men in this place say: Hey, the Republicans did that. Mark my words. You will have a bunch of Democratic Senators who have no institutional memory out here--if we have a Republican President and a Democratic Senate--holding up Republican judges a year out. This is bad, bad, bad precedent. This is not a good thing to do.

   Mr. BIDEN. Look at Norm Stahl. Norm Stahl is in the first circuit, a New Hampshire judge. Norm Stahl was nominated in March. I held the hearing in June, and in June of that year, 1992, election year, we confirmed him. Justin Wilson didn't make it. There were reasons that that occurred, by the way. I can understand a political party saying: Hey, look, this nominee you have sent up is just not palatable to us. We in the majority will not vote for that person. We are flat not going to. I got that. I understand that. 
   The deal I made honestly, straight up with President Bush--if he were here,  he would acknowledge it, and my Republican colleagues on the committee will tell you--I said: Here is what I will do. If there is someone who is absolutely, positively going to be a fire storm, if they are brought up, I will flag that person as soon as you name him, tell you what the problem is, and tell you there is going to be a fight. And you can decide whether you want to go forward or not go forward. 
   That is not the case with Bonnie Campbell. I ask the Senator a question: Has anyone come to him and said, the reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is she is incompetent, or the reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is because she doesn't have a judicial temperament, or the reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is she is just not a mainstream person? I mean, I haven't heard anybody tell

   Again, I never question the right of the Senate or an individual Senator to say, I do not want so-and-so on the bench and I will tell you why and I will fight it. 
   I got that. I got that. I understand that. That is what the advise and consent clause is about. But what I don't get is: Hey, you know, she is a Democrat, we are Republicans. We may win so we will not confirm anybody until we determine whether we win.

   Mr. BIDEN. The point that is important to make for people who may be listening is that we Democrats controlled the committee. I remember this case explicitly because I got walloped. I ran for the Senate because of civil rights, and I got walloped because I held a hearing. Every liberal group in the country castigated me for holding the hearing. And then we referred Judge Carnes to the Senate--get this--in September of the election year; we confirmed a very controversial judge. 
   So, again, I understand the point the Senator is making. I just think this is a terrible precedent that we are continuing to pile on here. I think there is going to be a day when the nature of this place--as my Republican friends told me: What goes around comes around. That is a nice political axiom, but it is not good for the courts. We have a fiduciary responsibility under the Constitution to deal with the third coequal branch of the Government. We are not doing it responsibly. What the Senator hasn't mentioned and won't go into because the floor staff wants me to make a request here--but that doesn't even count. The District Court judges, where there are serious emergencies that exist because they cannot try the civil cases because the criminal cases are so backed up, we have held up for over a year.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand the passion the Senator feels. It is particularly difficult to go through this kind of thing when it is someone from your home State being so shabbily treated. I empathize with him. I might say parenthetically, Bonnie Campbell--and we are not being colloquial calling her Bonnie. People might be listening and saying, well, if this were a male, would they call him Johnny Campbell? Bonnie Campbell is what she is known as. So we are not making up pet names here. This is Bonnie Campbell. 
   This is a woman who has been an incredible lawyer, a first-rate attorney general in one of the States of the United States. She has run an office that, at its inception, didn't have a single employee, didn't have a single guideline, didn't have a single penny when she came in. She has done it in a fashion, as the Senator said, that the ABA thinks she is first rate. Coincidentally, this will cause controversy, but we seem to hold up people of color and women for the circuit court. They tend to get slowed up more than others around here. It simply is not right. This is a woman who is as mainstream as they come, who is well educated. If anybody has a judicial temperament, this person has it.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today the United States Senate has passed the Children's Health Act of 2000, an Act which will have a far-ranging impact on the health of America's youth. This legislation not only addresses juvenile arthritis, diabetes, asthma and other childhood diseases, but it also takes important steps to address what I would argue is a public health epidemic for both children and adults--substance abuse and addiction. 
   The Children's Health Act reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the federal agency devoted to substance abuse prevention and treatment services as well as a wide range of mental health programs. The bill also includes three important drug bills which I have cosponsored: the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act and the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. The result is a comprehensive piece of legislation which includes the law enforcement, treatment and prevention services necessary to address substance abuse in the United States today. 
   Mr. President, in 1996 I joined with my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator HATCH, to introduce the ``Hatch-Biden Methamphetamine Control Act'' to address the growing threat of methamphetamine use in our country before it was too late. 
   Our failure to foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one of the most significant public policy mistakes in recent history. We were determined not to repeat that mistake with methamphetamine. 
   That 1996 Act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of the methamphetamine epidemic--increased penalties for possessing and trafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor  chemicals and equipment used to manufacture the drug; tighter reporting requirements and restrictions on the legitimate sales of products containing precursor chemicals to prevent their diversion; increased reporting requirements for firms that sell those products by mail; and enhanced prison sentences for meth manufacturers who endanger the life of any individual or endanger the environment while making this drug. We also created a national working group of law enforcement and public health officials to monitor any growth in the methamphetamine epidemic. 
   I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic significantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive drug. 
   The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act--which I have cosponsored--builds on the 1996 Act. First and foremost, it closes the ``amphetamine loophole'' in current law by making the penalties for manufacturing, distributing, importing and exporting amphetamine the same as those for meth. After all, the two drugs differ by only one chemical and are sold interchangeably on the street. If users can't tell the difference between the two substances, there is no reason why the penalties should be different. 
   The bill also addresses the growing problem of meth labs by establishing penalties for manufacturing the drug with an enhanced penalty for those who would put a child's life at risk in the process. We provide $20 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reimburse states for cleaning up toxic meth labs and $5.5 million for the DEA to certify state and local officials to handle the hazardous byproducts at the lab sites. We also provide $15 million for additional law enforcement personnel--including agents, investigators, prosecutors, lab technicians, chemists, investigative assistants and drug prevention specialists--in High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas where meth is a problem. 
   Also included in the bill is $6.5 million for new agents to assist State and local law enforcement in small and mid-sized communities in all phases of drug investigations and assist state and local law enforcement in rural areas. The bill also provides $3 million to monitor List I chemicals, including those used in manufacturing methamphetamine, and prevent their diversion to illicit use. 
   Further, the legislation provides $10 million in prevention funds and $10 million for treating methamphetamine addiction, as well as much needed money for researching new treatment modalities, including clinical trials. It asks the Institute of Medicine to issue a report on the status of the 
   development of pharmacotherapies for treatment of amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction, such as the good work that the scientists at the National Institute on Drug Abuse have done to isolate amino acids and develop medications to deal with meth overdose and addiction. 
   The Children's Health Act also includes the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act,'' a bill which Senators GRAHAM, GRASSLEY and THOMAS and I introduced in May to address the new drug on the scene--Ecstasy, a synthetic stimulant and hallucinogen. The legislation takes the steps--both in terms of law enforcement and prevention--to address this problem in a serious way before it gets any worse. 
   Ecstasy belongs to a group of drugs referred to as ``club drugs'' because they are associated with all-night dance parties known as ``raves.'' There is a widespread misconception that it is not a dangerous drug--that it is ``no big deal.'' I believe that Ecstasy is a very big deal. The drug depletes the brain of serotonin, the chemical responsible for mood, thought, and memory. 
   If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is. 
   A few months ago we got a significant warning sign that Ecstasy use is becoming a real problem. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future survey, a national survey measuring drug use among students, reported that while overall levels of drug use had not increased, past month use of Ecstasy among high school seniors increased more than 66 percent. 
   The survey showed that nearly six percent of high school seniors have used Ecstasy in the past year. This may sound like a small number, but put in perspective it is deeply alarming--it is five times the number of seniors who used heroin and it is just slightly less than the percentage of seniors who used cocaine. 
   And with the supply of Ecstasy increasing as rapidly as it is, the number of kids using this drug is only likely to increase. So far this year, the Customs Service has already seized 9 million Ecstasy pills--three times the total amount seized in all of 1999 and twelve times the amount seized in all of 1998. 
   Though New York is the East Coast hub for this drug, it is spreading quickly throughout the country. In my home state of Delaware, law enforcement officials have seized Ecstasy pills in Rehoboth Beach and are noticing the emergence of an Ecstasy problem in Newark among students at the University of Delaware. 
   The legislation directs the United States Sentencing Commission to increase the recommended penalties for manufacturing, importing, exporting or trafficking Ecstasy. 
   The legislation also authorizes a $10 million prevention campaign in schools and communities to make sure that everyone--kids, adults, parents, teachers, cops, coaches, clergy, etc.--know just how dangerous this drug really is. We need to dispel the myth that Ecstasy is not a dangerous drug because, as I stated earlier, this is a substance that can cause brain damage and can even result in death. We need to spread the message so that kids know the risk involved with taking Ecstasy, what it can do to their bodies, their brains, their futures. Adults also need to be taught about this drug--what it looks like, what someone high on Ecstasy looks like, and what to do if they discover that someone they know is using it. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the United States Senate on numerous occasions to state what I view as the most effective way to prevent a drug epidemic. My philosophy is simple: the best time to crack down on a drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before the abuse of the drug has become rampant. The advantages of doing so are clear--there are fewer pushers trafficking in the drug and, most important, fewer lives and fewer families will have suffered from the abuse of the drug. 
   It is clear that Ecstasy use is on the rise and I am pleased that the Senate has acted today to address the escalating problem of this drug before it gets any worse. 
   In addition to stopping the proliferation of new drugs, we also need to invest in treating those who are already addicted. More than ten years ago, in December 1989, I released a Senate Judiciary Committee Report entitled ``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990s.'' In this report I argued that there was scientific promise for medicines that might lessen an addict's craving for cocaine and heroin, as well as to reduce their enjoyment of those drugs. 
   This report asked the question: ``If drug abuse is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find a medical `cure'?'' 
   At the time, despite the efforts of myself and other members of Congress, the answer to that question was as clear as it was distressing: the nation was doing far too little to find medicines that treat the disease of drug addiction. 
   To address this shortfall, I authored, along with Senator KENNEDY, the Pharmacotherapy Development Act--which passed into law in 1992. The cornerstone of this Act was its call for a ten year, $1 billion effort to research and develop anti-addiction medications. 
   I cannot think of a more worthwhile investment. There is no other disease that effects so many, directly and indirectly. We have 14 million drug users in this country, four million of whom are hard-core addicts. We all have a family member, neighbor, colleague or friend who has become addicted. We are all impacted by the undeniable correlation between drugs and crime--an overwhelming 80 percent of the men and women behind bars today have a history of drug and alcohol abuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime. It only makes sense to unleash the full powers of medical science to find a ``cure'' for this social and human ill. 
   Ten years ago, the question was: ``Are we doing enough to find a `cure'?''  Unfortunately that question is still with us. But today we also have another question: ``Are we doing enough to get the `cures' we have to those who need them?'' We have an enormous ``treatment gap'' in this country. Only two million of the estimated 4.4 to 5.3 million people who need drug treatment are receiving it. 
   That is why I have worked with Senators HATCH, LEVIN and MOYNIHAN and Representative BILEY to craft the ``Drug Addiction Treatment Act,'' a bill which creates a new system for delivering anti-addiction medications to patients who need them. Under the bill qualified doctors can be granted a waiver to prescribe certain Schedule III, IV and V medications from their offices. This is a significant step toward bridging the treatment gap. 
   Right now we have some highly effective pharmacotherapies to treat heroin addiction and we are still working on developing similar medications for cocaine addiction. Access to currently available medications such as methadone and LAAM (Levo-Alpha Acetylmethadol) has been strangled by layers of bureaucracy and regulation. As a result, only 22 percent of opiate addicts are now receiving pharmacotherapy treatment. General McCaffrey and Secretary Shalala are leading the charge to fix that problem and I applaud their efforts. 
   Under the legislation passed today, patients will be able to get new medications such a buprenorphine and a buprenorphine-naloxone combination product--which are now under review by the Food and Drug Administration--much like they can get other medications: a doctor prescribes them and the patient can get the medication from the local pharmacy. This new system helps to move drug treatment into the mainstream of medicine. 
   The difficulties of distributing treatment medications to addicts not only hurts those who are not getting the treatment they need, but it also stifles private research. I have often bemoaned the fact that private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies. As we increase access to these drugs, we increase incentives for private investment in this valuable research. 
   I am proud that the Senate has acted today to pass ``The Drug Addiction Treatment Act'' because it helps get new, promising anti-addiction medications get to those who need them. By allowing certain doctors to dispense Schedule III, IV and V drugs from their offices, the bill expands treatment flexibility and access and encourages others to develop similar medications. 
   Mr. President, in passing the Children's Health Act today, the Senate has taken an important step to addressing the problem of substance abuse and all of the social ills that go along with it. I congratulate all of my colleagues who have worked on this legislation which will make an important contribution to public health and public safety in this country.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that today the Senate is giving advice and consent to the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, and approval to the related implementing legislation. 
   The Senate's approval of these measures will send both of them to the President for his signature. This is good news for American parents looking to adopt overseas, and good news for the thousands of orphaned children overseas looking for loving homes. 
   This treaty is important for a very simple reason--it will help facilitate international adoptions and provide important safeguards for children and adoptive parents. It is a good thing when the government can make things easier for its citizens--in this case, adoptive parents. An adoption is a joyous occasion, but the current system can be confusing and present uncertainties. 
   The Hague Convention establishes a uniform system for adopting children from other countries--so that both adoptive parents and biological parents have the assurance that an adoption is being done right. The Hague Convention and the implementing bill also establish mechanisms for improved governmental oversight for international adoptions--in order to guard against fraud and other problems associated with such adoptions. 
   The implementing legislation is the product of compromise between a number of people--the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator BROWNBACK, and myself, and several people in the other body, including Chairman BEN GILMAN, and Representative SAM GEJDENSON, BILL DELAHUNT, and DAVE CAMP. None of us got all that we wanted. But I believe we have a good product here. I want to express my appreciation to them and their staffs for the hard work that went into the drafting of this bill. Several people in the executive branch, too numerous to mention, also contributed greatly to this bill. 
   Now the hard work of putting the promise of the Hague Convention into reality begins. The executive branch will have much to do in implementing this treaty, and Congress will have a duty to oversee this work closely. But today we are taking an important step for parents and children--a step about which we can all be proud.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate today is not a mundane redefinition of China's status under our trade laws. Nor does it mark a profound shift in our policy toward the most populous nation on earth. 
   The question before us--neither mundane, nor profound--is nonetheless of vital importance to the future or our relationship with China. Granting China PNTR and bringing China into the global trading regime continues a process of careful engagement designed to encourage China's development as a productive, responsible member of the world community. It is a process which has no guarantees, but which is far superior to the alternatives available to us. 
   Our decision on normalizing trade with China is best understood in its historical context. The search for a truly modern China is now more than a 100 years old. It arguably began at the turn of the last century with the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the birth of the Republic of China under Sun Yat-sen. The search has continued through Japanese invasion, a bloody civil war, the unmitigated disaster of the Great Leap Backwards), the social and political upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, and now through two decades of economic opening to the outside world. 
   Viewed in this context, a vote for permanent normal trade relations says that we welcome the emergence of a prosperous, independent, China on the world stage. It also says we want China to be subject to stronger, multilateral rules of economic behavior--rules about international trade that will influence the structure of their internal social, economic, and political systems. 
   Granting permanent normal trade status to China is not a new direction in our relationship with China, Mr. President, but it is an important change in the means we choose to pursue it. We have the opportunity to move some, but not all, of our dealings with China into a new forum; the forum of established, enforceable international trade rules. This will take our economic relationship to a new level; a level commensurate with the importance of our two economies to the world. 
   As important as this legislation is to our overall relationship with China and  to our aspirations for China, we must keep our expectations in check. The reality is that extending permanent normal trade relations to China will not magically cause China's leaders to protect religious freedom, respect labor rights, or adhere to the terms of every international nonproliferation regime. 
   No single piece of legislation could accomplish those objectives: indeed, these changes ultimately must come from within China, with such encouragement as we can provide from outside. 
   Some of our colleagues disagree on this point. They would have preferred that the China trade bill be turned into an omnibus China Policy Act. I understand their objectives and their frustration with the slow pace of reform in China. But amendments offered by Senator SMITH of New Hampshire--covering such diverse issues as POW/MIA cooperation, forced labor, organ harvesting, etc.--and Senator WELLSTONE of Minnesota--conditioning PNTR on substantial progress toward the release of all political prisoners in China--pile too much onto this legislation. Moreover, those amendments would effectively hold the trade legislation hostage to changes in China which passing the trade bill would promote. This seems backwards to me. 
   Other colleagues have such a deep reservations about trading with China that they proposed amendments which would essentially have taken the ``Permanent'' and the ``normal'' out of permanent normal trade relations. Amendments offered by the junior 
   Senator from South Carolina, Senator HOLLINGS, and the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, reflect a deep ambivalence about the benefits to the United States of trading with China. As I will discuss later, I share the Senators' skepticism about the grandiose claims some have made about the economic benefits which will flow to the United States from this trade agreement. But we are not voting on whether to trade with China. We are voting on whether to lock in concessions by China to open its market to the United States. That is why I opposed their amendments. 
   My opposition to efforts to turn this trade bill into an omnibus China Policy Act, and my opposition to efforts to take the ``P'' and the ``N'' out of PNTR, does not mean that I found all the amendments offered during the previous two weeks of debate without merit. 
   Indeed, on their own merits, I would have supported a number of the amendments offered by my colleagues. If we had considered this legislation in May, June, or July, there might have been a realistic possibility of resolving differences between the House and the Senate versions of this bill. Under those circumstances, some amendments offered here in the Senate might well have been appropriate. 
   For instance, Senator FEINGOLD offered an amendment to improve the Congressional Executive Commission on China to be established under the terms of H.R. 4444. The modest changes in the commission suggested by the Senator from Wisconsin are reasonable, and include making sure that the commission produces concrete recommendations for action and that it reports equally to both the House and the Senate. I hope that we might revisit this issue to ensure that the special commission on China is as effective as it can be. 
   Another Foreign Relations Committee colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, offered several meritorious amendments, including one endorsing the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom with respect to China policy, and another requiring the President to certify that China is in compliance with certain memoranda of understanding regarding prohibition on import and export of prison labor products. 
   We should seriously consider the input of the religious freedom commission and we should hold China accountable for its failure to implement agreements with the United States, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues in the future. 
   Finally, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee offered several amendments, including one expressing the sense of Congress condemning forced abortions in China. No member of Congress condones the practice of coerced abortion in China or anyplace else. Senator HELMS, who opposes normalizing our trade with China, knows that, which is why he offered his amendment. 
   Now I share the revulsion of the senior Senator from North Carolina toward forced abortion. It is beyond the pale. But I'm concerned--as I believe the Senator well knows--that his amendment would imperil the entire bill and risk a major setback in our efforts to achieve the very goals we both seek. 
   Sadly, that is the predicament we find ourselves in now. By delaying consideration of this historic legislation until the last days of this Congress, the Republican leadership has effectively denied the Senate the opportunity to debate the merits of various amendments without also considering the impact that any amendment, no matter how reasonable, would have on the prospects of passing the trade bill during this session of Congress. 
   So, I approach the pending vote on final passage with some frustration at the process, but which considerable confidence that extending permanent normal trade relations to China is in the best interests of 
   both the United States and the people of China. 
   I have listened carefully and respectfully to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of this question. I share with many of my colleagues a feeling of deep dissatisfaction with the many deplorable aspects of China's domestic and foreign policies. 
   But, for reasons I want to make clear today, I do not share the belief that by preserving the status quo in our relations with China we will see progress. 
   This, in a nutshell, is the question before the Senate: shall we stick with the status quo? Or shall we join with virtually every other advanced economy in the world, and endorse the membership of China in a rule-based organization that will help to encourage many of the changes in Chinese behavior that the opponents of permanent normal trade relations say they want to see? 
   While there are few simple answers to the many questions raised by China, one thing seems clear: If we don't like Chinese behavior now, why vote to preserve the status quo? 
   The answer, say some of my colleagues, is that we must preserve the annual review of China's trade status to keep the spotlight turned on China. 
   There are two problems with this answer, in my view. First, we have never, not once in the two decades of annual reviews of China's trade status, voted against renewal of normal trade relations. Not after the tragedy of Tiananmen Square, not after missile launches against Taiwan, not after so many other provocations, broken promises, and disappointments. Annual review of China's trade status is an empty threat--an excuse for a ritual that at one time may have served a purpose, but that no one can seriously argue today has an affect on China's behavior. 
   The second problem with this argument lies in the premise that extending permanent normal trade relations to China means taking China out of the limelight. I submit to you that anyone who thinks China is going to escape scrutiny by the U.S. Congress and the American people just because it enjoys normal trading privileges with us doesn't know beans about politics. 
   As I understand their arguments, those who will vote against normalizing our trade relationship with China believe China's foreign and domestic policies remain so objectionable under the system of annual review that we should not, as they put it ``reward'' China with permanent normal trade relations. 
   But if there has been no improvement in China's human rights record over the past two decades, why should we persist in the fiction of annual review, repeating the empty threat that we might withdraw normal trade relations? What has the annual review gained us? 
   I see the situation differently, Mr. President, I believe China is changing. China is far from the kind of country that we want it to be, or that its own long-suffering citizens are now working to build. But no single snapshot of unsafe working conditions, of religious and political repression, of bellicose pronouncements about Taiwan, will do justice to the fundamental shifts that are underway in China.  
   An objective assessment of China over the past two decades reveals sweeping changes in almost every aspect of life--changes facilitated and accelerated by China's opening to the world. These changes are not the result of our annual review of China's trade status. The roots of change reach much deeper than that. 
   China's leaders have consciously 
   undertaken--for their own reasons, not ours--a fundamental transformation of the communist system that so long condemned their great people to isolation, poverty, and misery. They have been forced to acknowledge the failure of communism, and have conceded the irrefutable superiority of an open market economy. The result has been a marked improvement in living standards for hundreds of million of Chinese citizens. 
   This growing prosperity for the Chinese people, in turn, has put China on a path toward ever greater political and economic freedom. The Chinese people, taking responsibility for their own economic livelihood, are demanding a greater voice in the governance of China. 
   This is not just my analysis. 
   This is also the view of people inside and outside of China who are struggling to deepen China's reforms and to extend them into the political arena. 
   Dai Qing, a former Chinese rocket scientist turned political dissident and environmentalist, testified passionately in support of permanent normal trade relations before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July. She said, ``PNTR will help reduce governmental control over the economy and society; it will help to promote the rule of law; and it will help to nourish independent political and social forces in China.'' 
   Wang Dan, the Beijing University student who helped lead the Tiananmen Square protests and now lives in exile, says, ``Economic change does influence political change. China's economic development will be good for the East, as well as for the Chinese people.'' 
   And Xie Wanjun, the Director of the Overseas Office of the China Democratic Party--a party banned within China--says,  
   We support unconditional PNTR with China by the U.S. government. . . . We believe the closer the economic relationship between the United States and China, the more chance for the U.S. to politically influence China, the more chances to monitor human rights conditions in China, and the more effective the U.S. will be to push China to launch political reforms.  
   Martin Lee, Chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, supports China's entry into the World Trade Organization and the granting of permanent normal trade relations. ``The participation of China in WTO would not only have economic and political benefits, but would also serve to bolster those in China who understand that the country must embrace the rule of law. . . .'' 
   And Chen Shui-Bian, Taiwan's democratically elected President, said last spring,  
   We feel that a democratic China will contribute to permanent peace in this region. Therefore, we support U.S. efforts to improve relations with China. While we seek to normalize the cross-strait relationship, especially in the area of business and trade, we are happy to see the United States and China improve their economic relations. Therefore, I am willing to support the U.S. normalization of trade relations with the PRC.  
   It's not must dissidents and leading Chinese democracy advocates who support PNTR. 
   At this time, I ask unanimous consent to introduce into the RECORD recent statements by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Christian Broadcasting Network Pat Robertson, former National Security Advisory Brent Scowcroft, and yes, even former President of the United Auto Workers and former U.S. Ambassador to China Leonard Woodcock, all of whom support extension of permanent normal trade relations to China.

   Mr. BIDEN. Finally, I would like to point out that my support for permanent normal trade relations with China is based not just on an assessment of  the economic benefits to the U.S., not just on the prospects for political reform in China, but also on the impact on our national security. As I discussed during the debate on the Thompson amendment at some length, improving our trade relations with China will help put the overall relationship on a sounder footing. We need to cooperate with China to rein in North Korea's nuclear missile ambitions, to prevent a destabilizing nuclear arms race in South Asia, and to combat the threats of international terrorism and narcotics trafficking. We cannot work effectively with China in these areas if we are treating them as an enemy in our trade relations. 
   Let me quote General Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ``I think from every standpoint--from the strategic standpoint, from the standpoint of our national interests, from the standpoint of our trading interests and our economic interests--it serves all of our purposes to grant permanent normal trading relations.'' 
   So, with all due respect to my colleagues who have brought before us the images of the worst in China today, we must keep the full picture before us and keep our eye on the ball. China is changing. We must do what we can to encourage those changes. 
   Can we control that change? Of course not. We know that not even those who currently hold the reins of power in China are confident that they can control the process that is now underway. What little we know of internal debate in China tells us that support for China's entry into the world Trade Organization is far from unanimous there. 
   It is those who are most closely tied to the repressive, reactionary aspects of the current China who are most opposed to this profound step away from China's Communist past. I urge my colleagues who so rightly and so passionately seek change in China to pause and reflect on that. 
   While we cannot dictate the future of China, we can--we must--encourage China to follow a course that will make it a more responsible, constructive member of the community of nations. 
   That is why I am proud of my sponsorship of legislation which created Radio Free Asia, and am pleased that the bill before the Senate includes increased support for the broadcast of independent news and analysis to the people of China. The opening of China--to investment, to trade, to travel, and yes, to foreign news sources--is a necessary ingredient to the process of economic reform and political liberalization. 
   Some of my colleagues have argued that we must not cast our vote on PNTR simply on the promise of increased commercial opportunities for American corporations. I agree, Indeed, unlike some of my colleagues--on both sides of this question, pro and con--I do not see the question of China's trade status simply in terms of the economic implications for the United States. 
   I do not anticipate a dramatic explosion in American jobs, suddenly created to fuel a flood of exports to China. Nor do I see the collapse of the American manufacturing economy, as China, a nation with the impact on the world economy about the size of the Netherlands', suddenly becomes our major economic competitor. 
   Both the opponents and proponents of PNTR, I believe, have vastly oversold the economic impact of this legislation. 
   For the record, let me say a few things about that aspect of this issue. First and foremost, this vote will not determine China's entry into the WTO. With or without our vote of support here, China will become a member 
   of the only international institution--created by and, yes, strongly influenced by, the advanced industrial economies of the world--in a position to formulate and enforce rules of fairness and openness in international trade. 
   The issue for us is what role will we play in that process--will we put the United States on record in support of change in China's economic relations with the rest of the world? Will we put the United States on record in support of China's participation in a rules-based system whose basic bylaws will require fundamental changes in the state-owned enterprises, in the People's Liberation Army conglomerates that are the last bastions of the failed Chinese system? 
   Or will we put ourselves on the sidelines, and on record in favor of the status quo? 
   Will we accept the deal negotiated between the United States and China last year, in which China made every concession and we made none? 
   Will we accept the deal which opens China's market to products such as Delaware's chemical and poultry exports, to Chrysler and General Motors exports? 
   Or will we consign ourselves to the sidelines while other nations cherry-pick Chinese markets and are first out of the gate in building distribution and sales relationships there? 
   Our course is clear. China's growing participation in the international community over the past quarter century has been marked by growing adherence to international norms in the areas of trade, security, and human rights. If you want to know what China looks like when it is isolated, take a look at the so-called Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. During those periods of modern Chinese history perhaps 20 million Chinese died of starvation, religious practice was almost stamped out entirely, and China supported Communist insurgents in half a dozen African and East Asian countries. 
   I will cast my vote today in favor of change, in favor of closing that sad chapter in China's long history. 
   Mr. President, I will cast my vote with Wang Dan, Dia Qing, Martin Lee, Chen Shui-bian, and the other courageous advocates for political and economic reform in China. 
   Let us continue to seek change in China, to play our role in the search for a truly modern China.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it has become increasingly apparent in today's society that a college education is no longer a luxury. In order for one to succeed in an ever-changing, high-tech world, a college education has become a near necessity. 
   However, just as a college degree becomes increasingly vital in today's global economy, the costs associated with obtaining this degree continue to soar out of control. At the same time, the annual income of the average American family is not keeping pace with these soaring costs. Since 1980, college costs have been rising at an average of 2 to 3 times the Consumer Price Index. Now, in the most prosperous time in our history, it is simply unacceptable that the key to our children's future success has become a crippling burden for middle-class families. 
   According to the United States Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, the average annual costs associated with attending a public 4-year college during the 1998-1999 school year, including tuition, fees, room, and board, were $8,018. For a private 4-year school these costs rose to an astonishing $19,970. and these are only the average costs, Mr. President. The price tag for just one year at some of the nations most prestigious universities is fast approaching the $35,000 range. 
   In 1996, and again in 1997, I introduced the ``GET AHEAD'' Act (Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable). My main goal in introducing this legislation was to help the average American family afford to send their children to college. Although this legislation never came before the full Senate for a vote, I was extremely pleased that a number of the provisions of the GET AHEAD Act--including the student loan interest deduction and the establishment of education savings accounts--were included as part of the 1997 tax bill. Additionally, two other provisions of that bill--the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Credit--were based upon the core proposal of my GET AHEAD ACT--a $10,000 tuition deduction. 
   The $10,000 tuition deduction is a proposal I have been advocating since I first announced my candidacy for the Senate 28 years ago. Today, I am building upon a proposal the President made in his State of the Union address earlier this year and am introducing legislation which would finally fully enact this proposal.  
   The legislation I am introducing today will provide America's middle class families with up to $2,800 in annual tax relief for the costs associated with a higher education. This plan will give families the option of taking either an expanded Lifetime Learning Credit or a tax education of up to $10,000. 
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, current law allows many American families to claim the Lifetime Learning Credit, currently a tax credit of up to 20 percent on the first $5,000 of higher education expenses--meaning a tax credit of up to $1,000 per family per year. For 2003 and after, this will increase to a credit of up to 20 percent of the first $10,000 of higher education expenses--meaning a credit of up to $2,000 per family per year. 
   The bill I am introducing today will expand this important tax credit to 28 percent on the first $5,000 of higher education expenses through 2002--amounting to a credit of up to $1,400. For the year 2003 and after, this will increase to a credit of up to 28 percent on the first $10,000 of higher education expenses--amounting to a credit of up to $2,000 per family per year. To give families the flexibility to choose the best approach for their own circumstances, my plan will give families the option of deducting these higher education expenses instead of taking the tax credit. 
   My legislation will continue to ensure that these important educational tax breaks help support middle class families while increasing the income thresholds to $60,000 per year for individuals and $120,000 for couples. 
   Mr. President, the dream of every American is to provide for their child a better life than they themselves had. A key component in attaining that dream is ensuring that their children have the education necessary to successfully complete in the expanding global economy. It is my hope that this legislation will help many American families move a step closer in achieving this dream and being able to better afford to send their children to college.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment by the Senator from Tennessee. 
   Although well-intentioned, the Thompson amendment--the so-called ``China Nonproliferation Act''--is a deeply flawed approach to addressing the proliferation problem. 
   At the outset, let me stipulate to a couple of points about which the Senator is correct. 
   First, I fully agree with the Senator that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a serious threat to our national security. I commend him for his concern, which I know is sincere. 
   Second, I agree with the Senator's assertion that the People's Republic of China has a poor proliferation track record. China's exports of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them have made the world a more dangerous place. 
   Unfortunately, our concerns are not all historical. You won't find much argument in this body if the Administration decided today to impose sanctions on China--using existing law--for its continuing export of ballistic missile technology to Pakistan. 
   The debate isn't about whether China has a clean record in the area of nonproliferation. It does not. Period. No, this debate is about how we get the Chinese and other proliferators to clean up their act. So I ask my colleagues to keep their eyes on the ball. 
   The question each of us should ask as we evaluate the Thompson amendment is this: At the end of the day, is the Thompson amendment likely to improve U.S. security by reducing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them? 
   I believe the answer is no. The legislation offered by Senator Thompson is deeply flawed. Since its introduction, the Thompson amendment has been revised at least three or four times. I give the Senator credit for trying to fix the bill's many flaws. Unfortunately, with each version, this bill has not substantially improved. 
   In its earliest iteration, at least we knew what this bill was all about. It was all about undercutting the very normal trade relations that we are about to vote to make permanent with China and instead treating China like a virtual enemy. 
   The likely effect of the original version of the ``China Nonproliferation Act'' was to gut normal trade relations with China, shut down trade in dual-use items, deny China access to our capital markets, end educational and scientific exchanges, and suspend the bilateral dialog on a range of important issues, including counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism. 
   It was clear-cut. It was unambiguous. And it was unambiguously contrary to the national interest. 
   The current version of the amendment does not have that coherence. Rather, it is a legislative stew containing an assortment of ingredients, not all of which go together. It has several major flaws. 
   The first major flaw is that although the sponsors have advertised the amendment as targeting certain rogue states, in fact it also targets American firms and firms located in several western nations. 
   On its face, the amendment purports to target only those countries highlighted by the Director of Central Intelligence in a seminannual report as ``key suppliers'' of weapons of mass destruction and missile technologies. Those countries, under the most current version of this report, released  earlier this summer, are China, Russia, and North Korea. 
   But closer examination of the amendment reveals that it would likely expose some of our closest allies--and even U.S. firms--to scrutiny under this bill. 
   Let me explain. This is a bit complicated, so I hope colleagues will bear with me. 
   Under the amendment, the President must submit a report to Congress annually--``identifying every person of a covered country for whom there is credible information indicating that such person'' has transferred dangerous technology to other foreign entities or has diverted U.S. technology in such a way so as to contribute to development of weapons of mass destruction. 
   A ``covered country'' is a term that is defined in the bill: it is any country identified by the Director of Central Intelligence as a ``source or supply'' of dual-use or other technology in the most current report required under Section 721 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. A country is also a ``covered country'' if it was so identified in this report at any time within the previous five years. 
   Guess what? In 1997, this report by the Director of Central Intelligence specifically named the United States, as well as several Western European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, as ``favorite targets of acquisition for foreign weapons of mass destruction programs, especially for dual-use goods not controlled by [certain] multilateral export control regimes.'' That makes those nations a ``source or supply'' of dual-use or other technology under the terms of the Thompson amendment. 
   So what does this mean? 
   It means the President will have to report to Congress on any ``credible information'' that the Executive Branch has on either (1) United States firms, or (2) European firms regarding transfers of dangerous technology. Sanctions are unlikely to result against U.S. or European firms, for two reasons. 
   First, after this report is provided to Congress, the President must then formally determine that the firm has actually engaged in the proliferation activity--not merely that there is credible information that it has. 
   Second, even if the President makes such a determination, the amendment exempts from the sanctions any nation that is part of a multilateral control regime on proliferation--as the United States and the major Western powers are. 
   But for the firms named in this original report, the damage will have been done. 
   First, the companies will surely be subject to negative publicity based on the very low ``credible information'' standard--and suffer financial and other damage that may flow from such publicity. Second, Section 8 of the amendment requires the firm, if its stock is listed on U.S. capital markets, to make this information--that is, the information that they have been cited in the presidential report--available in reports and disclosure statements required under the Securities Exchange Act. 
   In short, the bill places a ``scarlet letter'' on the reputation of firms--based on information that may later prove to be unfounded. 
   This is a pretty breathtaking provision--which requires the President to shoot first, and ask questions later. 
   The second major flaw of the bill is that the amendment is its rigidity. It imposes a one-size-fits-all straitjacket on the President--forcing him to impose numerous sanctions against an offending company, no matter the gravity of the violation, and it requires him to impose the same set of sanctions in every instance. 
   Under the amendment, if the President determines that a person or firm has engaged in prohibited proliferation activity, then the President must apply five different penalties on such firms--including a ban on military and dual-use exports from the United States to such firms, and a ban on the provision of any U.S. assistance, including any loans, credits, or guarantees to such firms. 
   This would include Export-Import Bank financing and assistance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. 
   The President has no flexibility to tailor the penalty to fit the crime. He must impose all five punitive measures against the offending person for at least one year--even if the behavior is corrected immediately. He cannot dangle carrots encouraging the firm or nation to clean up its act. 
   The only flexibility he would have is to invoke a national security waiver. And I doubt such a high waiver will be justifiable in each and every case. 
   I believe it is extremely unwise to tie the President's hands in this manner. 
   We are not clairvoyant, and we should give the President flexibility to calibrate his response--and the power to cope with changing circumstances which we cannot foresee. 
   It is also unwise to impose the same set of penalties on different cases. Should we treat the transfer of an item on Category Two of the Missile Technology Control Regime the less serious of the two categories in that regime--such as telemetry software--the same as a transfer of a complete missile system? Current missile sanctions law permit this sort of differentiation. The Thompson amendment does not. 
   On Monday the Senator from Tennessee implied that the sanctions under this provision are somehow discretionary--that the President has the flexibility on whether or not to impose sanctions under Section 4 of the amendment. This is simply not true. 
   Under Section 4 of the amendment, ``if the President determines that a person identified in a report submitted pursuant to section 3 has engaged in an activity described under section (3)(a)(1), the President shall apply to such person'' the sanctions for not less than one year. 
   In other words, if the President finds that a person engages in a proliferation activity, he must apply the sanctions. He has no discretion--if he sees that the requisite facts exist, he must impose sanctions. 
   Don't take my word for it. 
   A few years ago, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice interpreted similar language in another non-proliferation law--the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991. It concluded that the President ``has a duty to make determinations, not merely the discretion to do so.'' And once he makes those determinations, then the sanctions under the law are triggered. 
   So, too in the Thompson amendment. If the President determines that the proliferation action has occurred, then the sanctions must be imposed. 
   To be sure, the bill allows the President to waive the sanctions. But the act of making the initial determination is not waivable. 
   The third major flaw is that the bill will undermine the credibility of existing sanctions laws because it has an extremely low burden of proof and does not differentiate serious violations from trivial ones. 
   Let me explain first how sanctions are triggered in the bill. 
   Two kinds of behavior are sanctionable: the first is any transfer of technology of any origin by a person of a covered country--and remember, ``covered country'' includes the United States and several European allies--which contributes to the ``design, development, production, or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic or cruise missiles'' by a foreign person. 
   The second action that is sanctionable is any contribution to a weapons of mass destruction program made by the diversion of U.S.-origin technology to an unauthorized end-user. Such diversions are sanctionable even if they occur within China or Russia. 
   The bill penalizes either of these actions--technology transfers or diversion--regardless of whether they are either ``knowing'' or ``material.'' 
   Nearly all of our current proliferation sanctions laws contain these ``knowing'' and ``material'' requirement--they do not attempt to punish transfers that are unintentional or are relatively inconsequential. 
   For example, Section 73 of the Arms Export Control Act--the existing missile sanctions law--requires sanctions whenever a foreign person ``knowingly'' transfers equipment or technology controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR. 
   Items controlled by the MTCR meet the test of ``materiality'' because they  involve either complete missile systems or significant components of such systems. 
   The Thompson bill, however, punishes all transfers--regardless of whether the firm intentionally engaged in the prohibited conduct or whether the transfer made any difference to the program of the recipient nation. 
   The only standard is whether is it ``contributes'' to the ``design, development, production, or acquisition'' of weapons of mass destruction programs. This, potentially, has a very broad sweep. 
   Does a vehicle supplied by Russia, the United States or a western country and used by the People's Liberation Army to transport goods from one weapons plant to another ``contribute'' to ``production'' of Chinese missiles? 
   Does cement for a Chinese cruise missile plant ``contribute'' to the ``production'' of such missiles? Does advice from an efficiency expert ``contribute'' to ``production''? 
   Surely they do ``contribute'' in some way to the production occurring at the facility. 
   Under the Thompson amendment, all ``contributions''--even these relatively inconsequential examples I just cited--would appear to be treated equally. 
   If we are going to impose sanctions, we should have a rule of reason--and punish transfers that matter. Do we really want to trigger the vast machinery of sanctions over transfers that are not of serious concern? 
   Additionally, do we want to trigger a vast array of sanctions if the company did not act intentionally? 
   The fourth major flaw of the amendment is that it could undermine our proliferation policy by singling out China, Russia, and North Korea. 
   A law that singles out the worst proliferators might, at first blush, make sense. But it sends an odd message to the world that we care only about proliferation from those countries. Why shouldn't we care just as much about proliferation by Libyan or Syrian firms as by Chinese firms? 
   To be effective, U.S. sanctions law should be defensible to the world. We can logically explain that proliferation to Iran or Iraq deserves special attention--because of the rogue behavior of those countries. But what is the logic for treating proliferation from China, Russia, and North Korea more seriously than proliferation from other countries? 
   Moreover, country-specific legislation is unnecessary. 
   If China, Russia, and North Korea are the worst actors in this area, then any law that applies generally will fall on them disproportionately. 
   In fact, current proliferation sanctions laws have been used against these three countries more than most others. 
   The fifth major flaw of the amendment is that it will impose an incredibly burdensome reporting requirement on the intelligence community and the Executive Branch officials responsible for enforcing non-proliferation policy. 
   The amendment requires that all ``credible information'' about proliferation activity, no matter whether it is proven or not, no matter whether the activity is significant or not, be included as part of a new magnum opus. This low ``credible information" standard is derived from the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. Under this standard, one piece of information from a source deemed to be credible must be reported--even if that evidence later proves to be false. 
   Congress has yet to receive the first report required under that Act. But we do have some information about the burden it is imposing. 
   To date, the Intelligence Community has found 8,000 pages of information that is ``credible'' just on chemical and biological weapons and missile proliferation alone. 
   Many thousands of staff hours will be required to assemble and analyze the information for this report. Does it really make sense to have our government's non-proliferation specialists devoting so much time to assembling yet another report--rather than combating the proliferation danger? 
   Congress hardly suffers from a lack of information about proliferation. We already require a range of reports on the subject. For example: 
   Congress receives an annual report on proliferation of missiles and essential components of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons--required since 1991; 
   Congress receives an annual report on the threat posed to the United States by weapons of mass destruction, ballistic and cruise missiles--required since 1997; 
   Congress receives an annual report on the efforts of foreign countries to obtain chemical and biological weapons and efforts of foreign persons or governments to assist such programs --required since 1991; 
   Congress receives an annual report on the transfer of chemical agents and the trade precursor chemicals relevant to chemical weapons--required since 1997 under the Senate resolution consenting to the Chemical Weapons Convention; 
   Congress receives an annual report on compliance with international arms control agreements, which includes a detailed assessment of adherence of other nations to obligations undertaken in nonproliferation agreements or commitments--required since the mid-1980s. 
   In addition, Members of Congress have full access to a range of regular intelligence reports on the subject of proliferation. 
   In sum, we do not need another report that will divert officials in the Executive Branch from the daily business of trying to actually stop proliferation. 
   Mr. President, I understand the motivation at work here. Proliferation by Russia or China makes me angry too! I would have thought that the limitations of this kind of sledgehammer approach that I have just described would have been made evident by now. 
   So I remind my colleagues: Keep your eye on the ball! This legislation is not likely to be effective in reducing proliferation by irresponsible actors. 
   Let me make one final point. 
   One underlying assumption of the Thompson bill seems to be that there are few non-proliferation statutes on the books. Any such assumption would be false--over the last decade Congress has enacted numerous proliferation laws. Let me highlight a few: 
   The Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination of 1991 contains numerous provisions restricting technology to, or imposing sanctions on, to countries or persons proliferating chemical or biological weapons technology; 
   The Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 bars U.S. Government procurement in the case of foreign persons who materially contribute to the efforts of individuals or non-nuclear weapons states to acquire nuclear material or nuclear explosive devices, and requires sanctions on financial institutions that finance the acquisition of nuclear material or nuclear explosive devices. 
   The Foreign Assistance Act bars U.S. foreign assistance to nations that engage in certain proliferation activities; 
   The Arms Export Control Act provides for sanctions against nations that transfer unsafeguarded nuclear materials or 
   against non-nuclear states which use nuclear devices, including the Glenn Amendment sanctions which were imposed on India and Pakistan in 1998. 
   The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 requires sanctions against persons or countries who knowingly and materially contribute to the efforts by Iran or Iraq to acquire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons or to acquire destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons. 
   The Export-Import Bank Act bars financing for U.S. exports to any country or person which assists a non-nuclear weapons state to acquire a nuclear device or unsafeguarded special nuclear material. 
   Finally, a Presidential Executive Order (#12938) requires the Secretary of State to impose certain sanctions against foreign persons who materially contribute or attempt to contribute to the efforts of any foreign country to obtain weapons of mass destruction or a missile capable of delivering such weapons. 
   In short, it is a delusion to think we have a shortage of laws. 
   What the senator is complaining about is a failure to use these laws to punish the Chinese and other bad actors. This failure is hardly unique to this Administration. 
   During President Reagan's term, China provided nuclear know-how to Pakistan and missiles to Saudi Arabia. The United States responded by selling  advanced conventional weaponry to the People's Liberation Army--torpedoes for its navy, advanced avionics for its air force, and counter-battery artillery radars for its army. 
   In President Bush's administration, China sold missile technology to Pakistan. The United States responded by briefly imposing sanctions--and then subsequently liberalizing export controls on a wide range of high technology, including the launch of U.S.-made communication satellites by China. 
   The Clinton Administration has twice sanctioned China for proliferation of missile and chemical technology, but has balked at imposing sanctions in response to China's most recent misdeeds. 
   The failure of Executive Branch to use sanctions authority occurs in both Republican and Democratic administrations. It is often lamentable. But the appropriate response is not enactment of a severely flawed piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, let me sum up. 
   I understand the Senator's concerns. I agree with him that Chinese proliferation is a serious problem. I disagree with his remedy. 
   I would be pleased to work with him next year in trying to move serious legislation to fill any gaps that may exist in our proliferation laws through the Committee on Foreign Relations--the committee of jurisdiction. 
   But I believe that it would be extremely unwise to pass this legislation, as well-intentioned as it is--because I believe it has so many flaws that it is beyond fixing at this late date. This legislation, as currently written, would not succeed, and could seriously harm our non-proliferation efforts. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Thompson amendment. 
   To reiterate, the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Tennessee have made some good arguments but on the wrong bill. If you listen to the debate of the proponents, you would assume there is no sanction legislation that exists now relative to China. The irony is that there is significant sanction legislation on the books now. 
   This quarrel is about two things. Half the people who are for this amendment are against trade with China. The other half of them--I don't mean literally half--are made up of a mix of people, people who are against the bill, the permanent trade relations bill which my senior colleague is managing, and some who are desperately concerned about the prospect of further proliferation by China. 
   The truth is, what the real fight should be about is why President Bush, President Reagan, and President Clinton have not imposed the laws that are on the books now. We don't need any new sanction laws. We particularly don't need ones that are so desperately flawed as this one, which lowers the threshold so low you can't be certain that, in fact, there is proliferation going on, raises so many questions that we will spend our time litigating this among ourselves more than we will be doing anything about the problem. And further, this is a circumstance where I don't think there is anyone on the floor who would rise up and criticize this administration if they did what I have publicly and privately suggested to them: Impose sanctions now under existing law. 
   I am sure none of my colleagues would do this but their staffs may. I refer them to the last third of my statement where I laid out in detail how many laws are on the books now which were enacted relative to proliferation: the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Foreign Assistance Act, the Arms Export Control Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act, the Export-Import Bank Act, which bars financing of U.S. exports, the Executive Order No. 12938, which requires the Secretary of State to impose certain sanctions, et cetera. All the laws are there now. They exist. 
   What this is really about is the unwillingness in the minds of our colleagues, some of our colleagues, for this administration to once again impose sanctions, or the last administration to impose sanctions. 
   We became fairly cynical around here because of what happened during the terms of the last two Presidents. What was the response to documented proliferation by China, for example, during President Reagan's term; when China provided nuclear know-how to Pakistan and missiles to Saudi Arabia? The U.S. response, under President Reagan, was to sell advanced conventional weaponry to the People's Liberation Army, torpedoes for its navy, advanced avionics for its air force, and counterbattery artillery radars for its army. 
   In the Bush administration, China sold missile technology to Pakistan. The United States responded by briefly imposing sanctions and then subsequently liberalizing export controls on a wide range of high-technology issues, including the launch of U.S.-made communications satellites by China. 
   This isn't about whether or not nonproliferation laws exist. It is about whether or not we have the will to impose upon the President the requirement that he enforce the law now. 
   Why not pass a resolution here and now and say that the Senate goes on record saying, Mr. President, you should impose sanctions on China now? There is enough of a case to do it now. Why not do that, if you are really concerned about sanctions? This goes beyond that. 
   Everybody knows if this or any other amendment passes attached to this bill, the larger issue of trade with China is dead, for this term anyway. 
   In the brief time I have remaining, let me jump to another 
   point. My friends talk about this in terms of--and I don't doubt their sincerity--their strategic concerns. They talk about the fact of what is going to happen if China sells technology again; what are we going to do? The implication being, had we acted on this amendment favorably and passed it, then China wouldn't sell any more weapons technology. That is a bit of a tautology. They would sell it whether or not this amendment is here. The question is what retribution we take and in what form we take it. 
   I ask the rhetorical question to my friends from Tennessee and New Jersey, and others who support this amendment. Right now we are trying very hard to deal with two things in North Korea: the existence of fissile material that is able to make nuclear bombs, and their ability to produce a third stage for their Taepo Dong missile that would allow that missile to reach the United States, although it is problematic whether they could put a nuclear weapon on it even if it had a third stage because of the throw-weight requirements. 
   So what have we been doing? Former Secretary of Defense Perry, and the last administration as well, have been trying to get the Chinese to use their influence on North Korea not to develop long-range missiles. And what has happened? It is kind of interesting that the first amelioration, the first thawing of the ice came with the Agreed Framework during Perry's tenure. The Agreed Framework made sure that North Korea would not be able to acquire more fissile material for nuclear weapons. They stopped making fissile material. It is working. Surprise, surprise. 
   The second thing is, because of our intercession with China, at least in part, the Chinese had a little altar call, as we say in the southern part of my State, with the North Koreans. The North Korean leader, the guy we were told was holed up, who is manic depressive, a guy who was supposedly schizophrenic, everything else you hear about him, went to Beijing. He came back. Guess what. He had a public meeting with South Korea. Guess what. He concluded that they would stop testing their missile, the third stage of their missile. He further concluded that there should be some rapprochement with the south. 
   And lo and behold, Kim Jong-il concluded that he, and the North Koreans, wants American troops in South Korea. Surprise, surprise. Why? They don't want the vacuum filled by an Asian power if we leave. China doesn't want North Korea to have a nuclear capacity. It is not in their interest for that to occur. 
   Now, somebody tell me how we solve the problem of the proliferation of sophisticated nuclear weapons on the subcontinent of India, including Pakistan and India, as well as China, if we are not engaging China. I don't get this. From a strategic standpoint, I don't get how this is supposed to accomplish the strategic goal because my  friend from Tennessee and my friend from New Jersey parse out and make a clear distinction between the strategic objective of their amendment and the economic objective. They say they have no economic objective. Therefore, they are for free trade. 
   They don't want to scuttle the trade agreement. They say their interest is in the strategic problem of proliferation. I respectfully suggest that amendment is not going to, in any way, change China's proliferation instincts. What is going to change China's proliferation instincts will be a larger engagement with China on what is in our mutual interests--discussions about strategic doctrine, national missile defense, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. That will effect relations with China, potentially, in a positive way. 
   Passing this amendment, as my friend from New York said in another venue when I was with him yesterday, will be the most serious foreign policy mistake we will have made in decades. I share his view. I realize it is well intended. My friend from Tennessee says no one has an answer as to how we are going to stop China. I don't have an answer, but I have a forum in which you do that. It is not in the trade bill. It is engaging them in their mutual interests and ours on the future of North Korea, and engaging them and making it clear to them that it is not in their interest to see India become a nuclear state with multiple nuclear warheads and hundreds, if not thousands, of ICBMs. This isn't the way to do it. 
   I thank my colleagues. I realize my time is up. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution designating October 20, 2000, as ``National Mammography Day''. I am pleased that 54 of my colleagues have endorsed this proposal by agreeing to be original cosponsors. I might note that I have introduced a similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by approving the resolution. 
   Each year, as I prepare to introduce this resolution, I review the latest information from the American Cancer  Society about breast cancer. For the year 2000, it is estimated that nearly 183,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly fewer than 41,000 women will die of this disease. 
   In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics were. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have come to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be upbeat about this situation. The number of deaths from breast cancer is falling from year to year. Early detection of breast cancer continues to result in extremely favorable outcomes: 96 percent of women with localized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. New digital techniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and precise than before. Government programs will provide free mammograms to those who can't afford them. Information about treatment of breast cancer with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting enormous research advances in this disease. 
   So I am feeling quite positive about breast cancer. A diagnosis of breast cancer is not a death sentence, and I encounter long-term survivors of breast cancer so frequently now on a daily basis that I scarcely give it a second thought. And the key to this success is early diagnosis and treatment, with routine periodic mammography being the linchpin of the entire process. Routine mammography can locate a breast cancer as much as 2 years before it would be detectable by self-examination. The statistics tell the story: the number of breast cancer deaths is declining despite an increase in the number of breast cancer cases diagnosed. More women are getting mammograms, more breast cancer is being diagnosed, and more of these breast cancers are discovered at an early and highly curable stage. 
   So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram. Early diagnosis saves lives. But I know many women don't have annual mammograms, usually because of either fear or forgetfulness. Some women avoid mammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To these women, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, and the latest one comes out positive, even before you have any symptoms or have found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to be optimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are highly treatable. 
   Let me consider an analogous situation. We know that high blood pressure is a killer, and we are all advised to get our blood pressure checked from time to time. Are we afraid to do this? No. Why not? Because we know that even if high blood pressure is detected on a screening examination, it can be readily and successfully treated. We also know that high blood pressure is not going to go away by itself, so if we have it, we should find out about it, get it treated, and move ahead with our lives. 
   The argument for having periodic routine mammograms to detect breast cancer is similar. Most of the time, the examination is reassuringly negative. But if it is positive, and your previous routine mammograms were negative, it means that this cancer has been detected early on, when it has a high chance of being cured. 
   And then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it is to remember to do something that only comes around once each year. I would suggest that this is where ``National Mammography Day'' comes in. This year, National Mammography Day falls on Friday, October 20, right in the middle of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On that day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific date on which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to get a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the others that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long as possible. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast cancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to designate October 20, 2000, as National Mammography Day.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the senior Senator from Delaware for their remarks, and wish to indicate my concurrence with the points that they have made. I have had questions about this project, the planning process, its economic justification, and the potential for environmental harm for a number of years. I further understand that the State of Delaware's capital bond bill committee in July indicated in writing its intention to withhold all state money for the Deepening project until the State's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is satisfied and necessary permits obtained. 
   I believe we need to continue to pursue a resolution to these environmental issues and that the Corps should not move forward to construction unless and until appropriate permits have been issued, and the Congress has before it the information needed to determine that the project is safe and truly justified. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD, several letters from the Delaware DNREC which discuss the State's concerns.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, following the recent G-8 meeting in Okinawa and as we move closer to a vote on Permanent Normal Trading Relations with China, I want to briefly remind my colleagues of the importance of having a regional strategy for Asia. 
   There is a tendency to look at the Korean situation, the relationship between Taiwan and China, our presence in Japan, our presence in Guam, the situation in Indonesia, and so on as independent problems. Or, to just react to one situation at a time, with no overall understanding of how important the regional links and interests that exist are in shaping the outcome of our actions. 
   If we want to play a role in creating more stable allies in South Korea and Japan, and in ensuring that an ever-changing China is also a non-threatening China, then we must recognize that any action we take in one part of the region will have an impact on perceptions and reality throughout the region. 
   I do not intend to give a lengthy speech on this right now, instead I just want to draw my colleagues attention to an excellent letter that I received from General Jones, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. He wrote to discuss just this need for a regional and a long-term perspective as we evaluate our presence in Okinawa. 
   I agree with him that we cannot shape events in the Asia-Pacific region if we are not physically present. 
   So, as we engage in debate over what the proper placement and numbers for that presence are, I urge my colleagues to approach that debate and the debate on China's trade status with an awareness of the interests of the regional powers and an awareness of our national security interests both today and in the future.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senate will soon be considering the Treasury and general government appropriations bill. This is one of the important funding bills we will have to pass this year to keep the Government open and running. 
   In addition to the Department of the Treasury, this is the bill that provides moneys for the operation of the White House, the Executive Office of the President, and it also provides funds  for the construction of new courthouses, reflecting the priorities of the administrative offices of the courts. It is this third branch of our Government that I will take a few minutes to talk about. 
   In 1994, the Senate and the House passed the Violence Against Women Act which President Clinton then signed into law. As the author of that legislation, securing its passage had been my highest priority for three sessions of Congress. The cause of eliminating violence against women remains my highest priority. I have watched the progress of the implementation of my Violence Against Women Act. In that act we included a provision giving anyone who had been the victim of a crime of violence motivated by gender the right to bring a lawsuit seeking damages from the assailant. 
   On May 15 of this year, in a case called United States v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down this provision. The Court said that addressing the problems of violence against women in this way was beyond the constitutional authority of the elected representatives of the United States. Flat out, they said it was an unconstitutional act we engaged in. 
   In ruling it was beyond the constitutional authority of the Congress, the Court said that it does not matter how great an effect such acts of violence have on interstate commerce. They said gender-based violence could be crippling large segments of our national economy, but, nonetheless, even if that were proven--according to the Court--the Congress is powerless to enact a law to deter such active violence because although we have acted this way under the commerce clause of the Constitution before, the Court ruled violence in and of itself is not commerce. 
   I believe this is a constitutionally wrong decision. It is true that it does not strike a fatal blow against the struggle to end violence against women in this country. The other parts of the Violence Against Women Act are unaffected by this decision. I am pleased to report that these other provisions, together with changing attitudes in this country, are beginning to make a difference in this struggle in the lives of women who have been victimized. 
   I have introduced a bill with, now, I think over 60 cosponsors, to enhance the provisions of my Violence Against Women Act so that we can continue to make progress. Nonetheless, the decision in Morrison is a wrongheaded decision. It is not just an isolated error. No, it is part of a growing body of decisions in which this Supreme Court is seizing the power to make important social decisions that, under our constitutional system of government, are properly made by elected representatives who answer to the people, unlike the Court. 
   I said at the time that the case came down, striking down the provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, that the decision does more damage to our constitutional jurisprudence than it does to the fight against gender-based violence. Since I said that, a number of people have asked me to explain what I mean by that. Today, since we have the time, I am beginning a series of speeches to do just that by placing the Morrison decision in a larger context of what an increasingly out-of-touch Supreme Court has been doing in recent years. 
   I plan on making two additional speeches on this subject over the next several weeks and months. It is crucial, in my view, that the American people understand the larger pattern of the Supreme Court's recent decisions and, to me, the disturbing direction in which the Supreme Court is moving because the consequences of these cases may well impact upon the ability of American citizens to ask their elected representatives in Congress to help them solve national problems that have national impact. 
   Many of the Court's decisions are written in the name of protecting prerogatives of the State governments and speak in the time honored language of federalism and States rights. But as my grandmother would say, they have stood federalism on its head. Make no mistake, what is at issue here is the question of power, who wants it, who has it, and who controls it--basically, whether power will be exercised by an insulated judiciary or by the elected representatives of the people. 
   In our separation of powers doctrine, upon which our Government rests, that power is being wrestled by the Court from the elected representatives, for in every case in which the Court has struck down a Federal statute, it has invalidated a statute that the people of the United States have wanted. As a matter of fact, in many of the cases of statutes that have been struck down, the numerous attorneys general of the various States have sided with the Federal Government in briefs filed with the Court, saying that they supported the decision taken by the Congress and the President. 
   Let's give the emerging pattern of Supreme Court decisions a name. In a speech I gave before the New Hampshire Supreme Court last year, I referred to this pattern as an emerging pattern of an imperial judiciary. I meant to describe the judiciary that is making decisions and seizing power in areas in which the judgment of elected branches of government ought to be the controlling judgment, not the Court's. With increasing frequency, the Supreme Court is taking over the role of government for itself. 
   The imperial judging might also be called a kind of judicial activism. ``Judicial activism'' is an overworked expression, one that has often been used by conservatives to criticize liberal judges. Under this Supreme Court, however, the shoe is plainly on the other foot. It is now conservative 
   judges who are supplanting the judgment of the people's representatives and substituting their own for that of the Congress and the President. 
   This is not just JOE BIDEN talking. The Violence Against Women Act case came to the Supreme Court through the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson is the chief judge. Judge Wilkinson has been on many so-called short lists for possible Supreme Court nominees of Governor Bush and is a well recognized conservative. In the opinion he wrote, agreeing that the civil rights remedy in the Violence Against Women Act was unconstitutional, Judge Wilkinson praised the result as an example of ``this century's third and final era of judicial activism.'' 
   He, Judge Wilkinson, acknowledges that the decision represents the ``third and,'' he says, ``final era of judicial activism.'' And he said he hoped this new activism would be enduring presence in our Federal courts. 
   That was in Brzonkala v. VPI, 169 F.3d 820, 892-893. 
   Or consider Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, another well recognized conservative. Judge Ginsburg has quite explicitly criticized the interpretation of the Constitution that has prevailed through the better part of this entire century and, indeed, throughout most of our country's history, an interpretation which correctly recognizes the broad capacity and competence of the people to govern themselves through their elected officials, not through the court system. 
   According to Judge Ginsburg, the correct interpretation of the Constitution produces results that severely restrict the power of elected government. He calls the Constitution ``the Constitution in Exile.'' Under that Constitution, the one that he thinks controls, unelected Federal judges would wield enormous power to second-guess legislative bodies on both the State and the Federal levels. 
   When Judge Ginsburg wrote about these ideas in a magazine article in 1995, he was eagerly awaiting signs that the Supreme Court would begin to embrace his notion of a Constitution in exile. Five short years later, much has changed. As Linda Greenhouse recently put it in a New York Times column, Judge Ginsburg's hopes:  
   ..... sound decidedly less out of context today than they did even 5 years ago, just before the court began issuing a series of decisions reviving a limited vision of federal power.  
   By taking a closer look at these series of decisions referred to in the New York Times, the pattern I have been referring to will become quite evident. 
   The first clear step toward an imperial judiciary was taken in the case called Lopez v. United States, which invalidated a Federal law making it a crime to possess a gun in a school zone. The Supreme Court held that it was not obvious ``to the naked eye'' that the nationwide problem of school violence has a substantial effect on the  national economy and interstate commerce, the predicate we have to show to have jurisdiction under the commerce clause to pass such a law. 
   In our desire to respond quickly to the epidemic of school violence, which we all talk about here on the floor, we in the Congress did not make findings--that is, we did not have hearings that said ``we find that the following actions have the following impact on commerce''--we did not make findings to relate school violence to interstate commerce. Subsequently, 
   however, we did make such findings and pointed to the voluminous evidence that was before the Congress at the time we passed Senator KOHL's Gun-Free School Zone Act. 
   Nonetheless, the Court, this new imperial judiciary, ignored our findings and the raft of supporting evidence, and drew its own conclusions. They concluded--the Court concluded--that the threat of school violence to national commerce is not substantial enough to justify a legislative response on the part of those of us elected to the Congress. 
   The Lopez case startled many people. Numerous law schools sponsored conferences to discuss the meaning of this case. Constitutional scholars debated how great a departure this case signaled from the settled approach to congressional power that has been taken over the 20th century, at least the last two-thirds of the 20th century, by all previous Supreme Courts. 
   Immediately after the decision, no consensus emerged. Many scholars plausibly concluded that Lopez was, as one put it, just an ``island in the stream,'' a decision that breaks the flow of the river of cases before it, but which will have no lasting effect of any significance on those that follow it. 
   How wrong he was. It now turns out that if Lopez is an island, it is one the size of Australia. The Court soon followed Lopez by striking down the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act that Senator HATCH and I had worked so hard to craft and the Senate and House passed and the President signed. 
   In Boerne v. Flores--that is the name of the case that struck down the Religious Freedom Act we passed--the Congress of the United States enacted the Religious Freedom Act in response to an earlier Supreme Court decision. 
   In 1990, the Court ruled in Employment Decision v. Smith that the constitutional freedom of religion is not offended by a State law that significantly burdens the ability of members of that religion to practice their religion, so long as that law applies across the board, without singling out religious practices of any one denomination in any way. 
   For example, under the Smith decision, a dry county which prohibits the consumption of all alcohol could prohibit a church from using sacramental wine when they give communion, as they do in my church; I am a Roman Catholic; and they do so in other churches as well. 
   Smith broke with the prior line of decisions holding that such laws needed to make reasonable accommodations for religion unless the Government had a very good reason for applying the law when it offended someone's sincere religious practices to do so. In other words, unless the Government had an overwhelming reason why in a Catholic Church they could not serve, when they give communion, a sip of wine with the host, prior decisions said you cannot pass a law to stop that. 
   The overwhelming majority of both Houses of Congress thought the Smith decision was incorrect as a matter of constitutional interpretation and as a matter of policy. We concluded that because section 5 of the 14th amendment authorized the Congress to protect fundamental civil liberties by appropriate legislation, we could enact a statute providing greater protection than the Smith decision did to accepted religious practices. 
   After extensive hearings under the leadership of Senator HATCH and Senator KENNEDY, the so-called RFRA, Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, was drafted to require that the application of neutral laws had to make reasonable accommodation to bona fide religious objections. 
   The Supreme Court struck down our effort to extend reasonable protections to religious practices. It held that the 14th amendment does not authorize the Congress to confer civil rights by statute or to give judicially recognized rights a greater scope than the Court has set forth. 
   In the Court's view, the power of section 5 of the 14th amendment gives the Congress the power to ``enforce'' the rights established in that amendment, but it only amounts to a power to provide remedies for the violations of the rights that the Court has recognized--not the Congress, the Court has recognized--not to protect any broader conception of civil rights than the Court has already recognized. 
   In the Flores case, it was another sign that we are on the road to judicial imperialism. Recognizing the implications of the decision, the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution in the House held a hearing on the Court's refusal to defer to Congress' factual findings and the policy determinations it based on those findings. 
   Judicial deference to congressional findings and congressional authority to enforce civil rights are obviously important questions standing alone, but the Supreme Court raised the stakes even higher in two decisions relating to what we call State sovereign immunity. In those cases, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida and Alden v. Maine, the Court declared the Congress may not use its commerce clause powers to abrogate State sovereign immunity. 
   What this means, translated, is that when Congress acts under its broad power to improve the national economy, a power granted to it by the Constitution, the Congress, in the Court's view, cannot authorize an individual to sue a State even if they are suing over a purely commercial transaction with that State. For example, as the Court held in the Alden case, an employee of a State now cannot sue his or her employer for failing to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act just because the employer happens to be a State. 
   If it is a business person, a corporation, and they violate the Fair Labor Standards Act, which we passed to protect all people who work, they can be held accountable under that act. 
   The Supreme Court came along and said: But, Congress, you can't pass a law that holds a State accountable. 
   The Seminole Tribe and Alden cases highlight the importance of the issue of congressional power under the 14th amendment because the Court continues to recognize that Congress can authorize individuals to sue States if our legislation is authorized by the 14th amendment rather than by the commerce clause. 
   By limiting Congress' 14th amendment powers, therefore, the Boerne decision, which is the Religious Freedom Act decision, draws into question our capacity to meaningfully protect civil rights at all whenever remedies directly against a State are being considered. 
   Viewed in its historical context, this is a remarkable development in and of itself. The text of the 14th amendment was drafted immediately after the Civil War, and it grants powers to only one branch of the Government, the only one named in the amendment: the Congress, not the Court. Specifically, the amendment sought to grant the Congress ample power to enforce civil rights against the States. That is what the Civil War was about. That is why the Civil War amendments were passed: to put it in stone. Developments in these recent cases I have cited are in profound tension with the sentiments and concerns of the drafters of the 14th amendment. 
   Still, after that case, some might continue to say it is not clear where the Court was really headed. It was possible to say in the Flores case that it was simply articulating the standard governing the nature of Congress' power; namely, that it was purely remedial and not substantive. 
   Because the legislative record was designed to support an exercise of substantive power, that record did not so clearly support the exercise of the remedial power. 
   On this reading, the Court did not second-guess the congressional findings. It just saw them as answering the wrong question. Subsequent events, however, have confirmed that the Subcommittee on the Constitution had a right to be worried about Boerne because Boerne was much more ominous than that. 
   In one of the last cases decided in the 1998 term, the Court laid down yet another marker, perhaps the most bold  decision yet in the trend of the Court usurping democratic authority. 
   In that decision, the Court held unconstitutional a Federal statute, the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. That act provided a remedy for patent holders against any State that infringes on the patent holder's patent. That was in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank. 
   Before enacting this remedial legislation, the Congress had developed a specific legislative record detailing specific cases where States had infringed a federally conferred patent and evidence suggested the possibility of a future increase in the frequency of State infringements of patents held by individuals. 
   Unlike Lopez, the Patent Protection Act did not lack findings or legislative record. Unlike Boerne, the legislative record demonstrated that the statute was remedial and not substantive. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court decided, independently, that the facts before the Congress, as it, the Court, interpreted them, provided, in the Court's words, ``little support'' for the need for a remedy. 
   Get this: We, up here, concluded, on the record, that States have, in fact, infringed upon the patents held by individuals. We laid out why we thought--Democrat and Republican, House, Senate, and President--we should protect individuals from that and why we thought the problem would get worse. We set that out in the record when we passed the legislation. 
   But the Supreme Court comes along and says: We don't think there is a problem. Who are they to determine whether or not there is a problem? It is theirs to determine whether our action is constitutional, not whether or not there is a problem. But they said they found little support for our concern--the concern of 535 elected Members of the Congress and the President of the United States. 
   The Court was not substituting a constitutional principle here. The Court was substituting its own policy views for those of this body that described the problem of State infringement on Federal patents as being of national import. They concluded it is not that big of a deal. 
   We need to be clear about what the Court did in the patent remedy case. For a long time, it has been accepted constitutional law that once a piece of legislation has been found to be designed to cover a subject over which the Constitution gives the Congress the power to act--let me say that again--this has been accepted constitutional theory and law that once a piece of legislation has been found to be designed by the Congress to cover a subject over which the Congress has constitutional authority, that it then becomes wholly within the sphere of Congress to decide whether any particular action is wise or is prudent. 
   This has been constitutional law going all the way back as far as M'Culloch v. Maryland, written by the then-Chief Justice John Marshall, in 1819. There Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the ``government which has the right to act, and has imposed on it the duty of performing that act, must, according to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select the means [by which to act].'' 
   In the patent remedy case, the Court quite clearly usurped the constitutional authority of Congress to select the means it thinks appropriate to remedy a problem that is admittedly within the authority of Congress to address. 
   In the patent remedy case, the Court did not hold that Congress has exercised a power in an area outside its constitutional authority. Instead, it disagreed with our substantive judgment as to whether the Federal remedy was warranted. 
   In short, the Court struck down the remedy just because it did not think the remedy was a good idea. Who are they to make that judgment? Talk about judicial activism. The cases I have reviewed today--Lopez, Boerne, Seminole Tribe, Alden, and Florida Prepaid--bring us up to this term just completed by the Supreme Court. 
   In the next series of speeches, I will show how the trend of judicial imperialism continued, and was extended by several cases decided this past year, including the Violence Against Women Act, which I began with today. 
   The bottom line here is, in the opinion of many scholars and observers of the Court, we are witnessing the emergence of what I referred to a year ago as the ``imperial judiciary.'' I 
   just discussed five cases leading up to the just completed term. 
   Now I would like to discuss two significant decisions of this term. I will also begin the task of trying to place these decisions in a broader framework of the Constitution's allocation of responsibility between the elected branches of Government and the judiciary. It is a framework that this ``imperial judiciary'' is disregarding. 
   Last December, the Court focused its sight on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. That is the act that protects Americans against discrimination based on age and is amply justified under our Constitution. Not only does it protect the basic civil rights of equal protection and nondiscriminatory treatment--with bipartisan support, I might add--it also promotes the national economy, by ensuring that the labor pool is not artificially limited by mandatory requirements to retire. 
   So the Congress had ample constitutional authority to enact the Age Discrimination Act. And the Court did not deny that. Nonetheless, the Court, this last term, gutted the enforcement of the act as the act applied to all State government employees. 
   Building on its earlier decisions in the Seminole Tribe and Alden cases, which I discussed a moment ago, the Court ruled that the Constitution prevents us from authorizing State employees to sue their employers for violation of the Federal Age Discrimination Act. The Court also said, however, that the Constitution does not prevent the Congress from applying the law to the States. 
   Now, you have to listen to this carefully. In a thoroughly bizarre manner, in my view, the Supreme Court has now held that the Constitution allows the Age Discrimination Act to apply to State employers, but it denies the employees the right to sue the State employers when their rights under the Federal law are violated. 
   We learned in law school that a right without a remedy can hardly be called a right. 
   As a result of this case, called Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, over 27,000 State employees in my State of Delaware are left without an effective judicial remedy for a violation of a Federal law that protects them against age discrimination. Across the Nation, nearly 5 million State employees no longer have the full protection of Federal law. 
   Recall that in the Boerne decision--the case that invalidated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which I discussed a moment ago--the Court had begun the process of undermining the ability of the Congress under section 5 of the 14th amendment to enact legislation protecting civil rights. In Kimel, they continued that process. 
   In Kimel, the Court held that Congress' 14th amendment power to enforce civil rights refers only to the enforcement of those rights that the Court itself has declared and not to rights that exist by virtue of valid statutes. Because the Court decided that the Age Discrimination Act goes beyond the general protection the Constitution provides when it says that all citizens are entitled to ``equal protection under the law,'' the Court ruled that the right to sue an employer for violations of the act was not ``appropriate'' and so ruled the act unconstitutional. 
   After Kimel, the pattern of the imperial judiciary now emerges with some clarity. First, the Court has repudiated over 175 years of nearly unanimous agreement that Congress, not the Court, will decide what constitutes ``necessary and proper'' legislation under any of its, Congress', enumerated powers. Then in a parallel maneuver, the Court has announced that it, not the Congress, will decide what constitutes ``appropriate'' remedial legislation to enforce civil rights and civil liberties. 
   Let me return for a moment to the Violence Against Women Act, which I began earlier in my speech. Prior to the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, I held extensive hearings in the Judiciary Committee when I was chairman, compiling voluminous evidence on the pattern of violence against women in America. The massive legislative record Congress generated over a 4-year period of those  hearings supported Congress' explicit findings that gender-motivated violence does substantially and directly affect interstate commerce. How? By preventing a discrete group of Americans, i.e., women, from participating fully in the day-to-day commerce of this country. These are the types of findings, I might add, that were absent when the Congress first enacted the Gun-Free School Zone Act, struck down in the Lopez case. 
   Let me remind you that Congress, when we enacted the civil rights provision invalidated in Morrison, found:  
   [C]rimes of violence motivated by gender have a substantial adverse impact upon interstate commerce by deterring potential victims of violence from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, from transacting with businesses and in places involved in interstate commerce. Crimes of violence motivated by gender have a substantial adverse effect on interstate commerce by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products .....  
   I cannot emphasize enough the seriousness of the toll that we found gender-motivated violence exacts on interstate 
   commerce. Such violence denies women an equal opportunity to compete in the job market, imposing a heavy burden on our national economy. 
   Witness after witness at the hearing testified that as a result of rape, sexual assault, or domestic abuse, she was fired from, forced to quit, or abandoned her job. As a result of such interference with the ability of women to work, domestic violence was estimated to cost employers billions of dollars annually because of absenteeism in the workplace. Indeed, estimates suggested that we spend between $5 and $10 billion a year on health care, criminal justice, and other social costs merely and totally as a consequence of violence against women in America. 
   In response to this important national problem, one to which we found the States did not or could not adequately respond, Congress enacted my Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which included provisions authorizing women to sue their attackers in Federal court. This statute reflected the legislative branch's judgment that State laws and practices had failed to provide equal and adequate protection to women victimized by domestic violence and sexual assault and that the lawsuit would provide an adequate means of remedying these deficiencies. This was no knee-jerk response to a problem. Congress specifically found that State and Federal laws failed to ``adequately provide victims of gender-motivated crimes the opportunity to vindicate their interests'' and that:  
   ..... existing bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system often deprives victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender of equal protection of the laws and the redress to which they are entitled.  
   The funny thing about these explicit congressional findings and this mountain of data, as Justice Souter in his dissent called it, showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce--the funny thing about this is that the Supreme Court acknowledged all of it. They said: We don't challenge that. 
   This is the new height in their imperial judicial thinking. That is right. The Court acknowledged all of the findings of my committee. In Morrison, the Supreme Court recognized that in contrast to the lack of findings in the legislation on the Gun-Free School Zone case, Lopez, that the civil rights provisions of the Violence Against Women Act were supported by ``numerous factual findings'' about the impact of gender-motivated violence on interstate commerce. 
   But the Court also acknowledged the failure of the States to address this problem--they acknowledged the States had not addressed it before we did--noting that the assertion that there was a pervasive bias in State justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence was supported by a ``voluminous congressional record.'' They acknowledged that there was this great impact on interstate commerce. They acknowledged--because I had my staff, over 4 years, survey the laws and the outcomes in all 50 States--that many State courts had a bias against women. 
   So they acknowledged both those predicates. 
   Instead of according the deference typically given to congressional factual findings, supported by, as they said, a voluminous record, and without even the pretense of applying what we lawyers call the ``traditional rational basis test''--that is, if the Congress has a rational basis upon which to make its finding, then we are not going to second-guess it; that is what we mean by ``rational basis''--the Court simply thought it knew better. 
   This marks the first occasion in more than 60 years that the Supreme Court has rejected explicit factual findings by Congress that a given activity substantially affects interstate commerce. The Court justified this abandonment of deference to Congress by declaring that whether a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce ``is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.'' 
   You got this? For the first time in 60 years, since back in the days of the Lochner era, the Supreme Court has come along and said they acknowledge that the Congress has these voluminous findings that interstate commerce is affected and the States aren't doing anything to deal with this national problem of violence against women; they are not doing sufficiently enough. 
   There is a bias in their courts. We acknowledge that. But they said, notwithstanding that, the question of whether a specific activity substantially affects interstate commerce ``is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.'' Hang on, here we go back to 1925. 
   As Justice Souter said in his dissent, this has it exactly backwards, for ``the fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours.'' 
   In short, in a decision that reads more like one written in 1930 than in 2000, the Court held that the judicial, not the legislative, branch of the Government was better suited to making these decisions on behalf of the American people--a conclusion that certainly would have surprised Chief Justice Marshall, the author of the seminal commerce clause decision in Gibbons v. Ogden in the early 1800s. 
   The judgments that the Congress made in enacting the Violence Against Women Act were, in my view, the correct ones. Even if you disagree with me, though, they were the Congress' judgments to make, not the Court's judgments to make. 
   When it struck down the Violence Against Women Act, the Court left little doubt that it was acting outside its proper judicial role. They said that the commerce clause did not justify the statute because the act of inflicting violence on women is not a ``commercial'' act. It said that section 5 of the 14th amendment also did not justify this act because creating a cause of action against the private perpetrators of violence is not an ``appropriate'' remedy for the denial of equal protection that occurs when State law enforcement fails vigorously to enforce laws that ought to protect women against such violence. 
   Over the course of this speech today, I have discussed seven significant decisions since 1995: Lopez, the gun-free school zones case; Boerne against Flores, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act case; Seminole Tribe and Alden, the two decisions prohibiting us from creating judicial enforceable economic rights for State employees; Florida Prepaid, the patent remedy case; Kimel, the Age Discrimination Act case; and finally, Morrison, the Violence Against Women Act case. 
   None of them deal fatal blows to our ability to address these significant national problems, but they each, in varying degrees, make it much more difficult for us to be able to do so. 
   There are two even more important points to make about these cases. 
   First, together, these cases are establishing a pattern of decisions founded on constitutional error--an error that allocates far too much authority to the Federal courts and thereby denies to the elected branches of the Federal Government the legitimate authority vested in it by the Constitution to address national problems. 
   Second, this is a trend that is fully capable of growing until it does deal telling blows to our ability to address significant national problems. This is not only my assessment; it is shared, for example, by Justice John Paul Stevens, who was 
   appointed to the Court  by Gerald Ford. Dissenting in the Kimel case, Justice Stevens has written that ``the kind of judicial activism manifested in [these cases] represents such a radical departure from the proper role of this Court that it should be opposed whenever the opportunity arises.'' 
   That is not JOE BIDEN speaking; that is a sitting member of the Supreme Court appointed by a Republican President. 
   It is also shared by Justice David Souter, who was appointed by President Bush. Dissenting in the Lopez case, Justice Souter has written that ``it seems fair to ask whether the step taken by the Court today does anything but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself almost 60 years ago.'' He was referring to the Lochner era. 
   It is shared by Justice Breyer, a Clinton appointee. Dissenting in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid, Justice Breyer has written that the Court's decisions on State sovereign immunity ``threaten the Nation's ability to enact economic legislation needed for the future in much the way Lochner v. New York threatened the Nation's ability to enact social legislation over 90 years ago.'' 
   Significantly, this imperialist trend can continue to grow and flower in two different places. The Supreme Court itself can continue to write more and more aggressive decisions, cutting deeper and deeper into the people's capacity to govern themselves effectively at a national level. 
   In the short term, perhaps the odds are that this will not occur. Many of the decisions in this pattern have been decided by votes of five Justices to four Justices, and it may be that one or more of the conservative majority has gone about as far as he or she is prepared to go at this time. 
   In the longer term, however, we can quite reasonably expect two or three appointments to the Court in the next 4 to 8 years, and if those appointments result in replacing moderate conservatives on the Court with activist conservatives, we have every reason to expect that this trend I have outlined for the last 45 minutes would gain momentum. 
   It can also bloom in the lower courts. This may, to some extent, be by design of the Justices who are taking the lead in the Court today. Certainly, many people have remarked on the proclivity of Justice Scalia to author opinions containing sweeping language that creates new ambiguities in the law and which then often provide a hook on which lower court judges can hang their judicial activism. 
   Already, opinions have been written by lower court judges overturning the Superfund legislation, challenging the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act, calling into doubt Federal protection of wetlands, and eviscerating the False Claims Act, among others. Not all of these judicial exercises can be corrected by the Supreme Court, even if it were inclined to do so, because the Court decides only 80 or so cases a year from the entire Federal system. 
   In concluding, I wish to describe in the most basic terms why the imperialist course upon which the Court has embarked constitutes a danger to our established system of government. 
   In case after case, the Court has strayed from its job of interpreting the Constitution and has instead begun to second guess the Congress about the wisdom or necessity of enacted laws. Its opinions declare straightforwardly its new approach: The Court determines whether legislation is ``appropriate,'' or whether it is proportional to the problem we have validly sought to address, or whether there is enough reason for us to enact legislation that all agree is within our constitutionally defined legislative power. 
   If in the Court's view legislation is not appropriate, or proportional, or grounded in a sufficient sense of urgency, it is unconstitutional--even though the subject matter is within Congress' power, and even though Congress made extensive findings to support the measure. 
   More significant than the invalidation of any specific piece of legislation, this approach annexes to the judiciary vast tracts of what are properly understood as the legislative powers. If allowed to take root, this expanded version of judicial power will undermine the project of the American people, and that project is self-government, as set forth in the Constitution. 
   To understand the alarm that Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and others have sounded about the Court's pattern of activism, we must understand the way the Constitution structures the Federal Government and the reasons behind that structure. We must also understand the history and the practice that have made the Constitution's blueprint a reality and provide a scale to measure when the balance of power has gone dangerously awry. 
   These considerations amply support Justice Stevens's assessment of ``a radical departure from the proper role of this Court.'' 
   The Constitution (supplemented by the Declaration of Independence) sets forth the great aspirations and objects of our nation. It does not, however, achieve them. That is the great project of American politics and government: to achieve the country envisioned in those founding documents. The way to meet our aspirations and establish our national identity and our character as a people is through the process of self-government. 
   The Declaration of Independence proclaims our fundamental commitment to liberty and equality. These commitments are by no means self-executing. The history of our nation is in no small part the history of a people struggling to comprehend these commitments and to put these high ideals into practice. 
   The Constitution itself was concerned with a more complex function. Whereas the Declaration explained the reasons for splitting from Great Britain, the Constitution was concerned with explaining why the former colonies should remain united as a single nation. It was also concerned with the task of providing a government that could fulfill the promise and purposes of union. 
   The Framers who arrived in Philadelphia to debate and draft the Constitution were no longer immediately animated by an overbearing and oppressive government. In fact, our first national government, under the Articles of Confederation, was the precise opposite. 
   The emergency that brought the leading citizens of the North American continent together in Philadelphia that Summer of 1787 was the inability of the national government to act in any effective way. These framers saw the vast potential of the new nation with its unparalleled natural and human resources. 
   They saw as well the danger posed by foreign powers and domestic unrest. They realized too that the Confederation could never act credibly to exploit the nation's potential or to quell domestic and foreign hostilities. As Alexander Hamilton put it, ``[w]e may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not experience.'' 
   Hamilton urged that the nation ratify the Constitution and throw off the ability of the states to constrain the national government: ``Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our tranquility, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity.'' 
   Indeed, Hamilton may have been understating the degree of the crisis. Gouverneur Morris, a leading delegate from Pennsylvania, warned that ``This country must be united. If persuasion does not unite it, the sword will ..... The scenes of horror attending civil commotion cannot be described ..... The stronger party will then make [traitors] of the weaker; and the Gallows & Halter will finish the word of the sword.'' 
   The words of the Constitution's preamble are not idle rhetoric. The founding generation ratified the Constitution in order to establish a government that could decisively and effectively act to ``provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.'' This is a fundamental constitutional value that must always be brought to bear when construing the Constitution. 
   Yet, it is precisely this constitutional value that the Supreme Court  has lost sight of. Consider, for example, Justice Kennedy's statement in the case striking down the Line Item Veto Act. ``A nation cannot plunder its own treasury without putting its Constitution and its survival in peril. 
   The statute before us then is of first importance, for it seems undeniable the Act will tend to restrain persistent excessive spending.'' Who is he to make that judgment? Yet, Justice Kennedy viewed this as completely irrelevant to the statute's constitutionality. He concurred that the Line Item Veto Act violates separation of powers even though there was no obvious textual basis for this conclusion and no apparent threat to any person's liberty. 
   Justice Kennedy is right about one thing. His statement is premised on the view that the Court is not particularly well-suited to make policy or political judgments. This is accurate and no mere happenstance. The Constitution itself structures the judiciary and the political branches differently by design. 
   The Judiciary is made independent of political forces. Judges hold life tenure and salaries that cannot be reduced. The purpose of the entire structure of the judiciary is to leave judges free to apply the technical skills of the legal profession to construe and develop the law, within the confines of what can be fairly deemed legal reasoning. 
   Outside this realm is the realm of policy. Here Congress and the President enjoy the superior place, again by constitutional design. The political branches are tied closely to the people, most obviously through popular elections. 
   Between elections, the political branches are properly subject to the public in a host of ways. Moreover, the political branches have wide-ranging access to information through hearings, through studies we commission, and through the statistics and data we routinely gather. 
   This proximity to the people and to information makes Congress the most suitable repository of the legislative power; that is, the power to deliberate as agents of the public and to determine what laws and structures will best ``promote the general welfare.'' 
   It is much easier to describe the distinction between the judicial and the legislative power in the abstract than it is to apply in practice. That is why so much of our constitutional history has been devoted to developing doctrines and traditions that keep the judiciary within its proper sphere. 
   After much upheaval, the mid-twentieth century yielded a stable and harmonious approach to questions relating to the scope of Congress's powers: these questions are largely for the political branches and the political process to resolve--not the courts. 
   To be sure, the Court has a role in policing the outer boundaries of this power, but it is to be extremely deferential to the specific judgment of Congress that a given statute is a necessary and proper exercise of its constitutional powers. When the Court fails to defer, as it had during several periods prior to the New Deal, it inevitably finds itself making judgments that are far outside the sphere of the judicial power. 
   This is the point of Justice Stevens' warning. The Court is departing from its proper role in scope of power cases. What was initially uncertain, even after Lopez and Boerne, is now inescapable: This imperial Court, in case after case, is freely imposing its own view of what constitutes sound public policy. This violates a basic theory of government so carefully set forth in our Constitution. In theory, therefore, there is ample reason to expect that the Supreme Court's recent imperialism will undermine the fundamental value animating the Constitution, and that is the ability of the American people to govern themselves effectively and democratically. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how pleased I am that the Senate will finally pass the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act. HIV/AIDS has been acknowledged as the 21st century's bubonic plague. It is having a devastating impact in Sub-Saharan Africa, destroying the very fabric of African societies. And while Africa is the present day epicenter, there is no guarantee that the disease will not spread throughout the world in a manner that is just as devastating. No corner of the globe is immune. 
   HIV/AIDS is the only health related issue that has ever been the subject of a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, and the only one that has been the subject of a Security Council Resolution. Why? Because it poses a severe risk to every nation in the international community, but most especially to developing nations which do not have the means to either treat those living with the disease, or to educate those at risk of contracting the disease about how to avoid infection. 
   I believe that it is past time for the United States to step forward and lead the way in efforts aimed at stopping the spread of the HIV/AIDS. This bill does just that. The funding levels this bill authorizes significantly increase the level of U.S. assistance to combat HIV/AIDS. One of the key elements of this legislation is an authorization for the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the World Bank to create a Trust Fund, the purpose of which is the eradication and prevention of the spread of the virus. 
   The Trust Fund will allow donations and contributions from governments--the bill authorizes $150 million as the U.S. contribution--as well as the private sector, so that all sectors in society are working together at an international level to address this crisis. It is truly the best way to do so. The statistics are grim. According to UNAIDS, in 1999 alone 5.4 million people were infected with HIV/AIDS, bringing the total to 34.4 million infections world wide. 2.8 million people died of the disease last year. This does not have to be. We know how to prevent the spread of the disease. We have the means to treat the virus and the opportunistic diseases that kill those infected with HIV/AIDS. Millions of lives can be saved through both treatment and prevention. Through cooperation we can be successful. We must challenge other donors to dedicate the necessary resources to achieve our aim. 
   The bill also authorizes $300 million in bilateral assistance to stop the spread of the disease, and to treat it. While I strongly believe that a multilateral approach must be developed to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, I also believe that the United States should do all it can right now to deliver targeted assistance to specific regions and specific treatment programs. The problem of HIV/AIDS is urgent. Bilateral assistance programs can be funded and programs carried out right away, and they should be. 
   Assistance is desperately needed, for example, in Africa. The countries in the sub-Saharan region cannot wait for the negotiation of a Would Bank Trust Fund; they must have help now. The news which came out of the International AIDS Conference in Durban was grim. Gross Domestic Product could be cut by as much as 20% due to the impact of HIV/AIDS in some African countries, according to a study released at the conference. African countries are among the poorest in the world. They cannot afford to have their incomes diminished to such a degree. According to the World Bank,  
   AIDS is now the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. At all levels, the impact of AIDS in Africa is staggering: At the regional level, more than 13 million Africans have already died, and another 23 million are now living with HIV/AIDS. That is two-thirds of all cases on earth. At the national level, the 21 countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world are in Africa. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, one in four adults is infected. In at least 10 other African countries, adult prevalence rates exceed 10 percent. At the individual level, a child born in Zambia or Zimbabwe today is more likely than not to die of AIDS at some point in her lifetime. In many other African countries, the lifetime risk of dying of AIDS is greater than one in three. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is not only an unparalleled public health problem affecting large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, it is an unprecedented threat to the region's development. In many countries, the disease is reversing decades of hard-won development progress.  
   We cannot ignore these facts. The time to act is now. The sooner we address this crisis in Africa as well as the rest of the developing world, the better. The directives in this bill represent the best of the current proposals to do so. The World Bank and the Export-Import Bank of the United States both recently announced that they would make funds available for loans to African countries to help them purchase drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. While I welcome any efforts to procure drugs for this purpose, I do not believe that extending more loans to nations currently facing crippling debt burdens will, in the long run, prove to be the most useful strategy. Grants and no strings attached assistance, the aid provided in this bill, are what is needed. 
   I want to make it clear that this bill represents only the beginning of the United States' commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS. Sustained dedication of resources will be needed to continue the fight, and we in the Senate must ensure that such resources continue to be channeled towards eliminating the threat of HIV/AIDS. This bill is a good first step in our efforts.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Delaware's most brilliant legal minds and genuinely altruistic public servants--the Honorable William T. Quillen. 
   I have known Judge Quillen for 33 years, since I was an attorney fresh out of law school and looking for a job. As a 32-year old Delaware Superior Court judge he met with me and on blind faith recommended me for my first legal job. He has been a dear friend and confidant ever since. Over the past three decades, I have watched Judge Quillen with pride and admiration attain the greatest judicial heights any lawyer could ever strive for in Delaware, which is universally recognized--nationally and internationally--as having one of the most reputable, intellectual benches bar none. 
   He is known in my state affectionately and respectfully as ``Judge,'' ``Chancellor,'' ``Justice,'' and ``Mr. Secretary of State.'' He nearly became Governor and was my recommendation to President Clinton in June, 1999 to serve on the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals. It was during a medical examination required for this position that his physician detected prostate cancer. For health reasons, we withdrew his name from consideration. I am happy to report that following treatment for prostate cancer, he is as healthy as ever, running 5K races like a man half his age. 
   Now, in classic Bill Quillen altruism--he says it's time to retire from the bench and make way for younger lawyers to serve as judges. 
   Early in his career, Bill Quillen served in the United States Air Force as a judge advocate, then as a top aide for Delaware's Governor. His judicial career began in 1966 on the Superior Court, which is Delaware's primary trial court. In 1973, he was elevated and confirmed as Chancellor of Delaware's renowned Court of Chancery. 
   Following a two-year experience as a private attorney with the Wilmington Trust Company, he again heeded the call for public service. In 1978, the General Assembly had expanded Delaware's Supreme Court from three to five members, and the Governor called on Bill Quillen. He was confirmed unanimously as a Delaware Supreme Court Justice. He served on the State's Highest Court for five years, before stepping down to run for Governor on the Democratic ticket. In one of the rare instances when he did not achieve his goal, Bill Quillen was not bitter or discouraged. In 1993, he accepted Governor Tom Carper's call for continued public service to become Secretary of State. In a state that more than half of the Fortune 500 companies call home, Secretary Quillen made his mark on this prestigious office. 
   But his heart remained in the law. In November, 1994, Governor Carper nominated and the General Assembly unanimously confirmed him to the Court where his storied career began--the  Delaware Superior Court. As I said earlier, I believe our federal bench would have been enlightened by his experience and brilliance, but for health reasons, this was not meant to be. 
   What's even more striking than his distinguished legal career is Judge Quillen's love for history. He is a true Delaware historian, with long-time family roots in historic New Castle. His love and respect for the law, democracy and justice for all are unparalleled. 
   Judge Quillen is recognized nationally for his extensive writings on Delaware's Court of Chancery, the history of Equity Jurisdiction in Delaware and the Federal-State Corporate Law Relationship. His colleagues nationwide also have awarded him numerous prestigious awards, including the First Place Award for the 1980 Judge Edward R. Finch Law Day U.S.A. Speech, sponsored by the American Bar Association, on the topic of ``Seven Perceptions of Freedom.'' In June, 1998, he also received the ``American Judicature Society's Herbert Harley Award.'' 
   Judge Quillen will continue to serve as a professor at the Widener University School of Law and plans to spend more time with his wife of 41 years, two daughters and three grandchildren. I have no doubt his legal legacy, knowledge of Delaware, writing and speaking ability will continue to serve our State for many years to come. 
   Judge Quillen is a proud graduate of Harvard Law School, and it was the Dean Emeritus of Harvard Law School--Roscoe Pound--who said: 
   ``Law is experience developed by reason and applied continually to further experience.'' 
   Judge Quillen's vast experience and reasoned principles applied as a member of Delaware's top three courts will forever leave its marks on our body of law in Delaware. Our State and our citizens are so much better for his service. So, Your Honor, May It Please The Court, respectfully accept this statement of profound gratitude and admiration.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' When our parents and grandparents told us that, they probably weren't talking about the problem of crime in America. But they might have been. 
   So many times in our debates, in the testimony given by experts from law-enforcement professionals to psychologists and social workers, the value of prevention--of keeping kids away from crime before they ever get into it--is clear and indisputable. And it is just as clear that one of the best ways to keep kids out of trouble is, simply, to give them something else to do. 
   Terrance Collier, a 13-year-old from Washington, DC, had something else to do this summer. In fact, he had a lot to do. Through a program called City Kids Wilderness Project, Terrance went to Wyoming, where he camped, cooked, helped with cleaning up, paddled a canoe, went rafting, made new friends and, in the process, learned about nature, himself, teamwork and responsibility. 
   Randy Luskey started City Kids Wilderness Project and continues to fund the program himself. A few years ago, Randy donated his Wyoming ranch to the kids. But, Randy is not just a blind donor. Randy leaves his own family in Colorado every year to actively participate with the kids in Jackson Hole. 
   Cathy Robillard takes time away from her home and family in Vermont every summer to work with the kids in Wyoming. She is the person that runs the nuts and bolts of the program and does so with a measure of care and discipline. 
   City Kids Wilderness Project is one of the best possible examples of time and money well spent. And it is an example that should be followed. 
   A lot of the participants get into City Kids Wilderness Project through Boys and Girls Clubs, the kind of partnership that gets the best out of both programs, the kind of partnership that has proven successful time and time again. 
   In debating funding for crime-prevention programs and public-private partnerships, we hear testimony from the experts and professionals, as we should, but we will never have a witness more important than 13-year-old Terrance Collier. Terrance found his time in Wyoming to be rewarding, it made a difference to him, he thought it was important and it kept him off the street. 
   Let's listen to that testimony, and let's thank the people like Randy Luskey and Cathy Robillard who are offering ``an ounce of prevention'' to kids like Terrance, brightening the promise of the future for all of us.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2000. I am introducing this legislation because all too often we have short-term solutions for long-term problems. All too often we think about today, but not tomorrow. It's time that we start looking forward. It's time that we face the dire situation of prisoners re-entering our communities with insufficient monitoring, little or no job skills, inadequate drug treatment, insufficient housing and deficient basic life skills. 
   According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are now living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in local jails. A record number of those inmates--approximately 585,400 will return to communities this year. Historically, two-thirds of returning prisoners have been rearrested for new crimes within three years. 
   The safety threat posed by this volume of prisoner returns has been exacerbated by the fact that states and communities can't possibly properly supervise all their returning offenders, parole systems have been abolished in thirteen states and policy shifts toward more determinate sentencing have reduced the courts' authority to impose supervisory conditions on offenders returning to their communities. 
   State systems have also reduced the numbers of transitional support programs aimed at facilitating the return to productive community life styles. Recent studies indicate that many returning prisoners receive no help in finding employment upon release and most offenders have low literacy and other basic educational skills that can impede successful reentry. 
   At least 55 percent of offenders are fathers of minor children, and therefore face a number of issues related to child support and other family responsibilities during incarceration and after release. Substance abuse and mental health problems also add to concerns over community safety. Approximately 70 percent of state prisoners and 57 percent of federal prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse. Research by Justice indicates that between 60 and 75 percent of inmates with heroin or cocaine problems return to drugs within three months when untreated. An estimated 187,000 state and federal prison inmates have self-reported mental health problems. Mentally ill inmates are more likely than other offenders to have committed a violent offense and be violent recidivists. Few states connect mental health treatment in prisons with treatment in the return community. Finally, offenders with contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are released with no viable plan to continue their medical treatment so they present a significant danger to public health. And while the federal prison population and reentry system differs from the state prison population and reentry systems, there are nonetheless significant reentry challenges at the federal level. 
   We need to start thinking about what to do with these people. We need to start thinking in terms of helping these people make a transition to the community so that they don't go back to a life of crime and can be productive members of our society. We need to start thinking about the long-term impact of what we do after we send people to jail 
   My legislation creates demonstration reentry programs for federal, state and local prisoners. The programs are designed to assist high-risk, high-need offenders who have served their prison  sentences, but who pose the greatest risk of reoffending upon release because they lack the education, job skills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance abuse treatment and other mental and medical health services they need to successfully reintegrate into society. 
   Innovative strategies and emerging technologies present new opportunities to improve reentry systems. This legislation creates federal and state demonstration projects that utilize these strategies and technologies. The projects share many core components, including a more seamless reentry system, reentry officials who are more directly involved with the offender and who can swiftly impose intermediate sanctions if the offender does not follow the designated reentry plan, and the combination of enhanced service delivery and enhanced monitoring. The different projects are targeted at different prisoner populations and each has some unique features. The promise of the legislation is to establish the demonstration projects and then to rigorously evaluate them to determine which measures and strategies most successfully reintegrate prisoners into the community as well as which measures and strategies can be promoted nationally to address the growing national problem of released prisoners. 
   There are currently 17 unfunded state pilot projects, including one in Delaware, which are being supported with technical assistance by the Department of Justice. My legislation will fund these pilot projects and will encourage states, territories, and Indian tribes to partner with units of local government and other non-profit organizations to establish adult 
   offender reentry demonstration projects. The grants may be expended for implementing graduated sanctions and incentives, monitoring released prisoners, and providing, as appropriate, drug and alcohol abuse testing and treatment, mental and medical health services, victim impact educational classes, employment training, conflict resolution skills training, and other social services. My legislation also encourages state agencies, municipalities, public agencies, nonprofit organizations and tribes to make agreements with courts to establish ``reentry courts'' to monitor returning offenders, establish graduated sanctions and incentives, test and treat returning offenders for drug and alcohol abuse, and provide reentering offenders with mental and medical health services, victim impact educational classes, employment training, conflict resolution skills training, and other social services. 
   This legislation also re-authorizes the drug court program created by Congress in the 1994 Crime Law as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with non-violent offenders in need of drug treatment. This is the same language as the Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act that I introduced with Senator SPECTER last year. 
   Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial obligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They are also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track. 
   This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) found that these courts are effective at taking offenders with little previous treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they provide closer supervision than other community programs to which the offenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are cost-effective. 
   According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least $5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing of the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as important, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals. 
   I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last. Two-thirds of drug court participants are parents of young children. After getting sober through the coerced treatment mandated by the court, many of these individuals are able to be real parents again. More than 500 drug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a sizable victory for society and the budget alike. 
   This bill reauthorizes programs to provide for drug treatment in state and federal prisons. According to CASA, 80 percent of the men and women behind bars in the United States today are there because of alcohol or drugs. They were either drunk or high when they committed their crime, broke an alcohol or drug law, stole to support their habit, or have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The need for drug and alcohol treatment in our nations prisons and jails is clear. 
   Providing treatment to criminal offenders is not ``soft.'' It is a smart crime prevention policy. If we do not treat addicted offenders before they are released, they will be turned back onto our streets with the same addiction problem that got them in trouble in the first place and they will reoffend. Inmates who are addicted to drugs and alcohol are more likely to be incarcerated repeatedly than those without a substance abuse problem. This is not my opinion, it is fact. According to CASA, 81 percent of inmates with five or more prior convictions have been habitual drug users compared to 41 percent of first-time offenders. Reauthorizing prison-based treatment programs is a good investment and is an important crime prevention initiative. 
   This legislation is a first step. Someday, we will look back and wonder why we didn't think of this sooner. For now, we need to implement these pilot projects, help people make it in their communities and make our streets safer. I am certain that we will revel in the results.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the best economic and budget times in our country's history, I believe that we should provide American families with tax relief. That is why I supported this bill when it passed the Senate earlier this week, and that is why I will vote for it again today. 
   But I vote today knowing that this bill will be vetoed by the President. Everyone here knows that. I hope that passage here today will lead to the kind of eventual compromise between the President and Congress--maybe a grand compromise that will include a prescription drug benefit under Medicare--that we can all support. 
   If that kind of compromise is not reached, Mr. President, I will vote to sustain that veto. 
   Since we voted just a few days go, the cost of this bill has gone up over $40 billion--that is the wrong direction. I still prefer an alternative that would cost less and that would be better targeted at the marriage penalty and at those families with the greatest need, one that would give families more flexibility to deal with their own circumstances. 
   Passage of this bill today is the beginning of the debate on this issue, Mr. President, not the end.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the threat to Montenegro, the sole remaining free part of the Yugoslav federation. 
   In the decade of the 1990s, there were four mornings on which my colleagues and I awoke to a recurring headline: new war in the former Yugoslavia, started by Slobodan Milosevic. 
   First, in Slovenia. Next, in Croatia. Then, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finally, in Kosovo. 
   I do not want to ever read that headline again. I never want to read the headline that says: Milosevic starts new war in Montenegro. 
   So let's say it loud and clear: hands off Montenegro, Mr. Milosevic! 
   What is going on today in the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, specifically, in the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro? 
   Why is it important for us to pay attention? 
   And what should be our stance toward developments there? 
   These are the questions I aim to answer in my remarks today. 
   Most of my colleagues are aware that ``Yugoslavia'' is an invented term. It was not the name with which that nation was born after the First World War. Rather, the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes officially changed its name in 1929 to the ``Kingdom of Yugoslavia,'' meaning the kingdom of the South Slavs. 
   That was the first Yugoslavia, the one which perished in the course of the Second World War. Out of the ashes of World War II, the second Yugoslavia arose. That was Tito's Yugoslavia. Tito had been dead for a less than a decade when his Yugoslavia began to unravel at the start of the 1990s. And now, today, all that remains of Yugoslavia is an increasingly quarrelsome couple: Serbia and Montenegro. 
   Once Yugoslavia was a state of 20 million inhabitants, with five constituent republics plus two semi-autonomous provinces. And today? Slovenia, gone. Croatia, gone. Bosnia and Herzegovina, gone. Macedonia, gone. Kosovo, for all intents and purposes, gone. 
   The two republics of Serbia and Montenegro are what is left of Yugoslavia, Mr. President. And the undeniable fact is that many people in Montenegro want no more to do with that Yugoslav federation with Serbia as it is today. 
   Will Montenegro someday split off to become an independent nation-state, like Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina? Maybe. 
   Will Montenegro someday become a partner with Serbia in a revitalized and restructured Yugoslavia? Maybe. 
   Will Montenegro wind up as a Serbian puppet-state, ruled from Belgrade by the likes of Slobodan Milosevic or some other Serbian authoritarian jingoist? Not if I have anything to say about it, and I hope my colleagues and the U.S. Government agree with me. 
   We simply must not take our eye off the ball, Mr. President. There is still a very serious risk that Milosevic will undermine and then overthrow the elected government of the Republic of Montenegro. 
   What would be the result of such a development? At a minimum--Montenegrins executed or thrown in jail, others forced to flee abroad as refugees, Milosevic in charge of new borders with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, and Kosovo. At a maximum--war with a capital ``W'', in the Balkans, once again. 
   What is the seriousness of the threat today to Montenegro? 
   Earlier this month Milosevic made his latest move from Belgrade. He got the obedient legislature to approve changes to Yugoslavia's constitution. 
   The first major change was that henceforth the President of Yugoslavia will be directly elected. Guess who gets to run? Yes, Milosevic himself--who otherwise would have been obliged by the constitution to step down next year at his term's end. This means that Mr. Milosevic has, in effect, extended his legal ``shelf-life'' by as many as eight years. 
   The second major constitutional change was that the upper house of Yugoslavia's parliament henceforth will be elected proportionally. Mr. President, that's easy for us to understand. It means that, by comparison, in this Chamber, there would be a heck of a lot more Senators from California than from Delaware. In the case of Yugoslavia, it isn't hard to figure out the significance: Montenegro has 650,000 inhabitants; Serbia has 10 million. 
   This constitutional re-jiggering has fooled absolutely no one. 
   That it was immediately condemned, on July 8, both by Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic and by the legislature of the Republic of Montenegro. The vote in the Montenegrin legislature was 36 to 18 in favor of a vigorous condemnation of the constitutional changes as ``illegal and illegitimate.'' 
   The changes have also been condemned by the political opposition within Serbia. 
   The changes have even been condemned by the Russians, who joined in  the recent G-8 communique statement condemning Milosevic's constitutional fiddling. 
   Milosevic and his cronies are clearly trying to topple the democratically elected government of President Djukanovic. These constitutional changes are but the latest gambit. 
   In contrast with Milosevic's hopelessly inept long-term strategies, most of his tactics are clever. If these constitutional changes were ultimately to be accepted by, or forced upon, the Montenegrins, they would facilitate his control of Montenegro through peaceful means. Given, however, that the Montenegrins have rejected the changes, Mr. Milosevic now can claim, spuriously, that the Montenegrins are acting ``unconstitutionally'' or ``illegally'' and that, therefore, Belgrade has some right to ``intervene.'' 
   Mr. Milosevic also is trying to provoke the Montenegrin authorities into reacting out of anger and national pride, and going ahead with a referendum on independence. 
   Thankfully, the Montenegrin Government, including both President Djukanovic and the legislature, have not fallen for Milosevic's trap. On July 8, the same day that it so roundly condemned Milosevic's constitutional shenanigans, the Montenegrin legislature specifically rejected a proposal calling for an immediate referendum on independence. 
   The support for independence in Montenegro is not--at least not yet--sufficiently strong to justify holding a referendum. Look again at that vote--36 to 18. There clearly are pro-Milosevic politicians in Montenegro. Many Montenegrins, especially from the northern part of the country, either consider themselves Serbs or at least profess greater allegiance to Serbia and/or a Yugoslavia which Serbia dominates than to Montenegro. 
   Aside from ethnic self-identification, there are many Montenegrins who are not convinced that independence is a better outcome for such a small country than a democratically reformed federation with Serbia would be. For example, in recent municipal elections in Montenegro, the capital, Podgorica, went for Djukanovic, while another city, Herceg Novi, went for the pro-Serbian party. 
   The risk of holding a referendum on Montenegro's independence, in such a context, would be that the balloting might easily be followed by civil unrest and skirmishes--provoked by Milosevic's henchmen or spontaneous--which would be all the provocation that Milosevic would need in order to seize power in the name of preserving law and order through some combination of paramilitaries and Yugoslav Army units already stationed in Montenegro. 
   In fact, Reuters reported that the Yugoslav Army was poised to implement just such a plan if the Montenegrin legislature had reacted more radically to the changes in the Yugoslav constitution. Our State Department does not discount these reports as idle speculation. 
   What is our policy in response to Milosevic's constant provocations and threats against Montenegro? What have we been doing, what are we doing, what more can we do? 
   First of all, we are providing economic assistance to the Government of Montenegro. 
   In Fiscal Year 2000, we have already allocated $60.56 million. Secretary of State Albright announced on July 13 that the Administration plans to notify the Congress of its intention to reprogram an additional $16.5 million for democratization and economic reform in Montenegro. 
   Why does Montenegro need this money? 
   Much of it is for budget-support. As a key part of Milosevic's effort at destabilization, he has squeezed Montenegro's economy very hard through a series of measures. 
   He has had Yugoslavia's central bank print extra money, against the wishes of the Montenegrin representatives to the bank, and then spent it in Montenegro to cause inflation there. 
   Yugoslavia has refused to grant import and export licenses to Montenegrin companies. 
   Serbia has taken virtually all of the revenue from Yugoslavia's customs collections, leaving none of it for Montenegro. 
   Yugoslavia has stopped payment to Montenegrin pensioners from the federal pension fund. 
   Yugoslavia has denied overflight clearances for aircraft that would transport foreign tourists to Montenegro. 
   And, most significant, Belgrade has cut off Montenegrin purchasers from food and medicine produced in Serbia, the market which previously had provided 75 percent of Montenegro's purchases of such commodities. Think about this--the Milosevic regime, which complains about sanctions targeted at specific individuals and enterprises in Serbia, has placed sanctions on its ``brother'' republic of Montenegro. These are sanctions that hurt all Montenegrins. 
   It is in large part to combat this kind of economic sabotage that we are providing so much assistance to Montenegro. 
   That is merely the economic kind of sabotage. 
   As I just mentioned, the Milosevic regime has been preparing the Yugoslav Army to be able to move against the Djukanovic government. For several years, Milosevic has been sending special troops to join Yugoslav Army units in Montenegro, as well as commanders who would not hesitate to obey orders to attack their Montenegrin ``brethren.'' 
   Ready to defend the legally elected government are the relatively well-armed police force and Interior Ministry troops of the Republic of Montenegro. 
   There have been stand-offs and provocations at border crossings, at Podgorica airport, and elsewhere. 
   So far cooler heads have prevailed, but no one should doubt that Milosevic has a plan to depose Djukanovic, the most prominent remaining democrat in Yugoslavia. Milosevic will undoubtedly wait for another target of opportunity. I have no inside line to Belgrade, but my guess is that he may act when we are preoccupied with the U.S. election campaign this fall and when he hopes that partisan political interest may make reaction to foreign aggression more difficult. More about that later. 
   In any event, it is abundantly clear that Montenegro urgently needs our assistance because it is threatened by the Serbia of Milosevic, through economic pressure and military intimidation. 
   Why, however, does Montenegro deserve our assistance? 
   The answer is simple. Because Montenegro, and President Djukanovic's government, want to do the right thing. 
   President Djukanovic, though still a young man, has traveled a long road. He has gone from being a Yugoslav Communist committed to the preservation of the status quo to being a Western-oriented democrat. 
   I have met with President Djukanovic on several occasions. 
   He is a realist. He knows that the only option for Montenegro is the Western model. That means market economy. That means fair elections and multi-ethnic inclusive politics. That means engagement with the outside world rather than sullen, sulking self-pity. 
   From the beginning, his government has been a coalition of Montenegrins, Slavic Muslims, and ethnic Albanians, 
   During the air campaign in Kosovo, President Djukanovic permitted refugees to enter Montenegro from Kosovo, and from Serbia as well. In fact, some members of the Serbian opposition were safer during that war in Montenegro than in Serbia. 
   Even while Yugoslav Army targets were being bombed in Montenegro, President Djukanovic kept his cool. He understood that what NATO was doing had to be done. 
   Recently, President Djukanovic did something that I think is extraordinary, and ought to be better known. 
   Earlier this summer, he offered an apology. Specifically, on behalf of Montenegro, he said to the Croatian people: I'm sorry for the role that some Montenegrins played in the infamous shelling of Dubrovnik back in 1991. 
   What is going on here? A Balkan leader actually apologizing for ethnic-cleansing and war-crimes? 
   The fact that President Djukanovic made that statement, and that it was accepted as an apology by President Mesic and the Government of Croatia, is highly significant. 
   That kind of statement and reaction represent the only way out of the morass of ethnic hatred that caused, and  could still cause, death and destruction in the former Yugoslavia. 
   In terms of economic reform, the government of President Djukanovic has said that it would like to begin a major privatization of state assets sometime later this year. The United States, our allies, and the international financial institutions not only should support this, but should be involved in it. We have learned from hard experience throughout the former communist world, that if outside powers do not get involved, it is just too tempting for well-placed individuals to cream off the best for themselves, to the disadvantage of the populace as a whole. 
   Montenegro deserves our support, because its government wants to follow good models of governance, economics, and politics, despite the risk that its democratic and free-market policies could bring civil war, military coup, sudden exile, or even worse, assassination. Let us not forget that it was in Montenegro that Milosevic's hit-men shot and wounded Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian opposition leader. Standing up to Milosevic, when you live inside Yugoslavia, takes courage. Standing up to Milosevic in the name of a majority of your 650,000 countrymen, as President Djukanovic is doing, takes quite a bit of courage. 
   It seems clear to me that what we have on our hands in Montenegro is a case where we have American strategic interest combined with a moral imperative. 
   Let us not be caught flat-footed in Montenegro. Let us be vigilant and on guard. 
   First, I call upon our government to make clear to President Milosevic that the United States will not tolerate the overthrow of the legally elected government of Montenegro. 
   Second, I urge in the strongest terms that the United States immediately take the lead within NATO in drawing up detailed contingency plans for responding affirmatively to any request by the Djukanovic government for assistance in repelling aggression by the Yugoslav Army against Montenegro. 
   Third, in order that this not become a partisan issue in the fall election campaign, I urge the Administration to include representatives of both Vice President GORE and Governor Bush in all deliberations on the situation in Montenegro. 
   I hope that all members of Congress, and indeed all Americans, will agree that we owe it to ourselves, to our allies, and to our friends in Montenegro and in the Balkans, to be prepared. As somebody once observed, ``summoning the will to win is one thing; the more important thing is summoning the will to prepare.'' Deterrence is much cheaper than war-fighting. Milosevic must be made to understand that he will not be allowed to get away with his fifth war of aggression in 10 years.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, because of the sudden death of the former mayor of Wilmington, Delaware, who was a close friend of mine, I had to return to Delaware today directly after the funeral for Senator Pastore. Consequently, I was necessarily absent for the roll-call votes on Senate amendments No. 3925 and No. 3927 to the Agriculture Appropriations bill. Had I been present, I would have voted yes on both amendments. 
   The high cost of pharmaceuticals in this country relative to the cost of the same drugs in nearby countries, such as Canada and Mexico, is a major irritant to many seniors struggling to make ends meet in the face of fixed incomes and high expenses for medications. Reimportation of drugs from foreign countries, although it may lower prescription drug costs for Americans, should not be permitted if it will jeopardize the health of this country's citizens. The potential effect of these provisions to reduce pharmaceutical research and development in the U.S. is an unknown but important factor. The controversy over these provisions serves to emphasize once again the need to expand Medicare to provide prescription drug insurance coverage for seniors and the disabled.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the troubled transition from communism to democracy of the largest of the new states in Central Asia, Kazakhstan. That transition is in serious jeopardy because of the authoritarian behavior of Kazakhstan's President, highlighted by the recent capricious arrest of the leader of the political opposition. 
   There are high-stakes, competing forces at work in Kazakhstan: the promise of huge sums of money to be made from exploiting the country's vast natural resources, and the pull of old dictatorial ways against the nascent democratic movement. 
   Last month, I met with a man who could help lead Kazakhstan toward true democracy--a former Prime Minister and outspoken critic of the current regime, Akezhan Kazhegeldin. 
   Unfortunately, the Government of Kazakhstan is doing everything within its power to see that Mr. Kazhegeldin not get this opportunity. 
   Two days ago, he was detained in Rome on an INTERPOL warrant instigated by the Kazakh Government. The charges, which range from terrorism to money laundering, are regarded by our State Department as trumped up and political in nature. 
   This morning word came from Rome that the Italian authorities have shared our Government's assessment of the case and that they have released Mr. Kazhegeldin. 
   But, although I am gratified at this development, the very fact of Mr. Kazhegeldin's arrest is a cause for deep concern for every American who hopes that democracy can take root in every country where Soviet despotism once reigned. 
   This latest arrest is doubly troubling, because it suggests that authoritarian rulers are having at least temporary success in manipulating international organizations, in this case INTERPOL. 
   The International League for Human Rights considers Mr. Kazhegeldin's arrest to be a ``particularly serious violation of article 2 of the INTERPOL Constitution'' because the founders of that organization ``were careful to provide that the INTERPOL network could not be used by authoritarian governments to harass their domestic political opponents.'' 
   The real reason for the arrest was the latest in a series of attempts by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to suppress his political opposition, which is led by Mr. Kazhegeldin. 
   The timing is probably not coincidental. Mr. Kazhegeldin had recently offered to testify before U.S. authorities about corruption at the highest levels in Kazakhstan. 
   This is the second time that President Nazarbayev has had Mr. Kazhegeldin detained by national authorities--there was a similar occurrence in Moscow last fall. In both cases, President Nazarbayev's government filed bogus charges through INTERPOL to have Mr. Kazhegeldin detained. 
   I understand that our own Department of Justice has routinely ignored such INTERPOL notices concerning Mr. Kazhegeldin. 
   In an even more sinister vein, the harassment against Mr. Kazhegeldin's associates has turned to physical violence--his press aide was stabbed in Moscow recently. 
   Mr. President, the stakes in Kazakhstan are extraordinarily high. The country is four times the size of Texas and is blessed with energy resources that even the Lone Star State would envy. 
   For example, it has proven oil reserves of some 15 1/2 billion barrels; areas under the Caspian Sea may yield up to another 30 billion barrels. 
   Estimates of natural gas reserves range from 3 to 6 trillion cubic meters. In addition, there are rich deposits of minerals such as copper, zinc, chromium, and uranium. 
   The Tengiz oil field is currently being worked by U.S., Russian, Kazakh, and other companies. Construction is underway on a pipeline to the Russian port city of Novorossiisk, and Central Asian leaders have signed agreements with Turkey for a Baku-Ceyhan route. 
   But this energy wealth is prospective for now. The big fields have not yet begun to yield, and the country remains poor. 
   Kazakhstan's political landscape remains as undeveloped as its oil fields. Elections have been marked by irregularities to the point where international monitors 
   agree that they have not met democratic standards. In fact--and this speaks volumes about the arrest in Rome--President Nazarbayev was re-elected in 1999 by banning his only real opponent, none other than Akezhan Kazhegeldin. 
   Human rights abuses have been reliably documented and include extrajudicial killings, harsh prison conditions, and torture of detainees. 
   The press in Kazakhstan has been constrained by President Nazarbayev's desire to curb those who would ``harm the country's image in the world.'' In addition, the government owns and controls significant printing and distribution facilities and subsidizes publications. Restraints on the press are severe enough that self-censorship is now practiced. 
   The right of free assembly is restricted by law and by the government. Organizations must apply 10 days in advance to hold a gathering, and local authorities are widely reported to deny such permits. In some instances, demonstrators have been fined or imprisoned. 
   There is, however, one piece of good news, in the area of weapons nonproliferation. Kazakhstan, which was one of four nuclear states formed out of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, has been a vigorous partner with the United States in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. In 1995, President Nazarbayev announced that his country was no longer a nuclear power, after the last of its nuclear warheads had been removed to Russia. 
   On the negative side, however, government officials of Kazakhstan illegally sold 40 Soviet-built MiG 21 fighter jets to North Korea. The officials implicated in the sales have received only minor punishment.  
   The United States has worked with Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian states to promote democracy, economic reform, development of the energy sector, and other goals. In Kazakhstan alone, we provided $600 million in assistance from 1992 to 1999. 
   It is important to note that the Silk Road Strategy Act, passed by this Congress, specifically calls for increased aid to support conflict resolution in the region, humanitarian relief, economic and democratic reform, and institution-building. 
   Finally, the United States has pursued a policy of vigorous engagement with the Government of Kazakhstan, including visits to that country by Secretary of State Albright and First Lady Hillary Clinton. We have also received many of their leaders in Washington, including President Nazarbayev. 
   Kazakhstan, for all of its failings, is important to global security--because of its location, because of its wealth of energy resources, and because of its commitment to remain a nuclear weapons-free state. 
   But no matter how important Kazakhstan is, the United States must forcefully remind President Nazarbayev that acts of harassment such as the arrest of Mr. Kazhegeldin endanger the good relations between our two countries. He must be made to see the benefits of democracy and a free market economy, and the blind alley of authoritarian cronyism. 
   Therefore, I call upon President Nazarbayev to stop his harassment of Mr. Kazhegeldin and the rest of the legitimate political opposition in Kazakhstan. It is these attacks--not the legitimate activities of the political opposition--that are serving to tarnish the reputation of Kazakhstan. This political repression makes the developed nations--whose support and investment Kazakhstan desperately needs--wary of economic involvement there. 
   The United States can work in partnership to build a better life for the people of Kazakhstan, but only if President Nazarbayev understands that political democracy must go hand-in-hand with economic development.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 3 years ago I came to the Senate floor to talk about China and how the United States can best achieve its national interests in the Far East. 
   I spoke then on the eve on two summits which went a long way toward putting the U.S.-China relationship on a firmer foundation. I called for a patient, principled engagement strategy designed to win greater Chinese compliance with international norms in the areas of human rights, nonproliferation, and trade. 
   Three years later, there has been some progress, but also some setbacks. 
   U.S.-China relations remain dogged by uncertainties--each side harbors doubts about the other's intentions, doubts reinforced by allegations of Chinese espionage and the tragic mistaken U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. China's fear of how we might exploit our position as the world's only superpower is matched by our concerns over China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its intimidation tactics against Taiwan. China's leaders decry U.S. ``hegemony'' and ``interference in their internal affairs.'' We worry about whether the Dragon will breathe fire at its neighbors, or just blow smoke. 
   So today I rise at what I believe may be a pivotal moment which will determine our Nation's future in Asia not just for this year, or next year, but for 10 years, 20 years, and into the world my grandchildren will inherit. 
   Three decisions--on national missile defense, on invoking sweeping new unilateral sanctions on China, and on extending permanent normal trade relations to China--will help shape U.S. strategic doctrine and irrevocably alter the security landscape in East Asia for decades to come. They are decisions which must be made in the context of revolutionary changes underway on the  Korean Peninsula and an awakening China which wants to play in major leagues, but is not sure it wants to abide by all the rules of the game. 
   Today I wish to address the first of these three major decisions--national missile defense--as it relates to China and recent developments on the Korean peninsula. 
   Mr. President, I rise with optimism--my mother calls me a ``congenital optimist.'' Not the optimism of a Phillies fan--a blind, fervent optimism born each spring, matured each summer, and dashed against the rocks by fall. No, I speak with the confidence which flows from the enormous capacity and good will of the American people. I am optimistic because we now enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to shape the future in ways which will enhance our national security and preserve our prosperity. 
   I reject the path of unrelieved pessimism and lack of common sense which, to me, underlies much of the thinking of those who believe China must be an enemy of the United States, and that North Korea can neither be deterred nor persuaded to abandon its pursuit of a nuclear missile capability. 
   I reject the pessimism which says that American idealism and the dynamism of American markets are somehow incapable of handling the opportunities which will be ours as China joins the World Trade Organization and opens its markets to the world. 
   But my optimism is informed by realism. 
   Let me put it bluntly: China does not believe that National Missile Defense is oriented against North Korea. According to those who justify a limited national missile defense on the basis of the North Korean threat, North Korea is ruled by a nutcase who by 2005 will be in position to launch an ICBM with weapons of mass destruction against the United States, and will do so without giving one thought to the consequences. 
   Who can blame China for questioning this rationale for a national missile defense? I question it myself. 
   The notion that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il is going to wake up one morning and decide to attack the United States with long-range missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction is absurd! 
   The notion that 5 or 10 long-range missiles would deter us from defending South Korea is equally bogus. Did the Soviet Union's ability to devastate the United States prevent us from defending Europe for a generation and West Berlin in 1961, even in the face of superior Warsaw Pact strength on the ground? No. 
   Did it stop us from forcing the removal of missiles from Cuba in 1963, or from supplying Afghan mujaheddin in their successful struggle against Soviet forces? No. 
   Has China's ability to deliver a nuclear strike against a dozen or more U.S. cities prevented us from defending Taiwan? No, again. 
   Moreover, in the wake of the first North-South Summit meeting ever, the prospects for peaceful reconciliation between North and South Korea are better today than they have been in my lifetime. I'm not saying that peace on the Korean Peninsula is a ``done deal.'' Far from it. North Korea has not withdrawn its heavy artillery. North Korea has not abandoned its missile program. North Korea has not halted all of its support for international terrorist organizations. There is a tremendous amount of hard work to be done. 
   But look at the facts that relate to our decision on national missile defense. 
   The last time North Korea launched a missile, I remind my colleagues, was on August 31, 1998. On that day, a three stage Taepo-Dong missile flew over Japan. The third stage of the missile apparently failed to perform as the North Koreans had hoped, but the mere existence of the third stage surprised many of our experts and caused them to reassess the North's capabilities and to advance the date by which North Korea might develop an ICBM to 2005. 
   But since August 1998, North Korea has not launched a long-range missile. It recently extended indefinitely the test-launch moratorium it implemented 15 months ago. Negotiations are underway right now with the objective of curtailing North Korea's development and export of long-range missiles. 
   Now the pessimists say that North Korea will never agree to forego development, deployment, or export of long-range ballistic missiles. 
   But then, the pessimists also said that the North Koreans would never open their nuclear facilities to round-the-clock monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, would never stop construction on its heavy water nuclear reactors, would never permit World Food Program monitoring of food deliveries throughout North Korea, would never hold a summit meeting with South Korea, would never undertake economic reforms, and so on. Guess what? They have been wrong on all counts. 
   And what does Kim Dae-jung, the President of South Korea, have to say about the temperament of Kim Jong-il? All evidence points to a North Korean leader who is intelligent, 
   rational, and coldly calculating. Not the type of guy who gets up on the wrong side of bed in the morning and decides to ensure the complete annihilation of his country by launching a few nuclear missiles at the United States. 
   How does all this relate to China? The fact is, North Korea is in a world of hurt since the collapse of the Soviet Union. China is the North's major trading partner and aid donor, and it has successfully urged North Korea to engage with South Korea and curtail its missile testing. 
   Why? Is it because China wants to be helpful to us? Perhaps. But I doubt it. 
   No. China is acting in its own self interest. China knows that if North Korea presses ahead with its missile program, the United States is almost certain to deploy a national missile defense against that threat. And if we do, even a limited system will seriously undermine China's tiny nuclear deterrent. 
   China has only a handful of old, silo-based, liquid-fueled missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States. Beijing calculates that any U.S. system sufficient to deal with 10-12 North Korean missiles could also handle 10-20 Chinese ICBMs. And guess what? Notwithstanding our repeated protests to the contrary, they are probably right. 
   So how can we expect China to respond if we foolishly rush ahead with deployment of this unproven, expensive, national missile defense, for which the rationale is evaporating as I speak? 
   Well, for starters, China will have no further incentive to use its influence with North Korea to rein in the North's nuclear missile ambitions. And North Korea, with no reason to trust the United States, may opt to end its missile launch moratorium and proceed full speed with the testing, deployment, and export of long-range ballistic missiles. 
   Second, if we rush to deploy limited NMD, China itself will surely take steps to ensure the survivability of its nuclear arsenal. They have made that painfully clear. We already know that they are planning to move from silo-based liquid-fueled rockets to mobile, solid-fueled rockets which will be much harder for us to locate and destroy. They are probably going to do that no matter what we do. 
   But they have not decided how many missiles to manufacture, or whether to MIRV them. Our actions will have a huge impact on their thinking. We already sent one unfortunate signal when the Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. If we want to guarantee that China will go from fewer than two dozen ICBM's to 200 or 2,000, then by all means, let's just forge ahead with a national missile defense without any consideration for how that decision will affect China's nuclear posture and doctrine. 
   And if China responds as I fear they might, how will India respond? Pakistan? Japan? And if in 5 or 10 years Japan feels compelled to go nuclear, how will South Korea respond? 
   Mr. President, there is a reason why our allies in East Asia are urging caution with respect to the deployment of a national missile defense. They understand that bad U.S.-China relations are bad for regional stability. Listen to what a leading strategist in South Korea, Dr. Lho Kyong-soo of Seoul National University, recently wrote about missile defenses, China, and implications for the U.S.-South Korea alliance:  
   Needless to say, minus a clear-cut image of North Korea as the `enemy,' the security rationale underpinning the alliance is seriously weakened .....  
   Much will depend on how the relationship between the United States and China evolves in the years ahead. If the relationship becomes antagonistic, Seoul will find itself in an extremely delicate position vis-a-vis Beijing, a situation that it would clearly like to avoid at all costs. 
   There appears to be little awareness in Washington, however, how its China policy, should it be mishandled, could have possibly adverse consequences in terms of alliance relations with Seoul, and, in all likelihood, with Tokyo as well. The cautious stance taken by Seoul with respect to the acquisition of even a lower-tier Theater Missile Defense capability is but one example of Seoul's desire not to unnecessarily create friction with Beijing.  
   So, Mr. President, this is a serious business. 
   I believe this body has not yet taken the time to consider the implications of deploying a limited national missile defense for our broader strategic interests in East Asia. I intend to raise these issues and others in the days ahead. If we are not to squander our material wealth and our world leadership, we must consider carefully whether a missile defense will maximize our overall national security.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from New York has yielded me 10 minutes. I will not use the 10 minutes because there will be others who wish to speak. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, the headlines in today's papers say that we are here today discussing estate tax relief, an issue that affects a little less than 2 percent of Americans. 
   The issue before us is much bigger than that. We are debating the fundamental principles that should guide us in the new era of budget surpluses. 
   We cannot, we must not, lose sight of that larger picture. If we focus on the narrow picture of a tax cut here, a spending program there, we run the risk of wasting all the hard work and sacrifice that has brought us to the best economic and budget era in our history. 
   The real task before us today is to set the priorities for this era. This debate over the estate tax is just one part of that debate, but it is an important part. 
   Let's be clear about this--the amendment I am offering right now, with my friends from New York and Indiana and Louisiana, would repeal the estate tax for all families with estates up to $4 million, and for all family farms and businesses up to $8 million. And, it would leave room for a tuition tax credit to help middle class Americans pay for the rising cost of a college education. 
   Our proposal, the Democratic alternative proposal that Senator MOYNIHAN introduced earlier today, would eliminate those taxes sooner than the Republican plan, and would remove virtually all of the cases from the estate tax roles that have been employed as examples by the majority in this debate. 
   The majority would rather send their plan to the certain fate of a Presidential veto than cut the taxes of the family farmers and family businesses they claim to care about. 
   They would rather have an issue than a tax cut. Their proposal would cut the top tax rates for the richest of the rich first, and delay for 10 years the tax relief for family farms and businesses. 
   By the time any tax relief gets to those farmers and small businessmen, the Republican plan will cost at least $50 billion a year--half a trillion over 10 years--effectively squeezing out any hope for deficit reduction, strengthening Social Security, other tax cuts, or any other priorities we will face. 
   The plan I am offering with my colleagues today offers relief for family farms and businesses up front--and leaves room for other priorities. 
   The priority I want to stress is the need to help with the spiraling cost of college tuition. 
   Mr. President, I am glad to join the Senator from New York in offering this amendment to make higher education more affordable for America's families. 
   As a college degree becomes increasingly vital in today's global economy, the costs associated with obtaining this degree continue to skyrocket. At the same time, the annual income of the average American family is not keeping pace with these soaring costs. Since 1980, college costs have been rising at an average of 2 to 3 times the Consumer Price Index. 
   Now, in the most prosperous time in our history, it is simply unacceptable that the key to our children's future success has become a crippling burden for middle-class families. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, the average annual costs associated with attending a public 4-year college during the 1998-1999 school year, including tuition, fees, room, and board were $8,018. For a private 4-year school these costs rose to an astonishing $19,970. 
   And these are only the average costs, Mr. President. The price tag for just one year at the nation's most prestigious universities is fast approaching the $35,000 range. 
   In 1996, and again in 1997, I introduced the ``GET AHEAD'' Act, Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable. My main goal in introducing this legislation was to help the average American family afford to send their children to college. 
   Although this legislation never came before the full Senate for a vote, I was extremely pleased that a number of the provisions of the GET AHEAD Act--including the student loan interest deduction and the establishment of education savings accounts--were included as part of the 1997 tax bill. 
   Additionally, two other provisions of that bill--the Hope Scholarship and the  Lifetime Learning Credit--were based upon the core proposal of my GET AHEAD Act--a $10,000 tuition deduction. 
   I have been advocating tuition deduction since I first announced my candidacy for the Senate 28 years ago. Earlier this year, I was pleased that the President made a proposal in his State of the Union Address which would finally fully enact this proposal. 
   The amendment Senators SCHUMER, BAYH, LANDRIEU, and I are offering today will provide America's middle class families with a tax deduction of up to $12,000 for the costs of college tuition and fees. 
   Middle-class families who struggle to send their kids to college should get some tax relief. We should not be giving tax cuts to those who need them least. 
   The proposal Senator SCHUMER and I are offering is a tax cut that makes sense. It is a tax cut that benefits the middle class, and it is a tax cut that is an investment in America's future. 
   Mr. President, the dream of every American is to provide for their child a better life than they themselves had. A key component in attaining that dream is ensuring that their children have the education necessary to successfully compete in the expanding global economy. 
   It is my hope that the proposal we are offering today will help many American families move a step closer in achieving this dream and be able to better afford to send their children to college. 
   I am proud to join Senator SCHUMER. He and I, together and separately, have been pushing for this relief for middle-class taxpayers to send their kids to college for a long time. I apologize to my colleague, BILL ROTH, for whom I have great respect. He has heard me on this hobby horse about tuition tax credit longer than he cares. I am not suggesting he does not share the same concern, but I apologize. He has heard me make this speech since 1973 when I was a freshman Senator. 
   As one of the folks in Delaware said to me: BIDEN, when are you going to get off that hobby horse? I am not going to get off the hobby horse because, as the Senator from New York indicated, as a matter of public policy, we should be making it easier, not harder, for children to go to college. We should not make these false distinctions between you are able, maybe, to get to a community college or to a junior college or maybe your State college, but you are not going to be able to get to a private institution. 
   If a child has the intellectual capacity, interest, and drive and they are able to go to Harvard or the University of Chicago or one of the great institutions in America where we all know you get a little leg up--I had one son graduate from Syracuse Law School and did just as well as the son who graduated from Yale Law School, but the marks of the kid who went to Yale Law School were no different than the one who went to Syracuse Law School. He got his ticket punched, a ticket to ride. We all know it makes a difference to what school you have access. 
   We have essentially priced middle-class kids out of the finer institutions. They may not learn any more coming out of those institutions, but they get a heck of a lot more opportunities, which I can say as a graduate of my State university, of which I am proud. 
   Since 1980, college costs have been rising on average two to three times the Consumer Price Index. Now in the most prosperous time in our history, people still have trouble. Let me give my colleagues a little idea. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, the average annual costs with attending a public 4-year college during the 1998-1999 school year, including tuition, fees, room, and board were $8,018. For a private university, that average cost was $19,000. If you decide to send your child or your child decides they wish to go to a private university--I had one go to Georgetown, one go to Penn, and one go to Tulane. That is a total of over $100,000 a year in tuition, which is the reason I have the dubious distinction of being rated as one of the poorest men in the U.S. Congress. I am not poor. I live in a beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood. I do not think I am poor, but I have $125,000 in debts for college tuition. 
   The good news is, as the Senator said, I was able to borrow it because I had a nice enough house to borrow against on a second mortgage. What happens to the average American who has a good income, they have a decent income--the wife is making $30,000 or $40,000, and the husband is making $30,000 or $40,000. That is 70,000, 80,000, 90,000 bucks a year. After taxes, what do they have? Maybe somewhere between $40,000 and $50,000. After they write that first semester tuition check for 15 grand, like I am about to do for Tulane University, they are in pretty deep trouble. Every middle-class American knows that. What I am a little concerned about is we are paying very little 
   attention to this. This is about priorities. 
   I had a different bill than my friend from New York. Mine was $10,000 up to $120,000. His is $12,000. His has some better features than mine, but we joined forces to make the case. My dad always said to me: Champ, I tell you what, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is important to you, unless you have priorities. 
   This is about priorities. If the Senator from New York and I had our way and we could make this country as great as it is now without any taxes, we, like everybody else here, would vote against any tax for anything. I am all for no taxes, but what are our choices? Our choices are we cannot cut all taxes. So the question comes: What are we going to do in cutting taxes? Are we going to spend $134 billion over the next 10 years to deal with the ``death tax'' and $750 billion over the next 10 after that, or are we going to spend $40 billion over 10 years, as the Senator from New York----

   Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 30 more seconds. Are we going to spend $40 billion to provide for the opportunity for this to truly be an egalitarian system, a meritocracy? 
   When we graduated from school in the early 1960s and late 1960s, and when our parents did in the 1930s, you needed a high school education to make it, and a college education was nice. Now you need a college education just to make it. 
   So I think people should be able to deduct at least this $12,000 and get a tax credit. This is a matter of priorities. The priorities should be to take care of the middle class first. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time.

    Mr. BIDEN. I rise today to comment briefly on an extremely thought-provoking opinion piece by Josef Joffe in the June 20th edition of the New York Times. The article was entitled ``A Warning from Putin and Schroeder.'' It describes how the current global predominance of the United States is being countered by constellations of countries, which include allies and less-friendly powers alike, and how American behavior is aiding and abetting this development. 
   Mr. Joffe is the co-editor of the prestigious German weekly Die Zeit. He received his university education in the United States and is well known and respected in American foreign policy  circles. In short, his thoughts are advice from a friend, not hostile criticism from an embittered or jealous antagonist. 
   The take-off point of the article, from which its headline is derived, was the recent summit meeting in Berlin between German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian President Vladimir Putin during which Putin employed the classic Muscovite tactic of wooing Europe's key country in an effort to have it join Russia as a counterweight to us. 
   Fair enough, Joffe says. Whenever the international system has been dominated by one power, a natural movement to restore the balance has arisen. With regard to the United States, this is nothing new--the Chinese, as well as the Russians, have been decrying a ``unipolar world'' and ``hegemonism'' for years. 
   But Germany--the country the United States practically reinvented from the ashes of World War II, ushered back into the civilized family of nations, and then stood out as the only champion of re-unification only a decade ago? No matter how gushy a host he wished to be, how could the Chancellor of this Germany suddenly be calling for a ``strategic partnership'' with Russia? 
   One answer, according to Joffe, is the obvious and passionate hostility to the U.S. national missile defense project, known popularly as NMD, which the Russians and our German allies--for that matter, all of our European allies--share. 
   A second reason can be traced to the obvious shock at the overwhelming American military superiority shown in last year's Yugoslav air campaign. The manifest European military impotence impelled the European Union to launch its own security and defense policy, which NATO is now struggling to integrate into the alliance. 
   To some extent, then, the very fact of our current power--military, economic, and cultural--makes attempts at creating a countervailing force nearly inevitable. 
   But there is more. It is not only the policy that spawned NMD that irritates our European allies. What also irks them is the cavalier way in which we neglected to consult with them in our rush to formulate that policy. As Joffe trenchantly puts it, ``America is so far ahead of the crowd that it has forgotten to look back.'' 
   In this, the second half of his explanation, I fear that Joffe is on to something: a new kind of American hubris. Again, his use of English is enviable. He describes the behavior of Congress these days as ``obliviousness with a dollop of yahooism'' (I assume he isn't talking about the search engine). 
   Mr. President, no one loves and respects this body more than I do. I believe that the American people is exceedingly well served by the one hundred Senators, all of whom are intelligent and hard-working. 
   Nevertheless, I note with dismay an increasing tendency in this chamber--I will leave judgments of the House of Representatives to others--for Members to advocate aspects of foreign policy with a conscious disregard, occasionally even disdain, for the opinions of our allies and the impact our policies have on them. 
   This kind of unilateralism was exhibited in the floor debate last fall on ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by one of my colleagues who, in responding to an article jointly authored by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, and German Chancellor Schroeder, declared: ``I don't care about our allies. I care about our enemies.'' 
   No one, Mr. President, is advocating abandoning or compromising the national interest of the United States simply because our allies oppose this or that aspect of our foreign and security policy. 
   But power--in the current context, our unparalleled power--must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility. 
   Mr. Joffe alludes to this power-and-responsibility duality in recalling the golden age of bipartisan American foreign policy in the years immediately following the Second World War, when Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg and Democratic President Harry S. Truman collaborated on halting the spread of communism and on helping create the international institutions that remain the cornerstones of our world more than half a century later. As he puts it ``responsibility must defy short-term self-interest or the domestic fixation of the day.'' 
   Mr. President, one does not have to agree with all of Joffe's arguments to admit that his assertions at least merit our serious consideration. For if we do not begin to realize that even the United States of America needs to factor in the opinions of its friends when formulating foreign policy, it may not have many friends to worry about in the future. 
   And if that development occurs, we will almost certainly no longer retain the sole superpower status that we now enjoy.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, with Senator HATCH, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. And I thank Senator HATCH, the principal cosponsor of the original Act, for working with me over the past year to produce a bipartisan, streamlined bill that we are confident will enjoy the support of Senators from both sides of the aisle. Indeed, we already have a total of 50 cosponsors--many of them Republicans--as original cosponsors of this legislation. 
   The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994--bipartisan legislation cosponsored by 67 Senators from both parties--signaled the beginning of a national and historic commitment to the women and children in this country victimized by family violence and sexual assault. 
   The legislation changed our laws, strengthened criminal penalties, facilitated enforcement of protection orders from state to state, and committed $1.6 billion over six years to police, prosecutors, battered women shelters, a national domestic violence hotline, and other measures designed to crack down on batterers and offer the support and services that victims need in order to leave their abusers. 
   And this federal commitment has paid off: the latest Department of Justice statistics show that overall, violence against women by intimate partners is down, falling 21% from 1993 (just prior to the enactment of the original Act) to 1998. 
   The programs contained in the original Act were authorized only through fiscal year 2000. So unless Congress acts, programs to run the battered women's shelters, the national domestic violence hotline, the STOP grants to help law enforcement and prosecutors combat domestic violence and to provide victims services, grants to address domestic violence in rural communities--all of these will expire this year. These programs are popular, and more importantly, ladies and gentlemen, the Violence Against Women Act is working. 
   And it's not just me calling for this law to be reauthorized. 
   It's police chiefs in every state. It's Attorneys General. Sheriffs. District attorneys. The American Bar Association. Women's groups. Nurses. Battered women's shelters. Family Court judges. 
   States, counties, cities, and towns across the country are creating a seamless network of services for victims of violence against women--from law enforcement to legal services, from medical care and crisis counseling, to shelters and support groups. 
   The Violence Against Women Act has made, and is making, a real difference in the lives of millions of women and children by providing much needed funds at the local level to--and let me just give you a few examples: 
   Give police officers more specialized training both to deal swiftly and surely with abusers and to become more sensitive toward victims, as well as to provide them with better evidence-gathering and information-sharing equipment and skills; 
   Train prosecutors and judges on the unique aspects of cases involving violence against women; 
   Hire victim advocates and counselors and provide an array of services, including 24-hour hotlines, emergency transportation, medical services, and specialized programs to reach victims of violence against women from all walks of life; and 
   Open new and expand existing shelters for victims of violence against women and their children. 
   The Violence Against Women Act funds 1,031 shelters and 82 safe houses in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. But tens of thousands of women and children are still turned away every year. 
   Together--at the federal, state, and local levels--we have been steadily moving forward, step by step, along the road to ending this violence once and for all. But there is more that we can do, and more that we must do. 
   The Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of 2000 would accomplish three basic things: 
   First, the bill would reauthorize through Fiscal Year 2005 the key programs included in the original Violence Against Women Act. These include the STOP grants, the Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement Grants, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and rape prevention and education programs. 
   This also means reauthorizing the court-appointed special advocate program (CASA), and other programs in the Victims of Child Abuse Act. 
   Second, the bill would extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund through Fiscal Year 2005. Funding for the trust fund expires this year. This dedicated funding source--paid for by the savings generated by reducing the federal workforce by more than 300,000 employees--provides all the grant money for additional police officers, prosecutors, and battered women shelters. It is these funds that provide the specialized domestic violence training for law enforcement and prosecutors. 
   The Trust Fund is the source of funding for all the victim services, including counseling, legal services, nursing and hospital services, especially designed for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  
   Of course, the Trust Fund's significance extends beyond the Violence Against Women Act. The trust fund has provided the funds for a host of successful law enforcement initiatives, ranging from drug courts; the weed and seed programs that exist in every state to drive drugs from our cities; and funding for prisons, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and Boys and Girls clubs. And the list goes on. 
   In order to replicate the successes we have achieved under the original Violence Against Women Act, and in order to continue to pursue these other important law enforcement programs, it is imperative that we: (1) extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for an additional five years, and (2) that we fully fund the Trust Fund. 
   Third, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 makes some targeted improvements that our experience with the original Act has shown to be necessary. Let me give you just a few examples. 
   Civil Legal Assistance Grants: Our bill would create a separate grant program to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault who need legal assistance because of that violence, to obtain access to legal services at little to no cost. 
   This provision would also establish a database of legal assistance providers to be maintained and used by the National Domestic Violence Hotline, so that victims who call the hotline can be directed to a legal service provider immediately. 
   Improving Full Faith & Credit Enforcement of Protection Orders: My bill would help states and tribal courts improve interstate enforcement of civil protection orders, as required by the original Violence Against Women Act. The program would prioritize the development and enhancement of data collection and sharing systems to promote tracking and enforcement of protection orders across the nation. 
   Transitional Housing: The bill would also authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to provide short-term housing assistance and short-term support services to individuals and their dependents who are homeless or in need of transitional housing or other housing assistance as a result of fleeing a situation of domestic violence, and for whom emergency shelter services are unavailable or insufficient. 
   Safe Havens for Children: The bill would authorize a new two-year pilot grant program to be administered by the Department of Justice aimed at reducing the opportunity for domestic violence to occur during the transfer of children for visitation purposes by expanding the availability of supervised visitation for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse. We all know that women are at greatest risk of assault at the time when children are transferred between parents. 
   I also would like to take this opportunity to point out that the Supreme Court's recent decision in United States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000), invalidated a single provision of the original Act, the ``civil rights remedy'' that permitted a victim of gender-motivated violence to sue her attacker in federal court. No other provision in the original Act--or, for that matter, in the Violence Against Women Act of 2000--is affected by the Supreme Court's decision. 
   Finally, I would like to comment on where we are and how we got here. 
   The bill Senator HATCH and I are introducing today is a streamlined version of S. 51, the legislation I originally introduced at the beginning of the 106th Congress. 
   Since I first introduced S. 51, I have consulted extensively with Senator HATCH and with many other individuals, inside and outside of the Senate, and on both sides of the aisle, in an effort to narrow the legislation to produce a bill that every Senator, regardless of party, can enthusiastically support. 
   In the course of that effort, I agreed to drop a number of items that quite frankly, I think were worth doing, and made other concessions. I did that because I believe it is critical, in the waning days of this legislative session, to achieve a strong bipartisan consensus on the essential elements that must be included in this bill. I am convinced that we have reached that consensus, and that the bill we now propose reflects the priorities of a substantial majority of Senators. 
   For far too long, law enforcement, prosecutors, the courts, and the community at large treated domestic abuse as a ``private family matter,'' looking the other way when women suffered abuse at the hands of their supposed loved ones. Thanks in part to the original Act, violence against women is no longer a private matter, and the time when a woman has to suffer in silence because the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend has passed. 
   The bill I introduce today will renew the commitment we made as a nation in 1994 to combat family violence, sexual assault, and stalking. I urge all of you to support it.

   Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator from Tennessee leaves, let me say that I think his rendition of Chinese behavior and proliferation is accurate. I remind all Members to keep that in mind when we vote on a national missile defense system. 
   Right now, I point out, as my friend on the Intelligence Committee knows, China has a total of 18 intercontinental ballistic missiles. If we go forward with the national missile defense system that we are contemplating, and if we must abrogate the ABM Treaty in order to do that, I am willing to bet any Member on this floor that China goes to somewhere between 200 and 500 ICBMs within 5 years. 
   It is bad that China still proliferates missile technology. It is even more awesome that they may decide they are no longer merely going to have a ``city buster'' deterrent, which is no threat to our military capability in terms of our hardened targets and silos. If we deploy a national missile defense, they may decide that they must become a truly major nuclear power. 
   I also point out that, notwithstanding that everything the Senator said is true, I do believe there is hope in engagement. There is no question that the reason North Korea is, at least at this moment--and no one knows where it will go from here--is withholding missile testing, at least at this moment adhering to the deal made with regard to not reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, at least has begun discussions with South Korea, is in no small part because of the intervention of China. 
   As the Senator from Tennessee and the rest of my colleagues know, foreign policy is a complicated thing. We may find ourselves having to balance competing interests. I am not defending China's action. As the Senator may know, I am the guy who, with Senator HELMS 5 years ago, attempted to sanction China for their sale of missile technology to Pakistan. However, I think that as this develops and we look at the other complicated issues we will have to vote on, we must keep in mind that, as bad as their behavior is, we sure don't want them fundamentally changing their nuclear arsenal. I don't want them MIRVing missiles. I don't want them deciding that they are to become a major nuclear power. 
   I respectfully suggest that before we make a decision on national missile defense, we should know what we are about to get, for what we are bargaining for. Maybe we can build a defensive system that could intercept somewhere between 5 and 8 out of 7 or 10 missiles fired from North Korea. 
   As they used to say in my day on bumper stickers, ``One nuclear bomb can ruin your day.'' 
   I am not sure, when we balance all of the equities of the concerns about what is in the interest of those pages on the Senate floor and their children, that if deployment of a national missile defense starts an arms race in Asia, it is actually in their interest in the long run. 
   I thank the Senator for his pointing out exactly what China is doing.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the managers from Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee for accepting my amendment yesterday, which was a resolution arguing that we should restore the moneys that we cut from the NADR funding line in the State Department. The Foreign Operations Appropriation bill cut a lot of money out of a proposal and recommendation from the authorizing committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   We cut a significant amount of money out of some vital programs that we have to support nonproliferation, antiterrorism, and related programs. As a matter of fact, the 10 programs in this category are all on the front line of protecting our people from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, the funding in the Foreign Operations bill for 7 of those 10 programs was 37 percent below the levels requested by the President. And that is without counting another $30 million that was cut because the Foreign Operations Subcommittee concluded that a new counterterrorism training center had to be funded in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill instead. 
   The national security and the very things my friend from Tennessee is talking about require that we provide substantially more of those requested funds. 
   Let me describe the programs that are treated so badly. In the nonproliferation field, we have the Department of State's Export Control Assistance program, which helps foreign countries to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Recently, Customs agents in Uzbekistan, for example, stopped the shipment of radioactive contraband to Kazakhstan, which was on its way to Iran with an official destination of Pakistan. Press stories suggest that the shipment was really intended for an Afghanistan terrorist group affiliated with Osama bin Laden, who would have used it to build a radiological weapon for use against Americans. 
   Those Customs agents were trained in the United States. The equipment they used to detect the radioactive material was provided by the United States. In that case, the funding came from the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which is in another appropriations bill. But the Export Control Assistance Program has provided the same sort of assistance when the Nunn-Lugar program could not be used, and it regularly helps other countries enact the laws and regulations they need in order to be effective in export control. 
   The personal ties that are forged by this program with export officials in other countries are equally critical in improving other countries' export controls and their willingness to work with us. 
   I cite that as one example. We are cutting by 37 percent on average the non-proliferation and anti-terrorism programs. We are cutting by 37 percent on average those programs that allow us to train customs agents and others in detecting the transfer of the very material my friend from the State of Tennessee is talking about being transferred. None of that is transferred in the open. China doesn't say, ``By the way, we are about to send to Pakistan the following.'' They don't do that. It is all done surreptitiously. How we are cutting funds to deal with the transport of materials that cause the proliferation to rise as it has is beyond me. It is absolutely beyond my comprehension. 
   There are many other aspects of the program. Last year Congress increased funding for this program from $10 million to $14 million. Indeed, the report for the Foreign Operations Appropriation bill takes credit for the increase. This year the President asked for $14 million to maintain the level we set up last year. But what happened? The appropriations bill cut it back down to $10 million. I don't get this. Hello? What is going on here? The committee takes credit for raising this program's budget and then cuts it back down? If there is a logic here, I fail to see it. 
   The fact is that last year, when it came to this program, the appropriators were right. This year they should do again just what they did last year. But they did not. That is why my co-sponsors and I offered our amendment, and I am grateful to the managers for their acceptance of that amendment; I hope the conferees will take it to heart. 
   We need more export control assistance to help other countries keep nuclear materials out of the hands of their dangerous neighbors. Earlier this month the National Commission on Terrorism warned that it:  
   ..... was particularly concerned about the persistent lack of adequate security and safeguards for the nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.  
   That is a cogent concern, one my friend from Tennessee and I and others have talked about on this floor. Export control assistance is one of the programs that helps keep those dangerous materials from crossing the former Soviet borders. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee is on record as favoring full funding of the request for this program. Indeed, it was suggested by Senator HELMS we add another $5 million to our security assistance to support strategic cargo X-ray facilities that would be used in the free port of Malta. Malta is a crossroads for shipping in the Mediterranean area and sometimes it has been the doorway for contraband flowing to Libya. You might think appropriators  would pay attention to such a sensible suggestion, but the Foreign Operations Appropriation bill did the opposite. 
   Another non-proliferation program, International Science and Technology Centers, would provide safe employment opportunities for former Soviet experts. There are thousands and thousands of Soviet experts, nuclear experts. They are not getting paid. They don't have housing. Their economy is in the toilet. We have a program: We want to hire them. We don't want Qadhafi hiring them. We don't want them being hired in Libya. We don't want them hired in North Korea. So we have a sensible program. 
   I will end with this. There are 4 more examples, but I will not take the time. 
   What do we do? We cut these programs. Then we all stand--and I am not speaking of any particular Senator--and say we are going to fight terrorism, and nonproliferation is our greatest concern, and we are worried about this technology changing hands. The bottom line is the programs that help to do that are cut. That is why it is so important that our amendment of yesterday be implemented in conference. 
   I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of the effort here today--led by Senator CHAFEE--to put the Senate on record in support of United States' participation in an international program to lift the burden of debt from the poorest countries of the world. That is the HIPC program, named for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries for which it is intended. 
   With this amendment the Senate is now on record in support of a simple, but powerful, idea. 
   Right now, in the poorest countries of the world, desperately needed resources--including both money and some of the best-educated public officials--are used to pay money to the richest industrial economies. That's right--they are sending money to us. 
   That is happening because, over the years, we and our allies have loaned substantial amounts to those countries, often to pursue our own goals of fighting communism during the Cold War or for other foreign policy purposes. That often meant that we turned a blind eye to the problems in those countries, including how their governments might spend the money, or if they had any hope of repayment. 
   The perverse result is that, while we seek to promote economic growth and opportunity in the least developed countries of the world, at the same time we continue to collect payments on those debts. At a time when foreign assistance of all kinds is shrinking, we continue to expect these countries to send money to us, most commonly to pay the interest to simply service their debts. 
   And this is no small problem for these poor countries. Many of them will spend more on just servicing the interest on their debts than they do on childhood immunizations, or education. 
   That is not just unconscionable, Mr. President, it is bad policy. It defeats many of our best efforts to help those countries turn the corner to more sustainable economic growth and development. 
   There is so little chance that these countries will ever be able to pay off the principal on these loans that we carry them on our own books at just a few cents on the dollar. That means that it will cost us very little to give a great deal of benefit to these countries. 
   Those benefits come not just from the lifting of the debt itself. The HIPC program requires that each country that is to receive debt relief must draw up and stick to a plan for social and economic development, reducing poverty and creating sustainable growth. 
   Banks here in the United States and all around the world know that when there is no chance that a loan will be repaid, you take it off the books. 
   But the HIPC program is more than just a bookkeeping matter--it is a way of leveraging money that we are unlikely to ever see into essential resources for the neediest countries. 
   Earlier this year, I made full authorization of the HIPC program my top priority when the Foreign Relations Committee passed its first foreign assistance authorization bill in fifteen years. With the cooperation of Senator HELMS, we reached agreement on all of the pieces needed for full U.S. participation in the HIPC program, participation which we have already pledged, along with our partners among the advanced industrial nations. 
   That legislation authorized full funding, at the levels requested by the Administration earlier this year, as well as the authorization needed from us to permit the International Monetary Fund to dedicate to the debt relief effort the proceeds from a revaluation of their gold holdings. 
   As it stands, the Foreign Operations Bill before us today cuts the Administration's request of $262 million for debt relief by $187 million--that's a cut of more than 70 percent. That affects both the HIPC program and another priority of mine, the Tropical Forest Protection Act, a debt-for-nature program that was established with strong bi-partisan support. 
   While this amendment will not change that situation, it does put the Senate on record in favor of changing it, when this process is once again engaged later on in this session. 
   Whatever disagreements we have about the IMF, the World Bank, or other aspects of foreign assistance, we should all be able to support this program. The HIPC program comes with its own strong program that the poor countries must comply with to be eligible for debt relief. 
   It stands on its own merits and should not be tangled up in other debates. Given the heavy burdens on these poor countries, relief delayed is relief denied. Every day that debt relief is put off, those obligations continue to sap their limited resources.  
   This is a program that has the support of a strong, ecumenical, inter-faith effort by the world's major religions. The Pope, the Reverend Billy Graham, and other religious leaders have dedicated their time and effort to making debt relief a reality. 
   Considering the small and shrinking support we give to the poorest nations, and the importance to us of their economic health and stability, this is an issue where conscience and economic common sense agree. 
   Again, I want to thank Senator CHAFEE, Senator SARBANES, Senator HAGEL, and all of our cosponsors, for keeping this issue before us. I am confident that at the end of the day, we will do what is right, and fully fund this worthy program. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, by now it should come as no secret that I believe that the bill as it stands right now is inadequately funded. The foreign operations appropriation bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation we pass each year. Yet for the past several years Congress has not been devoting the necessary funds to this portion of the budget. 
   Due in large part to the crucial need for the Colombia supplemental I am going to vote yes on final passage. The Pastrana government urgently and desperately needs these funds to continue its fight against drug lords who are not only undermining the stability and viability of Colombia as a nation, but who are literally killing the people of two nations: Colombians through violence, and Americans through drugs. The government of Colombia deserves our help as they put their lives on the line to stop the production of illegal drugs. I think the outcome of the votes rejecting the Wellstone and Gorton amendments, which would have significantly decreased the amounts available in the supplemental, showed that the majority of my colleagues agree about the severity of the problem in that country and the necessity of U.S. aid. 
   During the course of this debate, we have been faced with having to make several other untenable decisions. I and my colleagues have had to come to the floor and in essence attempt to get blood from a rock. I believe that we need more money for non-proliferation, anti-terrorism, and de-mining. My colleague Senator FEINGOLD rightly believes that the amount designated for the Mozambique supplemental appropriation needs to be increased. 
   Senator BOXER has attempted to channel more funds towards combating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. 
   In every instance, each of us has been stymied by the fact that there is not enough money in this bill. It simply isn't there. So we are left with the option of either not attempting to raise the level of appropriations for programs that we think are important, or of using different political maneuvers, none of which is particularly effective, to get the money that we feel these programs need. We should not have to face a choice between helping victims of flooding in Mozambique, and preventing the spread of AIDS. The United States should be able to help with these activities as well as drug eradication and non-proliferation. 
   I spoke briefly this morning about the shortfall in the NADR accounts, and at length yesterday about Plan Colombia. These are not the only accounts about which I am concerned. Development assistance is shortchanged, funds for voluntary peacekeeping activities fall below requested amounts, and as the Senator from Wisconsin points out, the President's request for resources to aid victims of the flooding in Mozambique is virtually ignored. I will continue to go on record as being adamantly and staunchly opposed to any attempts to undertake diplomacy on the cheap. That is what the Senate is attempting to do here. By neglecting to grant the administration's request for development assistance and economic support, we are robbing ourselves. 
   According to a report published in April by a nonpartisan research organization called the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, spending on development aid--defined as all international development and humanitarian assistance, as well as economic support fund monies--measured either as a share of the federal budget or as a share of the U.S. economy, will be lower than at any time in the fifty years before 1998. The report further states that out of the countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United States ranked ``the lowest of all ..... OECD countries examined in the share of national resources devoted to development of poor countries.'' 
   Some would argue that this is because the administration has not asked for enough money. I would answer that constitutionally, Congress controls the purse strings, thus we have only ourselves to blame. I suggest that we make a commitment to take  corrective action, because our foreign assistance programs are vital to our national interests. 
   Foreign assistance helps us further international peace and security. U.S. citizens and citizens of the world benefit from programs that U.S. assistance pays for. I spoke before about programs aimed at keeping Russian scientists from being employed by states intent on developing nuclear and biological weapons of mass destruction. I am sure that we can all agree that keeping these scientists out of countries such as Iraq makes for a safer world. 
   When the United States provides assistance to Colombia for crop substitution programs, it is the citizens of the United States who benefit. Less drug production means less drugs on the streets of our neighborhoods. When the United States funds vaccines for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, we are helping to protect our own citizens from being infected by these illnesses. 
   Every time United States economic support funds help bolster a new democracy, we widen America's sphere of influence in the hopes of increasing security for the United States. And the preceding represent only a few of the ways in which our foreign assistance aids in promoting our national security. I could go on at length about the positive effects of aid to the Middle East, Russia, and Eastern Europe. Programs in these regions have prevented conflict, helped build economic and financial infrastructure, and combated transnational crime and corruption. 
   Let me conclude by saying this: our foreign assistance is a preventative tool. The idea behind it is to aid in building a community of like-minded states, states free of internal conflict, states that get along with their neighbors. If we are able to do that, if we are successful with our preventative tools in increasing security, then we will never have to use our corrective tool--that of military action--to achieve security. Think about that. If prevention works, correction is not necessary. Given the sentiments of some Members of this chamber about the commitment of our soldiers overseas, doesn't it make sense to make every effort to prevent our troops from having to deploy? 
   Some of my colleagues urge frugality in our foreign assistance spending. I agree with the notion that Congress should spend wisely. However I would caution against an approach that is penny-wise and pound foolish. Mr. President, I cannot emphasize this point enough, and it brings back to what I said at the beginning of my remarks: We cannot obtain security on the cheap. By stinting on our foreign assistance programs we are shortchanging our national security. 
   As the administration indicated in their statement regarding this bill, if the sum appropriated for our foreign operations is not increased, the President will have no choice but to veto this legislation. I sincerely hope that as the fiscal year comes to a close, the allocation for the foreign operations appropriation is significantly increased, and conferees distribute any additional amounts wisely. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to begin a discussion of the tremendous strategic consequences which may flow from events now underway on the Korean Peninsula. 
   As we debate spending on non-proliferation programs--including support for the Korean Energy Development Organization created by the 1994 Agreed Framework, which was significantly reduced in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill just passed by the Senate--it is important to keep the big picture in mind. We need to remain flexible in the face of a changing world, avoiding the twin pitfalls of rigidity and what Fed Chairman Alan  Greenspan refers to as ``irrational exuberance.'' 
   Our decisions today will help shape the strategic environment that our children and grandchildren will live with tomorrow. 
   I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I think I have a good handle on some of the key questions, and I hope my colleagues will bear them in mind as we move forward. 
   A decade after the end of the cold war, the American people are entitled to feel puzzled and dismayed by the continued hostile division of the Korean peninsula along the 38th Parallel. More than a million soldiers, including 37,000 Americans, thousands of artillery tubes, and hundreds of tanks, are clustered along a heavily-fortified border 155 miles long. If ever a place were ill-named, it would be the so-called ``Demilitarized Zone'' on the Korean Peninsula. 
   Today, the two Koreas could not be more different. 
   North of the DMZ, people live in unimaginable poverty and hardship. As many as 2 million North Korean have perished as a result of famine and disease over the past 4 years. 
   The 22 million who have survived live under one of the most repressive and brutal regimes on the planet. 
   Their leader, Kim Jong-il, was, until recently, a recluse. We didn't know much about him, although there were plenty of rumors. He was said to be mad, irrational, a playboy obsessed by Hollywood movies. He was the ``perfect rogue'' in charge of the world's most dangerous ``rougue'' nation. 
   South of the DMZ, 47 million Koreans live in a flourishing democracy, one of the most productive societies on the planet. They enjoy one of the highest living standards in Asia, or indeed, in the world. Their country is completing a remarkable transformation from authoritarian rule to full-throated democracy. 
   They are a steadfast U.S. ally, and have shed blood and put their lives on the line alongside U.S. forces from Vietnam to the Middle East. 
   South Korea's leader, President Kim Dae-jung, is a visionary and a man of peace. Long imprisoned for his support for democracy and rapprochement with North Korea, Kim had the courage to extend a hand of peace and friendship across that DMZ, and the peninsula may never be the same. 
   Mr. President, the Korean Peninsula is hallowed ground. 
   This is where Americans of the 2nd Infantry division struggled their way up Heartbreak Ridge in order to help secure a defensive line which has remained static for the past 50 yrs. It is a battlefield on which 900,000 Chinese, 520,000 North Korean, 250,000 south Korean, and more than 33,000 American combatants lost their lives. It is ground on which as many as 3 million civilians--ten percent of the total population--perished during three years of desperate fighting. 
   The Korean Peninsula is also perilous ground. 
   The North has not withdrawn any of its heavy artillery poised along the Demilitarized Zone. It has not yet ended all of its support for terrorist organizations. And, perhaps of greatest concern to the U.S., North Korea has not stopped its development or export of long-range ballistic missile technology. The North's missile development poses a threat not only to our allies South Korea and Japan, but to others in regions destabilized by North Korean arms merchants. 
   In short, the North Korean threat remains today the most obvious strategic rationale for America's forward-deployed military forces in the Pacific Theater. Roughly 100,000 men and women of the armed forces safeguard U.S. interests in East Asia. 
   The North Korean threat is also the most obvious strategic rationale for those who advocate the development and deployment of a limited National Missile Defense. As the expression went back in the early 1980's, ``One A-bomb can ruin your whole day.'' 
   Mr. President, it is too soon to pop the champagne corks. Euphoria is not an emotion that lends itself to sound foreign policy-making. As President Kim Dae-jung himself has said, we must approach North Korea with a ``warm heart and a cool head.'' 
   Having said all of that, it would be the greatest folly for us not to consider the potential significance of what is happening on the Korean peninsula, not just for Northeast Asia, but for the future of United States strategic doctrine and our role in the Pacific. 
   Mr. President, the world does not stand still. The ``plate-tectonics'' of Northeast Asia are fluid. The realignments underway could have a profound impact on our force posture and role we will play, with out friends and allies, in helping to secure a peaceful and stable East Asian environment for our children and grandchildren. 
   With the emergency of Kim Jong-il from what he jokingly admitted was a ``hermit's'' existence in North Korea, we are beginning to see the rewards of patient diplomacy backed by strong deterrence. If implemented, the agreement reached in Pyongyang--especially provisions for family reunion visits, economic cooperation and eventual peaceful unification--promises to reduce tensions in this former war zone and enhance economic, cultural, environmental, and humanitarian cooperation on the peninsula. 
   In five year's time, we might be evaluating a new North Korean missile threat. Alternatively, we might be marveling at the creation of a genuine demilitarized zone linking, rather than separating, North and South. 
   North Korea appears to have made a strategic decision that reforming its moribund economy and normalizing relations with its neighbors are the keys to the survival of the regime. 
   This decision was not made at the summit. It has its origins in the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the success of China's economic reforms. Absent Soviet subsidies and military, North Korea has become a desperately poor country, unable even to feed itself. It has begun to seek accommodation, even on tough issues involving national security. 
   Just yesterday, in response to President Clinton's decision to lift some economic sanctions on the North, the North Koreans agreed to extend the missile launch moratorium it has observed over the past year. 
   The North also agreed to engage in a new round of talks next week with the Administration. These talks will take time, but they could ultimately lead to a decision by North Korea to forego future missile exports and curtail its development of long range missiles. 
   What would be the consequences of a world in which North Korea no longer posed a significant threat to its neighbors? Where would our interests lie? 
   It's hard to answer the first question without first engaging in thorough deliberations not only with our allies South Korea and Japan, but also with others with a stake in preserving peace and stability in northeast Asia, most notably China and Russia. I believe those deliberations should begin now. We should not wait for events to dictate an answer to us, as occurred in the Philippines when we suddenly found ourselves without bases on which we had staked much of our future in Southeast Asia. 
   It's a little bit easier to answer the second question. I believe our enduring interests are clear. 
   First and foremost, will be our desire to preserve peace and stability. There are regional tensions beyond the division of the peninsula. 
   Japan and South Korea have unresolved territorial disputes and a historical legacy of war and mistrust. The Perry Initiative has helped forge a remarkable trilateral spirit of cooperation, and we should seek to ensure that spirit lives on even after the threat of a second Korean War is laid to rest. 
   Japan and Russia have much the same difficulties as do Japan and South Korea, and we should do our part to help them to resolve their differences peacefully. 
   Second, we must pursue non-proliferation. The danger of nuclear proliferation will not evaporate just because North and South Korea are reconciled. U.S. strategic doctrine--especially our decision on whether to proceed with the development and deployment of a National Missile Defense--will have a huge impact on whether Japan goes nuclear, which would immediately trigger a Korean response, and whether China builds more ICBMs or decides to MIRV a future generation of missiles. 
   The North Korean threat is literally and figuratively a ``moving target.'' We should make sure that our aim is true, and that we do not inadvertently cause more problems than we solve in our haste to address it.  
   Third, we will want to foster respect for international norms in the areas of human rights and the environment. This will be particularly important in our relationship with China. 
   Fourth, we will continue to seek economic openness, including securing sea lanes of communication. A decision looms before the Senate on whether to extend permanent normal Trade Relations to China. 
   I support PNTR for China, in part because I believe it is an essential ingredient of an overall strategy which secures a place for us in more prosperous and economically integrated East Asia. 
   For all of these objectives, maintenance of robust U.S. military capabilities, forward deployed in the region, will be essential, although the composition of those forces is likely to change as their roles and missions evolve. Our forward-deployed forces and the maintenance of strong strategic airlift capabilities at home enable us to respond swiftly and effectively to regional contingencies, humanitarian disasters, and political instability which might impact our vital interests. 
   Mr. President, as I said at the outset, I think we may be witnessing something extraordinary underway in Northeast Asia. We don't know exactly how it is all going to play out. But we had best begin now to discuss the potential implications. The decisions we make today will shape the strategic environment and the tools we have to advance our interests in East Asia tomorrow. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator from Minnesota, knowing he was about to give me time, which is his nature. I appreciate that. 
   Mr. President, my mom had an expression. Occasionally, when I was a kid, I think she had a good idea and was well intentioned. She would say, ``JOEY, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.'' 
   I have no doubt about the intentions of my friend from Minnesota. I know he knows that as the author of the drug czar legislation for the past, I guess it is about 14 years, I have issued every year a drug report or an alternate drug report laying out a drug strategy for the United States, usually as a counterbalance on the Republican administration and criticism or one of agreement with the administration. 
   This debate reminds me a little bit of the position in which Democrats have always been put. The Democrats get put in a position where we are told there is a dollar left and it can be distributed among the hearing impaired, the sight impaired, and those children needing emergency medical care. So we have to choose. We have the blind fighting the disabled fighting the hearing impaired. Instead of saying we can choose between building a highway and taking care of all the needs of those in desperate need, or we cannot build a submarine, or an air base, whatever, we are debating about whether or not we can walk and chew gum at the same time. 
   There is no disagreement. I have, as well as my colleagues, pushed--pushed in the early days when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee--for major increases in treatment. I have issued a total of seven major reports on treatment, its value, its efficacy, and why we should be doing more. 
   I take a backseat to no one in arguing that we do not give enough treatment here in this drug war. 
   I point out that the President's budget, unrelated to the Colombian aid package, has $6 billion in it for drug treatment and drug prevention. That total includes $300 million in funding increases in this area. We don't have to take away from the money that, in fact, would have a significant impact on the reduction of product here. That is the bad news. 
   The good news is that, as we have debated the Andean drug policy for the past 12 years, we used to have to deal with the idea that Colombia was a transiting country as well as a country that turned raw product into the materials sold, and the laboratory work and product used to be produced in Bolivia and Peru. 
   The good news is, because of eradication programs, because of U.N. leadership, I might add in this area, essentially there has been an elimination of the crop in those two countries. 
   The bad news is that it has all moved into Colombia. They now are a full-service operation. The product is there, the narcotraffickers are there, the laboratory laboratories are there, and the transiting is there. That is the bad news. 
   The good news is it is all in one spot for us to be able to hit it. It is all in one spot for us to have a very efficacious use of this money. 
   I spent days in Colombia. I spent 2 days, 24 hours a day, with the President of Colombia. I ended up actually going with him on his Easter vacation by accident to his summer residence. 
   This is a guy, as my friend from Illinois points out, that is the real deal. 
   For the first time, we have a President who understands that his democracy is at stake. He is willing to risk his life--not figuratively, literally. I went to dinner with he and his children. He has seven bodyguards around his children because of the death threats. This is a guy who is risking his life. He is willing to do it because he understands what is at stake for his country, unlike previous Presidents. 
   The next point is, we are making this distinction between police and military. With all due respect to my friend from Minnesota, historically the thugs in South America have been the police. Police are not like police here. There is a national police; we have no national police. The Federales in Mexico were police, not army. Often the police in South America are the biggest abusers of human rights. 
   What did we do? We gave the Colombian National Police aid, $750 million in aid. What did we say? Purge this police department, purge the national police, and they did. And guess what. If I stood on this floor 5 years ago and said the Colombian police are going to crack the Medellin and Cali Cartel, no one would have said that is possible. No one. 
   Guess what. They cracked the Medellin Cartel. They cracked the Cali Cartel. They put them in jail. They are extraditing the police. Why? Because we trained their police; they purged 4,000 of them. 
   Where are we on military? I met here with every major human rights group from Colombia, including the bishops who came up. When we push them to the wall and say to them: By the way, you want us out? 
   No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. You have to stay in. You have to be involved. We don't like the balance the way you have it here. 
   I say: Fine. No problem. 
   Tell me, bishop, you want us in or you want us out? 
   Stay. Stay. 
   Now, civil war. There is no civil war. We are so caught up in the old logic of  how we deal with things. There is no civil war. Less than 5 percent of the people of Colombia support the guerrillas. Every other guerrilla movement, every other civil war, you go into the village to recruit people. They go in, as my friend Illinois said, to shoot people. There is no popular sentiment at all. This is not a civil war. 
   With regard to the paramilitaries, I called President Pastrana a few weeks ago. I said, a lot of the criticism of the plan is you have to be sure that you are only focusing on the FARC and the ELN and only focusing on the guerrillas. What about the paramilitaries? I said, I want a letter guaranteeing that you will, in fact, move on the paramilitary simultaneously. You must change.

   Mr. BIDEN. When I said, do we take sides? The answer is, yes, we take sides. We are not putting anybody in the field. What are we doing? We are training three battalions. Why are we training them? For the same reason we train the police. We want to open up the eyes of the Colombian military, who in recent years have been accused of fewer human rights abuses. They have been accused of turning their heads. They hear the paramilitary coming, they lift the gate, the paramilitary comes through, the paramilitary terminates people, and they go back out. 
   Then they ask, what happened? 
   That is what they are doing. 
   Plan Colombia does not only involve U.S. participation. This is a $7.5 billion plan. The Colombians are coming up with $4 billion; the Europeans, about $1 billion and the international financial institutions about $1 billion. If we take out our piece, it all falls apart. We are not the only game in town. But we are the catalyst. What will happen? The whole world is going to be looking to the Colombian military, from Japan to Bonn, because they are all in the deal. They are all in the deal. If you want to clean up anybody, anything, any institution, listen to the dictates of a former Supreme Court Justice: The best disinfectant is the clear light of day. 
   There will be a worldwide spotlight shined upon this military. I have never personally testified on the floor that I have faith in an individual leader, but I have faith in President Pastrana. He is the real deal. What is at stake is whether or not Colombia becomes a narcostate or not. This is not in between. Keep in mind, folks, when the Supreme Courts of Colombia several years ago extradited some, they blew the Court up; they blew the building up and killed seven Justices. When a Presidential candidate took them on, they shot him dead. 
   This is the real stuff. It is not like a Member of this body. The worst thing that happens to us is we get a drive-by shooting politically and we lose office. There, you jump in the sucker and you lose your life. This is for real. These are courageous people who finally have said: We will take them on. 
   I am convinced--knowing the chairman, and my friend from Kentucky is a hard-nosed guy--he made a judgment whether these guys are real. He is not about to give $1 billion to anybody. 
   My colleagues, it is very basic. There is a lot at stake. We have a significant increase in funding for treatment and prevention. It should be more. But we have an obligation, in the interests of our children and the interests of the hemisphere, to keep the oldest democracy in place, to give them a fighting chance to keep from becoming a narcostate. Folks, if they lose, mark my words, we are going to reap the whirlwind in this hemisphere on matters that go far beyond drugs. It will include terrorism, it will include whole cadres of issues we have not thought about. 
   I thank the chairman for his time. I truly appreciate the motivation of my friend from Minnesota. At the appropriate time, unless the chairman of the committee does not want me to, I move to table. I am not trying to cut off discussion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the foreign operations of the United States are all undertaken to promote the national interests of our country. They are all useful and important programs, and they deserve our support. 
   The national interests that they serve, however, are of varying importance. As George Orwell wrote in his novel ``Animal Farm,'' ``some are more equal than others.'' All our foreign operations programs are useful, but some are downright vital to our national security. 
   One element in this bill that is truly vital to our national security is severely underfunded. I will introduce shortly an amendment to address that severe problem. 
   The funding line to which I refer is known as ``NADR.'' That does not refer to Ralph Nader. It does refer to ``Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs.'' The 10 programs in this category are all on the front line of protecting our people from terrorism and from weapons of mass destruction. 
   Unfortunately, the funding in this bill for 7 of those 10 programs is 37 percent below the levels requested by the President. (And that ignores another $30 million that was cut because the Foreign Operations Subcommittee concluded that a new counter-terrorism training center must be funded in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriation.) I submit that the national security requires that we provide substantially more of those requested funds. 
   Let me describe the programs that are treated so badly in this bill: 
   In the non-proliferation field, the Department of State's Export Control Assistance program helps foreign countries to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Recently customs agents in Uzbekistan stopped a shipment of radioactive contraband from Kazakhstan that was on its way to Iran, with an official final destination of Pakistan. Some press stories suggested that the shipment was really intended for a terrorist group affiliated with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, who would have used it to build a radiological weapon for use against Americans. 
   Those customs agents were trained by the United States. The equipment they used to detect the radioactive material was provided by the United States. In that case, the funding came from the Cooperative Threat Reduction program. 
   But the Export Control Assistance program provides the same sort of assistance when Nunn-Lugar funds can not be used, and it helps other countries to enact the laws and regulations that they need in order to have effective export controls. The personal ties that are forged by this program with export control officials from other countries are equally crucial to improving other countries' export control performance. 
   This year, the Export Control Assistance program will enable the Department of Commerce to assign a resident export control attach&#233; to Russia. The Export Control Assistance program also sets up internal compliance programs in Russia's high-tech industries and trains the Russian personnel who staff those offices. These programs enable Russia to police itself and give us increased visibility into plants that are of particular concern from the non-proliferation standpoint. 
   Last year, Congress increased funding for this program from $10 million to $14 million. Indeed, the report on the bill before us takes credit for that increase. This year, the President asked for $14 million, to maintain this vital level of effort, but the bill before us includes only $10 million. 
   When the appropriators increased this program last year, they were right. This year, they should do it again. We need more export control assistance to help other countries keep nuclear materials out of the hands of their dangerous neighbors. 
   Earlier this month, the National Commission on Terrorism warned that it was ``particularly concerned about the persistent lack of adequate security and safeguards for the nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.'' That is a cogent concern, and Export Control Assistance is one of the programs that helps to keep dangerous materials from crossing former Soviet borders. 
   By the way, the Foreign Relations Committee favors full funding of the President's request for this program. Indeed, at the suggestion of Chairman HELMS, we added $5 million in our security assistance bill to support a new project in Malta. 
   Another non-proliferation program, the International Science and Technology Centers, provides safe employment opportunities for former Soviet experts in weapons of mass destruction who might otherwise be tempted to sell their skills to rogue states. This program not only helps those scientists. It also gives hope to, and helps to preserve discipline at, the institutes where those experts work. 
   The activities of this program are guided by a Governing Board headed by the Honorable Ron Lehman, a wonderful public servant who was Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration and director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the Bush Administration. 
   Ron Lehman and I often disagree on policy matters, but we are in complete agreement on the need to help Russia to restructure its bloated, Soviet-era weapons complexes without leaving its weapons 
   experts prey to offers from countries like Iran, Iraq or Libya. His program is doing some wonderful things, moreover. Since 1994, the Science Centers have supported over 840 projects, employing over 30,000 weapons experts at more than 400 former Soviet institutes. 
   Some of these projects led to the formation of viable commercial companies; others resulted in contracts with western companies to distribute new Russian products like medical devices or high temperature batteries. Around a fifth of Science Center funding now comes from Western companies and government agencies that employ former Soviet experts through this program. 
   Other projects have put weapons experts to work on public health, environmental remediation, and non-proliferation projects that provide real benefits to the former Soviet Union and its neighbors. 
   For example, the Russian Academy of Sciences, MINATOM, and the prestigious Kurchatov Institute recently completed a six-year project to map all the nuclear contamination sites in the former Soviet Union. Science Center funding was the lifeblood of that project. 
   The Science Centers also funded fourteen Y2K readiness projects that ensured the safety of nuclear power facilities and chemical and biological storage areas. 
   The International Science and Technology Centers are multinational. The U.S. Government provided only 31 percent of last year's Science Center funding, compared to 36 percent provided by the European Union. Japan, Norway and South Korea also participate in the program. But without our leadership, this program will fail. 
   The bill before us would give that program only a third of what was appropriated for this fiscal year. I know that the budget numbers for foreign operations are unrealistically tight. They always are. But if we cut the Science and Technology Centers program that much, we will endanger our national security.  
   It only takes a few experts in nuclear, chemical or biological weapons to provide dangerous materials or technology to a ``rogue state.'' We should do everything in our power to make sure that economic desperation in Russia does not result in such a catastrophe. 
   The committee report on this bill states that it:  
   was disturbed to learn that, after at least 5 years of interaction between the State Department and Russian scientists, relations remain guarded. 
   I, for one, am not disturbed by that. Russia still has a nuclear weapons program, just as we do. There are bound to be security concerns that keep us at arm's length. 
   Unlike us, Russia may also have illegal chemical and/or biological weapons programs. There are military biological institutes to which we do not have access. 
   As a result, there is always a risk that non-proliferation assistance will be diverted to illegal military research, or that the funds we provide will keep afloat people or institutes involved in an illegal chemical or biological weapons program. That risk pales, however, compared to the risk of weapons proliferation if we leave those weapons scientists unable to put food on their table. So we must be ``guarded,'' and we must do more. 
   The Science and Technology Centers program takes great care to minimize the risk of diversion. The General Accounting Office, after studying the Science Center's programs to employ Russia's former biological weapons experts, reported recently that the Center:  
   ..... has directly deposited grant payments into project participants' individual bank accounts, which prevents the institutes from diverting funds for unauthorized purposes....... Program managers from the Science Center review programmatic and financial documents on a quarterly basis, and the Science Center requires a final audit of every project before it releases an overhead payment to an institute. 
   In addition, the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency has conducted internal control audits for 10 Science Center biotechnology projects through 1999.  
   Those precautions work. A few months ago, Science Center officials were warned by Russian scientists of a possible diversion of funds. That information was received and acted upon in a timely manner, and steps were taken to make sure that no diversion occurred. 
   The Science Centers program also takes steps to guard against proliferation. After all, that's the point of this assistance. We can be proud of the job that this program is doing to reduce the risk of proliferation of Russian materials and expertise. 
   When the GAO looked at Science Center biotechnology projects, they found that nearly half the recipients of project assistance were ``former senior weapons scientists.'' On the average, the scientists devoted more than half of the year to Science Center projects. Institute directors told the GAO that these projects ``were crucial to their institute budgets.'' 
   The GAO also reports:  
   Prior to the funding of any U.S. collaborative research project, Russian institute officials must pledge that their institute will not perform offensive weapons research or engage in proliferation activities. According to a January 1999 State Department report, engaging in such inappropriate behavior would have an immediate and negative impact on any U.S. assistance. 
   Institute officials with whom we met consistently told us that they are no longer involved in offensive biological weapons activities and that they clearly understand the conditions of U.S. collaborative research assistance.  
   The GAO report continues:  
   Officials at three institutes we visited reported that, in the past, representatives of countries of proliferation concern had approached them seeking to initiate questionable dual-use research. Officials at the three institutes told us they had refused these offers because of a pledge made to U.S. executive branch officials as a condition of receiving U.S. assistance.  
   The pledge includes avoiding cooperation both with countries of proliferation concern or with terrorist groups. 
   State and Defense Department officials identified at least 15 former Soviet biological weapons institutes in which the United States has evidence that these programs have discouraged the institutes and scientists from cooperating with countries of proliferation concern such as Iran. 
   The Department of Defense informed Congress in a January 2000 report that the access gained through the collaborative research programs has provided ``high confidence'' that Biopreparat institutes such as Vector and Obolensk are not presently engaged in offensive activities.  
   Did everyone get that? This program is giving assistance to Russian biological weapons experts in order to keep them out of the clutches of rogue states. The GAO has found that it is succeeding in doing that. At the same time, we are guarding against the diversion of our funds to improper purposes. And the access we get to the institutes we assist--thanks to this program--has enabled the Defense Department to say that those institutes are clean. 
   Finally, we get useful research as an end product. If the executive branch gets the funding it wants, we will get help on defending against biological weapons. We will also help the Russians safeguard the dangerous pathogens that they keep for research purposes, thus guarding against their sale and reducing the risk of an accidental catastrophe. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee supports this program as well. Indeed, in our security assistance bill, we added $14 million, so that the Science Centers could fund all of the deserving projects that have been proposed. 
   But the bill before us cuts $25 million out of this fine program, leaving less than 45 percent of what the President requested, and barely a third of what the Foreign Relations Committee recommends. 
   The price of such cuts could be far more than the $25 million in would-be savings. If we leave Russian weapons scientists underemployed, with time on their hands and not enough food on their tables, how will they resist an offer from Iran or Iraq? 
   When we talk about keeping these Russian scientists usefully employed, we're guarding against the spread of nuclear weapons and dreaded plagues. We're not talking about budget caps, but rather about life or death for millions of people. 
   I understand the need for efficient programs. But this program works. That GAO report did not need to make even one recommendation. 
   And when millions of lives are potentially at stake, we should do more than do less. 
   A third non-proliferation program is our contributions to KEDO, the Korean Energy Development Organization, pursuant to the Nuclear Framework with North Korea. Thanks to this agreement, North Korea has ceased reprocessing spent nuclear reactor fuel. 
   Indeed, recently the last of the spent nuclear fuel was safely canned, under IAEA supervision. That vastly lowers any North Korean ability to produce nuclear weapons. 
   The Nuclear Framework Agreement has also led North Korea to let U.S. experts visit an underground site that we feared might be a nuclear plant. Our two visits showed that it was not a nuclear facility. 
   But there is a price for all these benefits, and part of that price is U.S. contributions of heavy fuel oil. Now, traditionally we have spent $35 million a year on that. But other countries have not helped out as much as we expected--although South Korea and Japan are spending much more than we are, to build new reactors in North Korea that will not be readily used for bomb-making. In addition, as we all know, fuel oil costs a lot more than it used to. 
   Appropriators have refused to allocate more than $35 million, however. Instead, last year, they kept this line at $35 million and added a separate, unallocated line of $20 million in the NADR account, which actually went to meet our KEDO obligations. 
   The bill before us again allots only $35 million, but this time there is no additional line with $20 million. 
   This money keeps the Nuclear Framework Agreement on track. That agreement keeps North Korea from using a handy source of fissile material to make nuclear weapons. It also provides a bit of stability on the Korean peninsula, which has led to a suspension of North Korea's long-range missile tests, to U.S.-North Korean negotiations on an end to those programs and to North Korea's missile exports, and now to the first summit ever between the leaders of North and South Korea. 
   Do we really want to put the Framework Agreement at risk, by failing to  fund it? Do we want to derail all the delicate negotiations that are ongoing with North Korea? 
   Perhaps the authors of this bill intend to fix this in conference, once everybody admits that we need to bust the budget caps on foreign operations. If so, I will be relieved. Maintaining KEDO and the Nuclear Framework Agreement gets to the heart of our national security, however, and I think we should make clear that we want this shortfall remedied. 
   Another important program in this funding category is our contributions to the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission. These funds are used primarily to procure and install the International Monitoring system, which serves United States national security interests by enabling the world to detect, identify, and respond to any illegal nuclear tests by other countries. 
   The International Monitoring System offers features that are of particular value to the United States. Its network of seismic stations will supplement those that the U.S. Government uses to monitor foreign nuclear weapons tests. Indeed, some of those stations will be in locations where we could not hope to get seismic coverage any other way. 
   The controlled and affiliated seismic stations will also afford regional coverage, rather than just long-range seismic collection. This will result in improved detection, as well as better geolocation of suspect events. 
   The International Monitoring System will include hydroacoustic 
   collection in the world's oceans, ultrasound collection, and a large network of land-based atmospheric collectors to pick up telltale contamination in the air. Use of those additional monitoring techniques will increase the likelihood of getting multiple-source evidence of an illegal nuclear weapons test. 
   In addition, the data from the International Monitoring System will be widely available, and therefore usable for enforcement purposes. This is important. 
   Although the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty has not entered into force, signatories are bound--by international law and/or by custom--not to undermine the ``object and purposes'' of the treaty. We have a legal interest, therefore--and surely a security interest--in making sure that other countries do not engage in nuclear weapons tests. 
   How do you enforce a ban on nuclear weapons tests? That takes more than just monitoring. It requires exposure of the offending country and convincing other countries that a violation has occurred. Only then can we rally the world to threaten or impose penalties on the offender. 
   U.S. Government sources of information, as good as they are, often can not be used to create a diplomatic or public case against an offender. Our contributions to the CTBT Preparatory Commission will help us to get the publicly usable information that is so vital to putting a stop to any cheating. 
   The report on this bill states that in the past, the President has requested more than was needed for this program. That is true. The executive branch asks for our share of the coming year's tentative budget, but we also work within the Preparatory Commission to scrub that budget, and it usually comes in a bit lower. 
   But does that mean we can safely cut 30 percent? Not on your life! The final U.S. obligation might be $20 million, as opposed to the requested $21.5 million. But $15 million is simply out of the question. That would presume a $25 million cut in the Preparatory Commission budget proposed by their Secretariat, which would mean an intolerable delay in fielding the monitoring system. 
   There may be some confusion because this program has been able to absorb budget cuts in the past. In those years, the State Department was able to apply previous-year funds to make up for the cuts. Virtually all the Fiscal Year 2000 funds, however, have already been obligated. Thus, a cut in Fiscal Year 2001 funding will be much more harmful than were previous cuts. 
   The report also states that the Preparatory Commission should reimburse the United States for services we have performed in setting up monitoring sites. That, too, is true, and we will be reimbursed. We will not be reimbursed, however, until the sites that we install have been certified as operational. That guards against shoddy work by other countries, and I don't think we want to give up that protection. 
   Certification has been achieved for one U.S.-installed site, and we will get $500,000 in reimbursements in Fiscal Year 2001. That is already taken into account in the President's budget request. Several million dollars in reimbursement will be received in later years. Cutting the 2001 budget will jeopardize not only the work program for the monitoring system, but also any reimbursements for past or current work that depend upon achieving certification next year. 
   The bottom line is simple: either we pay for our share of nuclear test monitoring costs, or we delay significantly the work on a monitoring system that serves our own national security. If we want to catch any country that cheats and to expose that cheating, so that we can sanction a violator, then we must pay our bills. 
   Non-proliferation programs were not the only ones to be cut in this portion of the bill before us. The Department of State's Anti-Terrorism Assistance program and its Terrorist Interdiction program are vital to the security of United States diplomatic and military personnel overseas. 
   The first line of defense against attacks like those on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, or on the Khobar Towers complex in Saudi Arabia, is not ours. Rather, it is the security services of the host countries. All over the world, those countries need our assistance in border control and airport security. They need our training in spotting terrorist groups hiding behind legitimate charities, and in handling terrorist incidents--including future attacks that could use weapons of mass destruction. The Anti-Terrorism Assistance program does all of this. 
   Right now, the Anti-Terrorism Assistance program trains up to 2,000 people per year. There is so much demand for our training that we could help 3,000 a year, if only we had the funds and the facilities. An increase in training funds would make a real contribution to our security. 
   The State Department also runs a Terrorist Interdiction Program--known as TIP--that provides other countries the training and equipment needed for them to apprehend terrorists entering their countries. The TIP program enables countries to compare a person's travel documents to their own data-bases. It also works through INTERPOL to link these countries and promote information sharing. Finally, it trains immigration and customs workers in interview and screening techniques. 
   The State Department recently began a program to provide these important capabilities to Pakistan. We all know about Pakistan, the gateway to Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden and his buddies. Can anybody think of a better place to beef up border security, so that terrorists can be apprehended as they go to and from those Afghan training camps? 
   The first phase of the TIP program in Pakistan will be paid out of Fiscal Year 2000 funds. But the bill for the second phase will come due in Fiscal Year 2001. So will the first phase of a program in Kenya, 
   which we know all too well has been used as a terrorist gateway to Africa, and site surveys in four more countries. 
   The proposed budget cut in the bill before us would force us to choose between Pakistan and Kenya. It is simply contrary to our national interest to force such a Hobson's choice. 
   These two anti-terrorist programs are utterly vital to our security. They make foreign security services more competent in protecting our own personnel, and they also foster ties that can be crucial in a crisis. We should be increasing these programs, and the President's proposed budget would do just that. 
   The bill before us would cut 22 percent of the funds requested. It would impose a 7-percent cut from this year's funding for these two anti-terrorist programs. This is simply unacceptable. 
   Finally, the Department of State's Small Arms program has underwritten successful arms buy-backs in Africa, notably in Mali. This is low-budget program is urgently needed in areas that are emerging from civil war and still awash in automatic weapons. A  little bit of support can go a long way to drain the supply of arms that otherwise end up going to drug-runners, bandit gangs, or renewed civil strife. 
   The President proposed $2 million for this program. The bill before us would slice away half of that. This is, indeed, a low-budget program, but $2 million is really the floor for a workable program. To take away half of that is to throw this effort into the basement. 
   The bill before us, Mr. President, leaves the Senate in a nearly untenable position. It is under the budget request by fully $1.7 billion. This is no way to fulfill our obligations to world organizations or to maintain either international influence or our own national security. We must accept that there is no such thing as world leadership on the cheap. 
   I deeply wish that I could restore the funds that this bill cuts from the NADR account. The truth is, however, that we must wait for conferees to break the ridiculous cap on this whole bill. 
   With that in mind, the amendment that I am introducing simply states the sense of the Senate that the conferees should find the funds needed to make NADR whole. 
   We have been through this drill before. In due course, more funds for foreign operations will be found. The crucial question is how the conferees will allocate those funds. This amendment calls on the conferees to give priority to these important national security efforts. 
   I am pleased to report that this amendment is co-sponsored by Senators LUGAR, HAGEL, BINGAMAN, CONRAD, DOMENICI and LEVIN. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
   This amendment is not certain to succeed in conference--but it surely is the least we can do. The safety of our diplomats and military personnel overseas, and the safety of all of us from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, demand no less.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an opinion piece in the June 20 edition of the Washington Post written by Mr. Milan Panic, former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and an American citizen. 
   In this article, Mr. Panic argues for getting Russian President Putin to agree to offer Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic asylum, in a deal approved by the international community. 
   This is an appalling idea whose time, thank heavens, has not come. At least it would appear so, since it has been widely reported that at their recent summit meeting Putin told President Clinton that Miami seemed to be as good a place for Milosevic as Moscow. 
   President Putin may not be turning out to be a model democrat, but no one has accused him of being dumb. He obviously feels that having Milosevic enlivening the Moscow scene would not exactly burnish his own credentials. 
   All kidding aside, the idea of blithely pronouncing all of our efforts in the former Yugoslavia over the last decade a hopeless failure and then letting the architect of the carnage skip off with his family to exile is both morally reprehensible and politically catastrophic. 
   The international community has labored long and hard to set up the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague, and then to get it up and running. 
   Over the past year the number of individuals indicted for alleged war crimes in custody has risen dramatically. Why should we totally undercut the Hague Tribunal, just when it is hitting its stride? 
   Why should we undercut the new, reformist government in Croatia, which has reversed the obstructionist course of the late strongman Tudjman and has begun cooperating with the Hague? If Milosevic is given a suspension of prosecution, then why shouldn't all the Croats in custody get the same deal? 
   In arguing against undercutting the Hague Tribunal, I do not wish to imply that it has been a complete success. What is missing from the jail cells in the Hague, of course, are the really big fish--the chief villains of the massive slaughter in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. 
   I am, of course, talking about Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, and, above all, the boss of all bosses Slobodan Milosevic. That's the point! To make this promising international effort work we need to do precisely the opposite from granting amnesty to public enemy number-one. We need to add him to the growing list of indicted suspects in detention. 
   The Panic op-ed argues that we won't be able to capture Milosevic. In the short run, we probably won't. But as  the vice tightens on Milosevic's cronies and makes it clear to them that they will have absolutely no future in a Milosevic-run state, I think it may occur to them to serve Slobo up on a platter to the Hague. 
   We have all learned not to make rash predictions about when Milosevic will fall from power, and I won't fail into that trap today. But the signs of increasing discontent are everywhere--from the new student-run, grassroots resistance movement called Otpor to the rash of gangland style assassinations and assassination attempts among Milosevic's retinue and allies. 
   So while I can't say when Milosevic will fall, fall he will. And it will be much better, both for Serbia and for the international community, if he falls as a result of pressure from his own people, rather than from some sordid deal cooked up abroad. 
   In a larger sense, why should we nip a promising international judicial effort in the bud in a misguided attempt to relieve the Serbs, in the worst possible way, of a problem that they spawned and that they have the primary responsibility to rectify? 
   Somehow the curse of Milosevic is to be lifted from the Serbian people by a foreign deus ex machina, in this case the good Russian tsar. And then, in return for having graciously allowed their dictator to depart, the Serbian people would receive and end to sanctions from the international community. 
   Give me a break. Even if we could persuade Putin to go against his self-interest--a total impossibility, of course--such a deal would only fuel the Serbs' oft-noted passion for blaming others for misfortunes that they themselves have created. Why else would the foreigners have gotten rid of Milosevic if they hadn't somehow been responsible for him in the first place? 
   And what are we to make of the article's nice plan that part of the deal would be free and fair elections in Serbia under international supervision? I can just imagine what the other war criminals in the Yugoslav and Serbian governments would think of that idea! 
   The most likely result of an arranged Milosevic departure would be another set of gangsters, not democrats elected by universal suffrage. The Panic op-ed is entitled ``Exit Milosevic.'' It might just as well be entitled ``Enter Seselj''--that is, Vojislav Seselj, the fascist Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia. Mr. Panic's naivete gives us a pretty good clue as to why Milosevic so easily outmaneuvered him in 1993. 
   Morality, Serbian politics, and the Hague Tribunal aside, granting asylum to Milosevic would be a political disaster for the United States and for NATO. 
   Last year President Clinton had a difficult time in rounding up support within NATO's nineteen members for Operation Allied Force, and then sustaining that support until Milosevic's troops and paramilitaries were forced out of Kosovo. But he skillfully managed to do it, and alliance unity was preserved. 
   Then we got our European allies and others to assume 85 percent of the burden of KFOR in Kosovo and also to fund the vast majority of the cost of the Stability Pact for South East Europe. 
   Now, after pardoning Milosevic, I suppose we could turn to our European allies and say, ``incidentally, friends, we really didn't need to fight that pesky, little air war after all. We could have just bought off old Slobo last year and sent him packing. But please don't ignore fulfilling the commitments you made to the Defense Capabilities Initiative at the Washington NATO Summit. We really do need an alliance with teeth, so you still have to spend a lot to upgrade your forces. Don't worry, though. The Milosevic buyout was just a one-time event. Nothing like that will happen again. NATO is really not in the amnesty business. It's just that the Serbs needed us to take the monkey off their back, and we're sure that Slobo's successors will now choose to cooperate with us.'' 
   Pardon my sarcasm, Mr. President, but this amnesty idea is just too politically naive to believe. 
   The Panic article also reveals an impatience as American as apple pie. We all want a quick fix. But, my friends, there are few quick fixes in life that have any permanence, and trying to set the Balkans right by way of shortcuts certainly isn't one of them. 
   To have any chance of creating a modicum of stability in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere in the region, solutions must be largely home-grown, if under the security umbrella provided by NATO. 
   So, let's consign the Panic op-ed to sophomore political science seminars and think-tank luncheons--but not to serious consideration by our Government. 
   Let's get on with the vital, if prosaic, business of rebuilding Bosnia and Kosovo and supporting the opposition in Serbia through a variety of programs, which are in place, ongoing, and which, in time, I believe, will succeed.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague from Iowa. He and I have worked together on a lot of issues. We tend to approach issues from a slightly different perspective but often end up in the same place, and that is the case here. 
   My concern in the reform of the bankruptcy code was not as much driven by those who were avoiding debt as his was but about making sure the overall consumer is protected. When people avoid debts they can pay, it is a simple proposition: My mother living on Social Security pays more at the department store to purchase something, my sons, who are beginning their careers, and my daughter pay more on their credit card bill because someone else does not pay. 
   In recent days, a number of my colleagues have brought the Time magazine article to my attention and to the attention of the Senator from Iowa and others. If you took a look at the Time magazine article and read it thoroughly, you would think we were about to tread on the downtrodden, deserving Americans who are about to be, and I quote from the article, ``soaked by the Congress.'' My colleagues have pointed this out to me. They find it a very disturbing article. It tells a tale of corruption and greed and heartlessness, claims that hard-working, honest, American families are about to be cut off from the fresh start promised by the bankruptcy code, and that lenders, who have driven these families into economic distress, are about to kick them when they are down. 
   Most shocking in the article, perhaps, from my perspective, is the claim that the U.S. Congress, by passing the bankruptcy reform legislation which passed out of here overwhelmingly, will make all this happen. As I said, it is a very disturbing article. It is hard to see how anyone, in my view, could vote for bankruptcy reform if, in fact, the essence of the article were true. But I remind my colleagues that bankruptcy reform legislation, not this imaginary legislation described in the article, passed the House by a vote of 313-108, and the Senate by 84-13. So this article claims a vast majority of both our parties in both Houses of Congress are conspirators in an alleged plot to hit those who are down on their luck. 
   The problem with this portrayal is the bankruptcy reform bill now in conference is the antithesis of what they have said. Their article is simply dead wrong. I do not ever recall coming to the floor of the Senate in my 28 years and saying unequivocally: One of the most respected periodicals and magazines in the country, with a major article, is simply dead, flat, absolutely wrong. I don't recall ever being compelled to do that or being inclined to do that. 
   I will make one admission at the outset. It is the intent of the bankruptcy reform to tighten the bankruptcy system; that is true, to assure that those who have the ability to pay do not walk away from their legal debts. The explosion of bankruptcy in the early and mid-1990s revealed a problem with our system and the reform legislation is a response to that by the strong bipartisan vote of both Houses. 
   I am more on that liberal side, as my friend from Iowa talks about. I admire his pride that everybody should pay their debts, and I think they should. 
   I am more inclined to let someone go than to hold them tightly. I admit that part. But I came here with this reform legislation because all these bankruptcies are causing debts to be driven up by other people. Interest rates go up on credit cards, not that credit card companies do not like high interest rates anyway. Interest rates go up on automobile loans. Interest rates go up all over the board. The cost of borrowing money goes up when people who can pay do not pay. It means innocent middle-class people and poor folks end up paying more. 
   Yes, bankruptcy reform is intended to require more repayment by those who can afford it, more complete and verified documentation, and to generally discourage unnecessary and unwarranted filings. When the bankruptcy system is manipulated by those who can afford to pay, we all pay. 
   This article claims that bankruptcy reform legislation is driven solely by the greed of lenders, that abuse of the bankruptcy code is a myth created by those who want to wring more money out of those who do not have more money. That is not the position of the Justice Department.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, back to the Time article. One would think there was no reason to tighten up the current system, that those of us who support bankruptcy reform--a large bipartisan majority--had lost our hearts, our souls, and possibly our minds. Some folks might find that easy to believe, but if they simply compare the language of the legislation to the case studies in the article, they will find that in virtually every significant claim and detail, the charges leveled against this reform legislation are not true. They are simply false; they are flat wrong; and they are easily and conclusively refuted by a quick look at the facts. 
   First, a little primer on the bankruptcy code reform. Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code requires a liquidation of any assets and a payout to as many creditors as possible from the proceeds. Chapter 13 allows the filer to keep a home, a car, and so on, but requires them to enter into a repayment plan. The irony is, chapter 13 was put in to help people from the rigors of chapter 7. I do not have time to go into that, but it is a basic premise that is missed by the article. 
   The bankruptcy reform legislation that is the cause for such alarm in this article asks a question that I think most Americans would be surprised to learn is never even asked under the present system. The question is: Do you have the ability to pay some of those debts that you want forgiven? 
   If the answer is yes, then you will have to file for bankruptcy under chapter 13 and have what they call a workout, a repayment plan. No one--I repeat, no one--who needs it would ever, as this article puts it, be denied bankruptcy assistance. That cannot happen now, and it will not happen under this legislation. So it is not the idea you are denied bankruptcy, it is how you file for bankruptcy--under chapter 7 or chapter 13. 
   Only a few filers of bankruptcy, no more than 10 percent of those now filing under chapter 7--maybe even less--would see any change at all in their status. Those who have demonstrated 
   an ability to pay would be told to file under chapter 13 and would follow the kind of repayment plan their resources would allow. 
   A key point must be stressed: Chapter 13 is not some kind of debtor's prison. It is a practical solution to the problem of too many creditors chasing a debtor with too few resources. The article suggests that any change in the availability of chapter 7 will be the equivalent of the whip and the lash and the restoration of debtor's prison. The truth is different. 
   Chapter 13 was added to the bankruptcy code in the 1930s as the more desirable alternative to the draconian liquidation required under chapter 7. It was conceived as the ``wage earner's'' form of bankruptcy, for those who had an income and the ability to pay some of their creditors but who needed protection of the system to keep their creditors from hounding them. 
   Although this may seem like a quaint notion these days, it was intended to preserve some of the debtor's dignity at a time when bankruptcy carried more of a stigma for some people than it does today. 
   A profoundly mistaken view of the difference between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is not the most serious flaw in  this article. The real impact of this article comes from its stories of hard-working, honest, everyday American families who have fallen on hard times. These are the people who will, according to the article, find the door to a fresh start shut to them. 
   As disturbing as these stories are, they are all based on a demonstrably false premise. As the Senator from Iowa said, virtually none of the low- to moderate-income working families whose stories were so compellingly told in that article would be touched by the reforms affecting the availability of chapter 7. 
   That is right. In each and every case, given their income and their circumstances as presented, those families and individuals who were talked about in the article would still be eligible for chapter 7 protection. The central claims about the impact of bankruptcy reform on the families described in this article are flat wrong. 
   I know a lot of my colleagues have been concerned about these charges, and I urge them to take a simple test. Compare the financial circumstances of the individuals in the article and the stories that are told with the terms of our bankruptcy legislation. My colleagues will see the claims that these families will be cut off are not true. 
   They are wrong chiefly because the reform legislation contains what we call a safe harbor which preserves chapter 7, with no questions asked, for anyone earning the median income or less for the region in which they live. This is a protection I sought along with other supporters of bankruptcy reform. It was a key element of the Senate bill, and it has been accepted in conference. 
   There is even more protection: Those with up to 150 percent of the median income will be subject to only a cursory look at their income and obligations, not a more detailed examination. 
   These provisions provide that the door to chapter 7 remains open for just the kind of family the article claims will be most hurt. 
   I will not chronicle all of them, but I ask you to listen to this one story. Of all the cases chronicled in the article, I read most carefully the story of Allen Smith of Wilmington, 
   DE, my hometown. A World War II veteran, he had worked in our Newark, DE, Chrysler plant until the downsizing of the 1980s cost him his job. 
   Struck by cancer, my constituent from Wilmington, DE, was also hit with the tragedy and expense of his wife's diabetes and then her death. Health care costs drove him deeper and deeper into debt, and he filed for bankruptcy under chapter 13. Further financial troubles led to the failure of his chapter 13 plan, and he was then switched to chapter 7 under which he will lose his home to pay some of his obligations. 
   I searched in vain to find any relevance of this profound human tragedy to the bankruptcy reform legislation. To the extent it has anything at all to do with the supposed point of the story, Mr. Smith's story is presented to show us someone who is going to lose his home in bankruptcy, because he is now in chapter 7, exactly what the authors previously argued should be the preferred chapter for individuals in his circumstances. His sad story is an argument for catastrophic health insurance, not against bankruptcy reform. 
   They contrast his case with that of a wealthy individual who uses the protection of the present bankruptcy code by purchasing an expensive home under Florida's unlimited homestead exemption to protect assets from creditors. One would never know it from reading the article, but in the Senate we voted to get rid of that unlimited exemption that now is in the law. 
   More recently, the conferees have agreed to eliminate precisely the kind of abuse criticized in this article. The article discusses at length a case that has nothing to do with reform but criticizes an abuse that is actually fixed by this reform bill. 
   There are other profound inconsistencies and factual errors in the article, including the assertion that medical expenses would not be considered in calculating a filer's ability to pay or would not be dischargeable after bankruptcy or that family support payments, such as child support or alimony, would be a lower priority than a credit card debt. None of these assertions is true. 
   However, without these errors, there would be no article. 
   In many cases, in terms of the new, additional protections for family support payments and improved procedures for reaffirmations, filers in the kind of circumstances chronicled in the other stories in this article would be better off, not worse off, when this legislation passes. 
   I know my colleagues have expressed their worries about this article. I truly ask them, look at the language of the legislation, look at the articles that are written, and you will find that, although this is not a perfect bill, that none of the families chronicled in that article would be affected at all except their circumstances improved, if in fact anything was to happen. 
   I know that my colleagues who have expressed their worries about this article are sincere in their concern about the fairness of bankruptcy reform legislation. I urge them to apply the simple test of fairness to this article, to compare the situations of those families in the article to the actual provisions in the bankruptcy reform legislation. They will find those families's access to the full protection of Chapter 7 unchanged by this bill. 
   I ask them to do it for themselves: they don't have to take my word for it. 
   This is not a perfect bill. It is not the even bill that I would have written by myself. But it is a bill that can pass that test. 
   I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues assembled on the floor for the additional 4 minutes. I realize it is a tight day and time is of the essence. I appreciate their courtesy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Rhode Island for taking the lead on this important amendment this year. As a former Governor and mayor, they can both tell you firsthand about the need for State and local governments to have flexibility to make the best use of their transportation dollars as they see fit. 
   I find this kind of fascinating. Here we are and we talk about States rights and doing what the States need and the States know what their requirements are. Yet repeatedly when I have introduced this same amendment without the help--hopefully, it will change now because I have a former Republican Governor who has done the job. He is here in the Senate. I have stood up on the floor since 1991 introducing this amendment and I have been told that the Governors don't want this, or that this is inconsistent with the Republican philosophy, or whatever. 
   Now we have a Governor from one of the largest States in the United States who has done the job--and he obviously did it very well--who says, along with a former mayor from one of our smaller States but with more concentrated cities, that this is a flexibility that will help. Why should you be put in a position as a Governor when, in fact, you are able to, by the way, have flexibility with this money and to decide how you want to use your highway money, and you decide you want to put a bus route on, you can do it? Why can't you use the railroad? This sacrosanct principle I always hear from my friend from Missouri I find fascinating. What is the difference between a bus and a railroad? It is not a road. Guess what. It is on a road. The cement and asphalt guys like that a lot. They don't like the idea that we would make it better for our constituents and 
   Governors have the choice and flexibility. 
   We are not asking for more money; we are asking for flexibility. I would think it is just common sense. The record shows that the Senate has gone on record time after time--in 1991, 1995, and 1997--in favor of this same proposal before us today in the Voinovich amendment. Time and again, the language has been dropped in conference with the House, which is why we are here again today. 
   In addition to the same common sense, we are also here to restore balance to the way our transportation dollars are spent. Once again, the highway lobby, which is not content to consume its own large share, is trying to keep Amtrak from having a little bit of a share of the leftovers that go on after other modes of transportation have been taken care of. I guess we will have that business to deal with today. 
   First, the issue is common sense. Under current law, States are permitted to make their own choices to use the money for certain Federal transportation programs for mass transit, hike and bike trails, driver education, and even snowmobile trails. This is not a very restrictive list, Mr. President. In fact, there is only one kind of transportation that Governors and mayors aren't allowed to consider; that is, inner-city passenger rail. 
   Isn't that funny? They are going to give the folks in Minnesota, as we should, the ability for the Governor to decide he wants to spend highway money for snowmobile trails. Well, that is his business. They need that, according to the people in Minnesota. We don't need it in Delaware. We need rail. As my friend, and the leader on this subject for the entire time he has been here, the Senator from New Jersey, says--and one of my greatest regrets is that he is leaving voluntarily, and I mean that sincerely. He has one of the few logical voices in this debate. He and I come from States that if you widen I-95, it will accommodate the reduction of rail transportation and you are going to take up the bulk of my State. It would take another seven lanes. Look, I don't tell the folks in Missouri what they need. I don't tell the Governor of Missouri that he should or should not build more roads. Why can't you let the Governor of the State of Delaware decide whether or not it is better for us to have rail transportation between Wilmington and Newark, DE, instead of having to build another lane on I-95? 
   We all know why Amtrak is off the list. It is politics, pure politics. It has nothing to do with good public policy or a principle of federalism. What sense does it make to go out of our way to tie our Governor's hands when it comes to inner-city transportation? It makes no sense. That is why the Senate has supported this language time and again--unanimously, in some cases, in the past, and with strong bipartisan support. Here is what is at stake when you think about this little proposition: A little balance in our transportation spending. 
   Mr. President, last year Amtrak received $571 million in Federal funding. The highway system got $53 billion; and $20 billion of that was over and above the gas tax and users' fees that make some folks believe they are paying their own way. Again, $20 billion.  We are talking $571 million for Amtrak. 
   I am not here to argue against full funding of the highway system. However, a lot of places such as the Northeast corridor are not going to be able to add another lane to I-95. We have to have another option for our transportation dollars. That is all this amendment does. It gives, along with every other State, an option we need to keep intercity transportation and rail systems viable. That includes States in the Midwest, West, and South, which is why S. 1144, the bill on which this amendment is based, is cosponsored by 36 Senators including, I note with interest, the distinguished majority leader. 
   The simple notion of balance says we ought to give all the parts of our transportation system the resources they need and we should give our citizens the full range of transportation choices that citizens in every other advanced economy in the world can now take for granted. It is time to stand up for this language. There is no principled argument on Federalism. 
   I thank my friend from Ohio for his leadership, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this resolution to designate Monday, June 19, 2000 as ``National Eat Dinner with Your Children Day,'' cosponsored by Senators GRASSLEY, LEVIN, JEFFORDS, BRYAN, KENNEDY, MURRAY, MOYNIHAN, SESSIONS, DEWINE, HELMS, THURMOND, SCHUMER and INOUYE. A similar resolution has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives RANGEL and MCCOLLUM. 
   In addition to designating June 19--the day after Father's Day--as National Eat Dinner with Your Children Day, the resolution also recognizes that eating dinner as a family is a critical step toward raising healthy, drug-free children and it encourages families to eat together as often as possible. 
   The idea for this resolution grew out of research by The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA, on teen attitudes about drug use. For four years running, the CASA teen survey has highlighted the power that parents have over their children's decisions regarding drug use, showing that children and teens who routinely eat dinner with their families are far less likely to use illegal drugs, cigarettes or alcohol: 
   Teens who rarely eat dinner with their parents are 72 percent more likely than the average teen to use drugs, cigarettes and alcohol. 
   Teens that almost always eat with their families are 31 percent less likely to smoke, drink or do drugs than the average teen. 
   Of course, having dinner as a family is a proxy for spending time with kids. It is not the meat, potatoes and vegetables that alter a child's likelihood to use drugs, it is the everyday time spent with mom and dad--the two most important role models in most kids lives. 
   I do not believe that this resolution will be the silver bullet to solving this nation's drug problem. But I do feel these statistics are telling. CASA President Joe Califano talks about ``Parent Power.'' It is important that parents know the power they have over their children's decisions and the power that they have to deter kids from drinking, smoking or using drugs. For example, nearly half of teens who have never used marijuana say that it was lessons learned from their parents that helped them to say no. 
   Unfortunately, many parents are pessimistic about their ability to keep their kids drug-free; 45 percent say that they believe their child will use an illegal drug in the future. 
   This pessimism is often reinforced by news reports that indicate that while most parents say that they have talked to their kids about the dangers of drugs, only a minority of teens say that they have learned a lot from their family about the dangers of drugs. Rather than be discouraged by this apparent disconnect, I think it should teach us an important lesson: that talking to kids about drugs ought not just be a one-time conversation. It should be an ongoing discussion that includes asking children where they are going, who they are going out with, whether there will be adult supervision, etc. These lessons can also grow out of spending time with a child, helping that child to learn how to work through problems or rise above peer pressure, and parents setting a good example for kids. 
   Keeping up on children's lives--including knowing who their friends are and what they are doing after school--is critical. The experts tell us that some of the tell-tale signs that a child is drinking or using illicit drugs are behavior changes, change in social circle, lack of interest in hobbies and isolation from family. These changes can be subtle; picking up on them can require a watchful eye. 
   Eating dinner as a family will not guarantee that a child will remain drug-free. But family dinners are an important way for parents to instill their values in their children as well as remain connected with the challenges that children face and help them learn how to cope with problems without resorting to smoking, drinking or using drugs. 
   I sincerely hope that each one of my colleagues join me to support this resolution to send a message to parents that they can play a powerful role in shaping the decisions their kids make regarding drinking, smoking and drug use.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the Chairman for taking the time to discuss an issue that is very important to my colleagues, myself, and national security--the modernization our strategic airlift fleet. 
   In this year's Defense Appropriations report, there is a restriction on using procurement funds for avionics upgrades of the C-5As. The Report also appears to restrict the High Pressure Turbine Replacements. I do not believe that was the Committee's intent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. I understand, however, that the Committee is concerned about the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) for the C-5 As. Just to clarify, there are two models of C-5s in the Air Force, 76 of the older A-model and 50 of the newer B-model. The C-5's mission is to take heavy loads over a long-distance. It is capable of carrying more cargo farther than any other plane in the United States' military. 
   In particular, the C-5 regularly runs missions to and from Europe and the Pacific and the United States. For this reason, compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization's rules in high-density flight areas is important for the entire fleet of C-5s. The AMP will bring C-5 aircraft into compliance with the new Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Compliance with GATM is important because it allows aircraft to use more operationally efficient airspace and lowers operational costs. 
   This is one of the reasons that the Senate Committee on Armed Services specifically requested that the Secretary of the Air Force proceed to test AMP upgrades on both A and B models in its Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Report and that both defense committees in the House of Representatives supported this program for the entire C-5 fleet.

   Mr. BIDEN. I share the Senator's concern that we have still not received MRS '05 and the AoA. However, my conversations with the Air Force lead me to believe that both A and B model planes are expected to be flown by the Air Force for 20 to 40 years to come, whether in Active-duty, Reserve, or Guard units. 
   While I know that no one in the Senate cares more about the safety of our military personnel than my colleague from Alaska, I remain concerned that some increased risk will be incurred by aircrews flying planes that have not had AMP upgrades. AMP also includes the installation of important safety features like Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System and an enhanced all weather navigational system, the Terrain Awareness and Warning System. Some of these systems were mandated by Congress after the tragic death of Secretary Ron Brown.

   Mr. BIDEN. In that case, I think it important to consider the difficulty of proceeding with upgrading the C-5Bs without A models available to do regular missions to Europe where the compliance issues could become a problem. 
   In addition, if I am correct about the continued use of the C-5As for decades to come, then not proceeding with the AMP for the A models will create a set of new problems. 
   First, efficient use of aircrew members and crew interfly will be prevented because of the dissimilarities that would exist between A and B model avionics and navigation systems. This is particularly problematic when additional aircrew members are needed to meet Major Theater War requirements. 
   Second, by attempting to maintain two separate avionics and navigation systems within the relatively small C-5 fleet (126 airplanes), additional spares and support equipment will be necessary with increased unit costs. 
   Already, the C-5 has been particularly hard-hit by the lack of necessary parts. This is likely to 
   exacerbate that problem. 
   Last, the language will also create changes in the existing contracts for these on-going programs. Until we know for sure what MRS '05 and the AoA will say, creating this new difficulty does not make sense.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I and my colleagues--Senators ROTH, KENNEDY, and THURMOND--are reintroducing an amendment that the Senate passed last year to provide long overdue justice for the two fine military officers, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. 
   Last year the Senate voted to include this amendment in the Defense authorization bill, but because the House had not considered such a provision, it was not included in the final conference report. 
   This year, having had time to consider the facts, the House Armed Services Committee included the exact same language that the Senate passed last year in their fiscal year 2001 Defense authorization bill, which passed the full House on May 18. 
   I also want to remind my colleagues that this resolution has the support of various veterans groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. It is also a move supported by former Chiefs of Naval Operations, including Admirals Thomas H. Moorer, Carlisle Trost, J.L. Holloway III, William J. Crowe, and Elmo Zumwalt. 
   As most of you know, Admiral Kimmel and General Short commanded U.S. forces in the Pacific at the time of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Afterwards, they were blamed as completely responsible for the success of that attack. 
   I will not go through an exhaustive review of this case. I think the amendment itself provides the facts and the record from last year's debate was also quite thorough. Instead, I want to review the reasons I think this is the right action to take. 
   For me, this issue comes down to basic fairness and justice. It was entirely appropriate for President Roosevelt to decide to relieve these officers of their command immediately following the attack. Not only was it his prerogative as Commander in Chief, he also needed to make sure the nation had confidence in its military as it headed into war. So, I can understand the need, at that time, to make them the scapegoats for the devastating defeat. What I do not accept is that the decisions of this government in those extreme times have been left to stand for the past 59 years. 
   To be more specific, it was a conscious decision by the government to actively release a finding of ``dereliction of duty'' a mere month after Pearl Harbor. Not one of the many subsequent and substantially more thorough investigations to follow agreed with that finding. Even worse, the findings of the official reviews done by the 
   military in the Army and Navy Inquiry Boards of 1944--saying that Kimmel and Short's forces were properly disposed--were classified and kept from the public. 
   Think about it. We are a nation proud to have a civilian led military. The concept of civilian rule is basic to our notion of democracy. This means that the civilian leadership also has responsibilities to the members of its military. The families of Admiral Kimmel and General Short were vilified. They received death threats. Yet, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were denied their requests for a court martial. They were not allowed to properly defend themselves and their honor. 
   Whatever the exigencies of wartime, it is unconscionable that government actions which vilified these men and their families should continue to stand 59 years later. It is appropriate that government action be taken to rectify this. There are very few official acts we can take to rectify this. The one suggested by this amendment is to advance these officers on the retirement list. They were the only two officers eligible for such advancement after Congress passed the 1947 Officer Personnel Act, denied that advancement. 
   I also want to point out that I do not believe this is rewriting history or shifting blame, instead, it is acknowledging the truth. The 1995 report by then Undersecretary Edward Dorn said, ``Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly shared.'' To say that and then take no action to identify others responsible or to rectify the absolute scapegoating of these two officers is to say that military officers can be hung out to dry and cannot expect fairness from their civilian government. 
   Again, with civilian leadership, comes responsibility. This advancement on the retirement ranks involves no compensation. Instead, it upholds the military tradition that responsible officers take the blame for their failures, not for the failures of others. The unfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were blamed entirely and forced into early retirement. As Members of Congress we face no statute of limitations on treating honorable people with frankness and finding out the truth so that we can learn from our mistakes. 
   By not taking any action to identify those who Undersecretary Dorn says share the blame, we have denied our military the opportunity to learn from the multiple failures that gave Japan the opportunity to so devastate our fleet. 
   This is not to say that the sponsors of this amendment want to place blame in a new quarter. This is not a witch-hunt aimed at those superior officers who were advanced in rank and continued to serve, despite being implicated in the losses at Pearl Harbor. Instead, it validates that the historic record, as it is becoming clearer and clearer, is correct to say that blame should be shared. This amendment validates the instincts of those historians who have sought the full story and not the simply black-and-white version needed by a grieving nation immediately following the attack. 
   So, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment again this year. Quite simply, in the name of truth, justice,  and fairness, after 59 years the government that denied Admiral Kimmel and General Short a fair hearing and suppressed findings favorable to their case while releasing hostile information owes them this official action.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that addresses a problem that I have seen directly impact the moral and readiness of units at the base I am most familiar with, Dover Air Force Base. First, I want to thank the committee for all of its hard work on this issue and for accepting this amendment. Despite the fact that we in Congress have increased the funding levels for spare parts for the past three years, the supply of spare and repair parts for the C-5's at Dover has been inadequate. 
   What does this mean? It means maintenance crews must work two-to-three times as hard because they have to cannibalize parts from other airplanes. It means planes that should be performing missions are being used for parts so that other planes may fly. It means that planes spend between 250 and 300 days on average in depots, waiting for regular maintenance, modernizations, and part replacements. 
   At Dover, from 1997 to 1999, an average of 7 to 9 C-5 aircraft were not available because of a lack of parts. This is out of a total fleet at Dover of only 36 aircraft! In addition, the average manhours required for cannibalizations during that period was between 800 and 1,000. Those are additional hours, above what is normally expected to replace a part. 
   Think of that in terms of a typical 40 hour work week--that's 20 to 25 additional weeks of work! Clearly, our maintenance teams cannot be expected to continue working like this. These are highly skilled professionals who are willing to sacrifice for this nation because they know how important the C-5's mission is to national security. It is absolutely wrong of this nation to continue to ask them to make those sacrifices year in and year out. We must get them the tools, and in this case, the parts, to do their jobs the right way. 
   In his testimony March 3, 2000 before the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Service Committee, Secretary of the Air Force F. Whitten Peters talked about the problem, pointing out that, ``The C-5 related MICAP rate had increased over the last two quarters by 36 percent.'' Just to clarify, MICAP rate is defined by the Secretary ``as the total hours a maintenance technician waits for all the parts that have been ordered to fix an aircraft.'' 
   In that same testimony, the Secretary also said, ``The impact of these additional MICAP hours has been a decline in readiness.'' 
   The problem is not just a Dover problem. On March 7, 2000, Major General Larry D. Northington, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Budget) for the Air Force testified on the problem of parts shortages throughout the Air Force to Readiness Subcommittee. He pointed out that we must look at all aspects of this problem. ``We must, therefore, expect significant spares investments for along time to come. We also need to understand that mission capable rates are not a product of spares funding alone. It requires dollars, deliveries of the right parts, trained and experienced technicians, and, over time, a sustained effort to upgrade the fleet to achieve higher levels of reliability and maintainability.'' 
   In other words, this is not a problem that can be solved by increased funding alone. We must also look at the entire structure that is supposed to be delivering parts and making sure we have adequate numbers of experienced people to maintain aircraft. In addition, we have to look at long-term modernization. 
   I am very pleased that this committee has fully supported the three C-5 modernization programs that are critical to improving reliability and maintainability--High Pressure Turbine Replacement, Avionics Modernization Program, and Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program. 
   Already, the High Pressure Turbine replacements that have occurred has meant that engines stay on their wings  at least double the time they had in the past before needing to be removed for maintenance. This is an easy mid-term fix that is already paying for itself. For the longer term, new engines are essential. The Committee authorized full funding for the necessary testing and design to put new engines on the C-5 and to replace antiquated parts that are particularly prone to breaking. 
   The C-5 engine was one of the first large jet engines ever made. Commercial planes are a good 5 generations of engines beyond the C-5. It is no wonder that there are no longer parts suppliers available. In fact, it can take up to two years to get parts because manufacturers no longer make those parts and so new versions must be created. Two years is not acceptable. With new engines, reliability will increase and operations and maintenance costs will go down. This not only means enhanced readiness, it also means that our military personnel doesn't have to work 20 to 25 extra weeks a year. 
   In addition, the committee fully supported the Avionics Modernization Program. This program will ensure that C-5's can fly in operationally more efficient airspace under the new Global Air Traffic Management System. In addition, this program improves the safety of aircrews by installing systems like Traffic Collision and Avoidance Systems (TCAS) and enhanced all weather navigation systems. Clearly, as the committee recognized, we cannot justify delaying these important upgrades to the entire C-5 fleet. 
   Until these modernization programs are completed though, the immediate problem is the day-to-day maintenance needs. Foremost among those needs is that parts be available to keep planes flying and that the cannibalization rates be reduced. 
   The current situation cannot continue. It daily hurts the morale of our personnel and lowers the readiness of our military force. The C-5 is the long-legged workhorse of our strategic airlift fleet. It carries more cargo and heavier cargo further than any other plane in our inventory. It is what gets our warfighters and their heavy equipment to the fight. It is also what gets humanitarian assistance to needy victims quickly enough to make a difference. 
   My amendment simply requires the Secretary of the Air Force provide two reports to Congress, one by January 31 and one by September 30 of next year on the exact situation of C-5 parts shortages, what is being done to fix this problem, what the impacts of the problem are for aircraft readiness and reliability ratings, and what the impacts of the problem are for personnel readiness and retention. It is my hope that such a thorough review will allow us to take the necessary steps to fix this problem once and for all. I know that the Air Force is concerned and taking steps to improve the parts shortage problem. I want to make sure that those efforts are comprehensive and that the hardworking men and women at Dover Air Force Base get some relief.

   Mr. BIDEN. I say to the managers of the bill--if I can get Senator WARNER's attention--as Senator WARNER knows, the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, and Senator LEVIN knows, I had planned to offer the Violence Against Women Act as an amendment. In the meantime, the fellow with whom I have worked most on this legislation, and who has played the most major part on the Republican side of the aisle on the violence against women legislation has been Senator HATCH. 
   He and I have been working to try to work out a compromise. We think we have done that on the violence against women II legislation, reauthorization of the original legislation. 
   Because of his cooperation and his leadership, actually, I am prepared to not offer my amendment. But I do want the RECORD to show why. It is because of Senator HATCH's commitment and leadership for us to move through the Judiciary Committee with this and find another opportunity to come to the floor with it. 
   With the permission of the managers, I will yield--without the Senator from Minnesota losing his right to the floor--to my friend from Utah to comment on the Violence Against Women Act.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to endorse the measure to name the State Department's headquarters after one of the great leaders of the twentieth century--President Harry S Truman. 
   Harry Truman symbolized the path that this country took during the ``American Century,'' moving from a small community in the American midwest, to the center of the world stage, where he helped rebuild a devastated Europe and contain Communism. 
   Harry Truman might have stayed on his farm in Independence, Missouri, but World War I intervened and he found himself in Europe as a captain in the Field Artillery. The man whose poor eyesight had kept him out of West Point, was a hero on the battlefields of France. When he returned to Independence--and the beautiful Bess Wallace--his reputation as a leader in battle led to his election as county judge in 1922. In 1935 he was elected Senator from Missouri, and in 1945, he became President upon the death of Franklin Roosevelt. 
   Truman's mother once said of him: (i)t was on the farm that Harry got his common sense. He didn't get it in town. It was this common sense--a hard-eyed pragmatism, really--that made him a great President. Having fought through the First World War in Europe, he was able to understand the ruin that faced Europe after the Second World War. This led to his support of the brilliant plan of his Secretary of State, George Marshall, who rebuilt Europe. It is not an exaggeration to say that our European allies own the peace and prosperity that they have enjoyed for the last two generations to Truman and Marshall. 
   It was also this hard-eyed pragmatism that gave Truman a clear view of the Communist threat that come on the heels of World War II. He laid out--and acted upon--the Truman Doctrine--in 1947, when he provided $400 million to fight the spread of Communism in Greece and Turkey. In 1949, he joined with Europe to form the alliance that contained the Soviet Union for nearly 50 years--NATO. And, although we were weary of war in 1950, he sent American forces to defend South Korea from incursions by the Communists of North Korea. 
   Harry Truman's foreign policy decisions were never easy. Europe's reconstruction, fencing in Communism, creating NATO, required clear vision, and a decisiveness that had nothing to do with favorable poll numbers or reelection prospects. Those are the attributes that made Harry Truman a great President--an ability to see what needed to be done, and the willingness to do it. 
   Because President Truman's greatest legacy was in international affairs, it is fitting that his name be bestowed on the State Department's main building. I hope that it will provide an inspiration to our diplomats, as they seek to defend the interests of our country, and the world.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Kerrey amendment is a sensible proposal that merits bipartisan support. 
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff decided many years ago under the Bush administration that we could safely go below START I force levels. President Bush signed START II, and the Senate approved it in 1996. 
   Now the Russian parliament has approved START II. That treaty cannot enter into force yet, due to differences over the ABM Treaty, but both the United States and Russia could usefully go below START I levels. 
   The Joint Chiefs have consistently opposed the statutory ban on going below START I levels. As General Shelton said to Senator LEVIN in an answer for the record.  
   The cold war is over....... The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to consider options that will reduce our strategic forces to the levels recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review. The START I legislative restraints will need to be removed before we can pursue these options.  
   The ban that the Kerry amendment would repeal is a hindrance to rational planning and resource allocation. It makes us maintain forces that are not needed, at the expense of more pressing needs. As General Shelton replied to Senator LEVIN: ``Major costs will be incurred if we remain at START I levels.'' 
   The Warner second-degree amendment would retain this ban for another year-and-a-half, for no good reason. 
   It would prevent the President of the United States from implementing strategic force reductions that are supported by our military leaders. It would also prevent his successor from implementing such reductions for nearly a year, and from deactivating any of those forces for another 30 days beyond that. 
   This is not just a slap in the face of our President--although it is surely that. It is also a slap in the face of the likely Republican nominee for President, Governor Bush of Texas. 
   Two weeks ago, Governor Bush proposed cuts in U.S. forces below the START II level--not just below START I, but below START II. Governor Bush said: ``The premises of Cold War nuclear targeting should no longer dictate the size of our arsenal.'' 
   He may think that the White House is the home of cold war thinking. If the American people should ever elect Governor Bush to be our President, however, he'll find that the cold war is alive and well a couple of miles east of the White House--in his own party. 
   Governor Bush added, 2 weeks ago:  
   ..... the United States should be prepared to lead by example, because it is in our best interest and the best interest of the world. This would be an act of principled leadership--a chance to seize the moment and begin a new era of nuclear security.  
   Would the Warner amendment allow him to seize the moment? Not for many months. 
   Imagine our new President negotiating with President Putin of Russia in 2001. Putin says: ``Let's do START III.'' President Bush (or President GORE) replies: ``Heck, my Senate won't even let me go under START I. Come back next year!'' 
   Hamstringing the President in this way is silly, and we all know that. The Joint Chiefs opposed it; the future Republican nominee for President wants to go far beyond it; and the Congressional Medal of Honor winner from Nebraska, whom the Senator from Virginia praised just last night, would never undermine our national security. 
   Let's stop playing games. Let's defeat the Warner amendment and support the Kerrey amendment. 
   Mr. President, I will respond to some of what I have heard in today's debate. My dad has an expression: Sometimes what people say is not what they mean, even though when they say it, they think they may mean it. That sounds confusing. I always used to wonder what he meant by that. I think I understand it better now. 
   The Senator from Virginia has an amendment that, with all due respect to him, is bad logic, bad law, and bad politics. I know him to be a much more informed fellow. I have asked myself why, why does he have this amendment? What is the real reason? I am not suggesting duplicity. I am not suggesting any kind of treachery, but why? Why would you have an amendment that says a President cannot do what a previous President said was proper to do and all the military people then and since then have said we should do? Why would you do this? 
   It has dawned on me that we are finally getting to the place--I suggest humbly--that I predicted we would get to 18 months ago. We are finally coming out of the closet in the real debate. The real debate is whether there should be arms control any longer or not. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks a piece by Charles Krauthammer on this very point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. It is in the latest Time magazine. Mr. Krauthammer is a very bright fellow. The thesis of his piece is that no one really listened to what George W. had to say. Everybody misunderstood what he meant when he stood up, with Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell and George Shultz standing behind him, and laid out his position, at least his position on nuclear weapons and on national missile defense. 
   He said that what Governor Bush really means is that this is a new era. No more arms control, period. START I, START II, START III, START anything, START V--no more. He ends his article by saying we should make our judgments about whether to reduce our weapons or to increase our weapons, or whether to build a national missile defense, irrespective of anything other than what we believe should be done at that moment. And that dictates, he says, the end of arms control. 
   That is what this debate is about. Cut through all the haze here. The problem with the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Nebraska, and my two colleagues on the floor now, is that we know too much about this. We are like nuclear theologians. I have been doing this for 28 years. I used to know what the PSI of the Soviet SS-18 missile silo was. That is very valuable information for someone to have to walk around with. The old joke is that we have forgotten more about these details than most people ever learned. In the process, we also forgot what this is really about. 
   What is the logic of the Warner amendment? The logic is that this President cannot enter into any more agreements. Really he doesn't need an agreement to go down, but what they are worried about is that he could decide, either with Russian President Putin or without Putin, to take numbers down to the START II levels, and that that will be offered as a sign of good faith to Putin that the President, in fact, is ready to go lower, which is what the Russians want in a START III agreement.  
   This is about arms control. Let's cut through all the malarkey. Before this next 12 months are over, in the next administration--Democrat or Republican--it will finally be out in the open. This place will be divided between those who say that arms control has a place in our strategic doctrine and those who say it has no place. We are getting there. We are getting there, inching to it. They are feeling their way, I say to my friend from Nebraska, feeling their way around this because, up until now, arms control has been the Holy Grail of both Republicans who are informed and Democrats who are informed. Nobody except the wackos has been flat opposed to any arms control. But there is a feeling emerging in the intellectual community on the right, as well, that what we should be doing as the United States of America, because of our overwhelming military political and economic superiority relative to the rest of the world, not just the Russians--is taking advantage of the luxury of dictating outcomes without consultation. 
   My friend from Virginia knows that a lot of his friends and my acquaintances in think tanks on the right believe what I just said. I am not saying the Senator does. But that is the genesis, the root, the cause of this debate--a legitimate debate to have. But they are just a little afraid, in this election year, to say they don't like arms control: If we are elected, no more arms control. We will adjust, or not adjust, to the levels that we choose independently, not in the context of a negotiation with anyone else. That is what this is about, with all due respect to my friends who support the amendment; even if they don't think that is what it is about, that it is just logical, rational, political purpose. 
   Think what you are saying. You are telling the President of the United States of America: you can't go down--although, by the way, constitutionally we probably can't do this. He is Commander in Chief. Nobody has been more aware than I of the prerogative of the Senate as it relates to the war clause and the Constitutional relationship of the authority between the executive and legislative branches relative to the ability to use force and/or control the forces we have. 
   The reason that there was a provision on the Commander in Chief was not to allow Presidents to go to war unilaterally. It 
   was rather to make sure Congresses didn't tell George Washington he could or could not move troops out of Valley Forge. They had a bad experience during the Articles of Confederation. So they wrote it in saying, hey, don't tell the Commander in Chief he can't steam here with the fleet or he can't move the flanks there, or he can't move troops from one place to another. That is what somebody should do day to day. We are telling him in the law and in the Warner amendment that he cannot reduce force numbers to something that has been negotiated and that everybody says makes sense. 
   Let me return to the Krauthammer piece, entitled ``The End of Arms Control; George W. Bush Proposed a Radical New Nuclear Doctrine. No One Noticed.'' 
   Byline: Charles Krauthammer. Concluding paragraph:  
   We don't need new agreements; we only need new thinking. If we want to cut our nuclear arsenal, why wait on the Russians? If we want to build a defensive shield, why ask the Russians? The new idea--extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily obvious--is that we build to order. Our order. 
   Read my lips. No new treaties.  
   That is what this is about. Whether old ``W'' knows it or not--and I don't know that he does; I mean that sincerely; he may know more than all of us on the floor combined; he may know as little as it appears that he knows; I don't know--this approach says ``no new treaties.'' That is what this is about. 
   So I would like us to have national elections. There should be a national referendum as well. We should have a national debate on that. I urge my friends to come out of the closet completely. Let's have an up-or-down debate. It is a little embarrassing to make the case for the Warner amendment on either logical grounds or constitutional grounds or political grounds, based on the way it is now. It doesn't add up. 
   I thank the Chair. I see my time is up. I thank my colleagues, and I have a feeling this is only the beginning of what is going to be a big, big, long debate--not on this particular amendment, but for this Nation.

   Mr. BIDEN. Well, I would respond rapidly by saying that we have enough trouble figuring what happened in this Chamber, let alone a new parliamentary body in a place called Russia. I think what they did was to put those conditions on because we had said we wanted these protocols. 
   We negotiated with them. They cannot anticipate that we in the Senate do not want to do what our Presidents have negotiated with them to get done. But there is a little concern by them about this Senate like we are concerned about them. 
   They are saying: Look, you negotiated a START II treaty with us, and you also negotiated demarcation protocols with us that you asked for. We didn't say we want new protocols to allow certain missiles to fly at certain speeds, et cetera. We didn't ask for that. You came to us and you said that. 
   We agree. If you are going with the whole package you negotiated with us over the years, we are in on the deal. If you are not going with the whole package you negotiated with us, we are not in on the deal, because we don't know what you are about. 
   I think that is what they are thinking. That is what I think. Keep in mind that the demarcation protocols the Senators are talking about are not protocols that the Russians initiated. They did not sit down and say: By the way, let's accommodate your ability to have theater missile defenses. We said: We want to be able to do that. And we went to them. They said: We don't want to do anything on the protocol. We said: You have to. So there were negotiations for several years. And they said OK. Finally, they signed it. 
   That is what I think. I don't know. I have enough trouble figuring out this place, let alone the Duma.

We said we will not ratify the extension of START II deadlines unless you, the Russians, allow us to test these theater missile defenses, which you claim are in violation of the ABM Treaty. Unless you amend the ABM Treaty to allow us to do this and also ratify START II, we will not ratify START II extension or go to START III. Right?

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the chairman yield for another response? I will be very brief. Let me make an analogy for the chairman. 
   Say we have a contract with someone on the rental of an apartment building. We say we want to renegotiate that contract to be able to rent to build 12 more units on that apartment building. We say: By the way, although parking is no part of this lease, we want to renegotiate our parking lot agreement with you as well. Before we agree to go into a new deal with you on the building, we want to get 10 more parking spaces. The guy who owns the building says: Wait a minute. I don't want to. I will only negotiate with you on the building. We say: We are not going to do it unless you give us more parking spaces. 
   That is what we did here. They said they want to go to START III. We said we are not going to do that unless you give us more parking spaces--unless you allow us to do something the ABM does not allow us to do right now. You give us the ability to test these missiles at a faster speed to be able to intercept your missiles that are called theater nuclear missiles. You allow us to do that. If you do not, we are not going to renegotiate a deal on the whole building. Do the parking, or we will not even talk about the building. 
   That is what we said. We said allow us to amend ABM, or we are not going to go down to these levels. 
   That is what happened.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my continued endorsement for the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic Byways Program, and to express my support for the Kennett Pike Preservation Committee's efforts to seek both state and federal scenic byways designation for Route 52, the Kennett Pike, in New Castle County, Delaware. 
   The National Scenic Byways Program recognizes roadways that exhibit outstanding examples of scenic, historic, recreational, cultural, archeological or natural qualities along their routes. The Kennett Pike boasts a number of cultural, scenic, historic and recreational values that I believe make it an excellent candidate for federal designation as a national scenic byway. 
   Originally constructed in the 1700's and named Doe Run, the Kennett Pike maintains much of its original character, despite more than 200 years of steady development in the area. During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington and his troops were thought to have marched along the road, and, during the Civil War, soldiers settled at Camp Brandywine, now the location of an intersection on the Pike. 
   Along its route, not only will you find world renown tourist attractions, including Winterthur Museum, Hagley Museum and Longwood Gardens, but also historic villages, numerous inns, farms, parks and mills. Within the Kennett Pike Corridor, over 30 sites are already listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with many more sites in the corridor also eligible for the historic designation. 
   In addition to its historic and cultural relevance, the Kennett Pike has been designated a greenway by the State of Delaware. A ride along the Pike reveals a beautiful landscape of rolling hills, forests and a state park. The Kennett Pike is truly a gem among the ever increasingly populated suburban landscape of the middle Atlantic region. 
   In the Fall of 1999, the State of Delaware received a grant from the Federal Highway Administration, in the amount of $140,000, to establish a state scenic byways program. A roadway can only be nominated for a national scenic byway designation after it has been designated on the state level. 
   It is my hope that the State will act quickly and implement its scenic byways program, so I can continue my efforts to see that Route 52, the Kennett Pike, is designated the first national scenic byway in the State of Delaware.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator BOXER, a bill to authorize the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make available to a private entity archival materials from the Africa Division of the Voice of America. This bill is also being introduced today in the other body by Representative CYNTHIA MCKINNEY, who initiated this proposal and asked me to introduce the Senate version of the bill. 
   The bill authorizes the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make available to the Institute for Media Development, a non-profit organization, archival materials of the Africa Division of the Voice of America (VOA). These materials, currently stored at the VOA in analog form, will be put into modern digital form and made available to scholars through the University of California, Los Angeles, and any other institution of higher learning approved by the Board. 
   I believe this is a very useful public-private partnership that will result in a positive benefit to scholars of African studies. As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the Voice of America is not broadcast in the United States. Programs which may be of interest to students and scholars of African politics, history, literature and foreign policy are often inaccessible. Moreover, there is no systematic means, much less the funds, to make such archival material available. And once the programs are aired, there is no guarantee that the analog tape on which they are recorded will be preserved. History may literally be lost, if news shows and interviews with prominent figures in various African countries are not preserved. Storing these recordings in a central archive should prove invaluable in years to come. 
   There will be no cost to the U.S. Government. The bill requires that the government be reimbursed for any expenses it incurs in making such materials available, and for the indemnification of the government in the event that the materials are used in a manner that violates the copyright laws of the United States. I would not anticipate that such copyright violations will occur, because the bill also makes clear that materials made available may be used only for academic and research purposes and may not be used for public or commercial broadcast purposes. 
   I am pleased that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations has agreed to place this legislation on the agenda of the committee later this week. I hope the Committee, and then the full Senate, will give its approval. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed at this point in the RECORD.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about an issue that is going to consume, over the next couple years, a fair amount of this body's time. If there were a contest to name a foreign policy issue that just won't go away, national missile defense would surely be a top contender. 
   The United States has been researching, developing, and sometimes deploying ballistic missile defense systems for almost 40 years now. Throughout this period, the issues of whether to deploy such a system and what system to deploy have prompted intense and often partisan debate. That debate continues today. 
   Two events this week argue strongly, however, for a pause in the partisan wrangling that so often accompanies this debate. The first event was Gov. George W. Bush's call on Tuesday for the President of the United States ``not to make a hasty decision, on a political timetable'' regarding amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deployment of a national missile defense. 
   Anyone on this floor knows that we voted in the last year, assuming that funds are provided and consistent with a policy of continued strategic arms reductions, to deploy a limited national missile defense system ``as soon as technologically feasible,'' and the majority of the Senate voted for that. There has been a bit of a rush, to use the expression we use on the floor, to take steps by the end of this year to ``pour concrete in Alaska.'' That is a euphemism for saying we have to put certain radars up in Alaska in order to meet the timetable to erect by 2005 a limited national missile defense that will defend against, theoretically at least, weapons that may or are likely to be deployed by the North Koreans. 
   Ninety-nine percent of the American people don't even know what we are talking about because we have not yet debated it, and it is going to cost $30 billion at the low end, probably a lot more. They have not heard that number before. What has happened is that we have been in a headlong rush to be in a position to be able to deploy that system in time to meet the looming threat from North Korea. 
   Now Governor Bush comes along, the putative candidate for President of the  United States in the Republican Party, and says: Don't make a hasty decision, Mr. President, on a political timetable. 
   Well, really, we are on a political timetable. What is moving this national missile defense proposal forward as rapidly as it has are the likely events in North Korea over the next 5 to 7 years and a political timetable on the part of some of my Republican friends. Fortunately, Governor Bush has stepped in and said: Let's slow all this down; let's think about this. I think we should listen to him. 
   A second event is Secretary of State Albright's journey to Florence, Italy, where she is making the case for national missile defense to our increasingly nervous allies, who oppose this notion of a limited national missile defense. 
   What shall we make of Governor Bush's stance on national missile defense? He proposes a missile defense to defend not only the United States but also our allies. That is a different proposal from that which we have been legislating on for the past 2 years. He also proposes not only to defend against missiles from so-called rogue states, such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq--which has been the rationale offered as to why we have to move so rapidly toward a national missile defense--but also to protect against accidental launches from anywhere in the world. 
   If we are to defend our allies as well as ourselves, then we are going to have to build a much larger missile defense system than the one being proposed by the Pentagon and the one we have been debating in the Congress for the past year and a half. If we are to defend against accidental launches from any country rather than only attacks from a specific state, then we cannot rely upon the sort of land-based or sea-based boost-phase system that I and others have been supporting as a means of reconciling defense with deterrence, which is different from the system proposed by the Pentagon. 
   Governor Bush stated properly that ``deterrence remains the first line of defense against nuclear attack.'' I assume that means he believes the ABM Treaty is essential, as it is a vital building block in that first line of defense against nuclear attack. 
   Governor Bush promised, properly, that if he were elected President, he would consult with our allies as he developed specific missile defense plans. I, too, have been suggesting, to my Senate colleagues and in high-level meetings, that we had better darn well understand what our allies think about this. 
   My good friend, Senator KYL, who is one of the brighter fellows here and who strongly supports national missile defense, said we should not let what our allies have to say affect what we do. I don't think it is that simple. Governor Bush now comes along and says he wants to make sure we consult with our allies. That is what he would do first after becoming President. This is clearly something we would want to have already done that before we decided to deploy any such system. 
   The push to deploy a system, without working out something with our allies, has not come to fruition yet. But Governor Bush points out another flaw in the argument for proceeding rapidly. He also acknowledges the need to convince Russia that the United States' missile defenses would not be aimed at Russia. 
   Governor Bush indicated a willingness to lower U.S. force levels--although he confuses me. He says ``lower U.S. force levels below the START II levels.'' We have already basically agreed to that in the START III framework that was set in 1997. Is he talking about lowering U.S. nuclear force levels below the 2,000-to-2,500 figure proposed at Helsinki? Or is the suggestion that we lower them only to that level? He was a little unclear in how he stated that, and he leaves me a little unclear--indeed, totally unclear--as to what he means. 
   Governor Bush also suggests that there is a need to move nuclear forces off the hair-trigger alert they are on. I agree. I think he is absolutely right about that. Indeed, Governor Bush stated that ``the United States should be willing to lead by example'' in this area. 
   At the same time, however, Governor Bush spoke approvingly of ``laser technology'' and of ``a space-based system.'' Now, this will surely strike others as it did me--as an allusion to Reagan's support for the ``Star Wars'' system of the 1980s, a notion that has been pretty soundly rejected up until now. It will raise legitimate fears, it seems to me, that a missile defense system deployed by the United States, whatever its size at first, would be enlarged to threaten the deterrent capacity of China, and eventually that of Russia. 
   Would Governor Bush withdraw from the ABM Treaty in order to ``fully explore these options?'' To fully explore the options of laser systems, of space-based systems--does that mean he is going to withdraw from the treaty he seems to imply is the building block upon which our deterrence rests? Or would he defer any decision on deployment until we were certain that the proposed system would successfully meet all of his criteria? His decision in that regard could determine whether his proposal prompted allied support or made them conclude that the United States was choosing missile defense foolishly or recklessly. 
   Admittedly, this was just a press conference, and Governor Bush has not had a chance to flesh this out. But the bottom line is that he is saying: Whoa, slow up, there are a lot of things we haven't answered. We should not keep this on a political timetable. 
   I wonder whether Governor Bush thought through all the implications of his missile defense proposals. How would he assure Russia that the United States would not seek to substitute defense for deterrence--an assurance he says is necessary? How would he avoid an arms race between Chinese missiles and American defenses? Or between China and India? Or then between India and Pakistan? 
   My own view is that the risk of a nuclear arms race in Asia would be the most dangerous consequence of deploying a national missile defense that was not limited to defending against the missiles of specific target states. I fear that such an arms race 
   would be terribly costly and would destabilize China's relations with its neighbors, and that the resulting instability would lead to Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea building nuclear weapons. They have the capacity to do that, and I truly believe they might, if an Asian arms race were to occur as a result of our missile defense deployment. 
   Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that a U.S. intelligence official warned ``that construction of a national missile defense could trigger a wave of destabilizing events around the world and possibly endanger relations with European allies.'' 
   Possible consequences reportedly include China fielding hundreds more missiles, putting MIRVed warheads on its missiles--which it does not have now--and adding countermeasures. We all know that they are measures added to a ballistic missile in order to fool any defensive system. The missile puts out a lot of little things--anything from balloons to what most people would think would be just like little pieces of metal. It is a lot more complicated than that, but the effect is to fool the defensive system as to which object has the nuclear warhead. That is what we mean by countermeasures. They are not hard to field. They haven't yet been fielded by China to any significant degree, to the best of our knowledge. But a U.S. intelligence official foresees China adding countermeasures to frustrate U.S. defenses and, in the words of that intelligence official, ``selling countermeasures for sure'' to countries such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. 
   This is precisely the sort of concern I have been raising for the last several months. I went to a defense conference in Germany with many of the people in the Senate, in the House, and in the Defense Department, as well as the defense establishments from all our allied nations--even some who are not members of NATO. I raised that very question there. 
   No one had an answer, I might add, when I raised the question among all the defense experts. Everybody is prepared to give an estimate of what the North Koreans are likely to do in terms of building not only nuclear capability, but also the capability to have a missile with a third stage that could reach the continental United States, that could not only carry a nuclear warhead, but also be used in chemical or biological warfare.  
   I asked: Can anybody give an estimate to the President as to what the Chinese would likely do if we deployed a national missile defense system? They now have fewer than two dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles. That seems to be a pretty good thing to me. I would not like to see China go to 200, or 400, or 800, or 1,000, which is fully within their capacity. I would not like them to do what the L.A. Times reports that a U.S. intelligence official raises as a possibility. I would not like to see them MIRV their warheads. I would not like to see them have more sophisticated nuclear weapons. I kind of like it where they are. 
   Now, I also raised the question, Has anybody calculated or laid out for the President of the United States what the likely scenario is if China were to significantly increase their arsenal? What would happen in India? What would happen in Pakistan? Has anybody raised this possibility of that being of concern to the Japanese? Well, the truth is, no one had an answer. 
   I even went to a high-level meeting in the Defense Department a couple of months ago, with the Secretary of Defense, other high officials, and those in charge of developing this system. I raised the same question again before the Foreign Relations Committee, on which the occupant of the Chair sits. I asked specifically--and he may have been there--the Director of the CIA if they had done such a study. Apparently, one is underway. Apparently, people are beginning to focus on the other side of this equation. 
   The fundamental rationale for our strategic doctrine is to guard Americans from harm, as best we can, to guarantee the security of those young Senate pages sitting up there and their children and grandchildren. Are we better off with a missile defense system as contemplated and an arms race in Asia, if that were to occur? 
   Or are we better off with the risk that might come from North Korea, if they developed a third stage that could reach the United States and we relied instead upon deterrence? I have not made that final judgment in my own mind. But I know one thing. We don't have enough information now to make a final judgment. 
   All this leads me to conclude that the risks inherent in doing without a national missile defense at this moment might be less than the risk we would accept in building either the Pentagon's proposed missile defense or the sort of defenses that Gov. George Bush has proposed. 
   Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Adviser in the Ford and Bush administrations, is also allegedly concerned. The Los Angeles Times reported that he called the scenario of an Asian nuclear arms race ``plausible'' and warned: ``We ought to think whether we want the Chinese to change their very minimalist strategy.'' 
   I know I don't want China to change their minimalist strategy. I believe anybody who thinks we can affect that outcome would not want China to change its minimalist strategy. I say this--speaking for myself, and clearly not for Brent Scowcroft--not merely because of the added threat that it would pose to the United States of America, but also because of what that would most assuredly cause to happen in India, and what that almost assuredly would cause to happen in Pakistan, and elsewhere. 
   Can anyone in this Chamber suggest to me that if China were to change in a robust fashion their nuclear strategy, that officials are going to sit in Tokyo, and say: You know, let's not worry about this; this is not a problem; we have the American nuclear umbrella? As much as I love our Japanese friends and allies, the last thing I want to see come out of this debate that we are going to have in the next weeks and months, and hopefully next year or so, is a nuclear Japan. 
   I hope General Scowcroft, who is a senior adviser to Governor Bush, will encourage his very important pupil to think carefully about this. 
   Just as I have concerns regarding Gov. Bush's position on national missile defense, so do I have concerns regarding the Pentagon's proposed system and the hurried pace at which a deployment decision is being forced upon the President. 
   Some of my concerns are those of a supporter of arms control, but others relate to the apparent shortcomings of the system the Pentagon proposes. 
   Renowned scientists and former defense officials have said that a land-based missile defense aimed at incoming warheads cannot do the job. 
   The current National Intelligence Estimate on the foreign missile threat to the United States warns:  
   We assess that countries developing ballistic missiles would also develop various responses to US theater and national defenses. Russia and China each have developed numerous countermeasures and probably are willing to sell the requisite technologies. 
   Many countries, such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq probably would rely initially on readily available technology--including separating RVs, spin-stabilized RVs, RV reorientation, radar absorbing material ....., booster fragmentation, low-power jammers, chaff, and simple (balloon) decoys--to develop penetration aids and countermeasures. These countries could develop countermeasures based on these technologies by the time they flight test their missiles.  
   Decades ago, when missile defense research began during the Cold War, the goal was not a perfect defense. 
   Rather, the idea was that by limiting our casualties--both in human lives and in retaliatory forces--a missile defense would buttress our ability to fight and win a nuclear war. 
   Missile defense supporters saw such an imperfect national missile defense as a contributor to deterrence, even though the Nixon administration eventually concluded that it was better to bar such defenses than to engage in an arms race involving both offensive and defensive weapons. 
   Modern proposals for a limited national missile defense are very different, however. They are aimed at deterring countries that would have no hope of defeating the United States in a nuclear war, but would seek to deter or to punish us by building a capability to destroy one or more American cities. 
   To defend against those threats, one's defense must be perfect. Merely limiting the destruction will not suffice. 
   I wonder whether the operational effectiveness of the Pentagon's proposed missile defense will really be sufficient. 
   If a system can kill each warhead 95 percent of the time, then the odds are 1 in 3 that an 8-warhead attack will get at least one warhead through and destroy a U.S. city. If the system can kill each warhead 98 percent of the time, there will still be a 1-in-3 chance that an attack with 21 warheads will get at least one bomb through. 
   In the days when the Presiding Officer and I were younger men, there used to be a bumper sticker that people would put on their car: ``One nuclear bomb can ruin your day''--one warhead getting through. If the objective is to deter against any of these rogue states, a missile defense must be perfect. 
   Missile defense supporters cite the need to avoid being blackmailed by North Korea or Iraq. But I find it hard to see how a national missile defense will give us freedom of action in Korea or the Middle East, if there is still one chance in 3, or even one chance in 5, that a modest attack will wipe out a whole American city. 
   In light of that reality, it is equally hard to understand the Pentagon's commitment to the proposed system, except as the product of bureaucratic inertia and political pressure to deploy the first system it could find. 
   When the Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on missile defense last year, I asked all our witnesses--both supporters and opponents of national missile defense--whether they would support a system limited to that which the Pentagon proposes. Not one of them, proponent or opponent, was prepared to do so. 
   Two commissions chaired by Gen. Larry Welch, former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, have criticized the testing program for the Pentagon's national missile defense system. The term ``rush to failure'' has become part of our everyday vocabulary. We should be equally attentive to Gen. Welch's warning that we are unprepared to determine the ``deployment readiness'' of national missile defense, despite the name of the Defense Department's forthcoming review. 
   The Pentagon's director of operational test and evaluation has voiced similar concerns regarding the limits of our national missile defense testing program. 
   His concerns were seconded last month by the American Physical Society, which warned:   
   A decision on whether or not to deploy the NMD is scheduled for the next few months. The tests that have been conducted or are planned for the period fall far short of those required to provide confidence in the ``technical feasibility'' called for in last year's NMD deployment legislation.  
   The American Physical Society is the premier professional group for physicists in this country. They take no stand on national missile defense itself. They deserve our bi-partisan attention. 
   In recent weeks, former senior officials have counseled delay. Listen to President Reagan's former National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane: ``Still more work is needed before a decision on deployment is made.'' 
   Listen to President Carter's former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski:  
   The bottom line is that at this stage there is no urgent strategic need for a largely domestically driven decision regarding the deployment of the national missile defense. 
   The issue should be left to the next president--to be resolved after consensus is reached with our allies both in Europe and in the Far East, after more credible evidence becomes available regarding the technical feasibility and probable costs of the national missile defense, and after compelling intelligence estimates are aired regarding the origin, scale and timing of likely new threats to the United States and its allies.  
   In a forthcoming article, former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown writes: ``deployment of the present NMD system should be deferred.'' He is joined in that recommendation by two former Deputy Secretaries of Defense, John Deutch and John White. 
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger says: ``In the light of recent ambiguous test results and imminent electoral preoccupations, it would be desirable to delay a final technical judgment until a new administration is in place.'' 
   As we all know, the motivations behind these bi-partisan recommendations are often very divergent. 
   Many Republicans fear that President Clinton will purposely strike a deal with Russia to limit U.S. missile defenses to an ineffective system, hoping that such a deal will make it politically untenable for a Republican president, were one to be elected, to go beyond it. 
   I do not share those fears. The Administration has made clear to Russians and Republicans alike that its proposed ABM Treaty protocol would be only a first step. 
   My fear is rather that the President will be sandwiched: between Russia, which doubts both our intent to deploy a missile defense system and our willingness to limit it; and Republicans, who have tried to make this a partisan campaign issue and have even urged Russian officials not to negotiate with the President of the United States of America. 
   My fear is that the President--in order to show Russia that he is serious, and under pressure from Republicans accusing the Administration of being ``soft'' on the issue--will order the Defense Department to proceed with the deployment of a system that all of us know is the wrong one to build. 
   The time has come to set our fears aside. The fact is that, whatever our views on the wisdom of putting our trust in a national missile defense, many of us oppose the system proposed by the Pentagon. 
   Whatever our views on the larger issues, many of us would be content if the President were to defer both a deployment decision and the choice of a missile defense architecture, and let his successor grapple with those issues. 
   It is also a fact, however, that the President has been under political pressure to proceed with deployment, despite the technical and strategic concerns that many of us share. 
   If missile defense supporters maintain that pressure, they increase the risk that a poor system will be deployed, rather than one that meets our country's needs by any rational measure. 
   I therefore call on the two major presidential campaigns--that of Gov. Bush and that of Vice President GORE--to agree not to seek partisan advantage if the President defers a missile defense deployment decision. 
   I call on all of us in the Congress to give the President the freedom of action to make his decision without political sniping. 
   I also call on both campaigns to agree that negotiations for a path-breaking START III agreement should continue. Gov. Bush stated that he would:  
   ..... ask the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture and determine how best to meet our security needs ..... [and] pursue the lowest possible number consistent with our national security.  
   He added that ``the United States should remove as many weapons as possible from high alert, high-trigger status, another unnecessary vestige of Cold War confrontation.'' 
   There is no reason to defer these two ideas until next year. 
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that it cannot go below the Helsinki target of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads for a START III agreement unless the President changes the nuclear targeting guidance. 
   Gov. Bush has implied that he would seek the Pentagon's advice on alternatives to that guidance, however, and President Clinton should do the same. 
   In summary, the longest-lasting foreign policy debate is not likely to be settled any time soon. There is widespread agreement, however, that we should not let this debate lead us into unwise decisions. 
   With goodwill on both sides, we have an opportunity to suspend the partisan wrangling and let our current and future leaders make their decisions in a rational way. Let us all work together to achieve that shared objective.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is a new drug on the scene--Ecstasy, a synthetic stimulant and hallucinogen. It belongs to a group of drugs referred to  as ``club drugs'' because they are associated with all-night dance parties known as ``raves.'' 
   There is a widespread misconception that Ecstasy is not a dangerous drug--that it is ``no big deal.'' I am here to tell you that Ecstasy is a very big deal. The drug depletes the brain of serotonin, the chemical responsible for mood, thought, and memory. Studies show that Ecstasy use can reduce serotonin levels by up to 90 percent for at least two weeks after use and can cause brain damage. 
   If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is. 
   A few months ago we got a significant warning sign that Ecstasy use is becoming a real problem. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future survey, a national survey measuring drug use among students, reported that while overall levels of drug use had not increased, past month use of Ecstasy among high school seniors increased more than 66 percent. 
   The survey showed that nearly six percent of high school seniors have used Ecstasy in the past year. This may sound like a small number, so let me put it in perspective--it is just slightly less than the percentage of seniors who used cocaine and it is five times the number of seniors who used heroin. 
   And with the supply of Ecstasy increasing as rapidly as it is, the number of kids using this drug is only likely to increase. By April of this year, the Customs Service had already seized 4 million Ecstasy pills--greater than the total amount seized in all of 1999 and more than five times the amount seized in all of 1998. 
   Though New York is the East Coast hub for this drug, it is spreading quickly throughout the country. Last July, in my home state of Delaware, law enforcement officials seized 900 Ecstasy pills in Rehoboth Beach. There are also reports of an Ecstasy problem in Newark among students at the University of Delaware. 
   We need to address this problem now, before it gets any worse. That is why I am pleased to join Senators GRAHAM, GRASSLEY and THOMAS to introduce the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000'' today. The legislation takes the steps--both in terms of law enforcement and prevention--to address this problem in a serious way before it gets any worse. 
   The legislation directs the federal Sentencing Commission to increase the recommended penalties for manufacturing, importing, exporting or trafficking Ecstasy. Though Ecstasy is a Schedule I drug--and therefore subject to the most stringent federal penalties--not all Schedule I drugs are treated the same in our sentencing guidelines. For example, selling a kilogram of marijuana is not as serious an offense as selling a kilogram of heroin. The sentencing guidelines differentiate between the severity of drugs--as they should. 
   But the current sentencing guidelines do not recognize how dangerous Ecstasy really is. 
   Under current federal sentencing guidelines, one gram of Ecstasy is treated like 35 grams of marijuana. Under the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act'', one gram of Ecstasy would be treated like 2 kilograms of marijuana. This would make the penalties for Ecstasy similar to those for methamphetamine. 
   The legislation also authorizes a major prevention campaign in schools, communities and over the airwaves to make sure that everyone--kids, adults, parents, teachers, cops, clergy, etc. --know just how dangerous this drug really is. We need to dispel the myth that Ecstasy is not a dangerous drug because, as I stated earlier, this is a substance that can cause brain damage and can even result in death. We need to spread the message so that kids know the risk involved with taking Ecstasy, what it can do to their bodies, their brains, their futures. Adults also need to be taught about this drug--what it looks like, what someone high on Ecstasy looks like, and what to do if they discover that someone they know is using it. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the United States Senate on numerous occasions to state what I view as the most effective way to prevent a drug epidemic. My philosophy is simple: the best time to crack down on a drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before the abuse of the drug has become rampant. The advantages of doing so are clear--there are fewer pushers trafficking in the drug and, most important, fewer lives and fewer families will have suffered from the abuse of the drug. 
   It is clear that Ecstasy use is on the rise. Now is the time to act before Ecstasy use becomes our next drug epidemic. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and passing it quickly so that we can address the escalating problem of Ecstasy use before it gets any worse.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, we would be 50 percent better off if we adopted the House position than the Senate position. The House position is only half as bad as the Senate position. The House position adopted today says there must be an accounting, as I understand it. The House requires that we pay our fair share, and that unless NATO meets their aid commitments, then troops would be withdrawn. 
   This amendment goes a lot further than that. The real damage of the Byrd-Warner amendment, in my view, is that it does something that I cannot imagine any military man wanting to do. It says that what we are going to do is announce today, tomorrow, the next day--whenever we finally vote on it--if it prevails, we are going to announce  that in the summer of 2001 we are out of there, unless we affirmatively vote to stay. 
   I find this absolutely intriguing. We had a very spirited debate about whether to get involved in Kosovo at all. I do not remember a single, solitary person during that debate who really wanted to be involved. I suspect--as my friend from South Carolina always reminded me--there was no one more vocal about our need to make that effort than me. He would come to the floor --and I consider him one of my closest friends, not only my closest Senate friend--he would say: How is the Biden war going today? 
   I felt strongly it was the right thing for the United States to do. I do not remember any time during that debate--and I believe I participated in every piece of that debate--when anybody said there was any reasonable prospect there would be no American forces in Kosovo 1 year or 2 years or even 3 years from now. We had just gone through this, in my view, very wrongheaded debate about setting a time certain for troops to be withdrawn from Bosnia. We did that once already, and we finally figured out it made no sense to set a time certain to withdraw troops in Bosnia, and here we are again. 
   Let's peel back the first layer of this onion. We have a very legitimate, fundamental, serious disagreement among many of us on this floor, crossing party lines. I do not know anybody stronger against this amendment than the Presiding Officer. He is a Republican. And I do not know anybody stronger for the amendment than Senator BYRD, a Democrat. This division crosses party lines. 
   It boils down to something very basic, it seems to me, and that is, when every Senator asks himself or herself the following question, they will know how they should vote. 
   The question is, Does the United States have a significant interest in peace and stability in the Balkans? If it does not, then my colleagues should vote for Byrd-Warner. I respect that view. I respect the view of those who say it is not a critical U.S. interest, a vital U.S. interest, a significant U.S. interest, or it is Europe's problem. I respect that. I think they are dead wrong, but I respect their view. 
   What I find fascinating, though, is I do not know how anyone can intellectually reach the following conclusion; that it is in our vital interest to see to it there is peace and stability in that part of Europe, but we should announce now that we are out unless we affirmatively vote we are in. I do not get that. 
   My mom had an expression--it is not original to her. She said: JOEY, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
   We are paving a road to hell with this amendment. What we are doing with this amendment is saying to Slobodan Milosevic, unintentionally, but the effect is: Hang on, baby, we do not have the will to stay. 
   Let me ask another question rhetorically: We have 5,600 troops there. Thank God, none are being shot at. Thank God, no one has been killed. Thank God, there is peace. Thank God, they are doing their job. Thank God, there is no immediate jeopardy from an outside invading army, et cetera. Does anybody believe that if we withdraw our forces from Kosovo the Europeans will get it right? Does anybody here believe that the Europeans will say: OK, the United States is gone; no worry, we're going to take care of this matter; not a problem. 
   We can all sit here and say: The GDP of Europe is bigger than ours. Europe should be mature enough to be able to handle this. They don't need us. It is their backyard. 
   That is all well and good to say, but does anybody believe it? In a different context, Thomas Jefferson said: If a nation wishes to be both ignorant and free, it wishes for something that never was and never can be. If anybody believes there can be stability in Europe without stability in the Balkans, they are wishing for something that never was and never can be. Never in our history has it been that way. 
   So let's cut right to the quick. You have to be able to say the following, it seems to me, to be for Warner-Byrd, Byrd-Warner: stability in the Balkans is not important for stability in the rest of Europe; or it is important, but I believe the Europeans can handle it by themselves. 
   If you can conclude either of those two to be true, then have at it. But if you conclude, as Barry Goldwater used to say--and I did serve with him--in your heart you know that not to be true, then you better not vote for this amendment or you better vote to strike this amendment. 
   What are the likely consequences of adoption of this amendment? I will get back to some of the details about the amendment and the requirements imposed upon the administration to be able to certify that the Europeans are doing their part. I will state right now the Europeans are doing their part. We have battered them up and about the head--no one more than this Senator--to do their part. 
   The President will have to certify, though, on a very different standard. By the way, the reason my friends want to amend this is so it can be even remotely possible that the President would be able to certify that the Europeans are doing their part. 
   But regarding individual countries, the European Commission is in the process of collecting data from the 15 member states in the European Council, each of which has unique budgeting procedures in fiscal years. We are utilizing the United Nations. As we already see in the aggregate, our European partners are providing a vast majority of the assistance to Kosovo. 
   If we look at the troop strength, our NATO allies have 40,000 troops on the ground in Kosovo; we have 5,600. That is, the United States is providing about 13 percent of the KFOR troop strength. 
   If we look at UNMIK--I hate these acronyms--but UNMIK's consolidated budget--that is the U.N. piece here--the Europeans, and others, are right now funding 87 percent of that entire budget. Our part, again, compromises only 13 percent of the total. 
   So the benchmark laid out in the legislation has already been met. 
   How about international police? There are civilian police officers sent from the U.N. member states all over the world, who are to relieve KFOR troops of the nonmilitary law and order function in Kosovo. That is the plan. We all support it. Fully 88 percent of the pledges for civilian police for Kosovo have come from outside the United States of America. And 87 percent of all the police officers pledged have already been deployed. 
   Let's look at the so-called reconstruction funding 
   concerning Europe's financial contributions to the reconstruction of Kosovo. Section 2410 of the Byrd-Warner amendment focuses on the speed with which it delivers that assistance. 
   When the United States commits funding for large-scale reconstruction initiatives, sometimes the United States itself does not hit the benchmark set here--33 percent obligated or contracted for a year or two. 
   Let's look at the humanitarian relief. In the spring of this year, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees announced that the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo had been averted. The much feared winter had come and gone. It was time for the international community to switch from a relief role to a reconstruction role. 
   Nonetheless, Senator WARNER's legislation, in section 2410, insists that Europeans continue to funnel money into humanitarian relief when the need no longer is pressing. This is what I might call counterproductive micromanagement from thousands of miles away. 
   The United States is not paying a disproportionate price in the international effort to secure peace in Kosovo--not in terms of the number of peacekeeping troops, not in terms of the number of civilian police, not in terms of the reconstruction and humanitarian aid. 
   Section 2410 is also inconsistent. It really is saying to the Europeans: Heads I win; tails you lose, Europeans. We set these benchmarks. We tell them they have to meet the benchmarks. They are meeting the benchmarks. Then we tell them: By the way, while you're meeting those benchmarks--and you do that first--we are not committing to stay anyway. As a matter of fact, we're out of there. We're out of there. We tell you now, ahead of time, hey, Europe, we're out in July 2001, unless we affirmatively change our mind and stay in. 
   That really is persuasive, isn't it? What do you think it would be the other way around if Europe said: I tell  you what, United States, you put up 87 percent of this endeavor we're going to get involved in. Once you put it up, we are going to tell you that we're not in anyway, unless we change our mind a year and a half from now. 
   Let me ask you a rhetorical question: If you are sitting in Europe--and in the mood that exists in the United States today, in a country that has turned down the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, where the debate is about whether or not we should be involved in Africa, whether we should be involved in anything that comes up internationally--and you hear that the Senate--and hopefully not the Congress as well--passes a law that says we are affirmatively out in 1 year and 3 months, unless we change our minds and affirmatively vote to stay; what do you think that communicates to Europe? What do you think they are going to think in Berlin, in Paris, in London, in Lisbon, et cetera? 
   Do you think they are going to say: Oh, I tell you what: that is just the way their Constitution operates. That is just how they do that? 
   I chaired the Judiciary Committee for years. I have made it my business to try to understand and--most dangerously--actually teach constitutional law and the separation of powers issues, and particularly the war clause. I take a back seat to no one, including my distinguished friend, Senator BYRD, in paying attention to the congressional prerogatives that exist when it comes to the notion of what constitutionally is permissible for a President to do and what our constitutional responsibility is. 
   The truth of the matter is, Congress has the power to authorize deployment to Kosovo or to set limits on deployment. Congress could, as the Byrd-Warner amendment clearly contemplates, cut off funds or circumscribe the missions of the troops. But merely because the Congress has the power to do that does not mean it is wise to exercise that power or that it has the obligation to do that under the Constitution. 
   I would have no objection to a resolution authorizing the deployment of U.S. forces or a resolution today saying: Withdraw now. Withdraw now. At least that would end the uncertainty. It would end the fact that you would have our troops and 40,000 other troops in Kosovo somewhere other than in limbo wondering whether we are going to stay or not stay, wondering what our predisposition is likely to be. 
   I do not believe we should put our troops or our allies under the sword of Damocles with the threat of a funding cutoff that implies the United States is abandoning its friends and allies in Europe now. The fact is, no one is being shot at now, our troops are not being shot at. We are not in a state of war now. 
   There is no outside army. There are a bunch of thugs wandering the countryside who have the possibility of doing harm to our forces and others. This is as close as you are going to get to a legal definition of a police action as you are ever going to have. This is not a circumstance requiring the United States--beyond what was already done in voting for the airstrikes and the use of force--to have Congressional consent beyond what it already has. As one of our colleagues said in the caucus, I didn't hear anybody in 1973 when I was here, or in 1977, or in 1985, or in 1997, or in 2000, call for continued authority, an affirmative vote to continue to maintain 100,000 troops in Europe. 
   With regard to the argument that we are stretched too thin and can't afford to have 5,600 forces in Kosovo for an extended period of time, well, if we can't afford that, how are we able to afford to have 100,000 troops in Europe? I want to know that one. I don't quite get that. I don't quite get how we can afford to have 100,000 troops in Europe, stationed in Germany and elsewhere, where they are not keeping anything except our political flag raised high--and I think that is important--but we can't afford 5,600 troops in Kosovo. If my memory serves me--and I have been here longer than one of the other three Members on the Senate floor. The only person I have been here longer than is Senator WARNER, but he has more experience. The other two Members I haven't been here longer than. I don't ever recall, since I have been here, having less than a minimum of 100,000 in Europe, and as many as 350,000. I don't remember that. But now we have this dire, urgent need to withdraw 5,600 forces from Kosovo. 
   Now, my friend from Virginia and my friend from North Carolina, as well as the Senator from West Virginia--but he is on Appropriations--these other two fellows spend a lot of time on the military side of the equation, and Armed Services in particular. If I am not mistaken, we spent some time in Europe fretting over what the Europeans mean by ESDI, European Security and Defense Initiative. That is something the French have been pushing a long time. They don't like the fact we are a European power. They don't like that idea. So they got this idea they were going to have this independent force--an independent force, separate from NATO. We got them to cool their jets a little bit and say what this really means is they get all that independent force with no Americans. That independent force would only be engaged in missions NATO first refused to be engaged in. But everybody knows that it is a harbinger for diminishing the power and the political efficacy of NATO. 
   I want to ask a rhetorical question. You know, in those movies when Clint Eastwood said, ``Go ahead, make my day''--we are about to make their day for the French. We are about to make France's day. Can you hear the discussion now if we vote this amendment: I told you the United States is not reliable. I told you we need our own European defense system. I told you about NATO. Can't you hear it? Maybe I have been to too many conferences with my French friends. Can anybody stand up and say that if we pass this amendment, we are not making it exponentially more difficult for us to deal with ESDI? Come on. Come on. Does anybody think that? 
   By the way, some of our friends--and they are obviously extremely bright, competent Senators who truly--and I am not speaking of anybody on the floor--believe NATO's day is past 
   and it no longer has any utility, and that we should disengage. In fact, the fellow I ran against a while ago for the Senate came to call me the ``Senator from Europe'' because I supported NATO. I thought it was very important that we stay involved in NATO. I respect the view. I disagree with it, but I respect the view. 
   But those of you who say you think NATO is important, I respectfully suggest to you that if Byrd-Warner becomes the law, we will have done more in two small paragraphs to damage the coherence of NATO than anything we have done since 1950. I truly believe that. I absolutely truly believe that. Obviously, I may be wrong, but I honest to goodness believe that. 
   Right now there are reports coming out of Serbia. By the way, before I say that, I came here at a time when the Vietnam war was in its final painful throes, in 1973. I used to resent it when people would say, when I opposed the war, that we were giving comfort to Ho Chi Minh. I am not suggesting anybody is intentionally or unintentionally giving anybody comfort. I want to state what I think to be the fact. Milosevic is tightening his grip now in Serbia, cutting off the alternative press available to the Serbs, cracking down on it--for example, last night, his goons occupied a station, Studio B2-92, and padlocked the doors of the other independent outlets and media offices and shut them down. An opposition leader declared the Milosevic government had imposed an informal state of emergency. 
   Now, why do you think he is doing that? I think he is doing that because he is desperate, because the hourglass is filling up from the bottom. He knows he doesn't have much time left. One of the reasons why he has reacted the way we wanted him to every time--that is, by backing off--is he has been convinced of our resolve. I suggest that the reason he finally capitulated at the end of that war is we started to move forces in place for deployment in Macedonia. He wasn't sure if we were going to invade and use land troops. I think most who studied that would acknowledge that is an overwhelming possibility. Now what does he do? Here he is in his last gasp, and we have gone on record saying we will pull out of Kosovo by midsummer next year. We affirmatively state that--not that we will have to have a vote next summer, or that we should consider it, but that we are out--unless we vote to stay in.  
   Now, say you are an opposition leader in Serbia; or you are sitting in Montenegro, which Milosevic has been leering at for the past 9 months; does that embolden you? My European colleagues will not like what I am about to say. But I have traveled the Balkan region on seven occasions. I met with every President of every frontline state, as many of us have. Does anybody know any leader in that region who is willing to place his fate in the hands of the Europeans? Can you name me one--a single solitary person who is in opposition to Milosevic, any democrat from Romania to Albania, from Bulgaria to Montenegro, who is willing? 
   Would I tell them: The United States is out, but don't worry, you have the French and the Germans to rely on; don't worry, they will be there? Can anybody stand up on this floor and say that you know a single leader who would say that? 
   I know there are certain things you shouldn't say. That is one, apparently. I will be reminded of this by my French friends and my British friends and others. But I think we have to be realistic. Everybody knows that if we are out, the game is up. That may not be fair. We shouldn't have to carry that much of a load, maybe. But they are the facts of life, and they are the facts of history. 
   Does anybody here believe Europe has achieved political maturation where they are going to solve their problems without the catalyst of the United States? What have we said all along? We have said: Look, as long as we are not carrying a disproportionate share, we are involved. 
   I remember going in to see the President when he made his speech about us being involved. He said we should not be responsible for any more than 15 percent of whatever reconstruction, peace, stability, et cetera, in that region requires. We are about 13 percent to 17 percent. 
   That was kind of the deal we thought we were brokering here. Sure. We provided 85 percent of the air power and 90 percent of leadership. 
   With this amendment, we would still require a NATO commander heading up the entire operation in Kosovo to be an American while we had no American troops there. I want to be there for that discussion. 
   I want to be there when we withdraw all American forces from Kosovo and then we tell our European allies abruptly: By the way, we are still in charge. We are the guys. Our general is an American general. He is in charge. He is in charge of NATO in Europe. That is where NATO is. He is in charge. That is a good one. I like that one. That will really help cohesion in NATO. 
   Heck, we are trying to convince the French that they had better buy an aircraft carrier before they take over the fleet in the Mediterranean. That is a big fight we are now having. The French say: We want a French admiral. 
   I got in trouble with the French when I said: OK, it is fine by me, if you buy some more ships. They didn't like that. 
   Can you imagine the argument now with a NATO operation in Kosovo led by an American general with no American troops? 
   Colleagues, this is not a well conceived plan unless, I respectfully suggest, unless you conclude that NATO is not vital to our interests any longer; unless you conclude that having a beefed up European defense initiative a la the French plan for the last 15 years is a good idea for the United States of America; unless you believe the Europeans can maintain stability in the Balkans, or that stability in the Balkans is not important for stability in Europe. 
   If you draw those conclusions, this makes sense. But if you say you think NATO is vital for American interests, if you say stability in Europe depends at least in some part upon stability in the Balkans and southern Europe, if you say you want an American in command of NATO forces when we have 100,000 left in Europe, then I don't know how you can reach this conclusion. 
   That is why I say here what I said at the White House when all of my friends who are sitting here, with one exception, were at that meeting 3 months ago, along with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, and the National Security Advisor's team. I will say it again. This is about what you believe is important. 
   I ask again a rhetorical question. Can anyone paint a picture for me that looks like this: That 5 years from now there is not a reignition of a great ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, that there is increasing stability in economic growth in the region, and that there is becoming an integration of that part of Europe into the rest of Europe--without the United States of America having some portion of the total force structure of NATO being present? Can anybody paint that picture for me? 
   I will be overwhelmingly delighted if my colleagues prevail and I am wrong, because my fervent hope is, if Senator LEVIN and I and others do not succeed in striking this language, everything I said is misinformed. That would be my fervent hope and prayer, because I think this has certain-disaster written all over it. I think this is one of the most serious mistakes we can make.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond. 
   What the Senator has written in the legislation I would characterize as having tried to do something after the horse is out of the barn. 
   Here is the deal. I am not suggesting there will be any hostilities before the U.S. forces leave. I am not suggesting there will be hostilities as the U.S. forces leave. If I were Milosevic, the KLA, or anybody else, I would have garlands and roses strewn along the road as they were on their way out. I would be throwing them bouquets. I would be giving them chocolates and  cigarettes as they left. I would not do a thing. I would wait until they were gone. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, when they go, I predict to you that you will see in the councils of Europe an overwhelming discussion about whether or not the Europeans will stay, and in what numbers. 
   At that point, if there is hostility, if Mr. Milosevic moves on Mitrovica to annex the top of the state, or if there is a movement in Montenegro to topple the Government, is the Senator saying to me that automatically authorizes the President of the United States to send whatever forces he wishes back in?

   want them to stay.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. 
   Let me rephrase my assertion. The Congress, as of whatever the operative date--and right now the operative date is in July 2001--the Congress does not vote to stay in Kosovo; then the troops must be withdrawn. Now, that is a distinction with a technical, legal difference. 
   What I respectfully suggest is, it will fall on deaf ears in every European capital. I respectfully suggest, if my friends think it is so dangerous or imprudent for us to be there now, if there is a constitutional requirement for us to have to vote on it, then why are we shirking the responsibility of not voting right now? Because if there is a constitutional responsibility, it is not delayed for a year. It either exists or it does not exist. If it exists, the obligation exists today to vote. And my friends want the next Congress to vote in the year 2001. 
   It is illogical to suggest, with all due respect, that there is a constitutional requirement for Congress to vote for these troops to stay but we don't have to do it for a year. The implication is, he doesn't have the authority now. So that takes care of the constitutional argument. There is obviously no serious constitutional argument, for if there were, we have to vote now, I assume, unless someone responds to the contrary that I am correct. 
   Look, folks, thank God that not a single American was killed in the entire war. Thank God, an American hasn't been killed yet, although it is possible. Thank God, there are not 800,000 people displaced and they are back in their homes. Thank God, the ethnic cleansing has stopped. 
   I ask the rhetorical question, if the Lord Almighty came down and sat in the well and said, ``I promise you all that, if you keep 5,600 troops in Kosovo for the next 10 years, there will be no carnage, there will be no death and destruction of American forces,'' would anybody here say that is too high a price to pay? Would anybody say that? Would anybody vote and say, Lord, no, we are stretched too thin? 
   I can pick an awful lot of places where I would like to take 5,600 troops out if we are stretched too thin other than Kosovo. Talk about a place where we are doing some good in what we are not allowing to happen! I think this is one heck of a gamble. The logic escapes me. I may be slow. I have not been here as long as some, but I have been here 28 years. I pay a lot of attention to this. I try my best. And the logic escapes me. If there is a constitutional requirement, it exists today. It exists tonight. It existed yesterday. It doesn't automatically click into effect in July of 2001. 
   If we are stretched too thin, if that is the problem, let's pick 5,600 troops from a place where they are  serving a function, but none nearly as important as the one they are serving now. And if we expect to be and intend to be a major force in Europe and NATO, let's understand that it will not happen without our participation to the degree of 13 percent of the forces in Europe. 
   We asked the Europeans to do the lion's share after Milosevic yielded. They are doing the lion's share, on average over 80 percent and as high as 87 percent in the four categories. So if anybody thinks that does not make sense, let us vote now. Can anybody seriously say that the anxiety level, at a minimum, in European capitals, the anxiety level in the frontline states, the anxiety level for our troops, the anxiety level for the total military, is not somewhat heightened by the fact that it will require, no matter how we get to it, an affirmative vote of the Congress in July of next year to have those troops stay? 
   I will end where I began and reserve the remainder of my time, if I have any. I will end where I began. It seems to me this is a basic, legitimate debate on what is in the naked self-interest of the United States of America. It is a fundamental foreign policy debate. Do you think stability in the Balkans can be maintained without U.S. forces there? If you do not, do you think that stability in the Balkans is necessary for stability in the rest of Europe? If you do not, do you think the United States is negatively impacted by either outcome? 
   While I strongly support trying to move the supplemental funding needed by our military and the important military construction projects included in this bill, Section 2410 would do damage to Kosovo and to the United States of America, despite the best intentions of its authors. 
   Section 2410 is premised on an inaccurate understanding of the facts, and then gets worse, as it abdicates U.S. leadership of NATO and gives comfort to Slobodan Milosevic. 
   There are two aspects to Section 2410. The first would require a joint Congressional resolution authorizing continued deployment of American troops in KFOR after July 1, 2001. 
   The second aspect would require that the Europeans are meeting certain requirements for burdensharing in Kosovo. If the President could not make that certification by July 15, 2000, then thereafter funds would only be allowed to be used for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kosovo, unless Congress authorized their continued deployment by joint resolution. 
   If Congress failed to enact such a joint resolution, no funding could be obligated to continue the deployment of United States military personnel in Kosovo. In that case, the President would be required to submit to Congress, not later than August 15, 2000, a report on a plan for the withdrawal of United States military personnel from Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, the question of whether Congress must, as a constitutional matter, authorize the deployment of U.S. forces in the Kosovo peacekeeping mission is a close one. 
   I yield to no Senator in my defense of the constitutional powers of Congress on matters of war and peace. In my view, Congress has not only the power to declare war, but also to authorize all uses of force. I have consistently resisted arguments by Presidents--Democrats and Republicans alike--that the Commander-in-Chief power provides unfettered authority to use force against foreign countries. 
   In this circumstance, however, I would argue that Congressional authorization for the deployment of U.S. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo is unnecessary. 
   The deployment of peacekeepers, in a situation such as we now have, is not war, or even a use of force. It falls far short of both. Unlike the deployment of U.S. forces to Lebanon in the early 1980's, there is no significant threat of hostilities from a foreign army or from guerilla forces. Rather, the only threat to U.S. forces comes from a handful of lightly-armed thugs in both the Serbian and ethnic Albanian communities in Kosovo. In that sense, the deployment is truly a peacekeeping or police action. 
   Undoubtedly, Congress has the power to authorize the deployment to Kosovo--or to set limits on that deployment. Congress could, as the Byrd-Warner amendment clearly contemplates, cut off the funds, or circumscribe the mission of the troops. But merely because Congress has the power to do so, does not mean that it is wise to exercise that power in this circumstance, in this manner. 
   Mr. President, I would have no objection to a resolution authorizing the deployment of U.S. forces. Let us have that debate. But I do not believe we should do so under the Sword of Damocles, with the threat of a funding cut-off that implies the United States is abandoning its friends and allies in Europe. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the second aspect of Section 2410 would codify burdensharing with our allies. 
   The bill would decrease by twenty-five percent the aid contributions by the United States to Kosovo unless the President certified to the Congress that the European Commission, the member states of the European Union, and European members of NATO were meeting certain targets for assistance expenditures and provision of civilian police in Kosovo. 
   Specifically, the President would have to certify before July 15, 2000 that the Europeans have: 
   First, obligated or contracted at least thirty-three percent of the amount of the assistance that the aforementioned organizations and countries committed to provide for 1999 and 2000 for reconstruction in Kosovo; 
   Second, obligated or contracted for at least seventy-five percent of the amount of humanitarian assistance to which they committed for 1999 and 2000; 
   Third, provided at least seventy-five percent of the amount of assistance to which they committed for the Kosovo Consolidated Budget for 1999 and 2000; and 
   Fourth, deployed at least seventy-five percent of the number of police, including special police, which they pledged to the United Nations international police force for Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, because the United States carried the vast majority of the military burden in last year's air campaign against Yugoslavia, it is now the Europeans' turn to provide most of the peacekeepers and the reconstruction money to win the peace in Kosovo. 
   Our allies agree with this formulation. Furthermore, Mr. President, this is precisely what has already happened, and continues to happen. 
   Finally--after decades of criticizing and cajoling--we finally have before us an example of successful burden sharing in NATO and the United Nations. 
   What is the share of the burden that our NATO allies and other countries are currently bearing? 
   The European Commission has already responded to this proposed legislation by providing a considerable amount of data on assistance programs that it administers. These data show that the European Union meets or surpasses the criteria of the legislation. 
   Regarding individual countries, the European Commission is in the process of collecting data from the fifteen members states of the European Union, each of which has unique budgeting procedures and fiscal years. 
   Utilizing data from the United Nations, however, we can already see that, in the aggregate, our European partners are providing the majority of assistance to Kosovo. 
   If we look at troop strength, our NATO allies have 40,000 troops on the ground in Kosovo. We have 5,600. That is, the United States is providing only thirteen percent of KFOR's troop strength. 
   If we look at the UNMIK Consolidated Budget, the Europeans and others are right now funding about eighty-seven percent of that. Our part, again, comprises only thirteen percent of the total. So the benchmark laid out in Section 2410 has already been exceeded. 
   How about the International Police? They are civilian police officers, sent from U.N. member states all over the world, to relieve KFOR troops of non-military, law-and-order functions in Kosovo. That is the plan. We all support it. 
   Fully eighty-eight percent of the pledges for civilian police for Kosovo have come from outside the U.S., and eighty-seven percent of all police officers pledged have already been deployed. 
   Now let's look at Reconstruction Funding. Concerning Europe's financial contributions to the reconstruction of  Kosovo, Section 2410 focuses on the speed with which it delivers its assistance. When the United States commits funding for large-scale reconstruction initiatives, sometimes the U.S. itself does not hit the benchmark set here--thirty-three percent obligated or contracted--for a year or two. 
   Last, let's look at Humanitarian Relief. In the spring of this year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees announced that humanitarian disaster in Kosovo had been averted. The much-feared winter had come and gone. It was time for the international community to switch from a relief role to a reconstruction role. 
   Nevertheless, Section 2410 insists that the Europeans continue to funnel money into humanitarian relief, when the need is no longer pressing. This is counterproductive micro-managing from thousands of miles away. 
   Mr. President, the United States is not paying a disproportionate price in the international effort to secure the peace in Kosovo--not in terms of the number of peacekeeping troops, not in terms of the number of civilian police, not in terms of reconstruction and humanitarian aid. 
   Mr. President, Section 2410 also is inconsistent. It is really a ``heads I win, tails you lose!'' for the Europeans. 
   The benchmarks in the first part of Section 2410 demand that the Europeans pay more and/or faster and supply the bulk of the troops and police in Kosovo. In the second part, though, the Congress mandates--irrespective of the Europeans' performance on the benchmarks--the enactment of a joint resolution to authorize the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops. The message to Europe boils down to this: pay first, and then we'll see. 
   Aside from these internal contradictions in the legislation, Section 2410 would do serious harm to our geopolitical interests, not only in the Balkans, but in all of Europe. If the mandated burdensharing could not be certified in every detail, the legislation would have one hundred percent of ground troops in Kosovo supplied by NATO allies and other non-American powers, leaving our contribution at zero with one exception: KFOR would remain under the ultimate control of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. General Joseph Ralston. That would be quite a deal for us, but one which I doubt that our allies would support for long. 
   We all know that there are elements in NATO who argue for the need for Europe to have its own ``army,'' independent of NATO. To date, the outline of the European Security and Defense Policy, or ESDP as it is called, has conformed to our wishes. It would only go into action if the alliance as a whole chose not to be involved. 
   If the U.S. Congress were to compel the President of the United States to unilaterally withdraw all U.S. combat troops from the NATO force in Kosovo, you can rest assured that the Europeans would get the message that the ESDP is the wave of the future, not NATO. I can hear the grumbling all over Western Europe: ``The French are right. We'd better have our own army, because we can't count on the U.S. in NATO any more.'' 
   Do we really want this happen? I don't think so. 
   Irrespective of these considerations, I would ask the authors of this section whether they really want to allow American military decisions to be made by other countries, in this case the Europeans? That would be an abdication of responsibility that should horrify any Member of this chamber. 
   Finally, Mr. President, let us consider the dynamic that Section 2410 would set in motion. First of all, let's consider what it would mean in Serbia and Kosovo, on the ground. Make no mistake about it: the result of this bill, unless Section 2410 is eliminated, will be a U.S. withdrawal from Kosovo. What Milosevic could not win on the battlefield, he would be handed by Congressional trepidation. 
   If the indicted war criminal Milosevic knew that the U.S. Congress was serious about abandoning Kosovo, his temptation to make mischief there would be dramatically increased. 
   If percentage point differences in contributions made at conference tables would be enough to force the U.S. military out of Kosovo, then imagine what would be the effect of a few U.S. soldiers wounded or killed by Serbian commandos! 
   Moreover, consideration of this amendment comes at a time of increasing weakness of Milosevic. 
   Last night his goons occupied television station Studio B and independent radio station B2-92, and padlocked the doors of other independent media offices. 
   An opposition leader declared that Milosevic's government had ``imposed an informal state of emergency.'' 
   Is this the time that we want to give Milosevic even the slightest bit of comfort? 
   Does the U.S. military support Section 2410? No. Secretary of Defense Cohen has said so, directly to its authors. Those who might support the amendment in the alleged interest of staving off the ``hollowing out'' of our military readiness should ask of the Department of Defense: is Section 2410 a good idea for the U.S. military overall? 
   The answer is an unambiguous ``no!'' It would harm--not help--the readiness of our armed forces for the rest of this fiscal year. If the President were unable to certify the meeting of the benchmarks, most of the supplemental funding for the Department of Defense would be unavailable. That would, therefore, mean that the Military Services' accounts for maintenance and operation would not be replenished, since they are currently being used to cover essential costs in Kosovo. 
   More broadly, the simple fact is that establishing security in the Balkans is squarely in the national interest of the United States. This country has a web of economic, political, security, cultural, and human ties to Europe that is unmatched with any other part of the world. Thanks to the patient, sustained, bipartisan policy of stationing millions of American troops in Western Europe for more than a half-century and through our nuclear guarantee, the western half of the continent was able to democratize, heal old wounds, and eventually prosper. 
   But, Mr. President, the stability of Western Europe would be severely threatened if war were to re-erupt in the Balkans--as it surely would if Western forces would withdraw. A study by the General Accounting Office released yesterday made that clear. 
   Last year we got a taste of the massive refugee flows that war would unleash. And some of those refugees would wind up in Western Europe--in fact, many already have. 
   Mr. President, the United States is the unquestioned leader of NATO, and I believe it must remain the unquestioned leader. I do not think that a leader can lead from the sidelines. To restrict our future participation in KFOR, or SFOR, to providing logistical and intelligence support would indicate to our allies that we were beginning a more general withdrawal from the continent. The symbolism would be unmistakable. 
   Incidentally, who would try to fill the vacuum left by the departure of American troops from Kosovo? 
   I urge my colleagues to recall that the Russians desperately wanted their own sector of Kosovo last summer. My guess is that they would have their hand up in an instant to volunteer to replace us. 
   I do not want this legislation to be the first step in reversing the most successful element in American foreign policy in the last fifty-five years. 
   Mr. President, Section 2410 is an idea whose time not only has not yet come--it is an idea whose time, I fervently hope, will never come. 
   We won the war last year, and now our allies are carrying the lion's share of the burden of winning the peace. We are on the right track. To rashly withdraw would invite further aggression by the Serbian dictator and gravely undermine the North Atlantic Alliance, the lynchpin of our trans-Atlantic ties. 
   Instead of pursuing this self-destructive course, I urge my colleagues to consider the approach taken by my friend from Ohio, Senator VOINOVICH. His resolution, S.Res. 272, which advocates a coherent strategy for furthering American interests in the Balkans, was passed overwhelmingly by the Foreign Relations Committee last month. It was passed by the full Senate just two weeks ago, on May second. 
   The Voinovich resolution advocates continued involvement in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans, not the precipitous disengagement called for in  Section 2410. It expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should remain actively engaged in southeastern Europe, continue to oppose Slobodan Milosevic, support the democratic opposition in Serbia, and fully implement the Stability Pact. 
   This is the course the United States is currently taking, and this is the course we should pursue with renewed vigor in the future. 
   It will not be an easy struggle; nothing worth accomplishing ever is. 
   We will not achieve lasting stability in the Balkans overnight--certainly we cannot expect to have achieved it less than a year after the end of the air war. 
   But rashly to conclude that we should no longer be part of the solution would be totally out of character for the United States of America. 
   We are the leader of NATO. We are the indispensable factor in the European security architecture. 
   We dare not sacrifice this position out of momentary frustration and impatience. 
   So, let's get this straight. 
   If you believe that stability in the Balkans is not important to the U.S. and our own naked national interest, then vote with my good friends Senators BYRD and WARNER. 
   But, if you think, as I do, that it is virtually impossible to have chaos in the Balkans, affecting, if not engulfing, the likes of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, even Greece and Turkey, while simultaneously maintaining stability in the rest of Europe, and at the same time developing a mature relationship with the countries of the former Soviet Union--then, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, who said ``If you expect to be both ignorant and free, you are expecting what never was and never will be,'' I say that if you are expecting chaos in the Balkans and stability in the rest of Europe, you are expecting what never was and never will be. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise with great sadness. On Monday, May 15, 2000, Harry L. Gardner, Sr.--a quiet giant in the long history of Delaware civil rights--died. He was a man whose very presence, literally, brought calm to the most difficult, seemingly intractable problems of race at the height of the civil rights movement in Delaware. 
   When citizens first heard that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King had been assassinated in April of 1968, what was once a cauldron of mounting tension between disillusioned African-Americans and Whites exploded into a series of violent and destructive acts--on both sides--reflective of unrest, resentment, and downright anger. 
   As you may know, of the many inner-cities ravaged by full-scale rioting and violence during this time period, Wilmington, Delaware--my hometown--was the only urban area where the National Guard occupied the city for an extended period of time. Indeed, for nine months, police officers and guardsmen patrolled the streets of Wilmington in an effort to bring order to what was seen by many in the mainstream as chaos. 
   As a young attorney, continually advocating for equity and social justice for African-Americans and other minorities, I saw things quite differently than many of my mainstream counterparts. 
   There were reasons for my own view: my Mom and Dad, who taught many lessons about the importance of equality, liberty and justice for all citizens; the people of East Side and East Lake, predominantly African-American communities where I spent a few summers life-guarding for neighborhood children; and African-American leaders like Harry L. Gardner, who taught me to believe that if I could not change the world and the view of race relations, there was no reason that I could not set a standard by which I lived my own life and became an example for others. 
   This was, in fact, the beauty of Harry Gardner. For 35 years, I had the pleasure of knowing a man whose deep respect for people engendered a deep respect for him. During the period of National Guard occupation, Harry was one of a very select group of people who were allowed to talk to rioters during racial disturbances. He was depended upon by city officials and neighborhood residents both to help in diffusing threatening situations and to continue to articulate the very legitimate concerns of African-American people. Though quite a difficult tightrope to walk, Harry made it look easy. In no small part, it was his ability to touch the heart of diverse groups of people and find common ground that, in effect, saved the city. 
   This, however, is just a portion Harry Gardner's legacy. While a career officer at the Ferris School, a juvenile correctional facility for adolescent boys, Harry founded Northeast Civic Alliance, chaired the Wilmington Police & Community Advisory Council and the Wilmington Fire & Community Council and helped start and maintain a group home for troubled youth. Yet, having said all of this, Harry received few accolades for his many faithful years of service. He was self-effacing, and traded in recognition and reward for diligent, undaunted self sacrifice for the voiceless in our community. 
   We may all know a Harry Gardner in our respective communities. A man who changed the way we think through living a reality of public service that surpassed rhetoric and funadmentally changed the way people from all different backgrounds see themselves and interact with each other. 
   Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, the famed sociologist and civil rights scholar, once said, ``peace will be my applause.'' Harry, today, we in the Senate--and so many others back home-- are all clapping loudly for your life and for its resounding impact in Wilmington and throughout the State of Delaware. Your presence will be missed, but your lessons will remain in our hearts forever.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I attended the Million Mom March with my wife. I do not think anyone should misunderstand the significance and consequence of so many mothers and a number of fathers giving up Mother's Day to make an important point. These were not a bunch of wild radicals. These were a bunch of moms from rural areas, inner cities, and suburban areas. They were black, they were white, Hispanic, Asian American. They were basically making a plea. As I stood there and listened, I was reminded of a quote attributed to John Locke speaking about someone he heard. He said:  
   He spoke words that wept and shed tears that spoke.  
   I do not know how anyone could have attended any significant portion of that march and not felt, as John Locke felt, listening to the words these women spoke that wept and the tears they shed that spoke volumes about the insanity of our policy. 
   Irony of all ironies; the next day, on Monday, the Supreme Court hands down a decision, not about guns but about the protection and empowerment of women in society. Yesterday, in United States v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of an act that I spent 8 years writing and attempting to pass--six of which were in earnest--the so-called Violence Against Women Act. There is one provision of that act they struck down and only one provision. That is the provision that empowered women to take up their cause in Federal court to make the case they were a victim of sexual abuse because, and only because, of their gender and to sue their attacker for civil damages in Federal court; empowering women to not have to rely on the prosecutorial system or anyone else to vindicate the wrong that had been done to them if they can supply the proof. 
   As the author of that act, I must tell my colleagues that I was disappointed by the Court's decision but, quite frankly, not surprised by it. 
   I emphasize, though, the Morrison case struck down the civil rights cause of action women have in Federal court, no other part of the act. Nothing in the Court's decision yesterday affects the validity of any other provision, any other program, or the need to reauthorize these programs through my bill, the Violence Against Women Act II, which now has 47 cosponsors. 
   Unfortunately, I believe the Court's ruling yesterday will have a significant impact on Congress' ability to respond to public needs in a way that has not been constrained since the 1930s. The Court has been inching toward this decision and this line of reasoning in case after case over the last several years. The Court has grown bolder and bolder in stripping the Federal Government of the ability to make decisions on behalf of the American people, part of the objectives of the Honorable Chief Justice, who believes in the notion of devolution of power and thinks that the Federal Government should have significantly less power. 
   The Court's decision--and these have all been basically 5-4 decisions--in United States v. Lopez in 1995 struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a decision upon which the Court heavily relied in the Morrison case in striking down the civil rights remedy. 
   In the case of Boerne v. Flores, a 1997 case, the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Again, this is not mostly about what act they like and do not like; it is 
   about Congress' power. Those who thought we should not be dealing with guns were happy with the Lopez case substantively. Those who thought we should have more religious freedom in public places, our conservative friends--and I happen to agree with them on that point--were disappointed when the Supreme Court reached in and said as to section 5 of the 14th amendment, which is the provision which says the Congress shall determine how to enforce the 14th amendment, no, no, no, Congress is not the one; we--the Court--are going to decide. 
   There, then, was another decision, the Supreme Court's watershed decision in the Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, a 1996 decision, and the cases that followed, in which the Court limited Congress' ability to authorize private citizens to vindicate Federal rights in lawsuits against their States, and that included the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Age Discrimination Act. 
   Putting it in simple terms, if the State of Florida discriminated against somebody in State employment because of age in violation of the Federal act, the Court said: Sorry, Florida has immunity. A Federal Government cannot protect all Americans against age discrimination because of a new and novel reading of the 11th amendment. 
   The Court's decision today is at peace with those rulings. Fundamentally, this decision is about power. Who has the power, the Court or the Congress, to determine whether or not a local activity, such as gender-motivated violence, has a substantial impact on interstate commerce? Yesterday the Court said it: The Court has this power--echoes of 1920 and 1925 and 1928 and 1930, the so-called Lockner era. 
   I find it particularly striking the Court acknowledged in Morrison that in contrast to the lack of congressional findings supporting the law struck down in Lopez, the civil rights remedy is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact of gender-motivated violence on interstate commerce. I conducted 4 years of hearings to make that record. 
   We showed overwhelmingly that the loss of dollars to the economy of women being battered and abused and losing work is billions of dollars. We showed overwhelmingly that women make decisions about whether to engage in a business that requires them to cross State lines based in significant part upon the degree to which they think they can be safe, based upon a survey of 50 State laws, and whether or not they adequately protect women as they do men against violence. 
   The record is overwhelming. Nonetheless, instead of applying the rule they had traditionally applied in determining whether Congress has the right to be involved in what is a local matter, they came up with a new standard. 
   Instead of applying the old standard of: Is there a rational basis for Congress to find, as they did, the traditional ``rational basis review'' to decide whether Congress' findings in this case were rational--and I cannot conceive of how they concluded they could not be--the Court simply disagreed with the  findings, marking the first occasion in more than 60 years that the Court has rejected explicit factual findings by the Congress, supported by a voluminous record. They, in fact, explicitly rejected the findings that a given activity substantially affects interstate commerce. 
   The Court justified the abandonment of the deference to Congress by declaring that whether particular activities sufficiently affect interstate commerce ``is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.'' 
   I could not disagree more fundamentally with the Court's ruling. Quite frankly, this will affect the Violence Against Women Act less than it is going to affect a whole lot of other things. The Supreme Court precedents have long recognized that Congress has the power to legislate with regard to local activities that, in the aggregate, have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. 
   I personally believe Justice Souter, who wrote the principal dissent in this case, had it right when he explained that:  
   [t]he fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours.  
   I am left wondering, where does the Court's decision leave Congress' formerly plenary power to remove serious obstructions to interstate commerce, whatever their source? 
   It is reminiscent of the Lockner era when they said, by the way, you have those labor standards having to do with mining--mining is not interstate commerce. Then they came along and said production is not interstate commerce. Then they said manufacturing is not interstate commerce. Until midway in the New Deal, with the end of the Lockner era, they said: Woe, woe, woe; wait a minute, wait a minute. 
   Unfortunately, this decision yesterday reads more as a decision written in 1930 than in the year 2000. 
   As Justice Souter documented so well in his dissent, the Court appears to be returning to a type of categorical analysis of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause that characterized the pre-New Deal era, where, as I said, manufacturing, mining, and production were all held to be off limits despite their obvious impact on interstate commerce. Now it is a new standard: ``Economic activity'' versus ``noneconomic activity.'' 
   If Congress can regulate activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce, then I, as Justices Souter and Breyer, do not understand what difference it makes whether the causes of those substantial effects on interstate commerce are in and of themselves commercial. 
   In any event, suffice it to say that this type of formalistic, enclave analysis--where certain spheres of activity are held off limits to Congress--did not work in the 1930s and will work no better in the 21st century. 
   Because it is impossible to develop judicially defined subject matter categories spelling out in advance what is in Congress' Commerce Clause power and what is out, I believe the dissenting Justices are correct that Congress, not the courts, must remain primarily responsible for striking the right Federal-State balance, and that the Members of Congress are institutionally motivated to strike that balance by virtue of the fact that we represent our States and local interests as well as the Federal interest. 
   So why has the Court revived the form of analysis that so ill-served the Nation in the years leading up to the judicial crisis of 1937? Again, I find Justice Souter's explanation convincing: In both eras, the Court adopted these formalistic distinctions in interpreting the Commerce Clause in service of broader political theories shared by a majority of the Court's members. 
   In the pre-New Deal era, that broader political theory was laissez faire economics; now it is the new federalism. In both instances, the Court has been eager to substitute its own judgment for that of the political branches democratically elected by the people to do their business. 
   Those of you who are conservatives in this Congress, who say that you, in fact, want the democratically elected bodies making these decisions, I suggest to you that this is one of the most activist Courts we have had in 50 years. It is supplanting its judgment for the democratically elected branches of the Government. 
   So have at it, conservatives. This judicially active Court is supplanting their judgment for the democratically elected bodies. 
   Justice Stevens put it bluntly in his recent dissent in the recent age discrimination case. He said: The Court's federalism decisions constitute a ``judicial activism''--that is his quote, not mine--that is ``such a radical departure from the proper role of this Court that it should be opposed whenever an opportunity arises.'' 
   This is one Senator who plans to keep up that opposition. 
   Stay tuned, folks, because what this upcoming election is about is the future--the future--of the power of the elected branches of the Government versus the Court which is appointed for life. This is a conservative agenda that is being forced upon the democratically elected bodies, as it was in the 1920s. The next President is going to get to pick somewhere between one and three new Justices.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I will vote for passage of the Trade and Development Act of 2000. 
   No one can look upon the scenes of human suffering in Africa today without recognizing the need for action. Whether it is the AIDS epidemic or the violence in Sierra Leone, the floods in Mozambique or the unacceptably slow progress toward democratization, Africa challenges the conscience--and threatens the health and security--of the rest of the world. 
   We must respond. 
   The bill before us today offers an initial response to the many interconnected problems on the African continent. I agree with the basic premise of the bill, that promoting sustainable economic growth, led by more open access to American markets, must be a key element in any strategy for Africa. 
   And I must add here, Mr. President, that it is time for us to provide similar market openings to the nations of the Caribbean, who have faced a real disadvantage since the passage of NAFTA. 
   But I will focus my brief remarks today on Africa, because when the legislation before us today was initially proposed, it offered us the opportunity to formulate a comprehensive policy for Africa. At the end of the day, I am afraid that what remains is only a first step. 
   Mr. President, compared to the crushing problems facing the peoples of Africa, this bill is really very modest in terms of what it offers African countries in terms of duty free exports to the United States. 
   While opening our markets must be part of any program of economic assistance for Africa, we should not mistake this bill for a complete policy. 
   It may be that this bill has more symbolic value, as evidence of renewed interest in Africa, than any material impact on the many difficult and interconnected problems facing economic development there. Certainly, we should not let this bill become an excuse for self-congratulation or complacency. 
   Some provisions, however, I hope will enable the United States government to enhance its trade and investment relationship with countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The conference report directs the Administration to convene an annual trade and economic forum with the trade ministers of African countries. The key here is that in order to expand trade and investment, there must be a climate within African countries which create investor confidence. 
   I believe that open, face to face dialogue with African Trade Ministers is vital if the United States is going to get its message across about issues such as the importance of transparency, and the guarantee of timely remedy to disputes through a judicial process that is open and fair. 
   In addition, the report increases the number of foreign commercial service officers. Currently, we have fewer than 10 such officers for the more than forty countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly this is inadequate. These officers are  responsible for identifying opportunities for small to medium U.S. businesses to export their goods and services to African countries, as well as providing information on economic conditions 
   and investment climate factors which enable them to make better decisions on where and when to invest. 
   One of the most glaring weaknesses of this legislation, Mr. President, is that it does not adequately address the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa, so eloquently described by Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator FEINGOLD yesterday in their moving statements. 
   Some of my colleagues do not believe that a trade bill should attempt to speak to the issue of HIV/AIDS. I believe that we are talking about a disease that is so virulent, so deadly and so pernicious that any plan for economic development in Africa will inevitably fail if this epidemic is not contained. 
   If only because of the very real threat that this epidemic carries for our own health and security, Congress must take any and all opportunity we have to provide help to this region in fighting this dreaded disease. 
   That is why, Mr. President, I was extremely disappointed that the Feinstein-Feingold amendment to the Senate bill was dropped without any provision put in its place which would offer effective assistance to Africans as they fight this deadly disease. 
   In March, the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously passed an authorization bill which provided $300 million dollars for a program--based on work by Senators FRIST and KERRY--of vaccines to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
   Although the conference on the bill before us today was conducted under the jurisdiction of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees, it declined to take action on the tax credits for vaccine research, production, and distribution that would have complemented those steps we took in the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   That was another opportunity lost, Mr. President, and another reason why the celebration over passage of this bill should be muted, at best. 
   I see some hope in today's Wall Street Journal, which reports that several major drug companies have announced plans to cut the cost of AIDS drugs in the developing world. I hope we will see some real results following from this announcement. Voluntary action of this sort can and should be part of any comprehensive plan to address this crisis of historic proportions. 
   This conference report also states that it is the sense of the Congress that the nations of Sub-Saharan Africa should receive substantial debt relief. 
   I must point out that the Foreign Relations Committee has passed authorizations for the use of the proceeds of gold revaluations at the IMF as well as the U.S. share of the trust fund that will be set up for the new, enhanced debt relief program for the poorest nations of the world. The nations of Sub-Saharan Africa will be among the chief beneficiaries of that program. 
   I am glad to see that, with passage of this legislation, that Congress stands behind this debt relief program. I hope that the Appropriations Committee will soon provide the funds for us to put some money behind those sentiments, and that the Banking Committee will quickly conclude its work on the remaining authorization needed to put the debt relief program into motion. 
   In the end, while I understand and sympathize with some of the complaints raised by those who will vote against the bill, I prefer to see this glass as half full. But this is still a pretty small glass, Mr. President.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator DASCHLE and 31 of my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Expansion for Needed Drugs Act. This important legislation would expand the Medicare program to provide outpatient prescription drug coverage for seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries. 
   This bill is long overdue, one might say 35 years overdue. When Medicare was first crafted in the mid 1960's, life-saving medicine tended to be focused on surgical procedures: appendectomy, mastectomy, and so forth. Medications were being increasingly used to treat serious medical conditions, such as antibiotics to treat infections. However, for most illnesses, the medicine cabinet contained few options. 
   The advances that have been made in the past 4 decades in the use of pharmaceuticals are nothing short of phenomenal. Diseases that were incurable by any means are now cured by drugs alone. For example, in 1965, childhood leukemia was inevitably fatal. Now, thanks to new medicines, it is almost always curable. 
   In addition, in many instances new medications have enabled us to avoid the need for surgical treatment altogether. In 1965, intractable pain from stomach ulcers was a common indication for surgery. In 2000, we have highly effective medications to cut down on stomach acid, which have virtually eliminated the need for that kind of surgery. Not only that, but since we have discovered that most stomach ulcers are really due to a bacterium, we can cure the condition entirely with antibiotics. 
   However, all too often, the elderly and disabled cannot take advantage of these major advances in drug treatment because the Medicare program does not pay for outpatient prescription drugs. How ridiculous is that?: that the group in our society that is the sickest, that could benefit most from these medications, is the one group that is denied access to them. 
   You would be hard pressed to name another health program in this country that doesn't pay for outpatient prescription drugs. Virtually all private health plans do. Even looking at the Federal government: Medicaid, Tricare, the VA, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, they all pay for prescription drugs. Only Medicare, the medical program for the elderly and disabled, is singled out for special limitations. 
   What is the consequence of this Medicare limitation? Just two weeks ago, the New York Times had a cover story on the plight of Albert Russell, a retiree who lives on an $832 Social Security check. Mr. Russell is nearly blind from glaucoma, a condition in which the pressure inside the eye is too high. When the new drug Xalatan was released in 1996, Mr. Russell's eye doctor tried it and found that it was just what Mr. Russell needed; it reduced the pressure in his eyes better than the alternatives. The problem was the cost of the drug: $1 per day. After several years on the medicine, Mr. Russell could no longer afford the cost, so he had to stop taking the medicine. Of course, Medicare would not pay for such an outpatient prescription drug. In an attempt to save Mr. Russell's vision, his eye doctor recommended an alternative: an expensive eye surgery. For Mr. Russell, the surgery would not be as effective as the medication, but there was one big factor in its favor: Medicare would have no reluctance about paying for the surgery. So, as compared to surgery, the medication would be better and easier for Mr. Russell, and probably cheaper in the long run for the taxpayer, but under the current Medicare situation, this common sense solution is out-of-bounds. This situation must be changed. 
   So what's in this bill for consumers? The bill makes prescription drug coverage voluntary and available to all Medicare beneficiaries. There is no deductible required, and there is an out-of-pocket cap that puts an absolute maximum limit on how much one person will have to pay for drugs in any given year. Participants pay a monthly premium, and the government splits the cost of drugs 50/50 with the beneficiary (up to a gradually increasing limit). There is absolutely no question that this bill is an important improvement for the health of our seniors. 
   I think it is important to keep in mind what this bill is not. First, it is not perfect. The coverage for prescription drugs is not in parity with coverage for alternative medical treatments, such as surgery. This difference reflects cost constraints, but I am optimistic that this aspect can be addressed in future legislation. 
   Second, this bill is not for everyone. Individuals who have better coverage of prescription drugs than is afforded in this bill, perhaps through an employer-sponsored retiree health plan, can keep that coverage. In fact, employers will be offered subsidies to encourage them to maintain prescription drug coverage for their retirees. 
   Third, this bill is not a prelude to price controls on drugs. The legislation makes no mention of or need for price controls, and it is not our intention to propose or implement price controls. This bill deals primarily with access to pharmaceuticals, not their cost. The high cost of medications is a concern to many of us in this country, but that is a very complex problem that is not, and should not be, addressed in this bill. 
   Finally, this bill is not the comprehensive overhaul of the Medicare program that we all agree is needed. The 1965 program needs to be brought up to new millennium standards to make it easier for the program to keep up with rapid future advances in medical technology. The benefit package (including enhanced preventive measures), the financing of graduate medical education, the provider payment mechanisms; these are all items that must be addressed. But not in this bill. Seniors need help now with prescription drugs, and they cannot wait the months or years that it will take to complete the needed comprehensive revision of Medicare.  
   Mr. President, I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to enact this legislation and to make sure that our Medicare beneficiaries aren't relegated to a second class health care system.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I have the honor of submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Department of Education develop and disseminate educational materials and programs designed to make students in elementary and secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their importance in preserving American peace and prosperity. The resolution also designates the week that includes Veterans Day as ``National Veterans Awareness Week'' to serve as a focus for these educational activities. 
   Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action has become necessary because we are victims  of our own success with regard to the superior performance of our Armed Forces. The plain fact is that there are just fewer people around now who have had any connection with military service. For example, as a result of tremendous advances in military technology and the resultant productivity increases, our current Armed Forces now operate effectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than just 10 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer career-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in today's military than in previous eras when conscription was a place. Finally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, such as World War II, when our military was many times larger than today, is inevitably declining. 
   The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire population that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a change that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during World War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that did not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous families that include no military veterans at all. As a consequence of this lack of opportunity for contacts with veterans, many of our young people have little or no connection with or knowledge about the important historical and ongoing role of men and women who have served in the military. This omission seems to have persisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations. 
   This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in our society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, civilian control of the Armed Forces is the key tenet of military governance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and limitations of the Armed Forces, and to its critical role throughout our history, can make decisions that have unexpected and unwanted consequences. Even more important, general recognition of the importance of those individual character traits that are essential for military success, such as patriotism, selflessness, sacrifice, and heroism, is vital to maintaining these key aspects of citizenship in the Armed Forces and even throughout the population at large. 
   Among today's young people, a generation that has grown up largely during times of peace and extraordinary prosperity and has embraced a ``me first'' attitude, it is perhaps even more important to make sure that there is solid understanding of what it has taken to attain this level of comfort and freedom. The failure of our children to understand why a military is important, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate survival, and why a successful military requires integrity and sacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters become of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility that is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it has been in the past, knowledge of the contribution of those who have served in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the extent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our country in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our responsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both tangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on our behalf. 
   The importance of this issue was recently brought home to me by Samuel I. Cashdollar, a 13-year-old seventh grader at Lewes Middle School in Lewes, Delaware, who recently won the Delaware VFW's Youth Essay Contest with a powerful presentation titled ``How Should We Honor America's Veterans?'' Samuel's essay points out that we have Nurses' Week, Secretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly emphasize the importance of these occupations, but the contributions of those in uniform tend to be overlooked and many businesses remain open on Veterans Day. In a time when, for some, Veterans Day has simply become an excuse for another department store sale, we need to make sure that we don't become a nation where more high school seniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name Dwight Eisenhower. 
   Now, it is appropriate to ask, ``We already have Veterans Day, why do we need National Veterans Awareness Week?'' Historically Veterans Day was established to honor those who served in uniform during wartime. Although we now customarily honor all veterans on Veterans Day, I see it as a holiday that is focused on honoring individuals, the courageous and selfless men and women without whose actions our country would not exist as it does. National Veterans Awareness Week would complement Veterans Day by focusing on education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many in addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National Veterans Awareness Week would also present an opportunity to remind ourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served in peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours and spend long periods away from their families under conditions of great discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and plenty.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment being offered by the Senator from Washington. A recent study by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee confirms what common sense should have been telling us all along--our children learn better when they are taught in smaller classes. 
   With enrollment at the nation's schools continuing to increase, and many of those currently in the teaching profession nearing retirement age, the fact of the matter is simple--we need more teachers. Under Senator MURRAY's leadership, we in the Senate began the class size reduction initiative a little over two years ago with the goal of hiring 100,000 teachers over a seven-year period and reducing class sizes in the early grades to a nationwide average of 18 students. Yet here we are today, faced with a bill which abandons this goal. 
   In 1998, my home state of Delaware recognized the need for more teachers and smaller class sizes. In July of that year, our governor, Tom Carper, signed legislation requiring all school districts in the state of Delaware to cap class sizes in kindergarten through third grades at no more than 22 students. That same legislation included a provision which increased state funding to help pay for one teacher for every 18 students. And with the help of the federal funding provided under the class size reduction initiative, Delaware was able to hire over 100 new teachers in 1999. 
   These teachers are in the classroom today. That means roughly 1,800 children are likely to get far more out of the hours they spend in school, and that they will move into the higher grades far better prepared. For these children in Delaware, and all the other children who are in smaller classrooms because of this initiative, this is literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get started on the right path. Yet this bill, without the Murray amendment, makes no promise of small classrooms. 
   We can fund all the education programs we want, but without enough quality teachers in every classroom to teach our children the basic skills necessary to succeed, these programs means nothing. We need to continue to promote smaller classrooms in grade school by continuing to help schools hire up to 100,000 additional qualified teachers to reduce class sizes. 
   The more individual contact our children have with their teachers, the more they are able to learn, and the better they perform on tests. Those are the facts. At a time when we are just beginning to make progress, now is not the time to abandon our children's future.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, next week the Appropriations Committee is expected to mark up several bills that will incorporate the Administration's supplemental request for this fiscal year. Included in this request is two point six billion dollars for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Kosovo and the surrounding region. 
   In that context, I rise to examine the rapidly changing conditions in the Balkans and to argue for continued vigorous American involvement in the region, including meeting the Administration's supplemental request. 
   Mr. President, since the end of the Cold War few, if any other parts of the world have commanded as much of our attention as the Balkans, particularly the area of the former Yugoslavia. This is no accident. The Balkans were the crucible for the First World War, played a pivotal role in the outcome of the Second World War, and persist as the only remaining major area of instability in Europe. 
   As every thoughtful political leader in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Madrid or other capitals will attest, if the movements in the countries of the Balkans toward political democracy, ethnic and religious coexistence, and free market capitalism do not succeed, the resulting turmoil will endanger the remarkable peace and prosperity laboriously created over the past half-century in the countries of the European Union and in other Western democracies. 
   Moreover, Mr. President, for Americans warning of this possibility is not merely an academic exercise. In political, security, and economic terms, the United States is a European power. We are tied to the continent through a web of trade, investment, human contacts, and culture to a degree unequaled by relations with any other part of the world. Instability that spread to Western Europe would directly and adversely affect the United States of America in a major way. 
   In other words, Mr. President, we do not have the luxury of being able to distance ourselves from the Balkans, no matter how emotionally appealing such a policy may appear at times. 
   As someone who visits Southeastern Europe on a regular basis, I fully understand how frustrating dealing with Balkan issues can be. Much of this stunningly beautiful area, with its jumble of ancient peoples, has seemingly intractable problems. Americans accustomed to quick solutions naturally become frustrated, especially since we have built up a large presence on the ground in several Balkan countries in the last few years and, therefore, know first-hand the complexities involved. 
   But the very diversity of the Balkans means that even if human history moved in a linear fashion--which it certainly does not--progress toward democracy, human rights, and free markets in Southeastern Europe would necessarily be uneven, moving forward in some countries, stagnating in some, and even regressing in a few. 
   Mr. President, this is precisely what has been happening; the region is experiencing ``ups and downs.'' Contrary to popular belief, undoubtedly influenced by the proclivity of the mass media to emphasize the negative, there have been several positive developments in the Balkans. 
   Slovenia, the northernmost country of the Balkans, is the region's success story. It has already established a solid democracy, and its transition to a free-market economy has been so successful that its per capita gross domestic product now exceeds that of a few members of the European Union. Slovenia seems certain to be in the next round of NATO enlargement, and it is one of the strongest candidates for EU membership. 
   Croatia, which suffered for a decade under the authoritarian rule of Franjo Tudjman, elected a new parliament this past January with a moderate, democratic coalition gaining a solid majority. The winner of the February presidential election, Mr. Mesic, is also a democratic reformer. 
   Already there has been signs of positive movement from the new regime in Zagreb, both domestically and in foreign policy. For example, the government has begun investigating corruption from the Tudjman era in the banking and communications sectors. In the international realm, the Croatian government has signed an agreement on cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. Moreover, the new government has closed down illegal television transmission towers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had spread ultra-nationalist programming from Croatia. 
   In fact, the hard-line obstructionist nationalist Croat leadership in Bosnia and Herzegovina is running scared, knowing that it has lost its patron, the former HDZ regime, in Croatia. It appears that the new government in Zagreb has pledged itself to full Dayton implementation, including a commitment to the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state. 
   It is debatable whether the ``good example'' set by Zagreb will soon influence the situation in Serbia; but it is already clear that the change of government in Zagreb is causing Bosnian Croat leaders to re-think their strategy. 
   The local elections in Bosnia last month provided mixed results. In the Republika Srpska, Prime Minister Dodik's coalition lost ground, but there is still hope that the new government being formed will accelerate the pace of implementation of the Dayton Accords. 
   In the Federation, reformist Bosnian Croats did not have sufficient time to organize strong opposition to the entrenched HDZ nationalists. As the withdrawal of subsidies from Zagreb to the Bosnian Croat HDZ takes effect, however, the moderate Bosnian Croats may be able to increase their strength in the upcoming national elections. 
   The most heartening developments concern the Bosnian Muslims, the largest of the three major communities in the country. The Muslims have demonstrated an accelerating move away from the nationalist SDA party to non-nationalist alternatives, as demonstrated by their electoral victories in several of Bosnia's largest cities. 
   Mr. President, the southern Balkans also show several positive trends, some of them quite remarkable. At the Helsinki Summit of the European Union in December 1999, Turkey for the first time was granted the status of candidate for membership. To be sure, any realistic analysis of Turkey's chances would make them long-term, but the development in Helsinki is nonetheless a real breakthrough and is being received as such by the majority of Turkey's population. 
   Moreover, the devastating earthquakes that rocked both Turkey and Greece last summer elicited mutual expressions of popular sympathy from both peoples and have led to a significant warming of relations between these two long-time rivals. 
   Both Bulgaria and Romania are governed by Western-looking, democratic free-marketeers. The closing of the Danube by the NATO bombing in the air war last year has had an extremely damaging effect on their already shaky economies. Both countries, though, have embarked upon painful, but necessary reforms. The reformers will be sorely tested in upcoming national elections. 
   Macedonia, perhaps the most fragile country in the region, has survived the trauma of the Kosovo war, with its massive influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees, without the violent destabilization expected by many observers, and certainly intended by Milosevic. A newly elected conservative government includes an ethnic Albanian party, but the raw material for an ethnic conflagration persists. 
   The ``downs'' in the Balkan picture, which have been getting the lion's share of the publicity, are Serbia proper, Montenegro, and Kosovo. 
   Certainly the principal negative fact of life in the region is the continuing presence in power in Serbia of Slobodan Milosevic. My colleagues know well my feelings about this man. In 1993, six years before the Hague Tribunal made public its indictment, I called Milosevic a war criminal to his face at a meeting in his office in Belgrade. 
   Milosevic, quite simply, has been a disaster for the Serbian people. He has destroyed Serbia's economy, eviscerated its body politic, and debased its reputation internationally. It is not easy to start--and lose--four wars in eight years, but Milosevic has managed to do it. He is a man of only one ideological conviction: that he must hold  onto power in Serbia. To retain power he is ready to use any means, including ruining the lives of the people he theoretically represents. 
   Unfortunately, Milosevic clings to power through a combination of ruthlessness, tactical cunning, and the inability until now of the Serbian opposition to forge a permanent anti-Milosevic coalition that could be compelling for the Serbian electorate. There is some basis for cautious optimism that the political opposition in Serbia may be unifying in its opposition to Milosevic. Last month the opposition was able to bring out to the streets of Belgrade a massive crowd of more than two hundred thousand demonstrators against Milosevic. 
   The gangland quality of life in contemporary Serbia is demonstrated by the recent public machine-gun slayings of ``Arkan,'' the Yugoslav defense minister, and other ultra-nationalist figures. Most recently independent journalists in Serbia have been given implicit death threats--from no less a personage than Mr. Seselj, the deputy prime minister! These moves, however, bespeak the increasing weakness and fear of the Milosevic regime, not any strength. 
   I should add that another reason that Milosevic has been able to survive this cold winter is assistance from like-minded dictators. Over the past few months, China made a gift of three hundred million dollars, and Iraq contributed much needed oil. It is also extremely likely that Russia and Belarus have funneled assistance to Milosevic. 
   The United States Government is actively supporting the creation of a civil society in Serbia through targeted grants to a variety of independent media, citizens' groups, independent trade unions, and towns controlled by the democratic opposition. 
   Despite Milosevic's malevolent and unscrupulous behavior, I remain convinced that ultimately the pressure from below--and from within his government, party, and armed forces--will result in his fall from power. What is key is that we not lose our patience or our nerve. I will not put a date on Milosevic's fall, but fall he will, and the long-suffering Serbian people will begin to regain their dignity. 
   Montenegro, the junior partner in the Yugoslav Federation, is governed by a multi-ethnic, democratic coalition led by President Milo Djukanovic. The reformist government of this little republic of less than seven hundred thousand citizens is struggling to avoid being overthrown by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is currently scheming about how to undermine Montenegro's democratically elected government. His tools are the Yugoslav army and shadowy paramilitary forces loyal to him, plus economic pressures applied to its vastly smaller neighbor. 
   We have seen Milosevic starring in this movie before--- in Slovenia, in Croatia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Kosovo. Milosevic lost each time, in the process sacrificing hundreds of thousands of lives and causing untold material damage. I can only hope that he has learned his lesson. 
   Kosovo is another ongoing challenge for American policy and fortitude. Eleven months after the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops, Serbian police, and paramilitaries, the province is still struggling to regain a semblance of normalcy. The task is enormous: by the estimate of the U.N., some eight hundred ten thousand residents who fled during last year's war have returned to a province in which approximately two-thirds of the housing stock was destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Not an appealing base on which to rebuild a traumatized society. 
   In that context, the herculean efforts of the international civilian and military authorities have had a good measure of success. Despite the understandable headlines detailing revenge killings of Serbs and Roma by ethnic Albanians, and of Kosovar Albanians by other Kosovar Albanians, the fact is that the incidence of homicide has dropped dramatically over the last several months. 
   The serious upsurge in ethnic violence in the town of Mitrovica earlier this year shows that universal security in the province has yet to be achieved. The response of KFOR to Mitrovica was to send in additional troops, from different sectors. Also a special prosecutor was appointed by the United Nations to handle Mitrovica. Things boiled over there; now the flame has been doused and the lid is back on. We will have to keep an eye on Mitrovica and northern Kosovo. 
   Similarly, the Presevo Valley in southeastern corner of Serbia proper, which has a strong ethnic Albanian majority population, is a potential flashpoint. Radical elements have been training in the demilitarized zone between Kosovo and Serbia proper, occasionally staging hit-and-run raids on Serbian police. Their motive is clearly to provoke a larger conflict, and then to appeal to KFOR to bail them out. We should not fall for this trap. I am pleased that the Administration has made clear to the radicals that they are on their own, and has enlisted the help of responsible Kosovar Albanians to rein them in. 
   With respect to security in Kosovo, however, the overall trend is in the right direction. The drop in the murder rate is due largely to the excellent work of the forty-two thousand, five hundred KFOR troops in Kosovo, and increasingly to the more than three thousand, one hundred international police deployed by the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo--known as UNMIK. Eventually four thousand, four hundred UNMIK police are to be deployed. 
   Our government must be sure to make its pledged payments to UNMIK on time and to pressure other donor countries to do the same. Cooperation between UNMIK's chief, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, and KFOR's commander has been superb. If Dr. Kouchner is given all the tools the way KFOR has been, then I believe he will be able to do his job successfully. 
   Incidentally, Mr. President, KFOR's commanders have been, in order, an Englishman, a German, and now a Spaniard--all under NATO's Supreme Commander in Europe, an American. 
   While profound mistrust of KFOR and UNMIK exists among much of the Serbian community in Kosovo, a hopeful sign is that observers from the Serb community recently joined the power-sharing system UNMIK has set up with a broad spectrum of Kosovar Albanian leaders. 
   Much of the Serbs' mistrust--and of widespread unease among the Kosovar Albanians--stems from the fact that although the homicide rate in the province has dropped, other forms of criminality are increasing. Particularly worrisome is the influx of organized crime elements from Albania across the porous, mountainous border into Kosovo. 
   We must not allow Kosovo to descend into gang-infested semi-anarchy. This is the principal reason that the promised international funding for UNMIK simply must be delivered promptly. I cannot stress this requirement enough. Our government must pressure the Europeans--who have assumed the primary responsibility for KFOR, UNMIK, and the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe--immediately to live up to their pledges. 
   Because of excellent work by the U.S. Agency for International Development and other national and international organizations, there are high expectations all over Kosovo that this spring and summer there will be reconstruction on a mass scale all over the province. We must be certain that the international funding is delivered in time, so as not to deflate the Kosovars' and the Kosovo Serbs' hopes and damage our credibility and that of our allies and other cooperating nations. 
   Mr. President, the more I delve into the details of the American and other international efforts to rebuild the Balkans--in Kosovo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Albania, and elsewhere--the more respect I have for our outstanding men and women serving in often difficult and dangerous circumstances in our diplomatic service, our armed forces, and our aid missions. They are bright, they are dedicated, and they are getting tangible results. This is a side of the story that the American public should hear more about. 
   It is also important that the American public understands that the overwhelming majority of KFOR troops, the overwhelming majority of UNMIK personnel, and the overwhelming majority of development assistance are all being provided by our European allies and other friendly governments. Mr. President, one bright spot of the Kosovo story is that it shows that  burdensharing not only can work, but is working. 
   In Kosovo, perhaps more than anywhere else in the Balkans, however, even as we analyze serious current problems, we must never lose sight of what the situation would be if we had not acted militarily last year. Milosevic would have gotten away with vile ethnic cleansing on a scale unprecedented in Europe for decades, causing untold human misery, destabilizing Macedonia and Albania, irreparably harming the credibility of NATO, and possibly even fracturing the alliance. 
   No, the situation in Kosovo is far from good, but it is incalculably better than it would have been, had NATO, under President Clinton's leadership, not intervened. 
   In early February, at the Munich Conference on Security Policy, the U.S. Congressional delegation had breakfast with Lord Robertson, the Secretary General of NATO. As he so aptly put it, ``no one should expect a Balkan Switzerland to be created in a few short years.'' But that should not blind us, either to the significant progress already achieved, or to the continuing importance to the United States and to the rest of Europe of the struggle for lasting security in the Balkans. 
   We must keep our eye on the prize and redouble our efforts to rebuild and stabilize Southeastern Europe. So, once again, I urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to fully fund, without conditions, the Administration's supplemental request for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Kosovo. The stakes are simply too high to do otherwise. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to congratulate 15 students and their teacher, Ms. Barbara Hudson, from Woodbridge High School in Bridgeville, DE, for their outstanding achievement in qualifying as finalists of the ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Consitiution'' program. 
   This program is administered by the Center for Civic Education which provides curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. These materials assist students in obtaining a working knowledge of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic government. 
   Next, ``We the People'' conducts a 3-day competition which tests a student's knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. A mock Congressional committee hearing is conducted in which the students testify and then respond to questions on Constitutional issues before a panel of judges. 
   This demanding competition takes hard work and diligence to reach the national finals, which are being held in Washington, D.C. from May 6 to May 8, 2000. I am pleased to congratulate those students from Woodbridge High School who will be participating in the final stage of this competition: Jennifer Blackwell, Steve Breeding, Jarelle Bruso, John Conner, Rachel Dawson, Shawnita Dorman, Chelsea Ferrell, Adam Hickman, Jerome Holder, Nick LaRusso, Kat Leiter, Jennifer Sheets, Latoya Thompson, Robert Tribbett, and Jessica Umstetter. Together with the help of their teacher, Ms. Hudson, they successfully learned and applied a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. Their knowledge will be tested yet again during the national finals, where they will compete with more than 1,200 students from throughout the United States. 
   It is exciting to see these young people from Delaware and so many other students from across the Nation expressing interest in our country's Government. Programs such as ``We the People'' help to inspire new generations of leaders. These students from Woodbridge High School are shining examples of the promise bright young people offer the future of this country. 
   It is my honor to recognize these students who represent excellence in Delaware scholastics, and I am sure that my fellow Delawareans join me in wishing these young ``Constitutional experts'' the best of luck during the upcoming competition.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont for his kind comments. It is rare on matters of constitutional law and matters of civil rights and civil liberties that the distinguished Senator from Vermont and I end up on opposite sides of the issue. We are on opposite sides of this issue. I, as the Senator from Vermont, have been very reluctant over my 28 years in the Senate to support constitutional amendments. I think they are a matter of significant concern and should not be undertaken without significant need and only after it is concluded that the same result could not be accomplished statutorily. So it is after some considerable thought--and, I might add, a considerable amount of work with the two primary sponsors of this amendment--that I have arrived at the point where I support this amendment. 
   Before I begin to discuss the details of the amendment, let me suggest to the Senator from Vermont that I came in at the tail end of his initial comments regarding public prosecution as opposed to privately going out and hiring a prosecutor to redress a criminal wrong that had been done to you, and his discussion about whether or not it was an established principle that the founders thought public prosecution was appropriate at the time of the Constitution. He is dead right on the facts. But I suggest to him, and others, that I suspect the points being made--and I have been in Colombia spending a good deal of time with President Pastrana on the drug and narcotrafficking problem he faces, so I missed a day of debate on this. So I may be mistaken in what I am about to say. But I expect that those who talked about public prosecution versus private prosecution were trying to make the generic point--I hope they were--that at one point in our English jurisprudential history, and for a number of centuries early on, the issue of moving forward to prosecute a wrong against you was totally in the hands of the victim. 
   The victim made that judgment. 
   Early on, to overstate it, in the 14th, the 15th, the 16th and 17th century, if I were mugged in the stable, it would be Biden v. Jones. It would not be the Crown v. Jones. I was not represented by anyone but myself. This process evolved. The only good part of that process was that the victim controlled his or her own fate to a significant degree. 
   All of the years and years that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking member, we held hearing after hearing about how victims feel disenfranchised. One of the things that victims of violent crime need to be able to come to closure with is the dilemma and the horrible position in which they were placed. They have to see it come to fruition. They have to be able to know that they had some hand in the idea that the person who did bad things to them was pursued, and they got their day in court--``they,'' the victim. 
   Also, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that began to pile up in the 1960s, 1970s, and then in the 1980s it reached a high pitch. In the 1990s it pertained as well. That is where people lost respect for the government and lost respect for the law because they believed they were not treated with respect--where victims found themselves, in their view, victimized not only by the criminal but victimized by the system. 
   That is why, I note parenthetically, when I wrote the Violence Against Women Act I provided for a means by which a woman who was a victim of violent crime could, if the prosecutor chose not to go after her assailant, after the person who did those bad things to her, she could at least go into the civil court and sue that individual. 
   Again, there was overwhelming testimony from psychiatrists and psychologists that there is a need for healing. Part of the catharsis in healing is to be able to go through the process and believe you are getting fair and decent treatment. 
   There are two things at stake when this cause of victims' rights begins to arise. 
   The public prosecutors, not because they were no longer caring, but because of the overwhelming burden, found themselves becoming increasingly callous about the plight of the victims. 
   I used to be a public defender. When I was a young lawyer, I would be assigned three or four or five cases to be tried in 1 day. The prosecutor would be assigned five, six, seven, or eight cases to be tried in 1 day. Everyone knew that plea bargaining process was necessary. 
   Often, looking back on it, the victim, or the alleged victim of the crime, found himself or herself showing up for court and learning from some prosecutor that they had dismissed the case. We didn't think there was sufficient evidence, or we decided to allow them to plead to petty larceny rather than robbery or burglar, or we decided so on and so on. 
   The impact upon victims and their faith in the system and their notion of whether or not government worked was always damning--always impacting upon them in a negative way. 
   To make a long story not quite so long, the Senator from Vermont is correct. Public prosecution did take place when our Republic became a republic. There were not, for example, in the city of Philadelphia, 25,000 felonies tried a year in one little city. There were not 68,000 habeas corpus out there. There was not the need for a prosecutor to find himself or herself in the position where they dismissed a large number of cases just 
   because they didn't have time to get to them. There were not circumstances where the victims of crime who were so callously treated that they weren't even informed, and the person against whom they had sworn out the warrant they found sitting in the trolley car with them on the way home. They were not in that position. 
   What are constitutional amendments about? 
   Constitutional amendments are about dealing with serious concerns of the public that come about as a consequence of changed circumstances. One of the circumstances changed--and I suspect what previous speakers have been speaking to when they talked about how the system used to work--is that there is a feeling on the part of the vast majority of the victims of crimes that they have no control over the situation. They have no control. Not only were they victimized by the criminal, but they go in and either find themselves in the circumstance where there has been a deal made which they were no part of, or there was a sentencing that took place and they didn't get a chance to tell the judge how badly this guy beat them up, or that money that was stolen from them was the last money they had in the whole world, and they lost their home. Just the need to cry out and say: Listen to me, listen to me. Just listen to me. That is all I am asking you to do. 
   It is not that the prosecutors are bad guys or bad women. They are incredibly overloaded. 
   As the Presiding Officer knows, we have an incredible amount of time, notwithstanding the fact it has dropped the last 7 years in a row. 
   This is about going back to a time when public prosecutors had the time and exercised judgment to make a decision relative to moving forward against a defendant in conjunction with the concerns of the needs of and the desires of the victims. 
   That is what is missing. 
   We are here today to discuss two matters that I have cared about for many years. The first is crime--more specifically, the victims of violent crime. The second is the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   As the Presiding Officer knows, we came at the same time, and both of us dedicated a significant portion of our life in the Senate to various issues. We developed different interests, expertise, and/or assignments. In my case, it has been both the plight of crime victims and the preservation of our constitutional liberties. 
   That is why I have thought long and hard about amending the Constitution to guarantee the victims of crime the elemental rights that they deserve, but too often are denied. 
   Time and again, I wrote and supported many statutory protections for victims. To cite just a few examples: 
   The 1990 Victims Bill of Rights gave victims a number of important procedural rights, including the right to notice of court proceedings, the right to confer with the prosecutor, and the  right to information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 
   The 1994 Biden crime law: 
   Gave federal victims of sexual and child abuse the right to mandatory restitution; 
   Gave victims of violent crimes and sexual abuse the right to be heard at the sentencing of their assailants; 
   Provided special court-appointed advocates for child victims of crime; 
   And it also included the piece of legislation closest to my heart: the Violence Against Women Act, which provided ground-breaking and sweeping assistance to victims of family violence and sexual assault--and which, I might add, needs to be re-authorized this year through my Violence Against Women Act II bill, which has 46 cosponsors. 
   The 1996 Anti-Terrorism Act included HATCH-BIDEN provisions guaranteeing mandatory restitution to all victims of violent federal crimes; 
   And, now, I am pleased to support--and urge all of you to support--a constitutional amendment to protect victims' rights. 
   I am proud of my track record on victims' rights. But I am convinced that federal statutory guarantees are not enough. Judges are simply too quick to conclude, almost reflexively, that the defendant's constitutional rights trump the victim's mere statutory rights, even when conflict is illusory or could readily be resolved. You heard about the difficulties we had after the Oklahoma City bombing with a federal statutory approach to help the victims and their families. Senator FEINSTEIN outlined in detail the chronology of events there, and so I will not repeat them. 
   But equally important, because more than 95 percent of all crimes are handled at the state level, our federal statutory rights simply do not reach the great majority of crime victims. 
   Regrettably, the hodge-podge of protections for victims in place at the state level is spotty and inadequate. There is no common denominator of rights that victims are guaranteed in every state of the union. As a December 1998 report by the National Institute of Justice found:  
   Enactment of state laws and state constitutional amendments alone appears to be insufficient to guarantee the full provisions of victims' rights in practice.  
   This report found numerous instances in which victims were not afforded the rights to which they were entitled. 
   For example, even in states identified as providing ``strong protection'' to victims' rights, more than 40 percent of victims were not notified in advance of the defendant's sentencing hearing. And more than 60 percent of victims in these strong-protection states did not receive notice of a defendant's pre-trial release. 
   And so, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to write a basic charter of victims' rights into our Constitution setting a national, uniform baseline of rights for all victims of violent crimes. 
   Now, one of reasons there were more than 60 drafts of this constitutional amendment is because I insisted on a number of basic changes before I would agree to support it. And with the help of Professor Larry Tribe, I proposed these changes, and the sponsors accepted them.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Mary Jane DeMatteis, Delaware's Mother of the Year 2000. 
   The story of Mrs. DeMatteis is one of strength and devotion. After her loving husband of twenty years passed away, she was left to raise their six children alone. Mrs. DeMatteis used her faith and her love for her children to persevere through the most difficult of times. While maintaining a job in the Delaware court system, she was able to find the time and energy to care for her children and teach them the importance of family and love. 
   I have had the opportunity to witness the product of Mrs. DeMatteis' many years of commitment to her children. Claire, her daughter, is one of my most senior advisors and her intellect and strength of character is certainly a reflection of the profound influence her mother has had on her life. Today the legacy of Mary Jane DeMatteis continues as her ten grandchildren are graced with the success and love that Mrs. DeMatteis infused into the lives of her children. I am sure that her impact will be felt for countless generations to come. 
   We all know that being a parent is the most important job in the world. I am extremely proud to recognize this wonderful honor that Mrs. DeMatteis so well deserves.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am disappointed in this budget resolution, because it endangers our national security. 
   The budget resolution does so by reducing the President's request for international affairs by over 10 percent. This reduction may appear to be a politically easy way to keep spending down. But mark my words: the reductions assumed by this budget resolution will end up costing us more elsewhere in future budgets. 
   Literally speaking, our diplomats are on the front lines of our national defense. They are out in force around the capitals of the world, defending and protecting our national interests every day--preventing and mitigating conflicts, fighting drug trafficking, promoting U.S. exports, reducing environmental degradation, and advancing American values and ideals. Most of them live and work under less than ideal circumstances. Many of them live in very dangerous places like Lebanon or Colombia. This budget breaks faith with those people because it will not provide enough money for secure embassies to protect them, and it does provide enough money for critical tools of diplomacy--exchange and assistance programs--that will enable them to adequately perform their missions. 
   We are deluding ourselves as a nation into thinking that we can remain a great power while continuing to skimp on spending to maintain a robust international presence. 
   We have made important progress in the past several years in restoring funding for international affairs. Unfortunately, we haven't made enough progress, and the budget remains below historical levels. According to a recent study by the Congressional Research Service prepared at my request, the discretionary budget authority for Function 150 in Fiscal 2000, $22.264 billion in FY 2000 dollars, is 9.3 percent below the average of the past two decades, $24.56 billion. As a percentage of total budget authority, Function 150 funding in FY 2000 is 1.24 percent, nearly one-fifth below the annual average, 1.571 percent, for the past two decades. 
   Mr. President, I hope that as the budget process moves forward, the leadership on the other side will find a way to accommodate the legitimate needs of our foreign policy and increase the allocations to these accounts. I urge the Chairman to do everything possible in the coming months to work toward to that objective.

    Mr. BIDEN. On March 31st, hundreds of people gathered in a lobby of the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. The focal point of the dignified but unassuming room is an information desk, with a big board behind it that's used to post the daily schedule for Delaware's Superior Court. It is, quite literally, where the Court meets the public, and it was the ideal--and perhaps the only--place for this particular occasion, a reception honoring Judge Vincent A. Bifferato as he retired following 32 years on Superior Court, a total of 36 years of public service. 
   ``Biff,'' as Judge Bifferato is universally known outside of the courtroom, is not the type for a country-club send-off. Part of it is roots. His father, born in Italy and never having had an education himself, always said he knew his son would go to college, and got to see his son sworn in as a member of the Delaware Bar. Biff remembers his father on that day, sitting in the front row, crying; ``To him,'' Biff says, ``it was the American dream.'' 
   And Biff knew, as his life since he became a lawyer has proved, that there is a second chapter to any true American dream story. It's the chapter written after you get there, the story of what you do with power and status once you've got them. And the truth is, it's the part of the story that matters most. 
   What Biff has done in his position as a judge is to combine the forceful exercise of authority and the vigorous application of the law with an uncommon sense of compassion for and responsibility to the people he was there to serve. He had never forgotten what drew him to public service in the first place--the opportunity to help people who need government, people who need someone on their side in order to have a chance. And he has never let those of us around him forget it either, always reminding colleagues and students--and anyone else who might need to be reminded--of our particular obligation to the least powerful of our fellow citizens. 
   Biff's concern for how people treat each other is, in fact, the hallmark of his character. In his courtroom, small-town lawyers from one-person firms knew they stood on equal footing with heavy-hitters from the big city. Litigants and witnesses were treated with  fairness and respect. Decorum and civility were not ideals but practiced standards. 
   Biff initiated a monthly forum for lawyers because he saw that solo practitioners and young attorneys from small firms were not getting the mentoring they needed, and also, as he said, that ``[t]here was a need for people to be nice to each other.'' That effort to promote professionalism and ethics--one lawyer described it as a ``blue-collar Inn of 
   Court''--is now called the Judge Bifferato Superior Court Trial Practice Forum. And for his leadership in that undertaking and in countless others, formal and informal, Biff received the inaugural Distinguished Mentoring Award from the Delaware State Bar Association. 
   As Resident Judge for New Castle County, Biff also made it his mission to ensure that the courthouse staff was appreciated as it should be. His emphasis was never on hierarchy but always on the common effort, never on the power or prestige of his office but on the contribution of each person who helped make the justice system work. It was the Court's staff Biff talked about most at his retirement reception, concluding simply, ``I love them all.'' 
   ``Love'' is a word heard often in relation to Vincent A. Bifferato. It was striking how often it was used at his retirement. Alongside words more expected at such occasions, like respect and esteem, ``love'' for Judge Biff was expressed by almost every speaker, including the Governor, the Mayor and the President Judge of the Court. No amount of ability, no standard of professionalism earns that kind of affection; it is, rather, a response to this man's grace of spirit, to the warmth and sincerity he brings to relationships, to the openness of his heart. 
   That heart was on generous loan to the Superior Court and to the people of Delaware, but it belongs, first and always, to Biff's family--to his wife, Marie, to his children and grandchildren, to his sister and to his mother, who was there, sitting in the front row, 37 years after that first swearing-in ceremony. She had always been proud of him, she said, long before any of his public accomplishments and contributions, because he was always ``a nice, young boy.'' 
   Biff remarked at his send-off that it was ``a hell of a tribute for just doing your job.'' But it was, of course, much more a tribute to who he is, a ``nice, young boy'' who made the most of his opportunities and then sought relentlessly to open opportunity for others; a leader who not only recognizes but genuinely feels his common humanity with those in need of help; a man who fulfilled and enriched his father's dream--for his family and for all of us. 
   Biff will have a successor but never a replacement. As he begins to write the next chapter of his life, he has our immeasurable thanks and, indeed, our love.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on March 18 the people of Taiwan went to the polls and chose their next president through a free and fair multiparty election. The winner of a close three-way race, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, will be inaugurated in May. 
   I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. Chen in Washington in 1997 when he was the mayor of Taipei. I was impressed by his political smarts and his commitment to building a more democratic and prosperous Taiwan. 
   I also found him to be genuinely committed to improving relations with the mainland. 
   I believe that Taiwan's election provides a fresh opportunity for the people of Taiwan and the people of China to reach out and resolve their differences peacefully through dialog on the basis of mutual respect. 
   I hope that leaders on both sides of the Strait will seize this opportunity and begin to lay the foundation of trust, goodwill, and understanding which must precede true reconciliation. 
   The inauguration of Chen will end the virtual monopoly of power the Nationalist Party has exercised for most of the past 50 years. This peaceful transition of power at the top of Taiwan's political system will mark the maturation of their democracy, and it is an event worthy of our profound respect and hearty congratulations. 
   It was only 13 years ago that Taiwan lifted martial law and ushered in a new period of open political discourse and expanded civil liberty. Prior to that, Taiwan's leaders did not tolerate dissent and moved swiftly and sometimes ruthlessly to silence their critics. 
   Taiwan's president-elect knows this well, because he got his start in politics as a young crusading lawyer working to promote transparency, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly. 
   Taiwan's emergence as a genuine multiparty democracy is a significant development in the long history of China. It is all the more remarkable given the fact that China's leaders in Beijing have done their level best to intimidate Taiwan's voters and prevent them from exercising this fundamental right. 
   I cannot help but wonder how average Chinese on the mainland must view Taiwan's remarkable transformation. On the one hand, the people of China have a deep devotion to national unity and apparently are prepared to use force against Taiwan if it were to declare its independence.  
   As Zhang Yunling of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing explained to New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Rosenthal on March 20, ``China was divided when it was weak, and now that it is getting strong again, people's nationalist feeling rises and they feel strongly it is time to reunite the country.'' 
   On the other hand, the people of China are beginning to form their own impressions of Taiwan, no longer content only to listen to the government's official propaganda demonizing the island. Some even admit publicly to a certain grudging admiration for Taiwan's accomplishments and hope their own government will do nothing to precipitate a crisis. 
   As one 22-year-old Beijing University physics major told Rosenthal, ``I think both sides will have to make adjustments to their policies. After all Taiwan is democratic now, and the people have exercised their right to choose a president.'' 
   Let me read the words of that university student again, ``..... the people have exercised their right to choose a president.'' 
   In America, we take democratic transitions of power for granted. But in China, and until recently on Taiwan, it was a revolutionary concept. And yet that is precisely what the people of Taiwan did on March 18. They changed their leadership through a peaceful, orderly, democratic process. They did so, by all accounts, because they were frustrated with corruption, cronyism, campaign finance abuses, and bureaucratic inefficiency. 
   These are all faults that China's communist government has in spades. And with Internet use exploding in China, and with cross-straits commercial ties now in the tens of billions of dollars, there is no way that the people of China will not discover what is happening on Taiwan. 
   And they may become inspired not only by the island's prosperity, but also by its peaceful democratic revolution. I predict they will begin to ask themselves, ``How come we don't enjoy the same standard of living and the same political rights here on the mainland?'' 
   Taiwan's people are responsible for the island's miraculous transformation from authoritarian rule and poverty to democracy and prosperity. They deserve all of the credit. But the people of the United States have reason to feel a little bit of pride as well. 
   If Taiwan wins the Oscar for Best Actor, then we at least get a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The United States commitment to Taiwan's security under the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act helped create the stable environment in which Taiwan has thrived. 
   The other critical component of cross-Strait stability has been our adherence to a ``One-China'' policy, in which we maintain that disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait must be settled peacefully, and that the future relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan must be determined in accordance with the wishes of the people of China and the people of Taiwan. 
   Maintaining a peaceful, stable environment in the Taiwan Strait has fostered economic growth throughout East Asia. It has also aided the emergence of democratic societies in the Philippines, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, and Taiwan. 
   In the past decade, more people have come under democratic rule in East Asia than were liberated in Europe by the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. This remarkable accomplishment would not have been possible without United States leadership. 
   Given all that Taiwan has accomplished in such a short span, I look forward to the future with renewed hope that someday all people of China will enjoy the rights and standard of living enjoyed by those fortunate few who live on Taiwan.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Richard Paez' nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And I must say, this vote is long, long overdue. I have heard a lot of talk here on the floor along the lines of hey--this is politics as usual. ``Oh when Senator BIDEN was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we held nominees up all the time.'' 
   Let me say this: forget my tenure as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. As far as I know, no judicial nominee in the history of this nation has waited as long as Judge Paez has for a vote. Four years is not even within the ballpark of a reasonable delay. 
   Judge Paez is a well-respected, experienced jurist. We already confirmed his nomination to the federal district court bench. He has served with distinction for 6 years on the federal district court and for 13 years before that as a municipal court judge in Los Angeles. The American Bar Association has given Judge Paez its highest rating, pronouncing him ``well qualified.'' Judge Paez enjoys broad bipartisan support in his own community, including from law enforcement officials. 
   Judge Paez is an honorable man, a man of integrity, and a man who has devoted his entire career to service--first, to service to the poor as a committed poverty lawyer, and then to service to the public at large as a state and then federal judge. His record does the President and his supporters proud. 
   From what I can tell, listening to the debate on the floor, the opposition to Judge Paez boils down to a few main points. First, to some off-hand remarks that he made about the California initiatives that maybe were ill-advised, but I believe may have been misconstrued--but we have already heard this discussed at length on the floor. I think it is a real shame to judge a man's distinguished 19-year record on the bench on the basis of any single remark. 
   More importantly, though, opponents cite concerns about the allegedly out-of-whack ninth circuit, which detractors like to call a ``rogue'' court. Aside from the fact that several circuits are reversed as or more often than the ninth circuit, I say this: If you have a problem with the ninth circuit, let's consider whether we should change the ninth circuit. I'm not saying whether we should or that we shouldn't, but there are several proposals out there to restructure the court. Let's debate them. 
   Why should we punish the millions of people who live in the ninth circuit by depriving them of the judges they need to mete out timely and fair justice? There are six vacancies on the ninth circuit--that is more than 20 percent of the 28 positions authorized for the court. And even more judges are needed to handle that court's heavy case load. All of these vacancies, by the way, are characterized by the Judicial Conference as judicial emergencies. 
   Let's not take out our differences on the ninth circuit on the people who live there and more importantly for today, let's not take out our differences on this nominee or--for that matter, on Marsha Berzon, another outstanding nominee who we are also voting on today. 
   The Los Angeles Daily Journal did an in-depth study of the criticisms leveled against Judge Paez and found that they were unfounded. What they concluded was this:  
   The portrait that emerged is of a thoughtful, unbiased and even-tempered judge, propelled into the political spotlight, only to be trapped in a seemingly never-ending and bitterly polarized nominations process.  
   Let us end that nominations process for Judge Paez here and now, and let it end with a vote of support.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, nearly two decades ago, President Carter submitted to the Senate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, known in shorthand as the ``Womens' Convention.'' 
   In the two decades since then, the Committee on Foreign Relations has acted on the Convention only once. In 1994, the Committee voted to report the treaty by a strong majority of 13 to 5. Unfortunately, the 103rd Congress ended before the full Senate could act on the Convention.  
   Since then, not one hearing has been held in the Committee on Foreign Relations. Not one. 
   It is a great mystery to me that a treaty that calls for the international promotion of civil and human rights for women would not be considered by the Senate. 
   Over 160 nations have become party to this treaty, which entered into force in 1981. To its great discredit, the United States stands outside this treaty with a just handful of other nations. 
   There is hardly anything revolutionary about this treaty. It contains a specific set of obligations calling on member states to enact legal prohibitions on discrimination against women--prohibitions which, in large part, the United States has already enacted. 
   In fact, if the United States becomes a party to the treaty, we would not need to make any changes to U.S. law in order to comply with the treaty. 
   So what are the opponents of this treaty supposedly concerned about? 
   In 1994, the five Senators who voted against the Convention in the Committee filed ``minority views.'' In it they expressed two concerns. 
   First, the dissenting Senators expressed concern that, in ratifying the Convention, several nations had taken reservations to the treaty, and thereby ``cheapened the coin'' of the treaty and the human rights norms that it embodies. 
   To this objection there are two answers. First, no treaty signed by dozens of nations will ever be perfect. It will be the product of numerous compromises, some of which will not always be acceptable. 
   That's why the Senate thinks it so important that we retain the right, whenever possible, to offer reservations to treaties--to attempt to remedy, or if necessary, opt-out, of any bad deals agreed to by our negotiators. 
   Second, this Senate has frequently entered reservations in ratifying human rights treaties in the 1980s and 1990s--such as the Convention on Torture, the Convention on Racial Discrimination, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
   In unanimously approving each of these treaties, the Senate imposed numerous reservations and understandings on U.S. ratification. In approving the Race Convention, for example, the Senate added three reservations, one understanding, and one condition. 
   Did we ``cheapen the coin'' of the Race Convention in doing so? The answer is no, because in entering these reservations we did not undermine the central purpose of the treaty--to require nations to outlaw racial discrimination. 
   The second objection registered by the five senators who voted against the Convention in 1994 is that joining the treaty was not the ``best use'' of our government's ``energies'' in promoting the human rights of women around the world. 
   This is a rather remarkable objection. What this group of senators was saying, in short, is that we should reserve our resources--and only promote human rights for women at certain times and in certain places. 
   I would hope that every senator would agree that we should promote equal rights for women at every opportunity--not when it suits us or when where it is the ``best use'' of our ``energies.'' Advancing human rights and human liberty--for women and for everyone else--is a never-ending struggle. 
   Of course, the United States has a powerful voice, and we do not need to be a party to this Convention in order to speak out on womens' rights. But we should join this Convention so we can be heard within the councils of the treaty. 
   Now the Senator from California stepped forward with a simple resolution which calls on the Senate to have hearings on the treaty, and for the Senate to act on the Convention by March 8, International Womens' Day. 
   Unfortunately, the effort to call up this resolution yesterday was objected to. So we are here on the floor today simply to try to raise the profile of this treaty. I hope that our colleagues are listening. 
   I urge the other members--whether on the Foreign Relations Committee or not--to step forward and join with us in urging support for this treaty.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning the FAA reauthorization bill that is currently before the Senate. Although I will vote in support of the bill, I feel compelled to express my reservations concerning the mandatory budgetary provisions that are included in this conference agreement. It should be understood by all here today that these provisions should not be used to reduce funding for other essential transportation programs, most importantly Amtrak. 
   I realize the importance of passing this legislation that provides necessary funding for aviation programs over the next three years. This bill has been a long time coming and I understand it has been carefully and diligently crafted between the conferees. I believe we need additional funding for the improvement of our airports and to permit us to take advantage of the best technologies to improve passenger safety. 
   However, I don't believe that other transportation programs such as Amtrak should suffer as a result of the budgetary agreement that has been included in this bill. I have long been a supporter of Amtrak and am dedicated to making sure that the Federal Government lives up to its promise to provide Amtrak with sufficient support to preserve passenger rail service in this country and enable Amtrak to reach operating self-sufficiency. Because of this I want to make it clear that I'm voting for this FAA reauthorization bill with the understanding that the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, and the Minority Leader, Senator DASCHLE, have made assurances that they will protect Amtrak from budgetary threats that may follow from this legislation.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, circumstances have prevented my being able to be here for the vote this evening on Julio Fuentes's nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, but I wanted to take this opportunity to make it clear that I am pleased to support his nomination. 
   Judge Fuentes is eminently qualified for this important position. After several years in private practice, Judge Fuentes has served the New Jersey community with honor first, as a judge on the Newark Municipal Court, and now, as a judge on the New Jersey Superior Court, where he has served admirably for well over a decade. 
   Judge Fuentes is an excellent jurist with an unblemished record and a man of integrity. He is regarded with great esteem within his community and has  received the endorsement of many different organizations. In fact, I understand that Judge Fuentes was originally recommended for a seat on the District Court in New Jersey, but the White House was so impressed after meeting him that the President nominated him to the Third Circuit instead. 
   I always monitor the nominations made to the Third Circuit with special interest because my own state of Delaware is part of that Circuit. And I can say without reservation that I am confident that Judge Fuentes will discharge his new responsibilities with distinction and will make a fine addition to that court. I commend the two Senators of New Jersey for their support of this nominee and am proud to join them.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Pennsylvania, I have known Cardinal O'Connor for a long time. I am a cosponsor of this bill. That is not the reason I stand. 
   I stand today to say I hope there is a lesson drawn from what is being done here. The primary cosponsor of this amendment is a man from New York of a different faith, who disagrees vehemently with the cardinal on some very important items that mean a lot to him in terms of the rights of homosexuals and the issue of choice. Yet he has come forward to acknowledge, along with his friend from Pennsylvania, that this man should be recognized for the special features he has possessed and the courage and the commitment he has shown. 
   I hope we all take a lesson from this. I hope we all understand that in every one of us in this country there is a lot of good--those who have strong political positions that are diametrically opposed to us--and yet we are able to see the good as well as the disagreement. I hope this is an object lesson for everyone. 
   I thank the Senator from New York for having the good grace to understand how we should run all of our affairs in this country. You can disagree without being disagreeable. You can have strong views and still recognize, in this instance, the saintly side of a great man. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I may not take the 10 minutes. 
   I can assure my colleagues that in order to accommodate the number of Senators who asked about my amendment, I am not going to, at this moment, force a vote on that amendment. 
   What I rise today for is to speak about an amendment I have submitted to this bill. What we have before us today is fundamentally a tax bill to help middle-class parents give their children the best education possible at elementary and secondary levels, as well as higher education. 
   I, with a few on my side of the aisle, happen to support the Senator from Georgia in his effort. The proposals in this bill are not new. In fact, I have supported many of them in their various incarnations in the past. 
   Several of these proposals were included as part of a so-called GET AHEAD Act--Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable--an act which I introduced in 1997. Although this bill never came before the Congress for a vote, many of its provisions were included in the 1997 tax bill. 
   In 1998, I was one of only a handful of Democrats who supported the legislation to expand the existing education savings accounts, more commonly referred to as educational IRAs. Currently, $500 a year may be contributed to these education IRAs, and the money in these accounts may only be used for higher education. However, under the 1998 proposal, as well as the bill we have before us today, these accounts would be expanded so the parents could contribute up to $2,000 per year, and the savings in the accounts could be used to pay for elementary and secondary education costs, as well as the costs associated with higher education. 
   I find no principal rationale why I should be able to use a $2,000 IRA to have sent my child to Georgetown University and not use it to send my child to Archmere Academy, which is a Catholic institution as well but a high school. 
   During my time in the Senate, I have consistently supported reasonable, appropriate, and constitutional measures to help middle-class and low-income families choose an alternative to public schools. I believe the bill achieves part of this goal. 
   There is no tax deduction for the money put into these education IRAs. There is no tax deduction for the entire cost of a private or parochial education. This is not a voucher proposal. 
   The thing I would most want to speak to today is the idea that we have to do more than we are now to accommodate parents sending their kids to college. As helpful as this initiative is, it does not go very far. We all know firsthand how difficult it is for American families to afford college. 
   In 1997, we took some important steps towards making college education more affordable with the enactment of several tax credits for students and their families. So-called HOPE scholarships allow families a tax credit of up to $1,500 for tuition and fees for the first 2 years of college. The Lifetime Learning credit currently allows families a 20-percent tax credit on up to $5,000 for educational expenses through the year 2002, and up to $10,000 for educational expenses thereafter. 
   Additionally, the 1997 tax bill allows students to deduct a portion of the interest paid on student loans during the first 60 months of repayment. The bill before us today proposes to eliminate that 60-month limit on student loan interest deductions and allow students to deduct the interest paid on their student loans for the duration of their repayment. 
   While this is another step in the right direction, I believe there is still more we can do to help our Nation's college students. That is why I am offering an amendment today to allow an additional tax relief for millions of families who are struggling to put their kids through college. My amendment builds upon the proposal contained in the legislation introduced in 1997. 
   My amendment would offer families the option of either a tax deduction of a 28-percent tax credit on up to $5,000 of educational expenses during 2001 and 2002 and up to $10,000 of educational expenses during 2003 and thereafter. Further, there is no limit on the number of years the family could claim this tax credit. So a student could claim a deduction or credit for every year he or she is enrolled in an institution of higher learning as either an undergraduate or a graduate student. 
   Additionally, this educational tax deduction contains higher income thresholds. I would allow this to be taken for up to $120,000 for joint filers, thus allowing more families and more students to take advantage of the tax benefits in this proposal. 
   Things have changed a great deal since I arrived in the Senate in 1973. In 1973, there was still the myth that all a student needed was a good high school education to have a clear shot at being able to make it. The statistics and the numbers and the story has been told over the last 28 years that a college education is essentially becoming a prerequisite for having a clear shot at the middle-class dream of being able to own a home, afford a good education for your children, and to live with some degree of financial certitude. 
   I will not take more time today, although when I do introduce this formally to a piece of legislation, I will speak much longer and in much more detail. 
   To summarize, I think it is the most noble of social purposes to seek to encourage families to spend money on educating their children and, particularly at this stage, on higher education. People say to me: JOE, $120,000 is an awful lot of money for you to allow someone to have a tax advantage. You can have them make up to $120,000 and they still get a benefit here. 
   The answer is yes. My inclination is to go higher. Try sending a kid to a private institution today and college. Try sending a kid to a school that is not a State public institution. There are phenomenal State public institutions. I am not suggesting there aren't. 
   Take my alma mater, the University of Delaware. As an in-State student, you can get it done for somewhere around $13,000 room, board, and tuition. Send that same kid to the school my son attended, the University of Pennsylvania and it is $35,000. Send them to Gettysburg College and it is $30,000 room, board, and tuition. The cost of education is astronomical. 
   What I don't like to see happen, when you think about the incredible cost of education today and what we are developing, is basically a two-tiered education system. One of the greatest bills that ever passed was the GI bill. The GI bill meant that 
   Irish Catholic kids and inner-city kids and farm boys could go to Harvard and Yale and Princeton and to the great ``universities'' out there. But now to go to those schools and every other school, many of which we haven't heard the names of, there is very little possibility. The only choice a student has in a middle-class family is to be able to go to the State institution. 
   I went to the State institution. I am proud of having gone to the State institution. My wife graduated from the State institution. My whole family went to the University of Delaware. I take a back seat to no one at any other university in terms of the education I received, but I don't want to be in a position where, in fact, the only choice middle-class people have of sending their kids to college is at a State university. I don't want this two-tiered system to reemerge. 
   If you get into one of the great universities, the prestige universities, they are endowed enough that if you have no money, you are likely to be able to get help. You will be able to get some aid packages to go. The people who get crunched are the people in the middle.  
   I am delighted and pleased and I applaud the Georgetowns and the Dukes and the Princetons and the Stanfords and the great universities out there that are the named universities for providing for the education of moderate- and low-income people who otherwise qualify to get in. Very few get turned away because of that. The problem comes with the quintessential middle-class family who makes what appears to be a good income, has three kids going to college, and they lose that option. I don't think they should. 
   Mr. President, rather than take the time of the Senate, I will withhold sending my amendment to the desk because I am not going to ask for a vote on it now. I will speak to this in more detail later. 
   I thank the manager of the bill for allowing me the opportunity. I particularly thank Senator WELLSTONE, who was here before me, for allowing me to precede him. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, is a very vital part of our arsenal to combat terrorism and espionage. For 20 years, it has enabled the FBI to keep track of major threats to our security while preserving the constitutional rights of Americans. Basically, it provides for a sort of super search warrant, allowing the FBI, under certain unique circumstances, to eavesdrop upon activities, after showing a probable cause to a Federal judge, without having to disclose this eavesdropping in ways that they would have to under a normal warrant for a wiretap or a physical search. 
   FISA has been very useful to deal with terrorism, and also with espionage cases. 
   Senator SPECTER has undertaken an effort to look into what may or may not have transpired at our National Laboratories in the celebrated case of Wen Ho Lee and others. This has been the subject of some very legitimate discussion, and occasionally some partisan discussion. But knowing Senator SPECTER as long as I have, I do not doubt his desire to look into these cases that have transpired, and the consequences of any leakage of classified information from any of our National Laboratories, for the primary purpose of seeing to it that it does not happen again, if in fact it did happen, as well as to determine what did happen. 
   Senator SPECTER and Senator TORRICELLI have been looking into these recent cases, especially, as I said, the case of Wen Ho Lee at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As a result of that inquiry, Senator SPECTER is proposing what I think is a very important series of sensible amendments to this act we call FISA. I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, having been an original author of that legislation in 1978, along with Birch Bayh and others. 
   The initial bill with which Senator SPECTER approached me and others had a few areas where I thought it could be improved. I wish to publicly thank Senator SPECTER for agreeing to the changes I suggested in his proposed legislation. 
   One of the dilemmas that exists, in the debate about whether the Attorney General and the Justice Department and/or the FBI were reading from the same page in the hymnal on how to investigate the Wen Ho Lee case, is the issue of whether the FBI communicated enough information to the Attorney General so that, under the reading of the FISA law, the Attorney General could conclude that there was sufficient reason to get a search or electronic surveillance court order. There has been a little bit of disagreement, at a minimum, between the FBI and the Justice Department as to who said what, when, and what request was made when. It has led to a serious political controversy. I think it has also led, as a consequence, on both sides of the aisle, to some posturing and partisanship about a significant national security issue. 
   One of Senator SPECTER's most important ideas in this bill, one which is going to seem commonsensical to most Americans, is to make it clear that if something is of such consequence that the Director of the FBI believes there should be a FISA hearing and authority granted to allow the FBI to use invasive measures to eavesdrop upon conversations and/or get records, for example, from computer data and the like, if it is that important, the FBI Director can, under this new amendment to FISA, put that request in writing to the Attorney General and the Attorney General, whoever that may be, then has to personally sign off or not sign off, so we avoid this debate that is taking place now about whether second level people or third level people made the right judgment or wrong judgment, and whether or not there was any malfeasance. 
   So this is a very practical solution. If this legislation had been in place 3 years ago, 5 years ago, there would be no doubt as to what happened. Had the FBI said this is critical and this is national security, the Attorney General personally would have had to say yes or no. That is where the record is unclear in the Wen Ho Lee case. This bill would eliminate such doubt in future similar cases if and when they arise, and they surely will arise. 
   Section 2 of this bill permits the judge to consider the past activities of the target of an investigation--that is, the person upon whom they want to eavesdrop and/or whose records they want to secretly examine. So, for example, the Attorney General would be able to say, in a closed FISA hearing: Your Honor, not only do we think this is justified because of some current activity, but we can show you evidence that in 1991 they were engaged in this suspicious activity, in 1993 they were engaged in that, in 1995 
   they were engaged in this, therefore lending greater credibility to the argument that a FISA court order should be issued by the judge. 
   Again, in this Wen Ho Lee case, and other cases that Senator SPECTER has examined, there has been discussion of the fact that sometimes these folks had been under investigation before. Would that not lend greater weight to the need for this FISA request to be granted? So we clear that up in this legislation, rather than only allowing the target's current activity to be brought up. 
   Section 3 of this proposal requires the FISA court to be told if the target of a proposed search or surveillance has a relationship with a Federal law enforcement or intelligence agency. This came up in this case as well. The case is being investigated. It turns out at some point one of the persons in the past had been also a source for the FBI. The FBI had gone to this person and said: Will you be a source for us, looking into the possibility of some illegal activity? Then that very person becomes the target, and that very person is never able to tell, nor does the FBI or the CIA say: By the way, Your Honor, we were working with them. That is why they went ahead and did the following. 
   Up to now, when the Federal Government has asked for a FISA court judge to give this surveillance authority, it has not been required to say: By the way, Your Honor, this person in the past had worked with us as a source, as a person cooperating with us. 
   This is a new and useful protection for Americans, because the conduct that might seem suspicious could be a result of what the law enforcement agency had actually asked them to do. It seems only fair to the target to be able to have that information known to the judge. 
   This is typical of the Senator from Pennsylvania, that he looks out for individual rights as well as the interests of law enforcement. 
   There are several other interesting provisions in this bill, including some to improve relations between the FBI and other agencies, and I am sure there will be further refinements in this bill when it is considered by the Judiciary Committee. The important thing is that Senator SPECTER is working, I think effectively and in a bipartisan manner, to ensure that his inquiry into the Wen Ho Lee case leads to useful changes and not just to partisan recriminations. I compliment him on that, because the purpose of oversight is not only to find out who struck John but, in the national interest, to find the best way to prevent something such as this from happening again. So I compliment him and again thank him for acceding to the more than several changes I asked for in this legislation. 
   I think the amendments to existing law that this bill will enact are good amendments. I think America will be well served, and I would argue that the individual rights of Americans will be in no greater jeopardy after this passes than they ever were. They are protected; they will continue to be protected; and some of these changes will  even help to further protect the rights of individual Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS, in supporting a resolution regarding Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for Radio Liberty, who has been missing in Russia since January. 
   Mr. Babitsky is a veteran reporter for Radio Liberty, the U.S.-funded radio broadcasting organization based in Prague. He has reported on Russia for over a decade, and reported on the Russo-Chechen war from 1994 to 1996 and over the past several months. 
   In mid-January, Mr. Babitsky disappeared in Chechnya. Since then, Russian officials have issued contradictory statements about Mr. Babitsky's whereabouts and well-being. On January 26, a Russian presidential spokesman stated that Babitsky ``left Grozny and then disappeared,'' and that Russian officials had no knowledge of his  whereabouts. Two days later, Russian authorities acknowledged to officials from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Mr. Babitsky had been detained, but that he would soon be released. Just a few days after that, Russian officials stated that, instead of being released, Mr. Babitsky had been handed to Chechen rebels in exchange for three Russian prisoners of war. 
   It is now late February. Mr. Babitsky still has not been heard from, and the Russian government has yet to provide a credible accounting of his whereabouts. 
   The actions and statements of the Government of the Russian Federation are deeply troubling, not only because of what they may mean for Mr. Babitsky's well-being, but for what they may portend about the freedom of the press in Russia today. Mr. Babitsky is a journalist, working for an American-supported news organization. His detention by the Russian authorities, and his reported exchange with the Chechens, violates fundamental norms embodied in the Geneva Conventions and applicable protocols. Equally troubling, the detention and mistreatment of a working journalist is a chilling indication that the Government of the Russian Federation is not committed to a fundamental human right: freedom of the press. These are not just the words of one United States Senator. In Russia itself, a leading journalists' union has stated that the Babitsky case is ``not an isolated episode, but almost a turning point in the struggle for a press that serves society and not the authorities.'' 
   Several weeks ago, the chairman and I wrote to Acting President Putin and urged Mr. Babitsky's release. Several other senators and members of the other body have expressed similar views. Additionally, the Secretary of State has raised this matter with senior Russian officials. In Russia, Europe and the United States, there has been universal condemnation of the Russian Government for its actions in this matter. 
   Today we have decided to call additional attention to Mr. Babitsky's plight by introducing this sense of the Senate resolution, which criticizes the Government of the Russian Federation for its actions in the Babitsky matter and calls on Moscow to provide a full accounting of his detention. 
   I hope it will get the attention of the Russian Government. I hope it will help lead to the truth about the whereabouts of Mr. Babitsky. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves the floor, I wish to thank him and acknowledge all the work he has done over the past year or more on this issue. He has, in a sense, exercised some forbearance in the past when he thought it might have been more appropriate to make a stronger move, but because of circumstances within Russia and our bilateral relations and the hope--not expectation--that there may be a way to get this done, he has cooperated. I think everybody should understand the reason this issue has stayed so much on the forefront is because of his vigilance and his effort. I thank him for that. I thank him as well, along with other colleagues, for entertaining some of the changes that Senator LEVIN proposed. I think this is a much better bill. I agree with him; I think enough time has passed to demonstrate that this may be the only course left open, and hopefully it will work. 
   In a strange sense, the Senator and I have had occasion separately and individually, as the Presiding Officer has, to meet with members of the Russian Duma, members of the Russian Government, and members of the leadership of the various Arab states. I find it counterintuitive that they don't understand, quite frankly, that what is happening in Iran and their quest for this missile technology is literally a greater threat to them than it is to us. It is no greater threat to anyone than Israel; nonetheless, it is an incredibly significant threat to our friends in Europe, as well as our Arab friends. What is going on in North Korea is a threat to China and Russia in the long term, not only Japan and South Korea. What is going on in Iraq is a greater threat to our French friends--who seem to support Iraq against their own interests--than it is to us. 
   I am wondering when reason will take hold. I am a little bit dismayed, and more than a little bit miffed, by the ability of our friends, as well as those who are not viewed as our close friends, to dismiss reality. What do they think? If Russia is worried about the radicalization of the Moslem populations within the former Soviet Union, the Trans-Caucasus, and other places, why in the devil do they not understand that what is going on in Iraq, as well as in Iran--if it does not take a drastic change in course--is inimical to their interests? Ironically, the second largest former Communist state--the former Soviet Union--seems to be the ultimate capitalist in this regard; but they can't add very well. This is, I think, more about money than anything else. Hopefully, as I will lay out in my statement--and I don't want to delay the Senator any longer--they will see the virtues of looking to the West and not to Iran and Iraq for the source of their economic survival. At any rate, I thank the Senator very much for his leadership.

   Mr. BIDEN. I wish the driver of that express a lot of luck. 
   Maybe what Mr. Putin, who is the Acting President and likely soon to be elected President, it appears--maybe we should send my mom over to see him. My mom had an expression, from the time we were kids, when you would do something against your own interest out of anger, or out of pique, or misunderstanding. My mother would say, ``Don't bite your nose off to spite your face.'' Well, we have a whole lot of Russians seeming to bite their noses off to spite their faces. I find it absolutely astounding what they appear to continue to do. 
   The bill before us is called the Iran Nonproliferation Act. That is the context in which we should talk about this, and I think we should understand this. The purpose of this bill is not to punish, but rather to restrain. The goal that we pursue is not to invoke sanctions, but rather to make this a safer world for all of us, including the Russians. The means to that end is to make this a world with fewer weapons of mass destruction and with fewer delivery systems able to deliver weapons of mass destruction, notably long-range ballistic missiles. 
   Long-range ballistic missiles are a curious invention. They are awesome, frankly, but they don't amount to much as a military weapon unless they are armed with a powerful warhead. Now, the sort of long-range missile that Third World countries might build --and that the countries I have mentioned are attempting to build, or have built--those missiles cannot carry big enough warheads to do much damage with a conventional high explosive, a plain old bomb; they are too heavy. The missile is not big enough, powerful enough, does not have enough throw weight to carry conventional weapons. So the irony is that a country which develops or buys long-range ballistic missiles is all too likely, therefore, to seek weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear warheads that are lighter and have much more--no pun intended --bang for the buck than a conventional weapon, or even potentially a lighter payload, with chemical weapons or biological weapons on top of these missiles. The irony is that as they develop a long-range ballistic missile capacity, they are led inextricably--if they are going to be of any ``value'' militarily--they move toward weapons of mass destruction with which to arm the missiles. 
   North Korea has been trying to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq has built chemical and biological weapons and is seeking a nuclear capability. They were close to building a nuclear weapon a decade ago. Similarly, Iran has a  covert nuclear weapons program. Even the Government of Russia admits that. Iran has also developed and used chemical weapons. Now, again, that is chemical weapons that, based on the missile technology they may have acquired, even if they have a range of 2,000 miles, as my friend from Connecticut indicated, doesn't get them to Washington, DC. 
   It doesn't get them to any U.S. territory. But it does get them to a lot of areas of the world where our friends--in this case, the Russians--can be affected. 
   We have to stop this as best we can. The world must move toward fewer weapons of mass destruction, not more of them. We have to reduce the number of long-range ballistic missiles in the world, not increase them. Unfortunately, some foreign persons--and I say ``persons'' because that is the legal word in this legislation for officials or entities; by ``entities'' we mean the Russian agency comparable to our space agency, NASA, or the agency in Russia comparable to our Defense Department, or institutes, or companies. In Russia, institutes or companies cannot be separated very clearly from the Government. 
   Unfortunately, some of these foreign ``persons''--in Russia, China, and North Korea--are deaf to the world's call for nonproliferation and apparently tone deaf to their own interests. The countries or entities are so desperate for cash or so angry at the West that they will risk Armageddon by helping Iran build long-range ballistic missiles or even nuclear weapons. 
   As ironic as this sounds, this legislation is designed in part to save them from their own destructive impulses. The United States has imposed sanctions at times on entities from all three of these supplier countries. Again, by the ``supplier'' countries I mean North Korea, China, and Russia. The United States has imposed sanctions on entities from these countries and is continuing negotiations with all of these countries to secure an end to their assistance to Iran. While we may hope for success in the months or years to come, however, there has been little success so far. 
   Today the Senate will vote to make the President list the offending ``persons;'' to increase his powers to impose sanctions against them; and to limit United States support for Russian work on the international space station if any entities under the Russian Aviation and Space Agency continue to assist Iran, which we have reason to believe they have. 
   It is important to understand that H.R. 1883, which we will shortly pass, is not an anti-Russian bill. Rather, it is simply and overwhelmingly a nonproliferation bill. Both I and the Senate sponsors of this bill would like nothing better than to have this bill result in no sanctions whatever against Russia. 
   While we try to crack down on entities that assist Iran's long-range ballistic missile programs, we also support nonproliferation of assistance to Russia. We continue to help Russia reduce its unneeded strategic weapons through the Nunn-Lugar program, protect its sensitive nuclear materials, help it find new careers for excess weapon scientists, and improve its export control laws. Those are the laws that are on the books, and should be enforced, which would prevent any agency or company within Russia from transferring usable information to aid and abet Iran in their long-range missile programs. 
   We are helping Russia in other ways, as well, so this should not be taken in isolation. This is part of a continuum of efforts on our part to deal with the interests of our country as well as Russia. The United States Government, with the support of many in this body, also continues to work with Russia on many other vital issues. We seek continued strategic arms reductions, through the so-called START process. We support the sharing of missile warning data. We are working to preserve the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the ABM Treaty, with an amendment that allows for--again, in Russia's interests--a limited ballistic missile defense. Again, we pointed out that North Korea and Iran present a greater danger to them than they do to the United States. 
   The United States and other Western countries also offer the investment on which Russia's economic development depends. United States companies even buy ballistic missile engines from Russia's top design bureaus. Our American companies are purchasing directly from Russian design entities. We are buying engines that they are 
   producing, from which they are making substantial money. Iran cannot begin to match the power of the United States to sustain and transform Russian industry. In other words, they will make a heck of a lot more money doing the right thing, dealing with the United States and with the Western Europeans and Japan, than they will ever make from selling technology to Iran. I urge Russian leaders to think about that. 
   I wonder, with all the chaos that is in place in Russia, whether anybody at the top has ever really focused on this. In pure unadulterated dollars and cents, what is in Russia's economic interest is to sell to the West rather than to sell to Iran. If the choice is starkly made, which we are about to do, I hope they will focus more logically on their alternatives. 
   This bill and the Senate are not anti-Russian, but we are manifestly anti-proliferation. We will not tolerate vicious and venal persons plunging the world into a new cold war, let alone a hot one in which weapons of mass destruction would be a freely traded currency of death. If Russia or China or North Korea should choose the path of proliferation--and they have to some degree already done that--we will show that there are better paths to power and prestige than proliferating ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction to Third World countries with unstable regimes. There is still time to stamp out proliferation and to put the world on a more peaceful path, but we must not and we will not collaborate in sowing the seeds of global destruction through proliferation. 
   It is unfortunate that the Senate action occurs only weeks before next month's Presidential elections in Russia. The need to pass this legislation is not our fault, that is Russia's fault. Some in that country between now and those elections may try to use our action to stir up a nationalistic reaction for their own political purposes in the upcoming Russian election. That would be both unwise and ill founded. It is also unfortunate that the House authors of this bill insisted upon triggering Presidential reporting and possible sanctions based upon a very low standard of evidence. In practice, however, no President will impose sanctions unless he is convinced that wrongdoing has occurred, notwithstanding the fact that the House standard of evidence is too low a threshold. 
   Finally, I regret that this bill does not permit the President to authorize extraordinary payments for work on the international space station, if those payments should be needed, to protect sensitive intelligence information. Neither does it permit payments to a sanctioned entity if such payments are needed to prevent significant dangers to the crew of the space station. I do not think either of those are wise restrictions, and I hope these concerns can be addressed in conference between the House and Senate. 
   The important fact is, however, that the Senate action today is a measure not of anti-Russian sentiment, nor of any impulse to bully. Rather, it reflects the depth of our concern and also our frustration over the increasing risk that Russian and other entities will recklessly open Pandora's box, against their own interest as well as ours. 
   I earnestly hope that in the coming weeks, our President and the newly elected President of Russia can put us back on the track of peaceful cooperation to make this a safer and more prosperous world. That is a real prospect for both countries, if Russia would only accept that its profit and its destiny lies in the West, not in the East. 
   Perhaps passage of this bill will help to bring about such a reevaluation. If so, then prospects for the new century on which we have just embarked would truly be improved. If not, it puts us on a perilous slope to more proliferation and colder, not warmer, relations. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there has been incredible prosperity that the vast majority of our country is benefiting from--and that prosperity was built on a combination of communication and computers. This technology has opened a whole new world for America. This new technology has driven our economic growth. And, the future lies with those who can master the tools of this new economic age. 
   It wasn't too long ago that it looked like our time in the sun was behind us.  Behind us was the idea of prosperity in our country. But times have changed over the past few years. And we stand here today with the prospect of a new era of prosperity. 
   With flexible financial markets, a historic wave of entrepreneurial activity, and the convergence of new technologies from the personal computer to the Internet, we are transforming ourselves into what is now called the ``new economy.'' 
   Look at the numbers: In recent years, Information Technology industries contributed 35% to Gross Domestic Product growth. The Information Technology sector is growing at twice the rate of the rest of the economy. And by 2006, more than half of the U.S. workforce will be employed by industries that are either major producers, or intensive users, of Information Technology. 
   A lot of what we do--manufacturing, shipping, marketing, are basically the same old functions. But we do virtually all of them in new and better ways thanks to the explosion of information technology. This has increased our productivity in ways that the best economists still don't completely understand. 
   But, there is one thing that we do understand: those who can master technology will be able to benefit from this great expansion--and that is why we are here today. So no one is left behind. 
   That is why today I am proud to be introducing legislation, aptly titled Kids 2000, that will be one step in our mission to provide all children with access to technology. 
   It is my hope, that through a public/private partnership, led by members of Congress and Steve and Jean Case, state-of-the-art computer centers will be placed in Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. Located in largely under-served communities, Club computer centers will reach precisely the kids who need these resources the most. And none of these kids will be left behind. 
   One goal of Kids 2000 is to help close the digital divide by providing kids with computers, internet access, and fully comprehensive technical training. As the wonders of computers become increasingly evident and celebrated, certain segments of society still lack access to these resources. Some segments are not participating in this technological revolution that is sweeping across our country. 
   And the disparities are alarming. Look at the figures: Of households making over $75,000, 80% own computers and 60% use the Internet. Yet, for households making between $10,000-$15,000, only 16% own a computer and only 7% use the Internet. 
   And it's not just income levels. There are disparities amongst races, education levels and geography. In addition, at all income levels, households with two parents are far more likely than one-parent households to own computers and have Internet access. 
   The digital divide is also significant because the new digital economy can't run on computers alone. Businesses need workers with computer know-how and Internet literacy. Those who are not competent with the tools of technology will be left behind. Some of them are our kids. They are our responsibility and we cannot let this happen. 
   And we know what happens to our kids when they are left behind. Their opportunities are vastly reduced, there is despair, and even criminal behavior. But there is something that we can do. And we are here today to begin a significant effort to do just that--to close the digital divide. 
   Addressing the problems associated with the digital divide is not all this initiative seeks to do. Another goal is to reduce juvenile crime by providing kids with substantive after-school programs. 
   Everyone has heard me say this time and time again, but let me say this one more time--prevention works. 
   While kids are learning in these computer centers, they will be off the street and out of harm's way. They will be occupied with constructive activities. School dropout rates will be reduced because kids will realize that they have great potential. Kids 2000 is the ultimate after-school program. 
   That is precisely why I have asked the Boys and Girls Clubs to host my computer initiative. For decades, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America have provided young people all across the United States with the support and inspiration they need to make it in a world full of peer pressure and crime. 
   Kids 2000 also makes sense economically. It is estimated that allowing a single youth to drop out of high school and enter a life of drug abuse and crime costs society between $1.7 and $2.3 million. In comparison, Kids 2000 will cost the government a mere $40 per child. 
   Because I believe that there is a role for the private sector, I have asked my good friends Jean and Steve Case and PowerUp to be an integral part of this initiative. That means computers, America On-Line accounts, educational curriculum, and fully comprehensive technical training in Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide. 
   And PowerUp is not alone. 3-Com has committed to donating $1 million in networking equipment, MCI Worldcom will be donating educational software and training, American Airlines has agreed to donate free airline travel to train teachers, Ripple Effects Software will donate educational software, and Sabre Inc. will be donating computers. 
   I want to thank all the corporations that have stepped forward and I hope that there will be many more in the coming months. We can't do this project without the private sector's help. 
   I want to say thanks to Steve and Jean Case who have been in the forefront of this issue since the beginning and who are participating in this initiative in a very significant way. You know we could not do this without you and I appreciate your generosity and commitment to the cause. 
   This initiative has brought together so many integral sectors of society. Business, government, the non-profit world. Together, we can make this program a success. Together we can make a difference in the lives of kids and provide our children with the tools they need to live and learn in a world that has become so dependent on technology.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill which will re-authorize the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for an additional five years. 
   I firmly believe that re-authorization of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for another five years is the single most significant thing that we can do to continue the war on crime. 
   In 1994 when we introduced the Biden Crime Bill, which eventually became the crime bill of 1994, some people disagreed with certain aspects of the bill. But, we all agreed that crime control is a place where the federal government can and should play a key role. 
   We can all argue about how much we should be involved in education or welfare, but no one can argue about the requirement of the government to make our streets safe. That is the starting point for all ordered society. 
   So, I, along with the Senior Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, and the Senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, worked to set up a Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The way we did that was not to raise taxes--it was to cut the size of the federal government and use the money to fight crime. And so we agreed to let 250,000 Federal employees go. Then we took the paycheck that would have been used to pay John Jones and Sue Smith and we put it into a trust fund to do nothing but deal with violent crime in America. And guess what--it worked. 
   Since the Fund was established in the Biden Crime Bill, The Office of Management and Budget tells us that Congress had appropriated $16,648,000,000 from the fund through 1998, and $10,300,000,000 was estimated for 1999 and 2000 combined. 
   What has this money done you ask? Just look at the numbers: To date, the money has funded more than 103,000 police officers under the COPS program to make our streets safer. 
   As of 1999, over 17,000 new prison, jail or alternative beds had been added under the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing Grants Program. 
   Under the drug court program nationwide, more than 140,000 offenders have participated in drug courts, receiving the supervision and treatment they need to stop abusing drugs and committing crimes. 
   Under the National Criminal History Improvement Program, enhancements to the FBI's National Criminal History Background Check System have helped block more than 400,000 gun sales to ineligible persons. And, program improvements now allow 35 states and the District of Columbia to submit data to the FBI's National Sex Offender Registry, which became operational in July 1999. 
   The fund has provided money to states and localities to help offset the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. 
   Under the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment for State Prisoners program, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories, have implemented drug testing and treatment programs that address 80 percent of offenders who have drug or alcohol problems. 
   Through the largest Violence Against Women Act program, funding for the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program is changing the way communities work together to respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
   And there are other Violence Against Women Act grant programs which have had an impact on many communities. The Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies program encourages jurisdictions to implement mandatory or pro-arrest policies in domestic violence cases. The Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program has recognized the special needs of victims in rural locations. The Civil Legal Assistance Grant Program is designed to strengthen civil legal assistance for domestic abuse victims through innovative, collaborative programs that increase victim access to services. And, the Grants to Combat Violent Crimes Against Women on Campuses Program was first funded in FY 1999 to promote comprehensive, coordinated responses to violent crimes against women on campuses. 
   The results of these efforts have taken hold. Crime is down--way down. And we didn't add 1 cent to the deficit. 
   The significance of the Trust Fund, why it was so important, is because it funds the initiatives contained in the Biden Crime Bill. The money has to be used for new cops and crime prevention. It can't be spent on anything else but crime reduction. It is the one place that no one can compete. it is set  aside. It is a savings account to fight crime. 
   This fund works. It ensures that the crime reduction programs that we pass be funded. It ensures that the crime rate will continue to go down instead of up. It ensures that our kids will have a place to go after school instead of hanging out on the street corners. It ensures that violent crimes against women get the individualized attention that they need and deserve. It gives states money to hire more cops and get better technology. 
   Today our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant against violent crime. This is one modest step toward meeting that challenge. 
   This Act shares bipartisan support. No one wants crime and no one wants to raise taxes. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--this should be an easy one for all of us. In July of last year, during debate on the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, my friend from New Hampshire, Senator GREGG, declared his commitment to get the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund re-authorized. Senator GRAMM has always stepped up to the plate on this issue as well, and I commend them for their commitment to this program. As Senator BYRD aptly stated back in 1994 when we were first debating this, ``the war on crime is of such an overriding concern that, as in the past, the Committee on Appropriations must take extraordinary actions to confront the issue.'' That still rings true today. Although crime is down, we can not become complacent. We must continue the fight. We need this Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund more than any other single piece of legislation. 
   Every member of the Senate is against violent crime--we all say it in speech after speech. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up their words and follow through on their commitments to defeat violent crime. Pass this bill. Continue the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. Take serious action against violent crime. Show the criminals that we are serious about fighting crime. Show the American people that their safety is of the highest priority for us and that we are taking action.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to tell you about St. Paul School in my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. In a country that can only be measured by the well-being of its least-advantaged citizenry, St. Paul has a special story that is too often left untold. 
   St. Paul Church and the adjoining school are landmarks on the Wilmington skyline, visible from Interstate 95 heading North through Wilmington. Surrounding it are remnants of a once heavily-populated Irish and German immigrant communities and now is in the heart of the Hispanic section of the city. It sits at the base of the West Side and since the 1800's, has been a safe haven for generations of children and families newly arriving to American shores and settling in our community. 
   St. Paul School was founded in 1874. Its 125 year history is clear--providing quality education to immigrant and minority children. Yet at St. Paul, there is a much deeper, much more powerful message. While St. Paul is a school of 235 kindergarten through eighth graders, 99% of whom are urban children of color from some of Wilmington's most distressed areas, its students are prepared well and consistently perform above the national indicators of student achievement. 
   There is no culture of poverty or sense of hopelessness in any child, in any classroom in this school. St. Paul's dispels the assumptions and myths about the innate inability of inner-city minority children from very precarious circumstances to succeed academically and socially in mainstream society. At St. Paul, parents are properly engaged, teachers are supremely dedicated and most important, children come ready to learn. This in a school where more than half the students enter with limited English-speaking ability, most of the families live on the margins of poverty and the teachers and administration work for pay well-below their parochial, public and private counterparts. 
   St. Paul is indeed a special place, but in my view, it is one of so many other stories we need to find out about, embrace and share with America. Furthermore, it is the reason that we must continue to invest in the education of our children. On February 9, 2000 in Wilmington, there will be a Commemorative Mass benefiting the Saint Paul School Scholarship Fund. It is a time when St. Paul School will take center stage for many in our community. It makes perfect sense because every day, education and its importance takes center stage in the lives of St. Paul children. 
   Our community--both now and in future--will be better because of the efforts of schools like St. Paul around the country where truly no one child is left behind. We in Wilmington salute St. Paul School.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a true champion of humanity. A man whose whole life has been a gift of service without material reward. A man whose work has as much meaning for the poor and disenfranchised in Sudan as it does for the poor and disenfranchised in his Wilmington community. A man whose faith in the human spirit abounds. A man that I proudly call my friend, the Executive Director of Delaware's Ministry of Caring, Brother Ronald Giannone. 
   This week, business and community leaders and hundreds of Brother Ronald's closest friends from across the State of Delaware will gather to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. This Golden Birthday bash principally is to thank him fifty-times over for his countless years of service to our community. We will salute him because of who Brother Ronald is, what he represents and how much he means to improving the quality of life in my home State. 
   Let me be specific. Brother Ronald is the kind of guy who when asked by a man or a woman down on his or her luck, ``Can you spare a dime?'' responds with a meal, a place to stay and a rigorous routine of training and education to help keep that man or woman from the throes of homelessness and despair. He is hope to the hopeless, an oasis of strength and inspiration for all those who benefit from his generosity. 
   For these reasons, Brother Ronald is a true Delaware treasure, but still there is so much more. Brother Ronald is an exemplary administrator. There is, quite simply, no other organization like his Ministry of Caring. His 32 full-time facilities address every need of an individual or family who finds themselves homeless, destitute and/or in transition. He clothes, he shelters, he feeds, he takes care of children, he helps develop skills, he finds jobs, he provides medical care, he cares. He teaches those who need his assistance all the things they must do to be self-sufficient. And for those who seek to provide real change, he exemplifies just what it takes to make real differences in one life. 
   Still, it does not stop there. Brother Ronald understands that while he feeds someone in the Emmanuel Dining Room, someone else is starving in Sudan. Consequently, his work and Ministry extend far beyond American borders and into the lives of people throughout the world. Few people could have such grand vision and still focus so directly on those suffering in their own hometown. Such is the case with Brother Ronald. 
   Though I could say much more about this outstanding American, I will add only this. In the words of my hero, my dad, Joseph R. Biden, Sr., ``it is a lucky man that wakes up each morning, puts his feet on the floor, goes to work and believes that it matters.'' Even luckier is the man that does these things, and inspires everyone around him to believe the same. Happy 50th Birthday, Brother Ronald.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, three years ago I joined with my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator HATCH, to introduce the ``Hatch-Biden Methamphetamine Control Act'' to address the growing threat of methamphetamine use in our country before it was too late. 
   Our failure to foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one of the most significant public policy mistakes in recent history. We were determined not to repeat that mistake with methamphetamine. 
   That 1996 Act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of the methamphetamine epidemic--increased penalties for possessing and trafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor chemicals and equipment used to manufacture the drug; tighter reporting requirements and restrictions on the legitimate sales of products containing precursor chemicals to prevent their diversion; increased reporting requirements for firms that sell those products by mail; and enhanced prison sentences for meth manufacturers who endanger the life of any individual or endanger the environment while making this drug. We also created a national working group of law enforcement and public health officials to monitor any growth in the methamphetamine epidemic. 
   I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic significantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive drug. 
   The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999--which I have cosponsored--builds on the 1996 Act. First and foremost, it closes the ``amphetamine loophole'' in current law by making the penalties for manufacturing, distribution, importing and exporting amphetamine the same as those for meth. After all, the two drugs differ by only one chemical and are sold interchangeably on the street. If users can't tell the difference between the two substances, there is no reason why the penalties should be different. 
   The amendment also addresses the growing problem of meth labs by establishing penalties for manufacturing the drug with an enhanced penalty for those who would put a child's life at risk in the process. We provide the Drug Enforcement Administration with much needed funding to clean up clandestine labs after they are seized as well as to train state local law enforcement officers to handle the hazardous wastes produced in the meth labs and certify them to train their colleagues. 
   Methamphetamine is made from an array of hazardous substances--battery acid, lye, ammonia gas, hydrochloric acid, just to name a few--that produce toxic fumes and often lead to fires or explosions when mixed. I am revealing nothing by naming some of these chemical ingredients. Anyone with access to the Internet can download a detailed meth recipe with a few simple keystrokes. Our legislation would make such postings illegal. 
   We provide money for the Drug Enforcement Administration to clean up these toxic sites and certify state and local officials to handle the hazardous byproducts at the lab sites. We provide funds for additional law enforcement personnel--including agents, investigators, prosecutors, lab technicians, chemists, investigative assistants and drug prevention specialists in High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas where meth is a problem. 
   We also provide funds for new agents to assist State and local law enforcement in small- and mid-sized communities in all phases of drug investigations and assist state and local law enforcement in rural areas. 
   Further, the legislation provides much needed money for prevention, treatment and research, including clinical trials. It asks the Institute of Medicine to issue a report on the status of pharmacotherapies for treatment of amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction. 
   I understand that the scientists at the National Institute on Drug Abuse are making headway in isolating amino acids and developing medications to deal with meth overdose and addiction. 
   We also have a provision that would allow certain doctors to dispense Schedule III, IV and V drugs from their offices to treat addiction. I am glad to see this provision included. Ten years ago, I asked the question: ``If drug abuse is an epidemic, are we doing  enough to find a medical `cure'?'' Unfortunately that question is still with us. But today we also have another question: ``Are we doing enough to get the `cures' we have to those who need them?'' We have an enormous ``treatment gap'' in this country. Less than half of the estimated 4.4 to 5.3 million people who need drug treatment are receiving it. Licensing qualified doctors to prescribe certain pharmacotherapies from their offices is a significant step toward bridging the treatment gap. 
   Also to that end, this bill authorizes $10 million for treatment of methamphetamine addiction. 
   The bill also tightens the restrictions on direct and indirect advertising of illegal drug paraphernalia and Schedule I drugs. Under this legislation, it would be illegal for on-line magazines and other websites to post advertisements for such illegal material or provide ``links'' to websites that do. We crafted this language carefully so that we restrict the sale of drug paraphernalia without restricting the First Amendment. 
   All in all, I believe that this is a comprehensive bill that attacks the methamphetamine and amphetamine problem from every angle. 
   Today the Senate also passed the ``Date Rape Drug Control Act of 1999,'' a very important piece of legislation which will place the most stringent controls on GHB, a drug which is being used with increasing frequency to commit rape. I commend Senator ABRAHAM for his efforts to get this bill passed and I thank him for acknowledging my efforts as well. 
   For nearly five years now, I have been working to raise awareness about date rape drugs including rohypnol and ketamine. 
   In 1996, I first introduced legislation to schedule these drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. This was not a step I took lightly because there is a regulatory procedure in place for scheduling controlled substances. But my view was that the regulatory process would take years to do what needed to be done in months, forfeiting valuable time in the fight to stop these drugs from being used to commit heinous crimes. 
   Federal scheduling is important for three simple reasons. First, federal scheduling triggers increased state drug law penalties. This is because state law penalties are linked to the level at which a drug appears on the federal controlled substance schedule. Since more than 95 percent of all drug cases are prosecuted at the state level, not by the federal government, federal scheduling is vitally important. 
   Second, federal scheduling triggers tough federal penalties. 
   And third, scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to reschedule Quaaludes from Schedule II to Schedule I, Congress passed the law and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. Again in 1990, I worked to re-classify steroids as a Schedule III substance, Congress passed the law and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was reversed. 
   Progress on scheduling date rape drugs has been slow. This past August--four years after I first called for stricter regulations--the Drug Enforcement Administration finally classified ketamine as a Schedule III drug. 
   Rohypnol has yet to be classified as a Schedule I drug, though we have passed legislation that stipulates that it is subject to federal penalties. Far from perfect, but it is a small step in the right direction. 
   In 1996, we passed legislation to crack down on those who commit violent crimes--including rape--by giving the victim a controlled substance without that person's knowledge. 
   As a result of that legislation, this cowardly act is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. 
   And today the Senate passed legislation that recognizes that GHB is a significant public safety hazard and will result in the drug being designated as a Schedule I substance. At the same time, the legislation recognizes that there is a public health interest here. GHB is currently being studied as a treatment for narcolepsy and this bill goes to great lengths to ensure that this research can continue without undue burdens. 
   Further, the ``Date Rape Drug Control Act'' requires the Attorney General to assist in the development of forensic tests to help law enforcement detect GHB and related substances and develop training materials on date rape drugs for police officers. The bill also calls for a national awareness campaign to warn people about the danger of these drugs. 
   Recently, these date rape drugs have been used in my State of Delaware. Several women at ``The Big Kahuna,'' the largest nightclub in Wilmington have had drugs slipped into their drinks. 
   This is a serious problem and we must take bold steps, like passing the measure we passed today, to establish strict penalties for this cowardly crime. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has passed both of these important pieces of legislation today and I hope to see them enacted into law.

In 1996, I first introduced legislation to schedule these drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. This was not a step I took lightly because there is a regulatory procedure in place for scheduling controlled substances. But my view was that the regulatory process would take years to do what needed to be done in months, forfeiting valuable time in the fight to stop these drugs from being used to commit heinous crimes. Federal scheduling is important for three simple reasons. First, Federal scheduling triggers increased state drug law penalties. This is because state law penalties are linked to the level at which a drug appears on the Federal controlled substance schedule. Since more than 95 per cent of all drug cases are prosecuted at the state level, not by the Federal government, federal scheduling is vitally important. 
   Second, Federal scheduling triggers tough federal penalties. 
   And third, scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to reschedule Quaaludes from Schedule II to Schedule I, Congress passed the law and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. Again in 1990, I worked to reclassify steroids as a Schedule III substance, Congress passed the law and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was reversed. 
   Progress on scheduling date rape drugs has been slow. This past August--4 years after I first called for stricter regulations--the Drug Enforcement Administration finally classified ketamine as a Schedule III drug. Rohypnol has yet to be classified as a Schedule I drug, though we have passed legislation that stipulates that it is subject to federal penalties. Far from perfect, but it is a small step in the right direction. 
   In 1996, we passed legislation to crack down on those who commit violent crimes--including rape--by giving the victim a controlled substance without that person's knowledge. As a result of that legislation, this cowardly act is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. And today the Senate passed legislation that recognizes that GHB is a significant public safety hazard and will result in the drug being designated as a Schedule I substance. At the same time, the legislation recognizes that there is a public health interest here. GHB is currently being studied as a treatment for narcolepsy and this bill goes to great lengths to ensure that this research can continue without undue burdens. 
   Further, the Date Rape Drug Control Act requires the Attorney General to assist in the development of forensic tests to help law enforcement detect GHB and related substances and develop training materials on date rape drugs for police officers. The bill also calls for a national awareness campaign to warn people about the danger of these drugs. Recently, these date rape drugs have been used in my State of Delaware. Several women at ``The Big Kahuna,'' the largest nightclub in Wilmington have had drugs slipped into their drinks. This is a serious problem and we must take bold steps, like passing the measure we passed today, to establish strict penalties for this cowardly crime. I am pleased that the Senate has passed both of these important pieces of legislation today and I hope to see them enacted into law.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Conference Report before the Senate contains the State Department authorization bill. 
   With enactment of this legislation, we will finally--after three years of effort--approve critical legislation to authorize the payment of nearly $1 billion in back dues to the United Nations. Enactment of this legislation will serve, I believe, three important purposes. It should finally end the long-festering feud between the U.N. and Washington about our unpaid back dues; it should bring much-needed reforms to the world body so that it can more effectively perform its missions; and it should, I hope, end the debate about the utility of the U.N., and restore bipartisan support in Congress for the U.N. system. 
   The agreement before us will allow us to pay $926 million in arrears to the United Nations contingent upon the U.N. achieving specific reform conditions, or ``benchmarks,'' to borrow the Chairman's expression. 
   The first set of these conditions can be readily certified--thereby releasing $100 million immediately. The second and third set of conditions will be difficult to achieve. But I have great confidence in our ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke. And I believe that with the money on the table--that is, with the assurance that the U.S. payment will be available--the reforms will be easier to obtain then they might otherwise be. 
   The State Department authorization bill contains several other important provisions which I would like to highlight briefly. 
   First, the bill authorizes $4.5 billion in funding over the next five years for construction of secure embassies overseas. The tragic embassy bombings in East Africa in August 1998 underscored the current vulnerability of our embassies to terrorist attack. Simply stated, the large majority of our embassies around the world do not meet current security standards. Thousands of U.S. government employees--both Americans and foreign nationals--are at risk, and we must do all that we can to protect them. In addition to authorizing funding, this bill codifies many important security standards, including the  requirement of that embassies be set back 100 feet from the street, and the requirement that all agencies be co-located in the embassy compound. 
   All this is important. But what is essential is that we provide the actual funding. So far, aside from last fall's emergency appropriations bill, funding for embassy security has fallen far short of need. The President requested $3 billion in advance appropriations in his budget request, which was rejected by the Appropriations Committees. We must give our attention to funding this priority matter next year. 
   Second, the bill provides for the establishment of a Bureau of Verification and Compliance in the Department of State to monitor arms control and non-proliferation agreements. In his plan for the integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department, the President proposed that the functions of verification and compliance be handled by a ``Special Adviser'' to the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. 
   We think the Administration's proposal is ill-advised. Given the way the State Department operates--where key policy battles are waged among bureaus at the Assistant Secretary level --this ``adviser'' would be a weak bureaucratic actor, and the function of assuring compliance with arms control treaties and non-proliferation regimes would thereby be unacceptably diminished. Therefore, the conference report includes a provision which requires that this important duty be handled by an Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance. 
   Third, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia (RFA) for another ten years. RFA, which was established in 1994 pursuant to legislation I introduced, broadcasts news and information to the People's Republic of China and other non-democratic states in East Asia. I am pleased that Congress has given its further stamp of approval to this important instrument of American foreign policy. 
   It is fitting that this bill is named for two devoted public servants who were deeply involved in the development of foreign policy legislation for the last two decades--James Nance and Meg Donovan. 
   Admiral James W. Nance, known to everyone as ``Bud'', served as staff director of the Committee on Foreign Relations for most of the 1990s, working with his long-time friend, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator HELMS. Admiral Nance was a steady hand in guiding the Committee staff for so many years, and was integral to the initial development of the ``Helms-Biden'' legislation in 1997. 
   Meg Donovan was long-time staffer for our House counterpart committee, serving under Chairman Dante Fascell. After Chairman Fascell retired, Meg worked closely with the Foreign Relations Committee on behalf of Secretary Christopher, and then Secretary Albright, as a senior deputy in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Meg's advice and counsel was important on dozens of occasions--not only to senior State Department officials but also to our committee. 
   Bud Nance and Meg Donovan were both deeply committed to a bipartisan foreign policy. They were both taken from us too soon. It is therefore in tribute to them that we have named this bill--which represents an important act of bipartisanship--in their honor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is voting on the nomination of our friend and former colleague Carol Moseley-Braun to be U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, as well as Ambassador to Samoa. 
   I am confident that Senator Moseley-Braun will be an excellent ambassador. She has all the requisite skills--political savvy, personal charm, and street smarts--to represent the United States in the finest tradition of American diplomacy. 
   I would like to make a few comments about the remarks made yesterday by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the senior senator from North Carolina. 
   During yesterday's session, the chairman spoke on the floor about this nomination. While he essentially conceded that Senator Moseley-Braun will be confirmed by the Senate, he proceeded to make several arguments which I believe deserve a response. 
   First, the chairman stated that there had been a ``successful coverup'' of serious ethical wrongdoing. I believe such a loaded accusation should be supported by facts, yet the chairman offered not a shred of evidence that anyone has covered up anything. 
   On the contrary, during the consideration of the nomination, the Committee on Foreign Relations was provided with several thousand pages of documents requested by the Chairman, documents which were produced in a very short period of time. Included in these materials were several internal memoranda from the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service; Committee staff members were even permitted to read the decision memos related to the IRS request to empanel a grand jury. 
   Second, the chairman suggested that Senator Moseley-Braun has ``been hiding behind Mr. Kgosie Matthews,'' her former fianc&#233;, who, the chairman charged, is now ``conveniently a missing man.'' Mr. Matthews, it should be emphasized, is Senator Moseley-Braun's former fianc&#233;, and it is ludicrous to suggest that she is somehow responsible for his whereabouts or actions. 
   Third, the chairman suggested that the request of the Internal Revenue Service for a grand jury to investigate the Senator was blocked by political appointees in the Justice Department, ``no doubt on instructions from the White House'' and that it was somehow odd that the request was blocked. 
   Here are the facts: in 1995 and 1996, the Chicago field office of the Internal Revenue Service sought authorization to empanel a grand jury to investigate allegations that Senator Moseley-Braun committed criminal violations of the tax code by converting campaign funds to personal use (which, if true, would be reportable personal income). The IRS request was based almost exclusively on media accounts and some FEC documents. When the first request was made in 1995, the Department of Justice urged the IRS to do more investigative work to corroborate the information that was alleged in the media accounts. Justice invited the IRS to resubmit the request. 
   The IRS resubmitted the request in early 1996; but it had not added any significant information to the request. In other words, it did not provide the corroborative information that the Justice Department had requested. 
   The decision to deny the request for authorization of the grand jury was made in the Tax Division, after consultation with senior officials in the Public Integrity Section. 
   Although it is not that common for grand jury requests to be refused, the Department of Justice is hardly a rubber stamp--for the IRS or anyone other agency. It is guided by the standard of the United States Attorneys' Manual, which requires that there be ``articulable facts supporting a reasonable belief that a tax crime is being or has been committed.'' (U.S. Attorneys' Manual, 6-4.211B). The committee staff was permitted to review, but not retain, the internal memos in the Tax Division rejecting the IRS request. From the trial attorney up to the Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division--four levels of review--all agreed that there was not a sufficient predicate of information that justified opening a grand jury investigation. In short, there were not the ``articulable facts'' necessary for empaneling the grand jury. 
   There is no evidence--none--that this decision was influenced by political considerations or outside forces. 
   Last year, when the story became public that Senator Moseley-Braun had been investigated by the IRS--and that the requests for a grand jury had been denied--the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Department of Justice opened its own inquiry. They investigated not Sen. Moseley-Braun, but  the handling of the case within the Department of Justice. Their inquiry concluded that there was no improper political influence on the process. So, far from the ``Clinton White House blocking the grand jury,'' all the proper procedures were followed, and there is no evidence of White House intervention in the case. Equally important, the Office of Professional Responsibility review concluded that the decision on the merits was appropriate. 
   Next, the chairman suggested that the decision to reject the grand jury request was somehow tainted because the senior official at the Justice Department who made the decision, Loretta Argrett, ``was a Moseley-Braun supporter, who had made a modest contribution'' to Senator Moseley-Braun's campaign, ``who had a picture of Ms. Moseley-Braun on her office wall'' and that the Senator had ``even presided over Ms. Argrett's confirmation in 1993.'' 
   Here are the facts: Ms. Argrett, the Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division, was the senior official at Justice who approved the decision not to authorize the grand jury request. It is true that Ms. Argrett gave money to the Senator's campaign: the grand sum of $25. It is also true that the Senator chaired Ms. Argrett's hearing, a hearing at which several other nominees also testified. I chaired the Judiciary Committee at that time. I routinely asked other members of the Committee to chair nomination hearings, just as Senator THOMAS chaired last week's hearing on Senator Moseley-Braun. Finally, it is also true that Ms. Argrett had a photograph of her and the Senator hanging in her office--a photo taken at that confirmation hearing. 
   All of these facts were disclosed to the Deputy Attorney General at the time, Jamie Gorelick, for a determination as to whether Ms. Argrett should be involved in the case. On June 2, 1995, Assistant Attorney General Argrett disclosed these facts to the Deputy Attorney General and concluded that, based on the minimal contact she had with the Senator, she believed she could act impartially in this case. Deputy Attorney General Gorelick --one of the most capable public officials I have known in my years in the Senate--approved Ms. Argrett's continued participation in the case. 
   Mr. President, I will not delay the Senate any further. The Committee did its job and gathered the available evidence. There is no evidence in the record that disqualifies Senator Moseley-Braun. 
   She will be an excellent ambassador, just as she was an excellent senator. We are lucky that she still wants to continue in public service. I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, under the present law there are nondischargeable items with cash advances. It is a little over $1,000. This goes down to $750. There is a difference, but it is not what the Senator from Connecticut makes it out to be. 
   No. 2, in the means test in terms of ``other necessary expenses,'' it includes such expenses as charitable contributions, child care, dependent care, health care, payroll deductions--that is taxes, union dues, and life insurance. It is not true they are not able to be viewed as ``other expenses'' to be considered within bankruptcy. 
   I understand the Senator's point. I think he doth protest too loudly. It is not $1,000; it is $750. That is true. It is a $250 difference. That is what we are arguing about. 
   I have no more time, so I yield the floor.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases Act of 1999. This legislation, which is very similar to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Waxman, would create an Office of Autoimmune Diseases as part of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health. I would like to outline briefly why I feel that this office and this legislation are needed. 
   To understand autoimmune diseases, it is first necessary to talk about the body's immune system. The immune system is a collection of tissues which is designed to fend off any foreign invaders into our body. For example, we live in a world surrounded by microbes of various kinds, many of which would be harmful to us if they could set up shop in our bodies. However, the immune system recognizes that a foreign microbe has entered our body and it mobilizes a variety of defenses to expel this foreign invader. 
   The critical importance of the immune system can be easily seen when something goes wrong with it. For example, when a baby is born with a major defect in its immune system, it is extremely vulnerable to attacks by bacteria that a healthy baby would be able to fight off. Such immune-deficient babies need to be protected from their environment in order to preserve their lives. You may have seen the TV programs about such ``bubble babies'', who have to spend their entire lives in a protective plastic bubble or a spacesuit. 
   However, although the immune system is essential for human life, it sometimes can cause problems with our health. When someone gets a kidney transplant, for example, it is the immune system which tries to fight off this ``foreign invader'', a process called rejection. The survival of the transplant requires that the recipient be  given treatment in order to suppress the immune system. 
   Occasionally, the body's immune system goes haywire and starts to attack the body's own tissues as if they were foreign invaders. This process is called autoimmunity, and diseases in which autoimmunity is thought to play an important role are called autoimmune diseases. The spectrum of human illnesses for which there is evidence of an autoimmune component is extremely broad, ranging from lupus to diabetes to multiple sclerosis. At the National Institutes of Health, these different diseases are often studied in completely different institutes: diabetes in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; lupus in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; multiple sclerosis in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and so forth. 
   Despite being studied in different locations, these diseases all have one thing in common: abnormalities of the immune system that lead to an autoimmune process in which the body actually attacks itself. It is vital that researchers on one autoimmune disease understand what research advances are being made on other autoimmune diseases; the key to understanding the autoimmune process in multiple sclerosis might very well be uncovered by a researcher working on autoimmunity in diabetes. 
   This is where the need for an NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases arises. Its purpose is to make sure that there is cooperation and coordination across scientific disciplines for all those working on the broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases. Researchers working on autoimmunity in one narrowly defined disease must be able to benefit from research advances in autoimmune research. The history of medicine is replete with examples where breakthroughs in one area were actually a direct consequence of advances in a completely unrelated field. 
   This bill sets up an Office of Autoimmune Diseases at NIH, along with a broadly representative coordinating committee to assist it. The director of the Office of Autoimmune Diseases will be responsible for setting an agenda for research and education on autoimmune diseases, for promoting cooperation and coordination among the disparate entities that are working on autoimmune diseases, for serving as principal advisor to HHS on autoimmune diseases, for husbanding resources for autoimmune disease research, and for producing reports to keep other scientists and the public informed about progress in autoimmune disease research. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to explain why I have a particular interest in the area of autoimmune diseases. A very close friend of mine in Delaware, Ms. Tia McDowell, is fighting valiantly against a chronic disease. At present, the treatments for this disease no longer seem to be working very well, so Tia's hope lies in new research advances. Although doctors are not sure what causes Tia's disease, they do think that autoimmunity plays an important part. For Tia, and for others with diseases where autoimmunity is important, I want to make sure that we are moving ahead with research in the most efficient manner possible, and I think that creation of an NIH Office of Autoimmune Diseases is one way to help this process along.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on August 26, 1999, 13 young women, ages 15 and 16, put the First State on the map again by capturing the Senior League Softball World Series in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
   This was a tremendous accomplishment for Delaware and for the country. The Stanton-Newport team completed an undefeated run through the double elimination tournament by winning a come-from-behind victory over a persistent and well seasoned team from the Philippines. 
   As one reporter put it, eight teams participated in the tournament, but ``only one will have its flag fly over the field for the next year.'' Proudly that will be the flag of the United States of America thanks to the team from the great State of Delaware. 
   The Stanton-Newport team is an outstanding example of the power of youth sports in America. As I have said many times in the past, young people need a hobby they love, at least one adult who supports them and a good many friends with similar interests. Organized sports provides this much and more. 
   In competitive sports young people learn responsibility, discipline, and the importance of cooperation and teamwork on and off the field. Later, these same young individuals will be able to apply their hard-earned lessons to everyday life. 
   The young women of Stanton-Newport epitomize the exceptional athletes and citizens from across the nation who are inspired on a daily basis by their committed parents and coaches. 
   I am proud to call this team a home-grown product and continue to salute their efforts on behalf of the First State and the rest of our nation. They are indeed World Champions.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator GRASSLEY and Senator TORRICELLI, in bringing bankruptcy reform legislation before the Senate today. 
   Senator GRASSLEY is the Senate's acknowledged leader on this issue, in every sense of the word. He has made reform of our bankruptcy code his cause, and he has stayed the course, through the last session of Congress and again this year, to bring us to where we are today. 
   It is evidence of Senator GRASSLEY's commitment that he has reached out to the ranking Democrat on his Subcommittee, Senator TORRICELLI, to join him in that effort. He certainly chose the right man for the job. 
   Senator TORRICELLI has worked with Senator GRASSLEY to bring the kind of balance to the bill before us today that marked last year's Senate floor a bill that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan, 14-to-4 margin. 
   Last year, we brought to the floor a bill that passed the Senate 97 to 1--virtually unanimous agreement that our bankruptcy code needs reform, as well as consensus that reform must be fair. 
   I would like to address both of those points today, Mr. President--the need for reform, and the need for that reform to be balanced and equitable. 
   To a large extent, the numbers speak for themselves--the number of bankruptcy filings has exploded in recent years, reaching a record 1.4 million last year. That's on top of double-digit increases in the number of consumer bankruptcy filings for most of this decade. This record was set in a time of the best economic conditions our country has ever seen--the lowest persistent unemployment and inflation, the highest sustained growth, widespread income gains, and a booming stock market. 
   These are not the conditions that we normally associate with the kind of widespread financial distress that could trigger a wave of bankruptcy filings. 
   This tells me--and a lot of others, as well--that there is something wrong with the way our consumer bankruptcy code operates today. Simply put, too many people are finding it too easy too easy to walk away from their legitimate obligations by filing for bankruptcy. When that happens, somebody else pays the bill. 
   In the past year, a number different studies have looked at just how big that bill can be. These studies have been conducted by all sides in the debate, including the credit industry and the bankruptcy bar. The study conducted by the Department of Justice concluded that American businesses lose $3.2 billion annually to bankruptcies filed by individuals who have the capacity to repay their debts. 
   The size of the bankruptcy problem--both the number of filings and the dead-weight losses to our economy--was the foundation for last year's overwhelming Senate support for reform. 
   The principle behind the reforms we bring to the floor today is simple, Mr. President--if you file for the protection of bankruptcy, one basic question will be asked: do you have the ability to pay some of your bills, or not? 
   If the facts--looking at your income on the one hand, and the bills you have to pay on the other--show that you can pay, then you must file under Chapter 13, that requires a period of at least partial repayment before you are forgiven your remaining debts. Under such a Chapter 13 plan, you are not required to sell off major assets such as your house or your car. 
   If the facts show that you simply don't have the income to under take a Chapter 13 repayment plan, then the protection of Chapter 7 is still there for you. Chapter 7, however, requires that you sell off any significant assets, and the proceeds go to your creditors. 
   Most Americans would agree that this is fair, and would be surprised to find that no test of someone's ability to pay is required to get the protection of Chapter 7. But in fact, as even the strongest opponents of bankruptcy reform admit, today pretty much all the assumptions in the bankruptcy code are in favor of the filers, who can voluntarily choose a Chapter 7 liquidation or a Chapter 13 repayment plan. 
   The bill we bring to the floor today attempts to restore some balance to those assumptions, to require more responsibility on the part of those who seek the protection of bankruptcy. 
   But some of my colleagues will argue during this debate that the source of this problem is not really the operation of our bankruptcy laws, but what they call ``irresponsible'' lending. Creditors--especially the aggressive credit card companies--are pushing debt onto people, and that is what is driving people into bankruptcy. 
   Now, I am sure all of us are tired of those millions--actually billions--of credit card solicitations that come through the mail every year. But I ask my colleagues to reflect for a moment on what the alternative to widely available consumer credit would be. 
   When I first came to the Senate, we were fighting against lending practices that ``red-lined'' whole neighborhoods, Mr. President, in which banks would simply decide that some people were not worthy of credit, that they were incapable of managing their own affairs. A lot of us in Congress saw that as just plain wrong, and we worked to change it. 
   One of the things we did, in 1977, was to pass the Community Reinvestment Act, that requires banks to lend into local communities where incomes may be lower or the risks of repayment higher than bankers might prefer. 
   We just passed an historic overhaul of our country's banking laws. The Financial Services Modernization Act took many years of hard work to complete. Among the most contentious issues was the treatment of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   In fact, President Clinton threatened a veto of that bill if the principles of the Community Reinvestment Act were not protected in the final deal. Those principles boil down to the idea that everyone deserves access to credit, and it is the policy of this country that banks must not unfairly restrict credit, despite what they think is the best way to maximize returns and minimize the risks on their loans. 
   Now, I am not here to argue that the flood of credit card solicitations is part of some new social program by the credit card companies. Of course they are trying to make money. By the way, it is also evidence of a lot of competition in the lending business, as well. But when I hear my colleagues argue about ``irresponsible lending,'' I hear echoes of those earlier debates about red-lining. 
   The ``democratization of credit,'' as some people have called it, has risks, of course. Some people will not use credit responsibly. But the alternative to widely available credit--passing laws to cut back on credit to the kinds of people we here in Washington have decided just can't be trusted to use it wisely--that alternative is far, far, worse, in my view. 
   Should we do more to make sure that consumers are fully informed, and that  lenders disclose the full cost consumers pay for credit? Of course we should, Mr. President. During our Committee deliberations on this bill, we considered proposals by Senator SCHUMER that would have imposed requirements for more complete disclosure, in billing and in advertising, by creditors. 
   Because those issues are under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee, we made the conscious decision to leave those provisions for an amendment here during the floor debate. That amendment will be among the first items of business on this bill. 
   Should we do more to make sure consumers are informed about how to handle debt, and how to avoid the ultimate step of bankruptcy? Of course we should, Mr. President. The bankruptcy reform bill before us today calls for new initiatives in those areas, as well. We look to the causes of bankruptcy as part of a comprehensive approach to reform. 
   But to try to stem the tide of bankruptcies by making credit harder to get, Mr. President, is a cure that will prove to be worse than the disease. 
   I thought one of the most important aspects of last years's Senate debate was how, as we attempt to reduce the number of bankruptcy filings, to still make sure that we continue to provide the full protection from creditors and the fresh start that many Americans will continue to require and deserve. 
   For many of my colleagues, particularly on my side of the aisle, that has been the real focus of the debate over bankruptcy reform, and it should be. 
   I know that many of my colleagues are concerned that the means test in this bill, that determines a bankruptcy filer's ability to pay, will be unfair to those who really need the full protection from creditors and the fresh start that Chapter 7 has historically provided. In fact, however, the means test is intended to ensure that a repayment plan--under Chapter 13--will be required only of those individuals who actually have the documented ability to continue to pay some of their legal obligations. 
   A range of studies from all sides in this debate has found that only 3 to 15 per cent of filers under the current system would be steered from the complete protection of Chapter 7 into Chapter 13, where they will be required to continue payments on--and, I have to stress, retain possession of--their credit purchases. The means test is designed to make sure that these new responsibilities will be required only of those who have the resources to meet them. 
   The managers' amendment that we will bring to the floor will provide additional refinements and safeguards to make sure the means test achieves that goal. 
   Another major concern that has been expressed by my colleagues is that bankruptcy reform will unfairly affect women and children, who may depend on family support payments--alimony, child support--that are all too often part of the picture in the financial and personal distress that can lead to bankruptcy. I want my colleagues to know just how much we have done to protect family support payments--to protect them much more than current law. 
   This bill will give alimony and child support payments the highest possible priority--over credit card companies, over department stores, over all other creditors--when the line forms to collect payments from someone who is in bankruptcy. This bill also requires that all alimony and child support must be paid in full before the final discharge of debts at the end of bankruptcy. These are just two of the significant improvements in the treatment of alimony and child support in this bill, and there are others. 
   The reform of our bankruptcy code is a complicated issue, and in the coming days we will be debating a lot of the thousands of important details that are involved. But if we keep our eye on the big picture--fundamental principles of fairness, responsibility, and effectiveness--I am convinced that this bill will enjoy overwhelming bipartisan support on final passage.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my colleagues for having supported S. Con. Res. 68, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I cosponsored with Senator HELMS, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the so-called Velvet Revolution, whereby the people of Czechoslovakia overthrew the communist dictatorship that had oppressed them for four decades. 
   Since then, Czechoslovakia decided to effect a ``Velvet Divorce.'' Today both successor states, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, are in the process of integrating into the West. The Czech Republic is already a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Slovakia is emerging as a strong candidate for the next round of enlargement. Both countries are busily preparing to qualify for membership in the European Union. 
   Both countries have growing pains associated with the difficult transitions from dictatorship to democracy, and from a command economy to the free market. Both have ongoing challenges to guarantee equal rights for minorities. But the overall picture for the Czech Republic and for the Slovak Republic is bright. 
   I am delighted that the Senate has recognized the accomplishments of the Czechs and the Slovaks and has wished them continued success in the future as partners of the United States. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support, along with the senior Senator from North Carolina and several other colleagues, the Serbia Democratization Act of 1999. 
   Mr. President, the last year has removed any lingering doubt that Slobodan Milosevic, rather than being part of the solution of the problems in the Balkans, is the problem. Milosevic has started, and lost, four wars during this decade: first with Slovenia, then with Croatia, then with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and finally with NATO over Kosovo. I would not be surprised if he were soon to make Montenegro, with its democratic-reformist government, the fifth target of his aggression. 
   Earlier this year, Milosevic was indicted as a war criminal by the International Tribunal at The Hague. As my colleagues have heard me recount, I told Milosevic to his face way back in 1993 in Belgrade that he was a war criminal and should be tried at The Hague. So in one sense I am gratified that he finally has been officially charged. On the other hand, I know that as long as Milosevic remains in power in Serbia and Yugoslavia, there is no chance for lasting peace and reconstruction in the Balkans. 
   In short, Milosevic must be replaced by a democratic government. This is no small order. Serbia is not exactly overflowing with genuine democrats, although there certainly are some. The problem is that many of them squabble among themselves, thereby wasting precious energy that should be devoted to unseating Milosevic. 
   Moreover, Milosevic runs an authoritarian state, ruthlessly suppressing dissent, threatening his opponents--even sometimes attempting to assassinate them, purging the army and police, and cynically dominating the electronic media so as to misinform the Serbian public. 
   Clearly it is in the national interest of the United States to use every legal means to undercut Milosevic and to assist the democratic opposition in Serbia. 
   With that in mind, we have introduced S. 720, the ``Serbia Democratization Act of 1999.'' The following are the major provisions of the legislation. 
   The Act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing one hundred million dollars for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the purpose of promoting democracy and civil society in Serbia and for assisting the Government of Montenegro. It also authorizes increased broadcasting to Yugoslavia by the Voice of America and by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 
   The Act offers assistance to the victims of Serbian oppression by authorizing the President to use authorities in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide humanitarian assistance to individuals living in Kosovo and to refugees currently residing in surrounding countries. 
   The legislation codifies the so-called ``outer wall'' of sanctions against Yugoslavia by multilateral organizations, including international financial institutions. 
   It also authorizes other measures against Yugoslavia, including blocking Yugoslavia's assets in the United States; prohibiting the issuance of visas and admission to the United States; and prohibiting strategic exports to Yugoslavia, loans and investment, and military-to-military cooperation. 
   The legislation also contains miscellaneous provisions, including requiring cooperation by Yugoslavia with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and a sense of the Congress declaration on the ownership and use of diplomatic and consular properties in the United States. 
   Mr. President, a good deal has been written in recent days about possibly easing the sanctions regime against Yugoslavia out of concern for its people. I do not believe that such a move would be in the interest either of the Yugoslav people, or of the United States.  
   A look at the precedent set in the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina is instructive. After the Dayton Accords were signed in late 1995, the Congress passed legislation in which no assistance could be given to the Republika Srpska, which was then ruled by the war criminal Radovan Karadzic and his gangster clique in Pale. Meanwhile the Muslim-Croat Federation could receive assistance. 
   Within two years a majority of the population of the Republika Srpska had observed the modest, but real economic recovery in the Federation and realized the futility of sticking with Karadzic and company. The result was, first the presidency of Mrs. Biljana Plavsic, and later the reformist government of Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, which is still clinging to power in the new capital of Banja Luka. 
   I believe that if we keep up the pressure on the indicted war criminal Milosevic, a similar process will eventually occur in Serbia. Conversely, if we were to loosen the legitimate sanctions on Yugoslavia, it would constitute a stunning triumph for Milosevic. 
   Mr. President, this week a delegation of leaders of the Alliance for Change, an umbrella organization representing more than forty democratic political parties and groups in Serbia, has been visiting Washington. I met with this group. They asked only that we lift sanctions against Serbia after a free and fair election results in Milosevic's fall from power. They are confident of victory in such an election; I hope they are right. 
   It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that we must hold out carrots to the potential democratic successors of Milosevic. Therefore, in a move to facilitate the transition to democracy, the Act authorizes the President to furnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he determines and certifies to the appropriate Congressional committees that the Government of Yugoslavia is ``committed to democratic principles, the rule of law, and is committed to respect internationally recognized human rights.'' 
   The Act also contains a national interest waiver for the President. The President may also waive the Act's provisions if he certifies that ``significant progress has been made in Yugoslavia in establishing a government based on democratic principles and the rule of law, and that respects internationally recognized human rights.'' 
   In the meantime, I approve of our government's political support of a pilot program run by the European Union whereby emergency heating oil shipments are made to two Serbian cities that are governed by opponents of Milosevic. If the project succeeds--that is, if the oil is delivered and Milosevic does not succeed in taking credit for the shipments--the United States might join in financing the program, which would be extended to other cities. 
   With regard to direct, material help to the anti-Milosevic forces, there are many genuine democratic organizations at the grassroots level and in the media in Serbia who could make a measurable difference if they had the means to spread their message. The United States Agency for International Development is already modestly supporting some of these organizations, and it has drawn up a list of additional potential recipients. 
   In addition, through the SEED Act our State Department has recently made funds available through non-governmental organizations in Slovakia--a novel and promising approach. I believe that we can also utilize the democratic government in Romania to assist the democratic opposition in Serbia. 
   I believe the time is ripe for simultaneously maintaining the pressure on the criminal Milosevic regime, and for increasing our material support to the democratic opposition. 
   The Serbia Democratication Act of 1999 does just that, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its adoption. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator ROTH, in introducing a bill that would designate the White Clay Creek and its tributaries in Delaware and Pennsylvania as a unit of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   It has been eight years since I introduced the bill authorizing the study of the White Clay Creek watershed, and thirty years since I began my efforts to protect this unique and valuable region from the over development and urban sprawl that are of increasing concern to all of us. 
   The White Clay Creek watershed is a truly remarkable environment, covering 107 square miles and draining over 69,000 acres in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Centrally located between the densely urbanized regions of New York and Washington, D.C., the White Clay Creek watershed is within a 2 hour drive of eight million people. 
   Its diversity of natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources, as detailed in the National Park Service's Resources and Issues Report in September of 1994, is extraordinary. The watershed is home to a wide variety of plant and animal life, archeological sites dating back to prehistoric times, a bi-state preserve and state park, and a source of drinking water for the region. 
   It became clear, early on, that these resources warranted the federal protection provided under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. With the introduction of my legislation today, we are entering the last major phase of seeing that protection become a reality. 
   Before I begin to speak on the particulars of today's legislation and the study process that got us to this point, I think it is important to note that while there are over 150 National Wild and Scenic Rivers across this nation, the White Clay Creek brings with it two distinctions: Specifically, it will be the first and only Wild and Scenic River in Delaware; and, it is the first and only river to be studied for designation on a watershed basis. 
   The study of the White Clay Creek for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System recently culminated with the release of a National Park Service study report in September of this year. The study process began in 1992, when Congress directed the National Park Service to convene a study task force consisting of state and local governments, community organizations, watershed residents and landowners within the White Clay Creek watershed. 
   As described in the study legislation, the duties of the task force were to evaluate the eligibility and suitability of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries, and to develop a management plan for the preservation and protection of the watershed. Fifteen local governments in Delaware and Pennsylvania participated in the study task force. 
   I stated during hearings on the study legislation, before the Senate Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land  Management in November of 1991, that there was tremendous support for the study and subsequent designation. However, I realized that with the diverse group of individuals, organizations and agencies making up the task force, the possibility for conflict in determining which segments should be designated and what protections afforded them, could be great. 
   What I could not have expected and what I am extremely pleased to report is that the support for protection of the White Clay Creek is so strong, that over 190 miles of the approximately 400 river miles studied in the watershed are being requested for designation today. Clearly, Delawareans and Pennsylvanians alike understand the value of preserving areas as unique as the White Clay Creek. 
   And, the legislation I am introducing will do just that. It directs the National Park Service to incorporate 190.9 miles of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries into its National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Along with the designation, all 15 local governments within the watershed area have unanimously supported, through the passage of resolutions, the ideals and goals of the White Clay Creek Management Plan. The plan, developed by the White Clay Creek Task Force, will ensure long-term protection of the White Clay Creek watershed, emphasizing the importance of local governments working together, which is key in obtaining the federal designation I am seeking today. 
   Designation of the White Clay Creek and its tributaries will bring national attention to the unique cultural, natural and recreational values of the area. It will provide an added level of protection from over development, by requiring an in-depth review by the National Park Service of any proposed project requiring federal permits or federal funding in the affected area. And finally, it elevates the value of the watershed when applying for state, local and federal preservation grants. 
   Of the 69,000 acres in the watershed, 5,000 acres are public lands owned by state and local governments, the rest is privately owned and maintained. There are no federal lands within the watershed and no federal dollars will be used to purchase any land within its boundaries. 
   I believe the protection of the White Clay Creek watershed to be one of the most important environmental initiatives I have undertaken since taking office in 1973, and it is my hope that Congress will act quickly on this bill so it can be preserved not only for us, but also for all the generations to come.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute four Delaware golfers who continue to make the citizens of my State proud. 
   Last June, Margaret Butler, Mary Kaczorowski, Joyce Ruddick and Alice Wooldridge played in and won the  American Cancer Society Golf Championship at Maple Dale Country Club in Dover, Delaware. They then advanced to the Mid-Atlantic Championship at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia and won the Delaware State Title in Division 3. And on December 3rd and 4th, they will be representing Delaware and looking to continue their winning ways at the P.G.A. West in LaQuinta, California. 
   Having talked with members of this foursome on a few occasions, it is clear to me that these women take their golf quite seriously. Together, they embody the spirit of competition and sportsmanship and are fine examples of personal achievement and Delaware pride. But most importantly, these women realize that their participation in this event helps to raise essential funding for cancer research and programs. Millions of Americans suffer from cancer-related illnesses, and events like these give us all hope for finding a cure. 
   While I acknowledge that I may be a bit biased in my viewpoint, I also know a group of champions when I see them. I, among many, believe that talent is often overrated and that character is the true determining factor for any success one has in life. 
   I have seen these women drive a golf ball and I can confidently say that both talent and character reign supreme for this team. It is therefore my pleasure to extend to them my deep expression of thanks for having represented Delaware so well this year and, as they prepare for their biggest challenge to date, to wish them continued success in the National tournament. 
   We in Delaware are very proud of these four women, and we will be rooting for them!

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn in the strongest manner possible the anti-democratic violence that continues in Kosovo. This violence takes many forms, the most widely publicized of which is attacks by ethnic Albanians on Serbs and other minority groups in the province. KFOR and the U.N. Mission must stamp out these attacks immediately. 
   What has received less media attention is the intimidation, and occasional violence, within the ethnic Albanian  community. Recently there were public threats against the lives of two of Kosovo's most respected journalists, Veton Surroi and Baton Haxhiu, editors of the newspaper ``Koha Ditore.'' 
   On my trip to Kosovo eight weeks ago, I met with Mr. Surroi. He had already spoken out against violence against Kosovo's Serbs and was already receiving private threats as a result. Mr. Surroi is a worldly, courageous democrat--exactly the sort of person that Kosovo needs to achieve genuine democracy. 
   During the same trip, I also met with Hashim Thaqi, political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army. I told Mr. Thaqi that he and his forces would have to submit unconditionally to civilian authority and respect the rights of all political parties, ethnic groups, and individuals in Kosovo.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, under the daily 24-hour assault of our highly competitive news media, constantly in search of the latest event and the most readily available personality, it would be easy to confuse leadership with celebrity. However, there are in every community, men and women whose names are rarely found in the headlines and whose faces rarely appear on the television screen, but who nevertheless contribute real leadership day in and day out. 
   In my state of Delaware, one of those invaluable if rarely recognized leaders is Wilmington City Clerk, and Democratic City Chairman, Leo Marshall. A Wilmington native and a lifelong Wilmington resident, Leo Marshall does not often make the morning headlines or the evening broadcast news, but he is easily familiar to many Wilmingtonians because he never joined the migration to the suburbs that drained the energies and economies of many of our older cities--he has lived and served among them for four eventful decades. 
   Leo Marshall is, in many ways, the ``Mr. Wilmington'' of an older and increasingly diverse city he has helped to guide through the social and economic challenges that have marked our urban landscape from the confrontations of the Sixties to, in Wilmington's case, the dawning rebirth of the Nineties. He would be the last to claim major credit for the city's successes; he will tell you that the city has survived and got to its feet again at the hands of a succession of progressive city administrations--but knowledgeable Wilming- tonians will tell you Leo Marshall has built and maintained the strong political structure that has made progress possible in the relatively small city that is nevertheless Delaware's largest and most thoroughly urban community. 
   Like another Democrat prominently in the news today, Leo Marshall first came to public notice with a basketball in his hands, but as a proud product of Wilmington's still highly coherent Polish-American community, he was not willing to stop there. He turned his attention to city government, and the same intelligence and fiercely competitive spirit that had been so evident on the basketball court soon marked him as a leader in the rough-and-tumble of city politics. 
   He was and is a frankly partisan Democrat, and he has made Wilmington a Democratic stronghold in most of our elections; but he has always reserved his most intense partisanship for his city itself. He never loses sight of the city's interests, and he will vigorously defend them against all comers, regardless of party. Those of us who encounter him as Democrats learn quickly, if we expect to enjoy the relationship, that Leo Marshall will almost invariably be found among the most progressive of Democrats when it comes to issues or candidates, local, state or national--but only when he is assured that the city's interests have been taken into constructive consideration. In those cases, he is capable of being a statesman who can help pull a party, a city or a state together; but if  he feels the city is being attacked or neglected, he takes off the frock coat and rolls up his sleeves--and his opponents rarely enjoy the contest that ensues. 
   If it sounds like I am characterizing Leo Marshall as an old-fashioned ``city boss,'' there is some truth to that notion; he came to party leadership out of the tradition of bare-knuckle ward politics that was the hallmark of most American cities of the day. But he has survived and successfully carried his leadership into a far different day because he has proved to be a boss with a difference--in a city significantly and persistently marked by rapid and challenging social and economic changes, he has been able to adapt his outlook, his leadership and his party to one major transition after another to the benefit of both his party and his community. 
   Such adaptable behind-the-scenes party leadership invites a consideration of the current state of our political parties. Much is said these days of how ``entrepreneurial politics'' has reduced our parties to mere shadows of their former selves, and those of us who must regularly place our records and our hopes for the future before the judgment of our constituents are well aware that that analysis comes uncomfortably close to the truth. Replacing party conventions with primary elections, struggling to meet the staggering costs of campaigning and coping with a swollen press corps that dogs our tracks at all seasons has inevitably thrown onto the shoulders of individual candidates much of the burden that historically was borne by the political parties. 
   But we should not let that fact blind us to the continuing contribution our political parties make to our national life. They remain the institutions that embody the political values we place before the voters when we campaign for office. They still provide the structure upon which our whole political system is based. They may not wield the overwhelming political influence they once possessed--and most of us would agree that they should not--but they are not without identity, they are not without purpose, and they are not without continuing value. They deserve our continuing attention, and leaders who maintain them to serve our nation's political life--leaders like Leo Marshall who have adapted those parties to the realities of our day--deserve our thanks and our admiration. 
   Mr. President, the great American humorist Will Rogers was as wise as he was amusing, and never more so than when he said, ``God will look you over, not for medals, diplomas or degrees-- but for scars!'' Wilmington's Leo Marshall need fear no such examination; he bears the honorable scars of many a political battle, all of them acquired in the service of his city and his party, but also on behalf of his state and nation. He does not often make the headlines, but he has made his mark on the history of his community, and that is the truest legacy of leadership.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Congress created drug courts 5 years ago in the 1994 crime law as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with nonviolent offenders in need of drug treatment. Though authorization for this program was repealed just two years later, we wisely continued to fund this program. I am pleased to join with Senator SPECTER today to cosponsor the ``Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1999.'' 
   In just 5 years, drug courts have taken off. There are 412 drug courts currently operating in all 50 States plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and two Federal districts. An additional 280 courts are being planned. 
   Let me tell you why I am such an advocate for these courts. Drug courts are as much about fighting crime as they are about reducing dependence on illegal drugs. 
   Our Nation has about 3.2 million offenders on probation today. They stay on probation for about 2 years. Throughout those 2 years, they are subject to little, if any, supervision. 
   For example, almost 300,000 of these probationers had absolutely no contact with their probation officer in the past month--not in person, not over the phone, not even through the mail--none! 
   Drug Courts fill this ``supervision gap'' with regular drug testing, with the offender actually coming before a judge twice a week, and actually seeing a probation officer or treatment professional three times a week. 
   Nearly 100,000 people have entered drug court programs and the results have been impressive. About 70 percent of the drug court program participants have either stayed in the program or completed it successfully. That is more than twice the retention rate of most traditional treatment programs. 
   The other 30 percent of the participants went to jail. And I think that should be heralded as a success of the drug court program as well. Without drug courts, this 30 percent would have been unsupervised, not monitored, and unless they happened to be unlucky enough to use drugs or commit a crime near a police officer, they would still be on the streets abusing drugs and committing crimes. Drug courts provide the oversight to make sure that does not happen. 
   The Specter-Biden reauthorization bill calls for fully funding drug courts at the level the Attorney General and I called for in the 1994 crime law--- $200 million. Drug courts are effective and cost effective. Let's spend our money wisely and invest in what works. 
   There are a number of jurisdictions that want to open or expand their drug courts but are unable to do so because of lack of treatment capacity. We always talk about devolving power to State and local government. Let's put our money where our mouth is and give these jurisdictions the funds they need. The Specter-Biden reauthorization act includes $75 million a year to expand local treatment capacity so that no community that wants to start or expand a drug court is precluded from doing so due to lack of treatment slots.  
   Make no mistake, participating in the drug court program is not a walk in the park. If you use drugs while in the program, you go to jail. Period. 
   Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial obligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They are also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track. 
   This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found that these courts are effective at taking offenders with little previous treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they provide closer supervision than other community programs to which the offenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are cost-effective. 
   According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least $5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing of the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as important, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals. 
   I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last. Two-thirds of drug court participants are parents of young children. After getting sober through the coerced treatment mandated by the court, many of these individuals are able to be real parents again. More than 500 drug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a sizable victory for society and the budget alike. 
   Let me close by saying I hope the Senate takes up this legislation as soon as possible so we can reauthorize this important, effective program.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator ROTH, Senator LUGAR and other colleagues, a resolution that attempts to clarify the relationship between the European Union's new European Security and Defense Identify, popularly known by its acronym ESDI, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
   Mr. President, as my colleagues will remember, ESDI has been gathering momentum since last December's meeting in St. Malo, France between French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair. It is part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which the EU sees as essential to its development as ``an ever closer union.'' 
   ESDI was discussed in the communique of the April 1999 NATO Washington Summit, and it was elaborated on in the communique of the June 1999 EU Cologne Summit. 
   Let me say up front that I believe that ESDI--if it is developed in proper coordination with NATO--can serve the national interest of the United States by becoming a valuable vehicle for strengthening the European military contribution to NATO. Put another way, ESDI, if handled correctly, can at long last create more equitable burden-sharing between our European NATO allies and the United States. 
   NATO must and will remain the preeminent organization to defend the territory of the North Atlantic area against all external threats, as envisioned in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty of April 4, 1949 and restated  on April 30, 1998 by the United States Senate in its Resolution of Ratification of the enlargement of the Alliance to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. 
   NATO may also, pursuant to Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case basis, engage in other missions when there is consensus among its members that there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO members. These missions have become known as non-Article 5 missions and were also reaffirmed by the Senate in the April 30, 1998 Resolution of Ratification of NATO enlargement. 
   ESDI's field of action should be restricted to those non-Article 5 missions in which NATO as an organization does not wish to involve itself. In practice, Mr. President, this would mean that at some future date if the need for military action arose in non-NATO Europe and the United States did not wish to become involved, the European Union could undertake the effort, utilizing, in part, NATO assets. 
   Mr. President, I believe that such a situation with a rejuvenated European pillar of the alliance could free up forces 
   of this country for possible action elsewhere. 
   Let me emphasize, however, that in order for ESDI to accomplish both the goals of the European Union and of NATO, it must be clearly designed in a way that gives NATO the ``right of first refusal'' on non-Article 5 missions. To repeat--if NATO would not wish to become involved, then the European Union would have the option of leading the mission. 
   In addition, Mr. President, we must be sure that ESDI does not duplicate resources or discriminate against non-EU European NATO members (Norway, Turkey, Iceland, Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary). 
   Mr. President, in my opinion the biggest danger is that ESDI could be constructed as an alternative to NATO for non-Article 5 missions. If this would happen, it could lead to an estrangement of the United States from its European allies. 
   Unfortunately, the June 1999 Cologne EU Summit communique subtly modified the language of the April 1999 Washington NATO Summit communique in the direction of ESDI as an autonomous EU military organ, using NATO assets, without giving NATO this necessary ``right of first refusal'' for non-Article 5 missions. 
   The European Union is currently involved in internal negotiations on a further elaboration of ESDI at the December EU Summit in Helsinki. The Sense of the Senate resolution that we are introducing serves as a clear message to our friends in the European Union that while we recognize their aspirations for a European Security and Defense Identity, it must complement NATO, not be in competition with, or duplicative of it. 
   With that in mind, our Resolution traces the development of ESDI, citing both the Washington NATO Summit and the Cologne EU Summit. It stresses that the Yugoslav air campaign demonstrated the military shortcomings of the European allies and the imbalance with the United States, both of which the allies have pledged to address through the NATO Defense Capabilities Initiative. 
   The Resolution then expresses several items that are the Sense of the Senate. 
   NATO should remain the primary institution for security issues of trans-Atlantic concern; 
   All NATO members should commit to improving their defense capabilities so that the Alliance can project power decisively with equitable burden-sharing; 
   The Defense Capabilities Initiative adopted at the Washington NATO Summit is specifically endorsed; 
   The resolve of the EU to have the capacity for autonomous action where the Alliance as a whole is not engaged is acknowledged; 
   The member states of NATO and the EU should promulgate 
   principles that will strengthen the trans-Atlantic partnership and reinforce unity within NATO. 
   Then, Mr. President, cutting directly to the heart of preventing ESDI's becoming an alternative to NATO for non-Article 5 missions, the Resolution offers the Further Sense of the Senate that ``on matters of trans-Atlantic concern the European Union should make clear that it would undertake an autonomous mission through its European Security and Defense Identity only after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been offered the opportunity to undertake that mission but had referred it to the European Union for action.'' 
   Further, and directly relevant to the issue of more equitable burden-sharing, the Resolution states the Sense of the Senate that ``failure of the European allies of the United States to achieve the goals established through the Defense Capabilities Initiative would weaken support for the Alliance in the United States.'' 
   Addressing the issue of non-discrimination by the EU against non-EU NATO members, the Resolution states the Sense of the Senate that ``the European Union must implement its Cologne Summit decisions concerning its Common Foreign and Security Policy in a manner that will ensure that non-WEU NATO allies, including Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Turkey, and the United States, will not be discriminated against, but will be fully involved when the European Union addresses issues affecting their security interests.'' 
   Finally, the Resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that the EU's implementation of its Cologne Summit decisions should not promote a strategic perspective on trans-Atlantic security issues that conflicts with that promoted by NATO and should not promote unnecessary duplication of the resources and capabilities provided by NATO. 
   Mr. President, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains the cornerstone of our engagement with Europe. The resolution we have introduced makes clear to our partners that we support the European Union's European Security and Defense Identity as long as it is developed in a manner to strengthen NATO, not weaken it. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when we passed the 1994 crime bill and created the COPS Program, there were some skeptics. There were people who thought community policing was nothing more than social work and that the program would not work. 
   Do you remember what I said to the skeptics? I told them that either this program was going to work and we would be geniuses or that it would flop and we would be run out of town. There is an old saying that success has a thousand fathers but failure is an orphan. Now, there are a thousand people all claiming to be the parent of this program simply because it has worked so darn well. 
   In 1994, we set a goal of funding 100,000 police officers by the year 2000. We met that goal last May--months ahead of schedule. As of today, there have been 103,000 officers funded and 55,000 officers deployed to the streets. The COPS Programs is ahead of schedule and under budget. 
   Because of COPS, the concept of community policing has become law enforcement's principal weapon fighting crime. Community policing has redefined the relationship between law enforcement and the public. But, more importantly, it has reduced crime. And that is what we attempted to do. 
   All across the country, from Wilmington to Washington--from Connecticut to California, we are seeing a dramatic decline in crime. Just this week, the FBI released its annual crime statistics which showed that once again, for the seventh year in a row, crime is down. In fact, since 1994, violent crime is down 17.6 percent. And just last year, violent crime was down 6.4 percent nationwide from the year before. But, we can't let that slow us down. 
   And that's why I'm here today. I am proud of our accomplishments, but we cannot become complacent. We have a unique opportunity here. Some people say if crime down, why put more cops on the streets? Well it's simple math: more cops equals less crime. If we know one thing it is this: if a crime is going to be committed and there is a cop on one street corner and not one the other, guess where the crime is going to be committed? Not where the cop is, I would guess. 
   Maybe someday we will reach the point where crime is so low that we don't have to take pro-active steps any longer. But, we are not there yet. Our children and our parents are still at great risk out there and it should not be that way. Nor does it have to be that way. And why more cops on the street, it won't be that way. 
   That is why today, I introduced a bill to continue this program for the next 5 years. It's called ``PROTECTION''--``Providing reliable officers, technology, education, community prosecutors and training in our neighborhoods.'' This bill will put up to 50,000 more officers on the street. 
   It will also allow police officers to be reimbursed for college or graduate school, because we all know that overcoming crime problems requires something more than just more cops. It requires cops who understand the importance of prevention and community relations. The legislation also provides funding for new technology so that law enforcement can purchase high-tech equipment to put them on equal footing with sophisticated criminals. And it provides for funding for community prosecutors--to expand the community policing concept to engage the whole law enforcement community in fighting crime. It has all the things that law enforcement told me that they needed to do their jobs. 
   I am proud to say that this legislation has the support of all the major law enforcement organizations and that 49 of my colleagues have told me that they support this legislation. Forty-five of them will join me today in cosponsoring this legislation--including 5 Republicans. I want to recognize my friends on the other side of the aisle and thank them for listening to their constituents, their mayors and their police chiefs who said: We can not do this without your help. 
   I hope that even more will join us today. I ask the rest of my colleagues--there are 50 more of you--will you be with us on this? Will you listen to everyone who is asking for help? Will you listen to your police chiefs and your mayors? Will you stand up and be counted among those who say enough is enough--and I'm going to do something about crime? I'm going to put more police officers on the street. I'm going to support the most effective law enforcement program of our time.  
   I hope that we can put politics aside on this one and all join forces to support the folks who do so much for us each and every day. The people who put their safety on the line so that we may be more secure. It is then, that I will know that we have all put our Nation's interest first.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on why I will vote against the motion to proceed to S. 1692, the Partial-Birth Abortion bill. I support this legislation. I have voted for passage of this bill in the past, and I have twice voted to override the President's veto. I think we should take up this bill in the Senate, and I am quite certain we will get to it. Yesterday, in fact, we offered to move to this bill by unanimous agreement and, had that been accepted, we would be on it now. 
   The problem with this procedural tactic of having a recorded vote on this motion is that it ends the Senate's work on campaign finance reform, and we are not finished with that bill yet. We started debating campaign finance reform last week, and we have a chance to make some genuine improvements in American politics. We should finish what we have started.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for this country's teaching hospitals. 
   These institutions provide the critical experiences of internship and residency by which raw medical school graduates, who have learned the science of medicine, are converted into seasoned physicians who have learned the art and practice of medicine. We are all going to face illness at one time or another in our lives, and we want to make sure that there will be well-educated, conscientious, and compassionate physicians to care for us during those periods. The critical role of the teaching hospitals in molding the doctors of the future cannot be overestimated. 
   These teaching hospitals also serve as key participants in the medical research advances from which we all benefit enormously. We tend to forget that medicine is a relatively young science. Antibiotics, which we all take for granted, have been in use for only about 50 years. Heart bypass surgery and kidney transplants, procedures so commonplace that we hardly give them a second thought, were virtually unheard of 40 years ago. These and other medical advances have led to a tremendous increase in life expectancy in this country over the past 100 years. Yet all of these innovations would have been virtually impossible without the ongoing participation of teaching hospitals in programs of medical research and development. 
   Finally, these teaching hospitals provide a tremendous service to our communities. For many of the most vulnerable among us, the teaching hospitals represent their major, and often only, source of medical care. The homeless, the indigent, the elderly, the new arrivals to our country: for many in these groups, there would be no medical care at all if not for the care provided by the teaching hospitals, such as Christiana Care in my home state of Delaware. 
   So we should all agree that teaching hospitals are an absolutely essential resource for our society; we don't want to go back to 19th century medicine, we want to move ahead to 21st century medicine. 
   But there is a problem: the teaching hospitals' financial underpinning has become very precarious, and a number of the most reknowned teaching hospitals in this country are now losing money each year. We have come somewhat late to the unsurprising realization that the time and resources which the teaching hospitals devote to the education of future physicians, the research we need for better and healthier lives, and the care of the indigent and working poor, costs a lot of money. 
   These costs are going up every year for our teaching hospitals: new technology costs money, dedicated employees must be paid a living wage, and so forth. But the income of teaching hospitals is not coming close to matching these cost increases. Health insurance companies are reducing their payments to health care providers, including teaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals, with their obligatory high costs, are not able to compete financially for contracts to take care of HMO patients. A significant percentage of teaching hospital costs has been paid in the past by Medicare, but as Medicare finds itself facing future insolvency, its payment to teaching hospitals for training interns and residents has also declined. We in Congress contributed to the decline in teaching hospitals' income with several provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, particularly the reductions in payments for indirect medical education and disproportionate share hospitals. 
   Everybody who gets health care in this country benefits from the work of teaching hospitals, but in the face of the financial straits that have overwhelmed our health care system, nobody wants to pay for them. 
   Mr. President, it is absolutely essential that this country's teaching hospitals remain vital and viable. Medicare may no longer be in a position to continue paying a disproportionately large share of teaching hospital expenses. In the long run, we must carefully reevaluate the funding mechanism for teaching hospitals to ensure their stability; if we all benefit from them, then perhaps we should all pay part of their costs. 
   These long-term changes are important, but we in the Senate must also be concerned about the here and now. Teaching hospitals that are currently losing money may not be able to wait for the ``long run''; they need help in the next few months. Senator DASCHLE has just introduced the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act, which contains provisions that would benefit the teaching hospitals and their patients, and I understand that the Senate Finance Committee is currently working on proposals to address some unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, including those that have impacted on teaching hospitals. 
   But time is of the essence, and the key word is urgency. Next year may be too late. The Senate is working furiously to pass the necessary appropriations bills in the few legislative days we have remaining this session, but I implore my colleagues not to move to adjournment until we take action to make sure that the teaching hospitals will still be around next session. The teaching hospitals spend 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, working to make sure we live long and healthy lives, and it's time for us to return the favor. If we don't have enough time this session to complete the necessary major surgery on the payment system for teaching hospitals, the least we can do is set aside the few hours or days it would take to administer a little life-saving financial CPR.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have spoken to our leader. I am going to close the debate on our side. I will use any time up to the amount of time that I have available. 
   My friend from North Carolina knows--I guess when people listen to us on the air they must wonder. We go through this, ``my friend from North Carolina'' and ``distinguished Senator from.'' I imagine people, especially kids or youngsters in high school and college, must look at us and say: What are they talking about, unless they understand the need for good manners in a place where there are such strong differences, where we have such deep-seated differences on some issues, where I must tell you--and I am not being melodramatic--my heart aches because we are about to vote down this treaty. I truly think, I honestly believe that, in the 27 years I have been here, this is the most serious mistake the Senate has ever made--or is about to make. 
   But that does not detract from my respect for the Senator from North  Carolina, who not only is against the treaty, but wants to bring it up now, now, and vote it down. So I think it is important for the American people to understand. We have deep differences on this floor. In other places they have coups and they shoot each other. Because of the traditions of this body and the rules of the Senate, we live to fight another day. 
   My friend knows we came the same year; we came the same date; we came at the same time. I will promise him, and he will not be surprised, I will use every remaining day of this Congress to try to fight him on this issue--even though I am about to lose, we are about to lose, my position is about to lose--to try to bring this back up, try to push it, try to keep it alive. Because as the Parliamentarian pointed out, when you vote this treaty down today, it doesn't die; it goes to sleep. It goes back to bed. It jumps over that marble counter there, back over the desk to the Executive Calendar to be called up again. 
   I warn you all, I am going to be a thorn in your side, not that it matters much, but I am going to keep harping at it. I am going to keep beating up on you; I am going to keep talking about it; I am going to keep at it, keep at it, keep at it. 
   When we started this off, my objective was to get the kind of hearings--I know my friend says we have had hearings--the kind of hearings we have had on other significant treaties--10, 12, 15, 18 days of hearings. The ``sense of the Senate'' amendment that I was prepared to introduce two weeks ago called for Foreign Relations Committee hearings beginning this fall and final action 
   by March 31, 2000. 
   That is what I was looking for because I truly believe that, were the American people and our colleagues able to hash this out in the way we designed this body to work, we would, in fact, find accommodation for all those concerns that 67 Senators might have; not 90, but probably 67, 68--70. I truly believe that. I truly believe that. 
   Instead, we got one quick week of hearings, with the Committee on Foreign Relations holding only one day of hearings dedicated to this treaty, the day after the committee was discharged of its responsibility. 
   That abdication of committee responsibility was perhaps only fitting, as most Republicans appear prepared to force this great country to abdicate its responsibility for world leadership on nuclear non-proliferation. 
   But let me say that in this floor debate, I have attempted at least to answer attacks leveled by treaty opponents. Neither side has been able to delve very deeply, however, given the time constraints and lack of balanced, I think, detailed knowledge on the part of our Senate. 
   For example, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Virginia are both friends. They are World War II vets. They have served a long time and they are among the two most honorable people I know. Senator CHAFEE--I assume he will forgive me for saying this--came up to me and said: JOE, check what I have here. Is this accurate, what I have here? 
   I said what I am about to say: It is absolutely accurate. 
   He said: But it is different from what my friend from Virginia said, Senator WARNER said. 
   I said: I love him, but he is flat wrong. He is flat wrong. 
   I don't think anybody is intentionally misleading anybody. I do think we haven't hashed this out. 
   For example, there is a condition that we have adopted by unanimous consent, part of this resolution of ratification we are about to vote on, the last section of which says:  
   Withdrawal from the treaty: If the President determines that nuclear testing is necessary to assure with a high degree of confidence the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, the President shall consult promptly with the Senate and withdraw from the treaty.  
   He has no choice. He must withdraw. 
   My friend from Virginia characterizes this treaty as having no way out. If, however, the President is told by the National Laboratory Directors, by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, ``We can't guarantee any more, boss,'' he must inform us and he must withdraw. 
   That is an illustration of what I mean. Here are two honorable men, two men of significant experience, asking one another and asking each of their staffs: Which is right? 
   In one sense, it is clear what is right: we haven't had much time to talk about it. We haven't had much time to talk about it. 
   The debating points and counterpoints are too many to summarize in a short statement in the probably 12 minutes I have left. But the themes of this debate are clear and so are the fallacies that underlie the arguments of those who oppose the treaty, at least the arguments made most repeatedly on the floor. 
   The first theme of the treaty opponents is that, while our nuclear weapons stockpile may be--they don't say ``may'', they say ``is''--safe and is reliable today, there is no way to do without nuclear testing forever. 
   That is the first theme that is promoted by the opponents. 
   This argument is based on a fallacy rooted in our nuclear weapons history. The history is that our nuclear testing has supported a trial-and-error approach to correcting deficiencies, rather than rooting our weapons in detailed scientific knowledge of how a nuclear reaction works. 
   The fallacy is that nuclear weapons must be subjected to full-up, ``integrated'' testing. That is a fallacy. The truth is, rarely do we fully test major systems. Rather, we test components or conduct less than full tests of complete systems. 
   As my colleagues know, a truly full test of a nuclear weapon would require that it be tested as a bomb or as a warhead, as it is intended to be, and exploded in the atmosphere. All the experts tell you that. That is the only true, absolute way you know what is going to happen: test it in the atmosphere. 
   As the Presiding Officer knows, we have done without atmospheric testing for 36 years. We accepted the supposedly degraded confidence in our nuclear stockpile that results from this lack of full-blown testing. 
   Why have we accepted that? Because we balanced the benefits of full-up atmospheric testing against its disadvantages, and it was clear that the benefits outweighed the negatives. 
   When listing the benefits, we also noted how well we could assure the systems performance without these full-up tests. When listing the disadvantages, we included cost, risk of collateral damage, environmental risk, radioactive fallout, and the diplomatic or military costs that would have been incurred if we had rejected or withdrawn from the Limited Test-Ban Treaty which was signed in 1963. 
   Similarly today, we have to consider both the benefits and the disadvantages of insisting upon the right to conduct underground nuclear testing. We should include in our calculus the fact that the Resolution of Ratification of this treaty requires the President to withdraw from the treaty if he ``determines that nuclear testing is necessary to assure, with a high degree of confidence, the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.'' 
   Guess what? Every year now, under the law, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense must not only go to the President, but must come to the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Delaware, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and they must tell us, as well as the President, whether they can certify the continued safety and reliability of the stockpile. If they cannot certify, and if we adopt this Resolution of Ratification, the President has to withdraw from the treaty. 
   We will likely differ in our calculations of the balance between advantages and disadvantages of foreswearing underground nuclear testing. But we should all reject the fallacy that there is no substitute for continuing what we did in the past. 
   The second theme that opponents of the treaty keep putting out is that we have to reject this treaty because it is not perfectly verifiable. This argument is based upon a fallacy rooted in slogans and fear. The fear relates to the history of arms control violations by the Russians and the Soviet Union. The slogans are Ronald Reagan's election-year demand: Effective verification. And his later catch phrase: Trust but verify. 
   This body has never demanded perfect verification.  
   Consider the vote we had on the INF Treaty that eliminated land-based intermediate-range missiles. That treaty was signed by President Reagan. President Reagan, the same man who signed the treaty, also coined the phrase ``trust but verify.'' 
   Was the INF Treaty perfectly verifiable? No. Nobody in the world suggested it was perfectly verifiable. Listen to what the Senate Intelligence Committee said before we voted on Ronald Reagan's INF Treaty. They said:  
   Soviet compliance with some of the treaty's provisions will be difficult to monitor. The problem is exemplified by the unresolved controversy between the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies over the number of SS-20s in the Soviet inventory.  
   We did not even know how many SS-20s, intermediate-range missiles, they had. The Intelligence Committee went on to say:  
   Ground-launched cruise missiles pose a particular difficult monitoring problem as they are interchangeable long-range, sea-based launch cruise missiles.  
   Which the INF Treaty did not ban. This was not verifiable. Where were all you guys and women when the Reagan treaty was up here? God love him: Trust but verify. I challenge anyone to come to the floor in the remaining minutes and tell me that the INF Treaty was perfectly verifiable. 
   I love this double standard. You wonder why some of us on this side of the aisle think this is about politics. 
   The fallacy is clear: Nobody really believes in perfect verification. The Senate approved Ronald Reagan's INF Treaty by a vote of 93-5, despite the fact that we knew the INF Treaty was far from verifiable. The legitimate verification questions are how well can we verify compliance and whether our national security will be threatened by any undetected cheating that could occur. 
   I say to my colleagues, we should end the pretense that only a perfectly verifiable treaty is acceptable. The only perfectly verifiable treaty is one that is impossible to be written. 
   Each side in this debate has agreed that the approval or rejection of this treaty could have serious consequences. I suggest that we pay some attention to each side's worst-case scenarios. 
   Opponents of the treaty have warned that a permanent ban on nuclear weapons tests could result in degraded confidence in the U.S. deterrent, perhaps leading other countries to develop their own nuclear weapons. Treaty supporters have warned that rejection of this treaty could lead to a more unstable world in which all countries were freed of any obligation to obey the Test-Ban Treaty. 
   Neither of these worst-case outcomes is very palatable. Any degraded foreign confidence in the U.S. deterrent would be limited, however, either by annual certification of our own high confidence in our nuclear weapons, or by prompt action to fix any problems--including mandatory withdrawal from this treaty if the President determined that testing was necessary. 
   Rejection of this treaty would not greatly increase the speed with which a nuclear test could be conducted, if one were necessary. The nuclear stockpile certification process already forces an annual decision on whether to resume testing, and the treaty would impost only a six-month delay after notice of our intent to withdraw. That means a total lag of 6 to 18 months between discovering a problem and being free to test--roughly what officials say is the minimum time that it takes to mount a serious nuclear weapons test, anyway. 
   By contrast, however, the worst-case scenario of Treaty supporters might not be so limited. As Larry Eagleburger, who served as Secretary of State at the end of the Bush Administration, wrote in Monday's Washington Times:  
   The all-important effort of the United States to stem the spread of nuclear weapons around the world is about to go over a cliff unless saner heads in Washington quickly prevail.  
   Eighty years ago, this body rejected the Treaty of Versailles that ended the First World War. Woodrow Wilson's vision of a League of Nations to keep the peace was turned down by a Senate that did not want to accept such a U.S. responsibility in the world. While that vote was understood to be significant at the time, nobody could foresee that our refusal to take an active role in Europe's affairs would help lead to a Second World War only two decades later. 
   Today, eight years after the Cold War's end, the Senate is 
   presented with a different kind of collective security proposition--an international treaty that can meaningfully reduce the danger that nuclear weapons will spread, a treaty enforced by an army of inspectors and a global system of sensors. 
   We cannot tell what the precise consequences of our actions are going to be this time, but the world will surely watch and wonder if we once again abdicate America's responsibility of world leadership, if we once again allow the world to drift rudderless into the stormy seas of nuclear proliferation. 
   World War II was a time of horror and heroism. A world of nuclear wars will bring unimagined horror and little room for the heroism of our fathers. We all pray that our children and grandchildren will not live in such a world. 
   Will the votes today have such a major, perhaps awful, consequence? We cannot say for sure, but I end by suggesting to all that the chance being taken by those who are worried about our ability to verify compliance and our ability to verify the stockpile is far outweighed by the chance we take in rejecting this treaty and saying to the entire world: We are going to do testing and we do not believe that you can maintain your interests without testing, so have at it. 
   We should all consider that this may be a major turning point in world affairs. If we should reject this treaty, we may later find that ``the road not taken,'' in Robert Frost's famous phrase, was, in fact, the last road back from the nuclear brink. 
   I heard, in closing--the last comment I will make--my friend say: Our allies will lose confidence in us if we ratify this treaty. The fact is, however, that Tony Blair called today and, to paraphrase, said: For God's sake, don't defeat this treaty. He is the Prime Minister of England, our No. 1 ally. 
   The German Chancellor said: Please ratify, in an open letter. The President of France, Jacques Chirac, said: Please ratify. So said our allies. 
   Larry Eagleburger's conclusion is one with which I shall end. His conclusion was:  
   The whole point of the CTBT from the American perspective is get other nations to stop their testing activities and thereby lock-in--in perpetuity--the overwhelming U.S. advantage in weaponry. There is no other way to interpret a vote against this treaty than as a vote in favor of nuclear testing of other nations. It would stand on its head the model of U.S. leadership on nonproliferation matters we have achieved for over 40 years. 
   If the Senate cannot bring itself to do the right thing and approve the treaty, then senators should do the next best thing and pull it off the table.  
   As I used to say in a former profession, I rest my case, but in my former profession, when I rested my case, I assumed I would win. I know I am going to lose here, but I will be back. I will be back. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time, if I have any.

   Mr. BIDEN. I do not wish to be the last to speak. I would like to use that 1 minute and ask unanimous consent that my friend be allowed to use any additional time he may want to use after that, because it is appropriate he should close. 
   I want to make a point in the minute I have. 
   This is about, as the Senator has honestly stated, more than the CTBT Treaty. It is about ending the regime of arms control. That is what this is about. If this fails, I ask you the question: Is there any possibility of amending the ABM Treaty? Is there any possibility of the START II or START III agreements coming into effect with regard to Russia? Is there any possibility of arms control surviving? 
   I think this is about arms control, not just about this treaty. I appreciate my friend's candor. That is one of the reasons I think it is such a devastating vote. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time. And I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from North Carolina be given an appropriate amount of time to respond, if he wishes.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the lifetime achievements of a man with truly a lifetime of achievements. 
   Russell W. Peterson served as Governor of Delaware from 1968-1972, restoring peace on the streets of Delaware's largest city in the wake of the tumultuous 1968 summer riots--as he overcame decades of resistance to implement a sweeping overhaul of State government. Russ Peterson is known to Delawareans as the father of the state's landmark Coastal Zone Act, just as he is renowned nationally as one of our country's leading environmentalists. 
   I will go into more detail of his many accomplishments, however, the reason I pay tribute to him today is for his recognition--not only as a statesman, environmentalist and civil rights leader--but as a grandfather! Delaware's Creative Grandparenting, Inc. has awarded Russell W. Peterson its first-ever ``Lifetime Achievement Award.'' Peterson, a grandfather of 17 and father of four, deserves every accolade bestowed upon him. 
   When Russ Peterson was elected Governor of Delaware in 1968, the National Guard patrolled the streets of Wilmington. As he promised, the day Peterson was sworn in as Governor, the National Guard was pulled from the streets. As a 27-year-old New Castle County Councilman first elected that same year in 1968, I assure you Governor Peterson's leadership and steady stewardship made a lasting impression upon me. I am proud to call him a friend. 
   As Governor, he bucked resistance and reformed Delaware's arcane Commission form of Government into a Cabinet form of government. He convinced the General Assembly to streamline 112 Commissions into ten department leaders. It was nothing short of a revolution! 
   His greatest accomplishment came in June, 1972, when he single-handedly pushed through the landmark Coastal Zone Act, which forever prohibits development along Delaware's precious coastal zone. Yes, he's the man who proclaimed ``to hell with Shell,'' as he fought efforts by oil refineries to further develop on the Delaware River. The Coastal Zone Act shall forever stand as a monument to Russ Peterson in my State. 
   Governor Peterson also signed Delaware's Fair Housing Act into law and appointed the first female to the Delaware bench--Family Court Judge Roxana C. Arsht. And in July, 1972, he signed into law a major revision of the Delaware Code, which is important for what was not included. The Whipping Post! From 1669-1952, more than 1,600 men were flogged at the whipping post. Delaware was the last State to eliminate this barbaric punishment, thanks to Russ Peterson. 
   After leaving office in 1972, Russ served as an advisor to Presidents and held numerous prestigious environmental positions. He was named Vice-Chair of Governor Nelson Rockfeller's National Commission on Critical Choices of America. Then, he chaired President Ford's Council on Environmental Quality. In 1976, Peterson became President of New Directions, a world-wide citizens' lobby group. In 1978, he was tapped to be the director of the congressional Office of Technological Assessment. He secured his worldwide reputation as an environmentalist as the President of the National Audubon Society. 
   Mr. President, I consider myself very fortunate to call him a friend. I am honored that just last week, Governor Peterson took the time to write me a handwritten note to say he was ``proud that you are my Senator.'' That sort of praise from such an accomplished man is humbling. 
   Russ Peterson, my friend, you have a lot of living yet to do and more accomplishments yet to come. Today, though, we honor your lifetime of achievements.

   Mr. BIDEN. In response to my friend from Pennsylvania, I will say that I, obviously, cannot speak for the President. But he has gone awfully far. He says: ``I believe that proceeding to a vote under these circumstances would severely harm the national security of the United States, damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our historic leadership,'' et cetera. ``Accordingly, I request that you postpone consideration of [this] Test Ban Treaty on the Senate floor.'' 
   Unless there is something incredible that is likely to happen in the next 8 months, the President is not going to be--and I realize this is a legitimate worry on the part of some; that the President will wait until the middle of an election year and raise a political issue by forcing people to vote for or against this treaty--but the likelihood of changing the votes of 22 Republican Senators between now and the election is zero, I would respectfully suggest. 
   So what the President has done here is done the only thing I think a chief executive--Democrat or Republican--should do; that is, he did just as Jimmy Carter did when he asked for SALT II to be taken down. He did not make a commitment he would not try to have it brought up. That is not what his letter said. What he said is: Bring it down. Don't vote on it now. It is not in the national interest. 
   To have a President of the United States say, the treaty I, in fact, negotiated--I want to go on record as saying you should not consider it at all during the remainder of my term in office, surely damages his ability to deal internationally. 
   So I think he is observing the reality of the circumstance, which means that there will be no vote next year on the floor of the Senate--for if that were the case, you might as well go ahead and have the vote now. 
   The letter Jimmy Carter sent--and I shall read it--said:  
   In light of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, I request that you delay consideration of the SALT II Treaty on the Senate floor. 
   The purpose of this request is not to withdraw the Treaty from consideration, but to defer the debate so that the Congress and I as President can assess Soviet actions and intentions, and devote our primary attention to the legislative and other measures required to respond to the crisis. 
   As you know, I continue to share your view that the SALT II Treaty is in the national security interest of the United States and the entire world, and that it should be taken up by the Senate as soon as these more urgent issues have been addressed. 
   Sincerely, JIMMY CARTER.   
   This letter of the President of the United States--this President--goes a lot further than President Carter went in pulling down SALT II. But for the President to go beyond that, it seems to me, is to be beyond what we should be asking any executive. 
   The Senator from Virginia has worked mightily to try to resolve this. He has gone so far as to draft a letter which a number of Senators are likely to sign, if they have not already signed, saying: In addition to the President asking this be brought down, we the undersigned Senators ask that it be brought down. And we have no intention of bringing that treaty up next year. We do not think the treaty should be brought up in the election year. 
   To make the President, from an institutional standpoint, guarantee that  he is now against the treaty that he ratified, it seems to me, is to be going beyond institutional good taste.

   My knowledge of Senate procedure pales in comparison to the Senator from North Carolina. I am not being solicitous. That is a statement of fact. But it is my understanding that the only procedural means by which we could move from this treaty to other business without a vote would be if there were a motion to move from the Executive Calendar to the legislative calendar. That would, as I understand it, require 51 votes. That is the only thing of which I know. I do not know if anyone is going to do that.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   I respect the Senator from Maine very much, as I do the Senator from Indiana, who put out the five-page statement on why he opposes the treaty. I want to speak to some of the things that some Senators have spoken to. 
   First of all, the Senator from Maine says we have to deal with the facts as we know them. I hope she will keep that in mind when she votes on missile defense. I hope the rest of my colleagues, who say we have to deal with the facts as we know them, keep that in mind when we vote on missile defense. 
   I find it fascinating some of the very people who push the missile defense and the abandonment of the ABM Treaty--where we have only had basically one successful test, which is a far cry from what we are going to need to be able to develop a missile defense initiative--are the same ones saying: But we can't go ahead with this treaty because we don't know everything. 
   I respectfully suggest the ability of the scientific community to shoot multiple nuclear weapons out of the sky in the stratosphere and make sure not a single one gets through is an even more daunting and challenging program than the Stockpile Stewardship Program. But they seem to have no problem to be ready to abandon the ABM Treaty, which has been the cornerstone, since Nixon was President, for our arms control regime. But they have no faith. I find that fascinating, No. 1. 
   No. 2, I also find it very fascinating that everybody keeps 
   talking about nonverifiability. I have heard more than once this morning--not from the Senator from Maine but from others --the dictum of President Ronald Reagan: Trust, but verify. That is constantly brought up: There is a reason why we can't be for this treaty. We can't verify it. 
   They say this treaty is not perfectly verifiable. That is true. But it is a red herring. This body has never demanded perfect verification. 
   Consider Ronald Reagan's treaty, the INF Treaty, that eliminated land-based intermediate-range missiles. That treaty was signed by President Reagan, the same man who coined the phrase: Trust, but verify. 
   Was the INF Treaty verifiable? Give me a break. No; it was not verifiable. It was not. 
   Listen to what the Senate Intelligence Committee said in response to Ronald Reagan's assertion: Trust, but verify my INF Treaty. The Intelligence Committee said at the time:  
   Soviet compliance with some of the Treaty's provisions will be difficult to monitor. This problem is exemplified by the unresolved controversy between DIA [the Defense Intelligence Agency] and other intelligence agencies over the number of SS-20's in the Soviet inventory. 
   Ground-launched cruise missiles pose a particularly difficult monitoring problem as they are interchangeable with long-range Soviet sea-launched cruise missiles.  
   This the INF Treaty did not ban.  
   We are concerned that the Soviets could covertly extend the range capability of a cruise missile, or covertly develop a new ground-launched cruise missile which prohibited long-range capability..... 
   In an INF/START environment.....the Soviet incentive to cheat could increase because of a greater difficulty in meeting targeting requirements.  
   Still, this Senate and my Republican colleagues--from DICK LUGAR, who  quotes that he fought for the INF Treaty, and others, had no problem saying that was a verifiable treaty. The ability to hide these things in barns, to hide them in haystacks, was greater than the ability of someone to muffle a nuclear explosion. 
   But no, I did not hear anything over on that side. I did not hear anybody saying: No, that's not verifiable. I guess that was a Republican treaty. Maybe this is a Democrat's treaty. Maybe that is how they think about it. 
   But I find this absolutely fascinating. It really--if my staff gives me one more suggestion, I am going to kill them. It says: The INF was approved 93-5. I thought I kind of made that point clear. 
   But at any rate, let me point out what else the Intelligence Committee said about that INF Treaty. It said:  
   Since no verification and monitoring regime can be absolutely perfect--  
   Let me read it again:  
   Since no verification and monitoring regime can be absolutely perfect, a central focus for the Committee--  
   That is the Intelligence Committee--  
   has been to determine whether any possible infractions would be of sufficient military significance to constitute a threat to our national security interests. This calculus is one which the Senate should bear in mind in its consideration of the treaty.  
   The Senate Intelligence Committee was right in 1988, and their standard is right today, even though this is pushed forward by a Democratic President instead of a Republican President. 
   To impose this utterly unrealistic standard of verifiability on Bill Clinton's test ban treaty, when no such standard was imposed on Ronald Reagan's INF Treaty, may be an effective ``gotcha'' in politics, but it clearly does not look to the national interest of the United States. 
   No inspection--no inspection--by the way, for onsite inspections in the INF Treaty, unless it was on prearranged sites. By the way, those of my colleagues who point out that we have to get 30 or 50 votes, our negotiators are pretty smart. We have 30 to 50 votes based on categories. 
   Let me tell you how membership on that committee would be determined. 
   The Executive Council is the decisionmaking body of the Treaty Organization. Among other things, it authorizes on-site inspections. 
   There are 51 seats on the Council, divided geographically. Ten seats are allocated to parties from North America and Western Europe. 
   Of these, the treaty provides that ``at least one-third of the seats allocated to each geographical region shall be filled taking into account political and security interests, by States Parties in that region designated on the basis of the nuclear capabilities relevant to the Treaty. . . . 
   The chief negotiator, Stephen Ledogar, told the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday that ``this is diplomatic language'' that assures that the United States gets a de facto permanent seat on the Council. 
   Moreover, he said that there was an agreement among the Europeans and us that we would always have a seat. 
   Makeup of the Council is: Africa, 10 seats; Eastern Europe, 7 seats; Latin America, 9 seats; Middle East/South Asia, 7 seats; N. America/W. Europe, 10 seats; East Asia/Pacific, 8 seats. 
   There are 2-year terms. 
   A quick review of the candidates for seats that we should expect, in almost all instances, to get all the votes of the West Europe/North America group. So we start with 10. 
   Aside from Yugoslavia, Russia, and one of two others, the Eastern Europe group comprises strong United States allies. So that's another 5-7 votes. 
   Similarily, many of the Latin American states are either: (1) strong allies or (2) strongly favor the test ban. So we should usually get most of those 9 votes. 
   That gets us very quickly to the low-mid-20s, in most instances--even being conservative and assuming that we don't get all the votes in the above 3 groups. 
   That leaves Africa, 10 seats; Middle East/South Asia group, 7 seats; and the East Asia, 8 seats. There is where our work, depending on the makeup of the Council at the particular time, could get a little harder. 
   But even there the rosters have U.S. allies, or proponents of non-proliferation. 
   It is hard to see how we will not get to 30 in most instances. 
   In truth, it is more likely that most U.S. inspection requests, based on our intelligence and the data from the International Monitoring System, will be easily approved. 
   It should also be noted that, unlike the U.N., Israel is a member of a regional group, and will automatically get a seat on the Council under a special rule that guarantees that one seat within each region be filled on a rotational basis. 
   We can get 30 votes. We can get 30 votes any time we want. The reason why is we set up the committees the way we did. The flip side of that is, it will be hard for them to get 30 votes because the fact is that our intelligence community is saying we do not want onsite inspections in the United States. I don't know what treaty these folks are reading. 
   Let me make a second point. Here is the one lately that really gets me: The Soviet Union is going to be able to develop very small tactical nuclear weapons that, in fact, will lead to a different strategy in terms of their conventional defense. Guess what. We should all be standing up on this floor going hooray, we did it, because I remember last time we debated this issue of strategic weapons. What were we saying? 
   I watched, by the way, with great interest Dr. Edward Teller last night. I watched a long documentary because I used to have to debate him around the country on SALT. He was wrong then; he is wrong now. 
   We used to argue that the real concern--I have been here for 27 years--was the Soviets seeking a first strike capability. Remember? The Soviets are seeking a first strike capability. And all of their actions were designed to do that. That is why they were building these new massive SS-18s with 10 nuclear warheads, independently targeted, et cetera, et cetera. Through the leadership of a Republican President, we have an agreement whereby they are going to dismantle those if we get the treaty, the START treaty, passed. So guess what we are worried about now. The exact opposite. We are worried now that they don't have a first strike capability, that they aren't seeking nuclear predominance, but they are acknowledging their conventional forces are so bad they need tactical nuclear defense on their territory. 
   As they say in my church, examine your conscience, folks. Take a look at what this is. We hear this thing, and the public says: Is it true, Joe, they really are developing a new tactical weapon? My response is, it probably is true. But guess what. They now have 10,000 tactical nuclear weapons. 
   I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   They are worried now that they are going to be able to develop another smaller tactical nuclear weapon, as if this treaty has anything to do with that. Come on. Come on. What we should be doing is rejoicing in the fact that the whole emphasis in the Soviet program has shifted to a recognition that they have to defend their homeland--their judgment--and they do not have the conventional forces capable of doing that--their judgment--and so they are developing, allegedly, a very small tactical nuclear weapon--their judgment. Does that shift the strategic balance? Give me a break. Give me a break. 
   I find this one of the most fascinating debates in which I have ever been engaged. I don't know what we are talking about. When my friend from Kentucky stands up and says, I thought we decided against unilateral disarmament, me, too--an are-you-still-beating-your-wife kind of question. Who is talking about unilateral disarmament? Where is that anywhere in this treaty? Where does it say that? Where does it imply that? That is like my standing up and saying: I am very surprised my friends who oppose this treaty want to go to nuclear war; I am very surprised they are advocating nuclear war. That would be equally as unfounded and outrageous a statement as the assertion this treaty is unilateral disarmament. 
   I will repeat this time and again, and I will yield the floor in a moment. My problem is, we have a President of the 
   United States of America who has sent a formal message to the Republican leader asking that a vote on this treaty  be delayed. Apparently, there is a consensus on the other side, thus far at least, not to allow it to be delayed. This is the total politicization of a national security debate. Could anyone have imagined before this came up, if a President of the United States of any party said: This issue, which is of the gravest consequence to the United States of America, I respectfully ask that you delay a vote on it, could anyone have imagined anything other than a response that says: Mr. President, we will concur with the delay, unless it was for stark political reasons? I can't fathom this one. I can't fathom this. I wasn't sure the President should have sent the letter in the first place. 
   If this treaty is defeated and India and Pakistan test, we are going to find ourselves in the ugliest political brawl we have seen in this place since Newt Gingrich left the House. You are going to have Democrats standing up on the floor saying: The reason why India and Pakistan have tested is because the Republicans defeated this treaty and gave a green light. That is not a provable assertion, but mark my words, we are going to hear it. Then the response is going to be even more political. 
   We ought to take a deep breath. My mom always said, when you lose your temper, take a deep breath, count to 10. Not that I have ever lost my temper in my life. You can tell I am not at all passionate about any of these issues. But let us count to 10. The President of the United States has asked this treaty vote be delayed. It seems to me it is common courtesy and totally consistent with national interests to grant that request. 
   I will speak to other aspects of this. Let me conclude by saying two things: One, to move to a very small tactical nuke on the part of the Russians is an absolute outward admission that they lack the capability in their minds for fighting the conventional war. Twenty years ago, we would have paid billions of dollars, if the Russians had come to us--I say to my friend from Massachusetts who knows a great deal about this--we would have been prepared to vote to pay them $10-, $20 billion if they would stop developing intercontinental range missiles that had the capacity to penetrate our airspace and in all probability hit hardened targets here. If they had said to us, we won't do that but we are going to build a very small tactical nuke, we would have paid them to do that. Now we hear on this side, if we pass this treaty, they are going to build tactical nuclear weapons that are very small, smaller than the 10,000 they now have and are able to have and legally can have. That is a very bad thing. That is why we should reject this treaty. So we encourage the Chinese to go from 18 to 800 or 8,000 nuclear weapons that have MIRV capability and are thermonuclear in capacity. That is wonderful reasoning. 
   There are legitimate arguments against this treaty, which I believe do not rise to the level of being against a treaty, but I haven't heard them made this morning, with all due respect. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will take a minute to respond. I understand the point made. We have 6,000 intercontinental ballistic missiles that are on line right now. The Russians have a similar number. After you get by that, the numbers drop off precipitously. China is down in the teens. This unilateral disarmament notion or, as explained by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I understand his point, but what are we doing? Are we going to give up? Are we freezing in place the fact that we stay at 6,000, and if they take the worst case of a stockpile that is in atrophy versus the dozen or more that the Chinese have? 
   I mean, come on. Come on. You know, if you told me the Chinese had 6,000 nuclear weapons, MIRV capability, thermonuclear yield, or if you told me the Koreans and Libyans had that and the Russians had that, then you would have an argument. After the Soviet Union and then our allies, it drops off precipitously into double digits, max--max.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will yield myself 5 minutes. 
   The argument has been made that the United States will not be able to modernize its deterrent arsenal to meet new threats or encounter new technologies under the Strategic Stockpile Stewardship Program, and that is why some of my colleagues are saying we cannot go ahead with this treaty. 
   I want to make it clear, the test ban treaty does not prevent us from adapting most operational characteristics of a nuclear weapons system to changing military missions, should we determine we have to do that. Many important parts of a nuclear weapon can confidently be developed, tested, and integrated into nuclear weapons without any nuclear tests because they do not involve changes in the primary or secondary components of the warhead; that is, the so-called physics package. 
   Dr. Paul Robinson, the Director of the Sandia National Laboratory, told the Armed Services Committee on Thursday night:  
   Adapting deployed nuclear designs to new delivery systems, or even other delivery modes, is not constrained by the elimination of nuclear yield testing.  
   Let me put this in ordinary English. We keep being told here what has happened is, if we sign on to this treaty without this Stockpile Stewardship Program being fully completed, we are going to put ourselves at great disadvantage, amounting to nuclear disarmament; we will not be able to modernize our systems, and our systems are going to atrophy. 
   Dr. Robinson, the Director of Sandia, went on to describe a prominent success in the Stockpile Stewardship Program that is working now. We have nine deployed systems, nine different kinds of nuclear bombs. One of them is the B61 Mod-7 strategic bomb. That was adapted without any nuclear tests. 
   I have a photograph of that I will hold up now. That is a B-1 bomber. That red missile that is being dropped out of the belly of that bomber is a change in the B61 Mod-7 to a B61 Mod-11, in response to a different requirement. 
   What was the different requirement? The military said they needed a nuclear weapon that could destroy targets that were buried very deeply in the ground, and that Mod-7 version of the B61 nuclear warhead could not do that. So without any nuclear test, they tested a new system. It is called the Mod-11. That can penetrate the Earth deeply and destroy deeply buried targets. 
   This picture illustrates an important fact. You can test nearly everything in a nuclear weapon so long as you do not put enough nuclear material in it to cause an uncontrolled chain reaction. We did not set off this bomb, but we did test the bomb. You can take the plutonium out of the bomb, and put uranium in the bomb, and you can test it. It just doesn't set off this uncontrolled chain reaction. So this idea that we cannot change anything in our arsenal if we sign on to this is simply not correct. 
   By the way, the JASON Group, which is the most prestigious group of nuclear scientists in the United States of America, studied this, and they said the Strategic Stockpile Stewardship Program can maintain all of our systems. One particular member of that group, testifying before the committee, Dr. Garwin, points out that we can even exchange entire physics packages; that is the plutonium and that secondary package, that device that explodes it, that blows up. In my visual image of it, the best way to explain it, as I was trying to explain it to my daughter who is a freshman in college, what happens is you get this plutonium, and you have to have something to ignite it, set it off. So there is a secondary explosion that takes place, and it shoots all these rods into this plutonium at incredible speeds. 
   I yield myself 2 more minutes. 
   What happens is it detonates the weapon, this chain reaction starts, and you have a thermonuclear explosion. 
   The question has been raised whether or not, if we figured out that this plutonium was no longer either stable or functional or was not reliable, could you take out of the warhead the thing that makes it go boom, the thing that causes the chain reaction, the thermonuclear explosion, and put a new package in? Dr. Garwin says you sure can do that, without testing, without nuclear tests. 
   This year, the first W-87--that is another warhead--life extension unit was assembled in February for the Air Force at the Y12 plant in Oak Ridge. It met the first production milestone for the W-87 life extension. 
   These are major milestones and successes in the Stockpile Stewardship Program. I might add, as my friend from Massachusetts knows, nobody is suggesting we start to test now--nobody that I am aware of. I should not say nobody. Nobody I am aware of. There may be somebody suggesting it. 
   Preservation of the option of modernizing U.S. nuclear weapons to counter emerging defensive technologies, the phrase you hear, does not require ongoing nuclear testing. The most likely  countermeasures would involve changes to the missile and its reentry system, not to the nuclear explosive. 
   It is a red herring to suggest if we sign on to this treaty, we are locking ourselves into a system that is decaying and moving into atrophy and we are going to find ourselves some day essentially unilaterally disarmed. That is a specious argument.

   Mr. BIDEN. The Senator, as usual, puts his finger on one of the incredible flaws in our opponents' reasoning. They engage in circular reasoning. It goes like this: Without spending money on the Stockpile Stewardship Program, roughly $4.5 billion a year for 10 years, we will not be able to attain, when the shelf life of these weapons is reached 10 years out or more, a degree of certainty that they are reliable and safe. 
   You say: OK, we will fund it; we are for it, and the President sends up that number. 
   Then they say: But we have a problem. Our Republican friends in the House won't vote for that much money, and we had to fight too hard to get it and they probably won't do it next year. The reason why, they go on to say, I am against this, although I think if we funded it, it would work and it would make sense, is my Republican colleagues in the House probably won't fund it; therefore, I can't be for this treaty because you guys are not funding the stockpile. 
   I find that absolutely fascinating, but it is the circular reasoning which is being engaged. It strings together a group of non sequiturs that end up leading to a conclusion that makes no sense. 
   The Senator has been here longer than I. Can he imagine, if we vote this treaty down and other nations begin to test, and those who voted it down are saying, by doing that, we think the United States should be able to test, can you imagine this or future Congresses coming up with $45 billion to perfect a Stockpile Stewardship Program which purpose and design is to avoid nuclear testing, to spend $45 billion for the redundancy? Can the Senator imagine us doing that?

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for his response. I will raise this when we get to the amendments. I wish to point out there is one other ultimate safeguard. The ultimate safeguard is in the amendment, our last provision, which says, if, in fact, we do not fund the stockpile and that causes the laboratory Directors to say, ``We cannot certify,'' and that means the Secretary of Energy says, ``We cannot certify,'' the President of the United States, upon that determination, must withdraw from the treaty and allow us to begin to test. I am amazed at the arguments that are being made on the other side.

   Withdrawal from Treaty.--If the President determines that nuclear testing is necessary--  
   The antecedent to that is the lab Directors say it--  
   to assure, with a high degree of confidence, the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, the President shall consult promptly with the Senate and withdraw from the Treaty pursuant to Article IX (2) of the Treaty in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.  
   It is pretty strong.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, this is another part of the circular reasoning. What I heard this morning on the floor and heard all day on Friday went like this: Without us being able to test, our 6,000 strategic nuclear weapons are going to become unreliable--which is ridiculous in my view. I strike the word ``ridiculous.'' Which is highly unlikely. I am trying to be polite. It is hard. 
   Then they say because it is going to become unreliable, two things are going to happen. One is that our allies are going to conclude that our deterrent is no longer credible and, therefore, they are going to lose faith in us. What they are then going to do is decide--Japan and Germany, which are nonnuclear powers--to become nuclear powers, and we are going to be escalating the arms race by passing this treaty. 
   The same day in an unprecedented move, to the best of my knowledge, the leader of Germany, the leader of France, and the leader of Great Britain sent an open letter to the Senate saying: We, Germany, Japan, and France, have ratified this treaty. We strongly urge you, the Senate, to ratify this treaty in the interest of your country as well as ours. 
   One of those signatories was the Chancellor of Germany, the very country my friends on the other side say, if we pass this treaty, Germany will go nuclear. I guarantee--I cannot guarantee anything. I will bet--I guess I am betting my career on this one--I will bet you anything that if we turn down  this treaty and it is clear that it cannot be revived, within a decade Germany and Japan are likely to be nuclear powers, particularly Japan, because what is going to happen is, India and Pakistan are going to continue testing. They will not sign this treaty. They say they will sign it now if we do. They will not sign the treaty. As India tests more and they move to deployment, China will test more. 
   China will test in order to determine whether or not they can build smaller, lighter thermonuclear devices where multiple numbers can be put on missiles. They will move from 18 nuclear weapons to God knows how many. Then Japan, sitting there in the midst of that region, is going to say, mark my words: We, Japan, have no choice but to become a nuclear power. 
   We have spent 50 years of our strategic and foreign policy initiatives to make sure that does not happen. But that is what will happen. So now, at the end of the day, are we likely to be more secure 15 years from now with the scenario I paint? Which is more likely? Is it more likely that turning down this treaty is going to turn Japan and Germany into nuclear powers, increase the total nuclear capacity of China, and move India and Pakistan further along the nuclear collision path? Is that more likely? 
   Or is it more likely--which is their worst case scenario--that what is going to happen is we are not going to fund the stockpile, we are not going to be able, in 10 years, to count on the reliability of our weapons, the weapons lab Directors are going to come to the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Defense and say, we can't certify any more Messieurs Secretaries, and they go to the President of the United States and say, we can't certify, and the President is going to say, oh, that is OK; don't worry about it. We are going to be bound by the treaty. 
   Which is a more likely scenario? What do you think? Which is more likely, that even if the stockpile degrades, any country, from China to our allies, is going to say, gee, their B-60 M-11 may not function as they thought it would, and maybe they will only be able to fire off 4,900 strategic hydrogen bombs. Maybe they will only be able to do that; therefore, they have lost their deterrent capacity. They no longer have credibility. 
   That is what you have to accept. You have to accept those kinds of arguments to sign on to the notion that most of our Republican friends are arguing. 
   Which is the more likely scenario? I would respectfully suggest that 85 percent or 80 percent of the American people are right. They figured it out. They figured it out. 
   So I hope I have responded, in part at least, to the Senator's question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to put this in context, one of the unfortunate ways in which this debate has developed, in my view, on this very important treaty is that the President of the United States when he put his signature on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty attached to it a number of conditions when he referred the treaty to the Senate. He sent up, along with the treaty, a total of six conditions that he said he wanted added to the treaty before we ratified the treaty. 
   As we all know, in previous arms control agreements, it has been our practice in the Senate to add conditions to treaties. When it was agreed that we were given essentially an ultimatum that if we wanted to debate this treaty at all, we had to agree to the following time constraints. 
   I was under the impression that the starting point for this debate would be what the President said he wanted, which was he wanted us to ratify the treaty itself and the six conditions. I found out later it was only the treaty. 
   Although we were entitled to an amendment on each side, the Democratic side, or in this case the Democratic leader's amendment would have to be what the President said he wanted as part of the package to begin with in order to be for the treaty. 
   Usually what has happened, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee knows, we debated at length, for instance the treaty on the Chemical Weapons Convention we had extensive hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. The outcome of those hearings was that we voted on, or agreed upon, or we negotiated a number of conditions. There were 28 conditions before we brought it to the Senate floor. 
   That is the usual process. But since we didn't have the first formal hearing on this treaty until after it was discharged--that is a fancy word for saying we no longer had any jurisdiction--and it was sent to the floor, here we are in the dubious position of having to use 2 hours on the one amendment we have available to us, an amendment to ask that the President's whole package be considered. That is where we are. 
   The amendment that has been submitted by the Democratic leader contains six conditions that corresponded to the six conditions that the President of the United States said were needed in order for him to be secure with the Senate ratifying this treaty. 
   These conditions were developed in 1995 before the United States signed the treaty. They were critical to the decision by the executive branch to seek the test ban treaty in which the standard would be a zero yield; that is, zero yield resulting from an uncontrolled chain react--a nuclear explosion. 
   We in turn think it is critical that in providing the advice and consent to this treaty, the Senate codify these six safeguards that the President of the United States said were conditions to the Resolution of Ratification. Let me explain why. 
   The safeguards were announced by President Clinton in August of 1995. They were merely statements of policy by the President, and there is no way for President Clinton to bind future Presidents with such statements. However, we can. 
   Conditions in a Resolution of Ratification, by contrast--which is what I am proposing now--are binding upon all future Presidents. Therefore, approval of these conditions will lock them in for all time, so that any future President or future Congress, long after we are gone, will understand that these safeguards are essential to our continued participation in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Administration witnesses who testified before the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee underscored the importance of these safeguards during the Senate hearings last week. I suspect that is why our Republican friends didn't allow Members to bring these up as part of the original instruments. So we started off as we would had it come out of committee, with the actual treaty, plus the conditions attached. I expect the reason they didn't want this side to do that is it would strengthen the hands of those who were for the treaty. 
   I understand the tactical move, but I think it is unfortunate because, as we all know, the witnesses who testified from the administration, others from the laboratories, and others who were with the laboratories and were in former administrations, all those people who testified underscored the importance of these safeguards. In other words, they didn't want the treaty without these safeguards. 
   During the testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Dr. Paul Robinson, Director of Sandia Laboratory, testified:  
   The President's six safeguards should be formalized in the resolution of ratification.  
   General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:  
   The Joint Chiefs support ratification of CTBT with the safeguards package.  
   Of the six conditions, the first, the third, and the last are interrelated and probably the most important. The first condition relates to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Anyone who has listened to this debate now understands what that is. The Stockpile Stewardship Program will be essential to ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons in the future. It requires this condition: That the United States shall conduct a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and the reliability of nuclear weapons in our active stockpile. 
   As we have all heard over the course of this debate, this Stockpile Stewardship Program is a 10-year, $45 billion, or $4.5 billion-a-year, project that is designed to maintain the nuclear stockpile, and it will involve cutting-edge science, as it 
   already has. It is already underway, and the Directors of the three National Laboratories have testified they believe they can maintain the stockpile of our nuclear weapons if the funding is provided. 
   Already there have been difficulties, particularly in the other body, in securing this level of funding. This first condition our amendment contains will assure that the funding will be there. The third condition which is in the amendment before the Senate requires that the United States ``maintain the basic capability to resume nuclear test activities prohibited by the treaty in the event that the United States ceases to be obliged to adhere to the committee.'' That means countries have to have a place to test the weapons underground. 
   We could let our underground test facilities go to seed and not maintain them, so that when the time came that we ever did have to pull out of this treaty, we would not be prepared to be able to resume testing. So we say as a further safeguard against the remote possibility that we will not be able to, through the Stockpile Stewardship Program, guarantee the reliability and safety of our weapons, a condition of the United States staying in this treaty is that the Congress appropriate the money and the President and future Presidents use the money to maintain the facilities necessary to be able to resume this testing if that event occurs. 
   The effort to maintain this capacity is also well underway, I might add. It is also tied to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Subcritical experiments--and we use certain phrases so much around here, sometimes it is easy to forget that most Members don't have nuclear weapons as their primary responsibility, and people listening on C-SPAN or the press aren't--although many are--required to spend time to know what certain phrases mean. A subcritical experiment means a country can set off an explosion that doesn't start a chain reaction. It only becomes critical when there is a chain reaction, which makes it a nuclear explosion. Subcritical means before the rods go banging  into the plutonium and something is started. That is a chain reaction. 
   The subcritical experiments at the Nevada Test Site, which are a vital part of our stockpile stewardship, also enable test site personnel to keep and hone their skills and practice the procedures for actual nuclear weapons tests. Translated, that means we have specialized scientists who in the past have participated in the over 1,000 nuclear detonations we have used over the history of our program, and that without having detonated a nuclear explosion since 1992, these skilled scientists still keep their skills honed by going into this test site facility and doing subcritical tests; for example, using uranium instead of plutonium or performing other tests that don't require a nuclear explosion. 
   We are not only maintaining the capability of being able to do a nuclear explosion; we are maintaining the necessary personnel. The fact that subcritical experiments are scientifically valid and challenging also serves to make work at the test site worthwhile and attractive to skilled personnel. 
   The reason I bother to mention that, in an argument against the treaty by one of the scientists who testified, I think before Senator HELMS' and my committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, he said: We really like to make things go boom. He said: I'm a scientist; I like to make them go to the end of the 
   experiment. I like to conduct them that way. But I can do it without making them go boom. 
   What people worry about now, if you are not going to ``make 'em go boom,'' if you are not going to explode them, some will say scientists won't want to be involved in that; it is not as exciting as if they could actually test. That is an argument that says we will lose a whole generation of nuclear scientists who know how to conduct these tests and know how to read them. 
   Other scientists come along and, with the laboratories, say: No, no, no; we can keep all the interest we need to keep in a group of young scientists who will replace the aging scientific community who have been performing the tests because we will do what we call subcritical tests at the sites where we used to do the critical tests. 
   Part of the agreement, part of the understanding, the requirement, is these facilities have to be maintained as opposed to saying we have a treaty now, we will not do nuclear explosions, so why spend the money on maintaining these facilities? 
   The answer is: To keep scientists interested and to bring a whole new next generation of brain power into this area so they will have something they believe is worthwhile to do, as opposed to them going out and inventing new widgets, or deciding they are going to develop a commercial product or something. That is one of the legitimate concerns. 
   The second concern has been: Once you pass this treaty, you know what you are going to do; you are going to stop funding the hundreds of millions of dollars it takes over time to maintain this place to be able to explode a nuclear weapon if we need to. 
   We said: Do not worry about that; we are going to pass a treaty, and we commit to spend money to continue to do it. If we do not, it is a condition not met and the President can leave the treaty. That is the third condition. 
   The sixth condition is a failsafe mechanism, available to future Presidents in case the critics of the stockpile program turn out to be right. Again, I might point out the critics of the stockpile program, including my good friend, and he is my good friend, are the very ones who have great faith in the Star Wars notion, great faith in the ability to put this nuclear umbrella over the United States so not a single nuclear weapon could penetrate and blow up and kill 5, 10, 20 million Americans. They have faith in that scientific capability, whether it is laser-based space weapons or whether it is land-based systems. But they do not have faith in the ability to be able to test a weapon that has not been exploded. 
   I understand that. It is a bit of a non sequitur for me to suggest you can have faith in one and not the other. I point out, as a nonscientist, as a plain old lawyer, it seems to me it takes a lot more to guarantee if somebody flies 2, 10, 20, 50, 
   100 nuclear weapons at the United States, you will be able to pick them all out of the sky before they blow up and America will be held harmless, than it would be to determine the reliability of this bomb you take out of a missile, sit on a table at a test site, and test whether or not it still works or not without exploding it. One seems more complicated than the other to me. But maybe not. At any rate, after spending $45 billion and all this scientific know-how, we have to continue to be able to guarantee the reliability of our weapons. We have a sixth condition. 
   Article IX of the treaty, I remind everyone, contains a standard withdrawal clause. I am talking not about the condition; I am talking about the treaty itself now. Article IX has a standard withdrawal clause, permitting any party who signs the treaty the right to withdraw 6 months after giving notice; that is, start testing. 
   We could ratify this tomorrow. We still have to wait for another 23 nations to ratify it, but we could reach the critical mass--no pun intended--where enough nations sign and the treaty is in effect, and 6 months after that the President of the United States says: I no longer think this is in the national interest of the United States of America. I am notifying you within 6 months we are going to start testing nuclear weapons and withdraw. That is what this article IX does. 
   But what we do is, if the President--and this is a quote:  
   ......decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests[,]  
   --he can withdraw from the treaty. 
   Every year pursuant to the safeguard--I am back on the safeguards now--every year, we are saying, if this amendment is adopted, pursuant to safeguard 6, the National Laboratories' Directors at Las Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore, all three of them have to go to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy and certify that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is still working and they, the scientists at our three National Laboratories say: We certify the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons. 
   The President, then, certifies to the Congress that there is a high degree of confidence in a safe and reliable stockpile. 
   If any one of those National Laboratory Directors--and there is a redundancy in what they check. By the way, do you know how it works now? The way it works now, we have nine deployed systems, nine different types of hydrogen bombs located in the bellies of airplanes, on cruise missiles, in the bellies of submarines, on longer range missiles, or in a silo somewhere in the United States of America. Every year these National Laboratory Directors go out and get 11 of these warheads from each of those nine deployed systems. They take them back to the laboratories and they dissect them, they open them up, they look at them--to overstate it--to see if there is any little corrosion there in the firing pin, that sort of thing. It is much more complicated, but they check it out. 
   They take one of them and they dissect it, similar to what a medical student does with a cadaver. They bring in 11 people, 10 of whom they give a thorough physical, the 11th they kill, cut up, and see if everything is working when they look inside. They do that now, and there is redundancy in the system. The three 
   laboratories do that. 
   Then they have to go to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense and say: We can certify that our arsenal out there is reliable and safe. 
   But, if, under our condition 6, any one of those lab Directors says, ``No, I don't think I can certify this year, I don't think I can do that,'' then the Secretary of Energy has to be told that, and the Secretary of Energy, who is their immediate boss, has to then tell the President: No, no, we can't certify, Mr. President. And under No. 6, safeguard No. 6, the President shall consult with us and must withdraw from the treaty. 
   Let me read the exact language. It says this under E, page 5 of the amendment, ``Withdrawal from the treaty.'' ``If the President determines,'' and I just explained how he determines--if it is sent to him by the lab Directors and the Secretaries of Energy and Defense who say we can't certify:  
   ......if the President determines that nuclear testing is necessary to assure with a high degree of confidence the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons  stockpile, the President shall consult promptly with the Senate and withdraw from the treaty pursuant to article IX.  
   He doesn't have a choice. He has to withdraw. That is the ultimate safeguard. 
   So for those over there who say if it turns out this Stockpile Stewardship Program doesn't work, they have to assume one of two things if that conclusion is reached. They have to assume the lab Directors are going to lie and they are going to lie to the Secretary of Energy. They are going to say: We can't verify this, we can't certify it, but we are going to do it anyway. They then have to assume the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy will say: Although we know we can't certify, we are going to lie to the President, and we are going to tell the President our nuclear stockpile is no longer reliable, but don't say anything, Mr. President. 
   And they have to assume, then, that the President, knowing that this stockpile is no longer reliable, would look at the U.S. Congress and say: I, President Whomever, next President, certify that we can rely on our stockpile. 
   They either have to assume that or they have to assume their concern about our stockpile is not a problem because the moment the President is told that, he has to call us and tell us and withdraw from the treaty, which means he can begin nuclear testing. 
   Remember condition 3. We said you have to keep those big old places where they do the nuclear tests up to date. So he can begin to test. 
   So what is the big deal? What are we worried about, unless you assume future Presidents are going to lie to the American people, they are going to lie, they are going to say we can rely on this when we cannot? 
   At the end of the process, if the President determines resumption of testing is necessary, then he has to start testing. That is what section 6 says. So we put the world on notice that we have a program in place to maintain a reliable stockpile. 
   If that does not work and we need to test, we put the world on notice as well today that we will and are prepared, politically and in practical terms, to withdraw from this treaty. I should emphasize that the certification process, as I have said, is extremely rigorous: For 3 years running, the lab Directors have certified to the safety and reliability of our stockpile, but only after detailed review by thousands of people at our labs. 
   The other three conditions involve the need to maintain several key elements of our national infrastructure. They require us to maintain modern nuclear laboratory facilities and programs in theoretical and exploratory nuclear technology and infrastructure of equipment and personnel, if you will--that is required--the continuation of a robust research and development program for monitoring, and, finally, our amendment requires the development of a broad range of intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities and operations to ensure accurate information about nuclear programs around the world. 
   These six conditions should have been part of the treaty anyway, but they would not let us add them. We are going to add them now, with the grace of God and goodwill of our neighbors and 51 votes. These six conditions are essential to ratification of the treaty. If you do not want this treaty to work, then you will vote against this amendment. 
   I acknowledge if these safeguards are not there, nobody wants the treaty. The President does not want the treaty. The lab Directors do not want the treaty. No one wants the treaty. There may be others that would be useful to add or even necessary for ratification of the treaty, but the leadership has said we can only have one amendment. 
   They will recall that my own resolution, which led to this process, proposed only hearings and final adoption by March 31 of next year. I want to put that in focus. I see others want to speak, so I will yield, but I want to make it clear it has been said time and again on the floor by the leader himself--and I am sure he unintentionally misspoke--he said he received a letter from 45 Democratic Senators saying they wanted a vote.

I probably have about an hour or 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes left on the amendment; is that correct?

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia would be next, but he has kindly yielded to the Senator from New Mexico. 
   My friend from Arizona keeps saying the ``acknowledged flawed treaty.'' It is not acknowledged to be flawed by 32 Nobel laureates in physics. It is not acknowledged to be flawed by four of the last five Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is not acknowledged to be flawed by the weapons lab Directors, et cetera. 
   I want to make it clear, he states some believe it is flawed. The majority of the people who are in command and have been in command--the Secretaries of Defense who have been mentioned--if we balance it out, clearly think this is not a flawed treaty. 
   I yield on the Republican time to my friend from New Mexico.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes, and then I would be happy to yield to the Senator. 
   I want my colleagues to note--they may not be aware of it, and I wasn't until a few minutes ago--as further consideration of how this may or may not affect the events around the world there apparently has been a coup in Pakistan where the Sharif government fired their chief military chief of staff when he was out of the country. He came back and decided he didn't like that. He surrounded the palace and surrounded the Prime Minister's quarters. The word I received a few moments ago--I suggest others check their own sources--was that there is going to be a civilian government installed that is not Sharif, and that the military will do the installing. I cite that to indicate to you how fluid world events are. We should be careful about what we are doing. 
   I also point out that today before the Foreign Relations Committee, Dr. William Perry, the President's Korean policy coordinator and former Secretary of Defense, testified that failure to ratify the CTBT will give North Korea ``an obvious reason not to ratify the CTBT.'' 
   Dr. Perry, the Secretary of Defense in President Clinton's first term, endorsed ratification of the treaty. He said it serves well the security interests of the United States. 
   I cite that only because it is current. 
   Lastly, I would say that listening with great interest to the last several speakers I find it again fascinating that this is a lot more than about CTBT. It is about ABM. It is about what our nuclear strategy should be. 
   My friend from Arkansas, as well as others who have spoken, has great faith in our ability to erect a nuclear shield that can keep out incoming nuclear weapons in the scores, dozens, or potentially hundreds, which is a monumental feat, if it can be accomplished--we may be able to accomplish it--but don't have the confidence that those same scientists could figure out a way to take a weapon off the nose of a missile, look and determine whether or not it has deteriorated. I would suggest one is considerably more difficult to do than the other. But it is a little bit about where you place your faith. 
   Lastly, I, point out for those who are talking about verification--my friend from Arizona heard me say this time and again, and I would suggest you all go back and look at, if you were here, how you voted on the INF Treaty, the Reagan INF Treaty, or if you weren't here, what President Reagan said because many of my friends on the Republican side quote Ronald Reagan when he says ``trust but verify.'' Nobody can verify the INF Treaty. The intelligence community--and I will not read again all of the detail; it is in the Record--indicated we could not verify the INF Treaty, and we said and the Reagan administration said and President Reagan said in his pushing the INF Treaty that no verification was possible completely. Yet 
   with the fact that we didn't even know how many SS-20s they had, it was concluded that they could adapt those to longer range, interchange them with shorter-range missiles and longer-range missiles, and hide them in silos. But my Republican colleagues had no trouble ratifying that treaty, which was not verifiable, or was considerably less verifiable than this treaty. 
   If you quote President Reagan, please quote him in the context that he used the phrase ``trust but verify.'' And he defined what he meant by ``verify'' by his actions. 
   The military under President Reagan said the INF Treaty was verifiable to the extent that they could not do anything that would materially alter the military balance. No one argues that we cannot verify to the extent as well. But it seems as though we apply one standard to Republican-sponsored treaties by Republican Presidents and a different standard to a treaty proposed by a Democratic President. I find that, as you might guess, fascinating. I will remind people of it now and again and again and again. But I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. I hope not. 
   My friend from Arizona, as I said, is one of the most skillful debaters and lawyers in here. He never says anything that is not true. But sometimes he says things that do not matter much to the argument. 
   For example, he said nuclear testing is the preferred method. It sure is. Flying home is a preferred method to get there. But I can get there just as easily and surely by taking the train. It is preferred to fly home. I get home faster when I fly home. But the train gets me home. In fact, I can drive home. All three methods can verify for my wife that I have come from Washington to my front door. They are all verifiable. They all get the job done. It is the preferred method. 
   By the way, it is the preferred method to have underground testing. It is the preferred method to have above-ground testing. That is the preferred method to make sure everything is working. 
   If I took the logic of his argument to its logical extension, I would say, well, you know, my friend from Arizona wanting underground testing is, in fact, denying the scientists their total capacity to understand exactly what has happened by denying atmospheric testing. 
   The preferred method is atmospheric testing. What difference does it make if we can guarantee the reliability of the weapon? 
   The question with regard to North Korea I pose this way: If we ratify the treaty, and my friend from Arizona is correct that North Korea does not, so what. There is no treaty. It does not go into force. They have to ratify the treaty for it to go into force. What is the problem? If a country is certain it will not matter, they are not going to ratify or abide. Then (a) they don't ratify, we are not in, we are not bound; (b) if they are in and they do a nuclear explosion underground, we are out, according to the last paragraph of our amendment. The President has to get out of the treaty. Must--not may, must. These are what we used to call in law school red herrings. They are effective but red herrings. 
   The last point, I heard people stand up on the floor and say: This country is already or is about to violate the NPT, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by exploding a nuclear weapon. Guess what. They are allowed, under the NPT, to blow up things: nuclear bombs, nuclear weapons, nuclear explosions. They don't call them ``weapons''; they say it is a nuclear explosion, as long as it is for peaceful means. How does one determine whether or not an underground test which has plutonium imploded and has set off a chain reaction was for peaceful, as opposed to nonpeaceful, means? That is a nuclear test. 
   We ought to get our facts straight. The distinctions make a difference. It is true; it is hard to verify whether or not anybody violated the NPT because if they are caught, that country says it was for peaceful reasons, dealing with peaceful uses of their nuclear capability. 
   I have heard a lot of non sequiturs today. My only point in raising North Korea was the idea that anybody who thinks we are going to be in a position that if we turn this treaty down there is any possibility we will stop testing anywhere in the world is kidding themselves. 
   I say to my colleagues, ask yourself the rhetorical question. Do you want to be voting down a treaty on the day there is a coup in Pakistan. Good luck, folks. I am not suggesting that a vote one way or another is dispositive of what Pakistan would or wouldn't do. But I will respectfully suggest we will be answering the rest of the year, the rest of the decade, whether or not what we did at that critical moment and what is going on between India and Pakistan and within Pakistan was affected by our actions. 
   I conclude by saying, in the middle of the Carter administration there was a little debate about this notion of a neutron bomb. The American Government put pressure on Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor of Germany at the time, to agree to deployment of the neutron bomb in Europe--a difficult position for him to take as a member of the SPD. He made the decision, and then President Carter decided not to deploy the neutron bomb. I remember how upset the Chancellor of Germany was. The Chancellor of Germany was not inclined to speak to the President of the United States. 
   I was like that little kid in the commercial with the cereal sitting on the table. There are two 10-year-olds and a 6-year-old. The 10-year-old asks: Who eats that? Mom and dad. Is it any good? You try it. The other kid says: No, you try it. They both turn to the 6-year-old and say: Mikey will try it. 
   I was ``Mikey.'' I got sent to Germany to meet with Schmidt, to sit down at the little conference table in the Chancellor's office to discuss our relationship. I will never forget something Chancellor Schmidt said--and I will not violate any security issue; it is probably long past a need to be secure--in frustration, while he was smoking his 19th cigarette similar to Golda Meir, a chain-smoker, he pounded his hand on the table and said: You don't understand, Joe; when the United States sneezes, Europe catches a cold. When the United States sneezes, Europe catches a cold. 
   When we act on gigantic big-ticket items such as a treaty affecting the whole world and nuclear weapons, whether we intend it or not, the world reacts. This is not a very prudent time to be voting on this treaty, I respectfully suggest. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. I will try to respond briefly. 
   No. 1, to suggest our actions would affect the international community should not be taken in the context and consideration of what is happening in the international community is naive in the extreme. It is not suggesting anyone should dictate what we should or should not do. It is suggesting that it makes sense to take into consideration what is happening around the world and what appropriate or inappropriate conclusion from our action will be drawn by other countries. 
   We have always done that in our undertakings around the world. It is just responsible stewardship of our national security. 
   The suggestion was not that because there is a coup, failure to ratify this treaty, turning it down or ratifying it would have affected that coup. That is not the issue. The issue is there is a struggle today within Pakistan, evidenced by the coup, as there was within India, as evidenced by their recent elections, about what they should do with their nuclear capacity, whether they should test further, enhance it, and deploy it, or whether or not they should refrain from testing and sign the treaty. 
   The only point I am making is that our actions will impact upon that debate within those countries. The debate happens to be taking place in the context of a military coup right now in Pakistan. It took place in the context of an election where the BJP won and made significant gains in India just last week, but it does impact upon that. 
   We lose any leverage we have to impose upon Pakistan, which still wants to deal with us, still relies upon us or interfaces with us in a number of areas in terms of food, trade, and aid all the way through to military relationships. It does make a difference if we are able to say to them, I posit: We want you to refrain from testing and sign on to this treaty if, in fact, we have done it. If we say: We want you to refrain from testing and sign on to the treaty, but by the way, we already have 6,000 of these little things and we are going to test ourselves, it makes it very difficult to make that case. 
   Lastly, I say with regard to Pakistan, it is not so much what anyone will be able to prove; it will be what will be asserted. We all know in politics what is asserted is sometimes more important than what is provable. It should not be, but it is. It does have ramifications domestically and internationally, I suggest. 
   Also, with regard to this issue of the preferred versus the only method by which we can guarantee the reliability of our stockpile, nobody, including the present lab Directors, suggests that our present stockpile is, in fact, unreliable or not safe. 
   We have not tested since 1992. The issue is, and my colleague knows this, the intersection--and it is clear if we do not test, if we do nothing to the stockpile, it will over time degrade, just like my friend and I as we approach our older years, as a matter of medical fact, our memories fade. It is a medical fact. 
   To suggest that because our memories fade we should not listen to someone on the floor who is 8 years older than someone else would be viewed by everyone as mildly preposterous because when that older person was younger, their memory may have been so far superior to the person who is younger now that they still have a better memory. It does not make a point. It is a distinction without a difference. 
   It is the same way with regard to our stockpile degrading. At what point does the degradation occur that it is no longer reliable? I asked that of Secretary Schlesinger. He said he thinks we are down from 99 percent to about 85 percent now, and he thinks there is no worry at that 85-percent level. But what he worries about, and then he held up a little graph and the graph showed based on years and amount of reliability this curve going down like this, at the same time there was a dotted line showing the Stockpile Stewardship Program and how that mirrored that ability to intersect with where we would intersect our 
   confidence that our Stockpile Stewardship Program would be able to assure that the stockpile was reliable. 
   It comes around where the shelf life of these weapons occur about 10 years out. Everyone has said that between now and then, the overwhelming body of opinion is, from the Jason Group to other leading scientists, including these 32 Nobel laureates in physics, the Stockpile Stewardship Program is working now and will if we make the commitment to intersect at a point where the shelf life begins to change where it continues to guarantee. 
   We are never going to be in that line where it is so degraded that any lab Director will have to say: Mr. President, I cannot certify anymore. 
   But as a fail safe, no pun intended, for that possibility--that is why the amendment was just adopted--the amendment says in the last paragraph, if that happens and a lab Director tells the President that has happened and it cannot certify in terms of reliability, the President must get out of the treaty. 
   It is true; we are stringing together a lot of true statements that are not particularly relevant to the question, and the question is: Is our stockpile now reliable and safe? Is it a deterrent still? Do other people believe it? Is it a deterrent so that our allies believe it and they do not go nuclear, such as Japan and Germany? And is it a deterrent so that our potential enemies, such as China and Russia and others, believe it so they will not try to do anything that will jeopardize our security? That is the second question. 
   The third question is: Are we able to verify this? 
   My answer to all three of those questions is, yes, yes, yes. And the answer of the overwhelming body of opinion is yes, yes, yes. But just in case it is no, the President has to get out. He has to get out. We just adopted a condition, so he has to get out. 
   By the way, I listened to people being quoted, like Edward Teller. God love him. I had the great honor of debating him around the country on four setup debates. It was intimidating because he would stand there with those bushy eyelashes and say: My young friend from Delaware does not know--here is the guy who invented the hydrogen bomb. What am I going to say? Yeah, right? 
   I would listen to him, and he would even get me thinking he was right for a while. Then I would listen to what he said. Last night, I watched a documentary that is 7 or 8--actually, it is older than that; it was President Reagan's last year--on the Star Wars notion. Dr. Teller was sitting there, a very distinguished man, saying things like--and I will get the exact quote for the RECORD tomorrow--but he said things like: We must act now because the Russians are on the verge of having a missile defense capability. 
   On the verge; they were on the verge of collapsing. He is never right about his predictions, so far. But he did invent the hydrogen bomb. That is a big deal. I cannot argue with that. As my mother would say, just because you can do one thing well does not mean you can do everything well. If I need to blow somebody up, I want him with me. If I need somebody to predict to me what is going to happen in terms of our interest, of our adversaries, or us, he ``ain't'' the guy I am going to because he has not been right. 
   Here we are, we are going to do this weight of authority--we all learned, and, again, I am not kidding when I say this. Senator KYL is not only a first-rate lawyer, he has a first-rate mind.  We both went to undergraduate school and took courses in logic. We learned about the 13 logical falacies. We engage in them all the time. One is the appeal of authority. I will take my authority and trump your authority. I have 32 Nobel laureates. Are you going to raise me with six Secretaries of Defense? I have four of the last five Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with what are you going to raise me? This is crazy. 
   What is true is that it is better to test if you want to know for certain whether weapons are reliable. I hope if I acknowledge that, he will acknowledge it is better not to test on one area: If you want to discourage others from testing. Just discourage. He does not have to agree that it would do everything, just discourage. It is better not to test. 
   If you tell your kid he cannot smoke and you are standing there smoking and saying: By the way, you can't smoke, it kind of undermines your credibility. 
   On the other hand, if you do not smoke--like I don't--and say to your kid, you can't smoke, they may smoke anyway; but one thing is for certain: If you are smoking--as my friend who is presiding would say in a different context--you might lose your moral authority to make the case. 
   I think we lose our moral authority to make the case internationally when we say: By the way, we are unquestionably the most powerful nuclear nation in the history of the world, and in relative terms we are far in excess of anyone else, including the former Soviets--now the Russians--that the Chinese are not, as they say where I come from, a ``patch on our trousers,'' that the Libyans and others may be able to get themselves a Hiroshima bomb, but they are going to have to carry it in a suitcase--it ``ain't'' close. 
   But I tell you what: Because we worry about our reliability--even though we are going to spend $45 billion, even though we have the best scientists in the world, the best scientists that we can attract from other parts of the world--we know we can put up a shield around America that can stop 10, 20, 100, 1,000 hydrogen bombs from dropping on the United States--but we believe that we have to test our nuclear weapons now or be able to test them in the near term in order to be able to assure that we are safe and secure and that you believe we are credible. 
   I will end where I began this debate a long time ago. When the Senator from New Hampshire and I were college kids, you used to ride along--he was heading off to Vietnam--and there used to be a bumper sticker which said: One hydrogen bomb can ruin your day. It just takes one. One hydrogen bomb can ruin your day. 
   We are not talking about one hydrogen bomb. No one is doubting that 1,000 people and 15 nations in the world can develop not a hydrogen bomb but a nuclear bomb like the one dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. No doubt about that. This is not going to stop that. This isn't going to guarantee that because you do not, everyone has to test that. They can do that without testing. We dropped it without testing it. The second one we did not test. So they can test; they cannot test. 
   But, folks, this is high-stakes poker. All I am saying to you is, you take the worst case scenario my friends lay out, that we have the stockpile, but we cannot guarantee it, and we cannot detect testing, and we have an escape clause--you get out of it because the treaty is not working. That is their worst case scenario. The escape clause is we have to get out because it says we must get out. 
   Let me tell you my worst case scenario. My worst case scenario is we, in fact, do not sign this treaty, and the Chinese decide all moral restraints are off--even though they are not particularly a moral country--we can now, with impunity, go and test and not be buffeted by world opinion in terms of affecting our trade or our commerce and the rest. We can go from 16, 18, 20--however many intercontinental ballistic missiles they have--we can now test to build lighter, smaller ones with that information we stole from the laboratories. We can now MIRV our missiles. 
   The Pakistanis and the Indians agree that: Look, what we have to do is now deploy nuclear weapons because the restraints are off. 
   I do not know what we do with that worst case scenario. There is nothing the President can say, such as: By the way, stop. Out. 
   I want to pull out. You all can't do that. China, you can't do that. There is no way out of that one. 
   This is not like us making the mistake on a tax bill. This is not like us making a mistake on a piece of welfare or social legislation. We can correct that in a day. I have been here when we passed reforms on health care that within 6 months we repealed because we thought it was a mistake. 
   You cannot legislate on this floor of the Senate a course of action that the world is engaged in, a road that has been been taken down away from nonproliferation to proliferation by a piece of legislation. I cannot guarantee the Presiding Officer that if this passes there will not be more proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   But I am prepared to bet you anything, if we reject this treaty, there will be significantly more proliferation of nuclear capability than there was before because there would be no restraint whatsoever on the one thing every nation has to do to become a nuclear power that is not already a significant nuclear power--and that is to test. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am anxious to respond point by point to my friend. I suggest, to believe his arguments, as the old saying goes, requires the suspension of disbelief. I find them to be well intended but half true. I will be very specific about each one of them, beginning with this notion of the value of deterrence. 
   I find it fascinating, my colleagues talk about these other nations can have a Hiroshima-type bomb and build without testing and that would radically affect our security; yet we cannot rely in the future on our certainty of 6,000 sophisticated nuclear weapons in the stockpile. I urge my friends to read today's New York Times and Washington Post where our allies are apoplectic about the fact my colleagues are going to reject this treaty. 
   The absolute notion that this idea is--don't let them kid you about this debate, folks, anybody watching this. You do not have to be a nuclear scientist to understand. You do not have to be a sophisticated foreign policy specialist to grasp what is at stake. 
   Think of it this way when they tell you the security of our nuclear stockpile is going to become so unreliable over time, that, as Dr. Schlesinger has said and my friend from Arizona has alluded, our enemies are going to know we do not have confidence in it and that is going to embolden them, and our allies such as Germany and Japan are going to go nuclear because they cannot count on us. 
   That is fascinating. Why did all of our allies sign and ratify this treaty? Why are they apoplectic about the prospect that we will not sign this treaty? I ask my colleagues when is 
   the last time they can remember the Prime Minister of Great Britain or the President of France saying publicly: My Lord, I hope the Senate doesn't do that. 
   You cannot have it both ways. This is an argument that I find absolutely preposterous. Although one can technically make it, it does require the suspension of disbelief in order to arrive at that conclusion. 
   One has to be an incredible pessimist to conclude that the 6,000 nuclear weapons configured in nine different warheads are going to atrophy after spending $45 billion over the next 10 years, and after having been able to certify without testing for the last 3 years that it is in good shape, that some nation is going to say: We got them now, guys; I know they don't believe their system is adequate; maybe one of those bombs won't go off, maybe 10 of them, maybe 100 of them, maybe 1,000 of them, maybe 3,000 of them. 
   We still have 3,000 left. Back when the Senator from Nebraska and I were kids and Vietnam was kicking up, we used to see bumper stickers: One atom bomb can ruin your day. 
   I am going to go into great detail on every point my friend raised and talk about, for example, the idea we cannot modernize these weapons when we find a defect; we cannot deal with them without testing. 
   Dr. Garwin yesterday--one of the most brilliant scientists we have had, who has been involved in this program since 1950--says, you can replace the whole physics package without changing. 
   By the way, I am going to yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this idea that the stockpile is not going to be reliable, that you can't--we have thousands of parts, and the Russians have missiles with bombs with only 100 parts, and that has some significance. I have said it before. 
   I will yield now. I used to practice law with a guy named Sidney Balick--a good trial lawyer. Every time he would start a jury trial, he would start off by saying: I want you to take a look at my client. I want you to look at him. They're going to tell you he's not such a good looking guy. He's not. They're going to tell you you would not want to invite him home for dinner to meet your daughter. I wouldn't either. They're going to tell you--and he would go on like that. But he would say: I want you to keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on the ball. Follow the bouncing ball. Did he kill Cock Robin? That is the question. 
   The question is, At the end of the day, if we reject this treaty, are we better off in terms of our strategic interest and our national security or are we better off if we accept and ratify the treaty that all our allies have ratified? Which is better? Keep your eye on the ball. 
   I will respond, as I said, in due time to every argument my friend has made, from ``the safety features argument'' to ``the purpose can't be achieved'' to ``nations that don't have sophisticated weapons are going to be able to cheat,'' and so on and so forth. But in the meantime, out of a matter of comity, which is highly unusual, because I should do a full-blown opening statement, I will yield to my friend from Pennsylvania because he has other commitments. Then I will come back to a point-by-point rebuttal of the statement by my friend from Arizona.

   Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 minutes, and then I yield to my friend from New York. 
   First, the very essential safeguards the chairman indicated all military guys want, I find it fascinating that the Republican leadership would not allow the Senate to include those in the treaty. That indicates what a stacked deck this is and how outrageous is this approach of how we are proceeding on this is. 
   The very things all the Joint Chiefs and the President of the United States said they wanted in the treaty as the six safeguards when we brought this up in the unanimous consent agreement, we were not allowed to include those as part of the treaty. I think that is telling. 
   The second point. The Senator says, Have we ever exercised this clause? The appropriate question is, Have we ever needed to? The answer is, we have never concluded we needed to. Such a clause, or a variation, is in every treaty the United States of America signs. This is a bit of a red herring. In every treaty we sign of consequence relating to our national security, there is a supreme national interest clause. The reason we haven't exercised it is that no President has concluded there was a need. 
   The third point I make, if my friend is concerned--as I know he is--about our friends at one point not being able to rely upon the United States and deciding to go their own route, I ask him why Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac are making a personal appeal to the President of the United States, for goodness sake, pass this treaty. Japan and Germany are saying please, please, pass a treaty. We signed it; we ratified it.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, regarding that, I point out to my friend that the ability to do that is in direct proportion to the lack of a MIRV'd capability on the part of other countries--that is, other countries being able to put multi-reentry nuclear missiles on a vehicle to fire at us. 
   All of the technology and testimony from all sources has indicated that for countries that don't have that capability now to be able to move to that capability, which requires them to have a much lighter physics package, or nuclear package on top of a missile--it must be lighter, and it must have a boost capacity--in order for them to develop that, they will have to have testing which is detectable beyond anybody's doubt. 
   So I make the point that the ability to establish a credible missile defense is directly dependent upon the ability of us to keep other nations from developing the ability to have MIRV'd reentry vehicles. 
   I yield 10 minutes now to my friend from Minnesota.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself a few minutes to respond. I will take no more than 3 minutes. 
   I hope all Members have observed why my friend from Arizona is such a good lawyer. He did get your eye off the ball. He started off talking about England and France and our allies and Japan and then shifted to Sri Lanka, China, and Russia and talked about why we should not yield to international opinion. No one has suggested we yield to Sri Lanka, China, and Russia in international opinion. 
   The suggestion made is exactly stated: Allies urge ratifying a test ban treaty. Why? Because they believe it is in their critical interest. They don't lack confidence in our ability to maintain our stockpile. They signed and ratified the treaty. 
   This circular argumentation going on is we should not ratify because we  won't be able to protect our allies; but our allies say you should ratify because we want you to ratify, we feel fully protected. 
   Who do you believe? Our allies saying they want us? They signed; we want to sign. 
   Second, I point out this missile defense rests upon our allies in Great Britain and in France and in Norway allowing us to be able to put sensors in their country in order to be able to have a missile defense. That is the way it will work. 
   What will happen is, we turn down this treaty that they signed, that they think is in their interests, and now we go to them and say: By the way, we want you to help us with a missile defense for our country--not yours, a theater missile defense for our country. How about it, fellows, what do you think? 
   The third point I would make is: China can only be a threat to our theater missile defense. They have about 18 weapons right now. They can only be a threat to us if they are able to MIRV their missiles, if they are able to get sophisticated. Under this agreement, the intelligence community uniformly concludes that we could detect anything they are doing to get to the point where they were MIRVing those missiles, taking any of the stolen data they have gotten from us and using it. So what are we going to do? We reject this treaty, thereby giving a green light to them to do what they want to do without violation of any international law, thereby putting in jeopardy the very missile defense system my friend from Arizona thinks is so critical for our security. 
   I find it fascinating. Keep your eye on the ball. 
   I yield the floor. I see the leader. Welcome, leader.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I find the leader's comment extremely fascinating. I want to set the record straight on a couple of minor details, as they are. 
   No. 1: The letter we sent was on July 20. The opening paragraph said:  
   We urge you to hold hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and report it to the full Senate for debate. Most importantly, we ask this be done in sufficient time to allow the United States to actively participate in the treaty's inaugural conference of ratifying states to be held in early September.  
   We wrote that in July. The assumption, anyone in good faith would assume, was we have hearings now--July, August, and September. We had none. We did not have any. Zip. None. 
   The majority leader said, ``Hearings are underway now.'' That is his quote. They are not underway now. The day before the treaty, the Foreign Relations Committee held its first hearing, on the day after we are discharged of responsibility. With all due respect to my friend from the great State of Virginia, chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee, the only committee of jurisdiction under the rules is the Foreign Relations Committee. Their input is important. We love to hear their opinion, as we do the Intelligence Committee. They have no jurisdiction. It gets sent to our committee, not to theirs. And we have 1 day of hearings after we are discharged? Give me a break.

   Mr. BIDEN. I will not yield now. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty had 8 days; SALT I, 8 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings, 18 days on the floor of the Senate; the INF Treaty in 1988, 23 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings, 9 days on the Senate floor; Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, 1991, 5 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings, 2 days on the floor; START I, 19 days of hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee, 5 days on the floor; START II, 1996, 8 days in the committee, 3 days on the floor; chemical weapons, 14 days in committee, 3 days on the floor; NATO enlargement, 7 days in committee, 8 days on the floor; Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 1 day of hearings after we are discharged. No committee report. 
   Look on your desks, I say to my colleagues. Find the report. Find me a report that makes any recommendation. Come on. Come on, this is a stacked deck. The idea that we are going to vote on a treaty that everyone acknowledges, opponents and proponents, is maybe the single most significant treaty we will vote on to determine the direction of this country in terms of strategic rationale, and we do not even have a committee report? 
   If you want to go down the list, the number of months between the time the treaty was sent to us and the time it got to the floor, we are talking over 2 years. In the case of ABM, 2 months; INF, 4 months; CFE, 8 months; START I, 13; START II, 32; chemical weapons, 37. We keep going higher and higher. Look at who is in charge when we have these. 
   But, my Lord, the idea we have had hearings, we have had sufficient time to consider it, don't get me wrong; in each of these other treaties, an incredible, valuable contribution and 
   report was filed by the Armed Services Committee and an incredible, valuable position was taken and a report by the Intelligence Committee. They were absolutely necessary and needed, neither of which are available now. That is why Senators are arguing about the determinations. 
   For example, I just spoke to General Powell, as my friend from Virginia spoke to General Powell. I wrote down exactly what he said. I just got off the phone with him. 
   He said the most important reason why he wants this delay is so it does not get defeated. That is an important little point. 
   The second point he said was: I still support this treaty. 
   The third point was: But in light of the way this is being taken up and the confusion raised, it is better for the country and everybody to have all this sorted out in an orderly fashion so we all know what we are talking about. 
   He knows what he is talking about. He still supports the treaty, but he made a central point, the point Senator HAGEL made, and that was: We have not had sufficient debate. Therefore, we can have the kinds of comments made, honest disagreements, my friends from Virginia can say: This is not verifiable. And the Senator from Delaware says: It is verifiable. 
   For example, my friend from the Intelligence Committee, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, quoted in his opening statement the Washington Times with regard to verifiability. I will discuss this in detail later. He is on the Intelligence Committee. He knows nobody in the intelligence community came in and said they have evidence that Russia has, in fact, detonated a nuclear weapon. He knows that.

   Mr. BIDEN. I respectfully suggest if you quote newspaper articles and you have some reason to believe a newspaper article is not consistent with what you know, then maybe we should not quote the newspaper articles. 
   The point I am making is a very simple one: Nobody in here has enough evidence, based upon a record, other than the probably 10 or 12 of us to whom responsibility is assigned to know this material; I doubt whether if you poll this Senate, intelligent women and men, that their degree of confidence--and I will be devil's advocate--for or against the treaty is as high as it has been in the past with other treaties because we have had extensive debate before. 
   When we talk about this notion that we are, in fact, in a position where what we asked for--and I wish the majority leader was still here. It was the Biden resolution that was going to be attached to an education bill that called for a sense of the Senate that we, in fact, hold hearings. Standing in this well, the leader--and he has acknowledged this and he made a point of this--walked up to me and said: If you will withhold that resolution, we can work out giving you a vote on this. He did say that, and I said fine. 
   The point is, we were not asking for a vote without 
   hearings, ever. The point is also, accurately stated by many, in retrospect, in hindsight, should some of us have objected to the unanimous consent agreement? The answer is yes. Yes. 
   Here is where we are, and it is true, it is totally within the power of any single Senator to insist we vote. If that is the case, so be it. I am ready to debate the last few hours we have, and we vote. But I defy anyone to suggest this is the way in which they want the Senate in the future on other treaties of any nature, arms control or not, to proceed, which is to wait 2 years, do nothing, have no hearings in the committee of jurisdiction, wait until the committee of jurisdiction is discharged, hold 1 day of hearings, leave 14 hours of debate with one amendment available to each leader. I do not ever remember any treaty on which we restricted amendments or covenants. I do not remember that. 
   On the chemical weapons treaty, we had a whole range of amendments, all developed in the Foreign Relations Committee after extensive hearings. 
   So, folks, this is not the way to do business. But if we are going to do business this way, so be it. I cannot do anything about it except agree with the Senator from Virginia that we should not go forward. I agree with former General Powell. I agree; we should not go forward. If we do, we do. But it is going to be upon those who conclude that this is the way we should conduct business. 
   I think we are setting bad precedent after bad precedent after bad precedent by the way in which we are proceeding. Again, it is true, tactically those who oppose the treaty are in a very strong position now. I give them credit for their tactic. But I hope they will put tactical advantage beneath substantive responsibility. 
   If their case is as strong as they say, I would assume they would feel even  better to have it debated at length, have the committees thoroughly explore it, and have it made clear to the American people so that when they vote it down, the American people--on average, 80 percent of whom support the treaty, based on all the polling data anybody has read--will not have to wonder why they went against the public will. They will be able to make their case, even if it is for no other reason than that. 
   So, Mr. President----

   Mr. BIDEN. I want to make two points. 
   What I said about the lack of an intelligence community, CIA conclusion that Russia has exploded a nuclear device was cleared by the CIA to be able to be said. The operative word is ``conclusion.'' They reached no such conclusion, and that was cleared. I did not speak out of turn. 
   No. 2, with regard to yesterday's--and through the kindness of my friend from Virginia, he has allowed a lowly member of the Foreign Relations Committee to sit in on his hearings. Yesterday, in front of the Armed Services Committee, all three lab Directors testified that our stockpile today is safe and reliable. 
   Let me read what Dr. Browne said. Dr. Browne said:  
   I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.  
   Let me further lay out for you that each Director--all three--answered this when Senator LEVIN asked the following question. Senator LEVIN asked the following question to all three Directors:  
   Are you on board with this treaty?  
   Every single one of the lab Directors said, ``Yes.'' 
   People will say: How can the honorable Senator from Virginia--and he is--say what he said and the Senator from Delaware say what he said? How can they be in disagreement? I will answer the question for you. 
   Remember, I said at the beginning ``keep your eye on the ball here.'' It is true, if we do not fully fund the stockpile at $4.5 billion per year for 10 years, that all three of them lose confidence in the ability to do that. 
   It is kind of ironic. The main reason why we fear that we will fund this--and I challenge anyone to show me this is wrong--is because a Republican-controlled House of Representatives is balking at funding it, not because we have not; we have funded it. The distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee is sitting behind me. We did our part.

   Mr. BIDEN. The inference was not that those who voted no were the only ones who would be taking a chance; the inference was that whomever among us turned out to be wrong is going to, in fact, have a long time to pay. 
   These are big stakes. If, in fact, you vote no, and if proliferation accelerates, whether or not because of this, mark my words, those who voted no will pay. Conversely, if you vote yes and we find out a year or 2 or 3 from now that all those horrible concerns about the treaty turned out to be true and the Soviets have a superiority and the Chinese are doing this, then those of us who voted for the treaty will be held accountable, as we should. I wasn't applying it to one side.

<DOCNO>106-biden-de-31-19991008</DOCNO>

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on my time, in response, I think the Senator from Georgia has narrowed it precisely. Let me tell you why I think the side on which he errs is the biggest chance. There is a safeguard F in this treaty which says that if at any time those laboratory Directors certify that they cannot certify the reliability of our stockpile--and they must do it once a year--and communicate that to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy, and they concur with that judgment, which most assuredly they would, barring their place in history being 
   besmirched in a significant way, then we have in this treaty the absolute authority, under safeguard F, to withdraw. 
   So the reason I believe we should err on the side of not testing nuclearly--knowing that if, in fact, it becomes necessary to safeguard us, we can get out legally in a moment's notice--is that failing to take that very small chance, we open up a door that cannot be closed, or is difficult to close. If, as a consequence of no treaty, China begins significant testing and MIRVs ICBMs and moves them from 18 to 800, or 8,000, or 5,000, if in fact Pakistan and India test further so they can deploy their weapons on the nose cones of missiles that can be fired, it is incredibly more difficult to turn that clock back, to put that genie back in the bottle, than it is for a President of the United States, upon the recommendation of the Secretaries of Defense and Energy, saying, Mr. President, get out, get out. 
   The last point I will make is this: I know of no program--and I stand to be corrected--where there has been a quantum leap in the capacity of a country that has taken us by total surprise, where we have had less than a year's notice. The likelihood of any fundamental change in the strategic balance during the year period, during the last certification and the next certification, is not reasonable. We are the only Nation in the world with the sophisticated capability to even approach that possibility. So that is why I respect my friend from Georgia, and he knows I do. That is why I decided we are taking very little chance relative to a gigantic chance if we turn the treaty down. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Again, as usual, my friend from Georgia goes to the heart of the issue. If you put everything else aside, you take all the detail away, you will find at its root--I am not suggesting that everybody who opposes this treaty doesn't believe everything they are saying; they do. But at its root, it comes down to a belief that has been the case in almost all the debates on treaties--and I am not suggesting that everybody has opposed every treaty. But they have argued one final piece, and that is simply that they lack faith in the political will of this country to do whatever is required. That has been the closing and legitimate argument raised. It was raised in START I, START II, SALT I, and SALT II. 
   The issue was whether or not we would so change the political climate that we lull ourselves to sleep. My friend from New Mexico remembers the argument that we would not have the political will to reengage. It is a legitimate argument. I do not give it short shrift. I think it is the single most serious argument against this treaty. 
   I will close by saying, as the kids say, I will put my experts up against your experts. I have more of them, numerically.

   Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, the remainder of that comment was:  
   ..... and to systematically deal with all the issues that are out there and to take whatever time is necessary to do it. With this treaty other nations will find it hard to acquire and to modernize nuclear weapons and we will gain the means to detect and deter. If we don't have the treaty for the United States, we will continue to refrain from testing and giving a green light to every other country in the world to develop and modernize nuclear weapons. I think it is clear what we ought to do but it is also clear we ought not rush to this vote until there has been an appropriate process in the Senate.

   Mr. BIDEN. He was at the same dinner as I was with the President of the United States when two present colleagues said: ``Mr. President, I'm sad to say the political process has taken this over. This is about politics.''  
   The truth of the matter is, politics is implicated in this. No one is suggesting the politics is good or bad on either side, that one side is better than the other. But two of our Republican colleagues at that dinner--the Senator heard them--said the same thing the President said. 
   We are acknowledging reality. We can all pretend here, with all the niceties, that politics has no part in this. Let's be real simple: The honest-to-God truth is, this is similar to the guy who says the emperor has no clothes on who usually gets shot after he acknowledges that.

   Mr. BIDEN. While the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is assuming his seat, I wish to say to my colleagues, I know of no one else on this side who wishes to speak today. I am anxious to hear what my friend from North Carolina has to say. I will sit here and listen to all of it. And I sincerely am anxious to hear it. But I want my colleagues to know for scheduling purposes, I indicated to Senator KYL I am going to respond specifically to some of the points he raised because--again, I am not being solicitous--I think he is one of the best lawyers in this place. He knows this area very well. I think each of his points warrants a very specific response. But I will attempt to do that on Tuesday when we are back in. So I want to put people on notice, I am prepared to debate the issue if people wish to, but as far as I am concerned, we do not intend on using any more time today, unless for some reason my colleagues conclude I should. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am going to take about 5 minutes to respond to my friend from Alabama. He may have to catch a plane or something. I hope he will understand that, if he is not on the floor. 
   First of all, I find it fascinating. I think he may want to amend the record--I am being a bit facetious, a little tongue in cheek--amend the record by suggesting that he has greater faith in headline writers and reporters than he does in the transcript I am about to read. 
   I don't know whether he has ever been bitten by a headline. We all know headline writers read--and no one  knows this better than my friend from North Carolina--the part of the copy that is given to them, and they get to write the headline they want. Sometimes it bears little resemblance to what happened. I hope we don't put any faith in a headline. I am not suggesting we shouldn't put faith in what is written by reporters sometimes. What was said in this article is accurate, but it is not complete. As my friend from Alabama said, we do not have one voice speaking on this, but we do have one record, one record from the hearing. I have a copy of the record from the hearing conducted in the Armed Services Committee yesterday, page 59. I will read the whole thing. It will take a minute.  
   Senator LEVIN. Therefore, what you are telling us is that if this safeguard [the Strategic Stockpile Program] and other safeguards are part of this process that you can rely upon, that in your words, Dr. Robinson, you are on board in terms of this treaty; is that correct? 
   Dr. ROBINSON. I am on board that science-based stockpile stewardship has a much higher chance of success and I will accept it as a substitute.  
   Going on to page 60.  
   Dr. ROBINSON. As a substitute for requiring yield tests for certification.  
   The tests he is referring to are nuclear tests. Then further on down, Dr. Tarter says:  
   I can only testify to the ability of stockpile stewardship to do the job. It is your job, about the treaty. 
   Senator LEVIN. Are you able to say that, providing you can rely on safeguard F--  
   My description: Safeguard F is the safeguard that allows the President to get out of the treaty if the lab Director certifies that he is not able to certify the safety and reliability.  
   Senator LEVIN. Are you able to say that, providing you can rely on safeguard F and at some point decide that you cannot certify it, that you are willing under that condition to rely on this stewardship program as a substitute for actual testing? 
   Dr. TARTER. Yes.  
   Further down, same page:  
   Dr. BROWN. Senator LEVIN, if the government [the laboratories] provides us with the sustained resources, the answer is yes, and if safeguard F is there, yes. 
   Now I am not suggesting all else that is quoted is not accurate. But it is useful to have a punchline at the end of the quotes. It may be viewed as tortuous; it may be viewed in any way you want. I don't think my friend from Alabama means that because these renowned scientists happen to work for the Federal Government--they also, by the way, are in the employ, if I am not mistaken, of outside laboratories and industries as well, or at least on loan from them--I hope nobody is suggesting--and I am sure he is not--that they would alter their testimony because the President of the United States or the Secretary of Energy takes a position that is consistent with theirs, and that is why they are taking it. 
   I know my friend from Virginia will want to respond to this today, or Tuesday, or whenever he wants to do it. We will have plenty of time. I did not want there to be a hiatus between the comments of my friend from Alabama and my responding. I will conclude, I say to my friend from North Carolina. I think we should be--and believe me, I need this admonition for myself as well--a little careful about some of the words we use, such as ``unilateral disarmament.'' I don't think anybody is arguing we are unilaterally disarming. 
   At any rate, I see my friend from Virginia has come down from on high and I assume wants to respond. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will pursue this more on Tuesday. I respectfully suggest that argument was based on a fallacy, and that is, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will not stay at zero until it is completed. We began this years ago. It is already working. We already use testing methods that do not require nuclear explosions. 
   The Senator will remember the chart James Schlesinger had with the arrows going up and down, and I quote from Dr. Sig Hecker, the Director of Los Alamos in 1997, whom everybody quotes these days, wrote a letter to the Senator from Arizona and said:  
   ..... there have been several instances since the cessation of nuclear testing in September 1992, where we have found problems ..... for which in the past we would have turned to a nuclear test in the kiloton range to resolve. In the absence of testing, we have used the methodology of [Stockpile Stewardship] to evaluate the problem and suggest fixes if required. 
   This has included more extensive calculations, non-nuclear laboratory experiments, comparison to previous nuclear test data, and the extensive experience of our designers and engineers. Moreover, our assessment has been checked against the rigors of peer review by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We have examined several problems of this nature during this year's certification cycle. 
   At this time, we have sufficient confidence in our solutions to certify the stockpile without a resumption of nuclear testing. If our confidence in the fixes were not sufficiently high, we would not certify the stockpile.  
   He is no longer the lab Director, but I assume my colleagues all believe him to be an honorable man. When they say testing is not needed at this time--that is, the Directors--I ask my colleagues whether or not they agree with Jim Schlesinger, who said it is not needed at this time and he doubts it will be needed in the future. 
   Let me explain. We are using data from 1,000 past nuclear tests--as my friend says, from nonnuclear subcritical experiments and from high-tech simulations to understand what is happening and what may happen in the weapons stockpile. 
   Four facilities that will not be ready until 2005 are--they are called the National Ignition Facilities--a contained firing facility, dual-access radiographic hydrodynamics test facility, and the Atlas Plus power facilities. These facilities--and this is important--are all logical successors to older, less capable facilities. Our scientists are pushing the envelope but are not engaging in flights of fancy. That is why our labs and the Department of Energy are confident the National Ignition Facility will work, even though it has cost overruns. These facilities will serve several purposes and increase knowledge of basic physics of nuclear weapons. That new knowledge will lead to more accurate and precise computer simulations. The facilities can also be used to test the particular weapons problems. That is why I say our weapons will still be tested, even without full-scale nuclear weapons testing. 
   Another key tool we are developing is this advanced supercomputing accelerated strategic computing initiative, another generation of supercomputers that will be able to synthesize test data from the past, and all of the testing done on weapons components, to provide three-dimensional simulations of all aspects of nuclear weapons and how they react. Already, our scientists and engineers are working with industry and several universities to develop  computers that are capable of running more than 3 trillion operations per second. That is a new record level of computing power, and it gives us new safety. 
   Our goal, admittedly, over the next 5 years is for those supercomputers to be able to do 100 trillion operations per second. That is not something we need in our stockpile today. In fact, it represents a 100,000-fold increase in today's computational ability, and everybody says today's computational ability is sufficient to guarantee the stockpile. But when our weapons reach their so-called shelf life, then it is going to be needed, and we anticipate needing that sophisticated modeling. No one thinks that sophisticated modeling is needed now. 
   Finally, I have real questions about my colleagues' concern that the stockpile stewardship cannot work. Our scientists are the best in the world. They know what they are doing. They define scientific challenges that must meet the military performance and reliability standards. After defining these challenges, they believe they can meet them. I believe they know what they are talking about. But I see one problem. The one problem the Stockpile Stewardship Program faces now and in the future is that some may not fund it. That is what our colleagues at the laboratories are talking about.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me conclude by pointing out that I find it kind of interesting. The very people who stand up here and say, as I happen to believe, that they have confidence that our scientists in the future are going to be able to shoot out of the sky like a bullet meeting a bullet incoming nuclear weapons over the ocean traveling at multithousand miles per hour and do it with certainty and accuracy--they have faith in the ability of that to occur, but they don't have faith in the ability of our scientists at the three laboratories, who say they are well on their way to doing that, to be able to say what they need. 
   I find it kind of interesting. I must admit it is a double-edged sword. I find my Democratic colleagues who do not support any national defense initiative--because they say this star wars notion can't work, it is too far out--I do not know how they come and rely so easily upon the likelihood that a $45 billion investment is going to guarantee these supercomputers will function to the degree they are needed to when these weapons reach their shelf life. But let's be fair. You can't have it both ways. I would respectfully submit that the ability to guarantee MIRV nuclear warheads fired in the hundreds or the thousands at the United States could be blown out of the sky with impunity by a missile defense initiative on our part is a mildly greater scientific feat than what the stockpile requires. 
   As someone said: ``The faith of our father''--``the faith of our father''--has always been that if we put our mind to it, if we invest the money, we have the intelligence, the ingenuity, and the know-how to get it done. I would respectfully suggest our three present laboratory Directors and all the doubts they express are primarily related to whether or not safeguard F and funding of $45 billion for the stockpile would be forthcoming. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. I don't doubt it. I read from page 59 to get the significance? 
   Do you get the significance? 
   That was stated on 50 and 51 and 52. This is 59. After all is said and done, the question was asked: Do you believe with the safeguards you can rely upon the stockpile, the strategic stockpile, approach as opposed to nuclear testing? 
   They said yes. 
   It follows. Page 59 and 60, I am reading from. Maybe there is something after page 61 in the testimony that would undermine what I have just said. I respectfully suggest I am unaware of it if it is. I stand ready to hear it if it has been. 
   It is one of those deals, folks. You have to go to the end. It ``ain't over until the fat lady sings.'' It ain't over until you read the whole transcript. The last thing stated was: We have confidence. 
   Then, after the testimony, after the testimony and after the New York  Times article, the Department of Energy and in the name of the three scientists quoted--and I will read it again. 
   ``While there can be no guarantee''--the point he is making on page 50--``that the stockpile remains safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.'' 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President I will take 1 minute. 
   The President doesn't need any more time; he read it and negotiated it. I don't need any more time; I spent over 100 hours on that. It is my job on the committee of responsibility. The Senator presiding doesn't need more time; he spent hundreds of hours. The Senator from Oklahoma doesn't need more time because he spent hundreds of hours on it. I defy anyone to find five other Members of the Senate who have spent as much time. 
   Usually what happens is we take on the responsibility to inform our colleagues based on our committees because we have more expertise when assigned the job. When it is tax policy, I don't know what the Tax Code says on major changes, but I rely upon the committee headed on the Democratic side by my friend from New York to tell me what is in it from spending hundreds of hours going through the detail. 
   This is a different way to do business. I don't ever remember Members having voted on a treaty without there being a significant report from the relevant committees on the floor. 
   The President doesn't need any more time. I don't need any more time. Senator BYRD says he needs more time, and I don't know anybody more conscientious than Senator BYRD. But the reason for more time is there haven't been any hearings. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have to say that I am disappointed in the foreign operations appropriations conference report. In my estimation then, and in my estimation now, this bill has two huge flaws: First of all, the bill as a whole is under funded. It simply does not dedicate the necessary monies for our nation's foreign operations. 
   The Administration has indicated that the President will veto this bill, and I approve that decision. The amount in this bill is nearly $2 billion less than the administration's request. That is unacceptable. 
   The second major problem is that, not only is overall funding inadequate, two essential programs have either faced draconian cuts, or have not been funded at all. It is on those programs that I wish to speak. 
   Perhaps the biggest failure of this bill is that it does not provide the amount that the President requested to support the Middle East Wye River Agreement. 
   I find it irresponsible that the conference report does not include a single penny to fulfill our commitment to support the agreement. Early in September, Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement to carry out Wye and to move to final status negotiations. 
   Just as the peace process is getting back on track, this conference report sends a signal of American retreat from our historic moral and strategic commitments in the Middle East. 
   The $800 billion in aid missing from the conference report for fiscal years 1999, and the $500 missing form this year's appropriation were requested to support Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority in critical areas. 
   In Israel, funds were requested to assist Israel in carrying out its military re-deployments and to acquire anti-terrorism equipment. In the Palestinian Authority, support was requested for education, health care, and basic infrastructure in order to reduce the influence of radical groups that thrive off of economic misery. 
   In Jordan, support is needed to bolster the new King as he takes bold and risky moves to support peace and aggressively fight terror.  
   The parties in the region will need to know that we are a reliable partner as they move to the most contentious issues in the peace process. This conference report calls into question our ability to carry out our commitments. 
   The second failure of this year's conference report is that it does not fund the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, an essential part of U.S. efforts to reduce the chances for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from the former Soviet Union. 
   Almost every one of the Department of State budget increases proposed in the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative has been zeroed out in the conference report. This occurred despite the inclusion in the Senate bill of two floor amendments calling for the conferees to achieve full funding of these program requests. I regret that this message was ignored by the conferees, and Frankly I fear that their action could endanger our national security. 
   Some of the programs that are unfunded in this bill were to help Russia's biological weapons experts find new fields of work. If we fail to do that, these very same experts could later threaten our crops, our livestock, and our very lives. 
   Assistance for the Newly Independent States was decreased by 445 million from a Senate passed level that was already $250 million below the Administration's request. While it is unclear where the additional cut would be made, it could reduce existing non-proliferation assistance programs such as the International Science and Technology Centers in Russia and Ukraine. Through these centers over 24,000 former weapons scientists have found jobs in places other than nuclear and biological weapons labs in Iraq and Iran. 
   The same could be said for the Civilian Research and Development Fund. This foundation provides training for Russians who are former weapons scientist so that they can embark in nonmilitary careers. Not only the United States, but the entire world has benefited from this. 
   I accept the fact that Congress has to make some tough choices in all of our appropriations. There are literally a dozen more programs in this bill that I would like to see increased funding for. We cannot designate as much money as we would like in all the areas we would like. However, I believe that the programs I have outlined above are crucial to the effective execution of United States foreign policy. 
   By ignoring them, we are creating serious problems which may very well be costly to correct. Diplomacy and assistance are cheap compared to the price we pay when they fail. When the Senate passed its appropriation bill in June, I hoped that these flaws I have just discussed would be corrected. They were not. As it stands, I cannot support the conference report.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act of 1999. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require that all health plans provide coverage for breast reconstruction surgery after a woman has had a mastectomy for breast cancer. 
   Breast cancer is a frightening disease for women. It is common: a very high percentage of women who live long enough will eventually develop the disease. It is insidious: it can remain asymptomatic for many years before it is discovered. It is stealthy: it can recur many years after it has been thought to be cured. It is devastating: surgical treatment can be not only physically mutilating but psychologically devastating to a woman's sense of femininity and self-esteem. And it is everywhere: there is hardly anyone in this country who does not have a close friend or loved one who has been through an experience with breast cancer. 
   Fortunately, there has been tremendous progress in the treatment of breast cancer, and many women can now be cured. However, as these breast cancer survivors attempt to resume their normal lives after their treatment, they can still be impacted by the physical damage that follows mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy is thus a key part of restoring the breast cancer patient back to a satisfying and fulfilling life; it is not simply a cosmetic procedure to satisfy one's vanity. 
   In recognition of the importance of breast reconstruction after mastectomy, last year the Senate passed the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill. This legislation, which was signed into law by the President, amended the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to require that health plans provide coverage for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. This coverage also includes surgery on the unoperated breast, if necessary, as well as the cost of breast prostheses and repair to physical complications following mastectomy (e.g. lymphedema or arm swelling). 
   However, if we don't pass further legislation, the enforcement mechanisms available to the Department of Labor to ensure that health plans comply with the breast reconstruction requirement are generally limited to requesting a court to issue an injunction. The Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act will incorporate the breast reconstruction requirement into the Internal Revenue Code in order to enable civil monetary penalties to be imposed on violators of the law. Passage of this bill would continue the precedent established by all previous mandates on health plans (those in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, and the Mental Health Parity Act), which were incorporated into all three statutes: Public Health Service Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Internal Revenue Code. 
   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to finish the work that we began last year to ensure that women can be fully restored to health after fighting breast cancer, and I urge them to support the Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act of 1999 that I am introducing today.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am always reluctant to disagree publicly with my friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the full committee, because we get along so well. We have a fundamental disagreement on this issue. But I am unaware of any hearings we have had in the Foreign Relations Committee on this treaty. 
   We have had hearings on the ABM Treaty. We have had hearings on the ABM Treaty. We have had hearings on the protocol to the ABM Treaty, and the demarcation issue. We have had hearings on the impact of theater missile defense. We have had those hearings. They all implicate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But we have had, to the best of my knowledge, no hearings on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I note for the RECORD one Senator's view. I think it is shared by many. 
   This is the single most significant issue facing the entire question of proliferation of nuclear weapons, and it holds the key for good or bad, depending on your perspective, on every other aspect of our strategic defenses. 
   So it is, to me, not reasonable. The chairman has been very straightforward with me--and I respect him for it--in the many urgings I have made to him to have hearings. He said to me: Joe, we will have hearings if the following things occur. 
   He lays it out. He said: We will have hearings if we first do ABM, if we first do the Kyoto treaty, if we first do other things. He has set priorities. He has been straightforward, honest, and up front about it for the last 2 years. This is the only thing he and I have had a real disagreement on. 
   But the idea that we have had hearings on this treaty is not true. I am not suggesting that the chairman is intentionally misleading the Senate. He may think in terms of since we have had hearings that implicate other aspects of our strategic defenses and our strategic offensive capability that we have done this, but we haven't. 
   The Government Affairs Committee, I thought, had some hearings on it relating particularly to the stockpiling  issue and the testing of the stockpiling. And I think maybe even the Armed Services Committee may have had hearings on it. 
   But I want to get something straight. I am going to sound to the public like a typical Washingtonian Senator. The only outfit that has jurisdiction over this is the Foreign Relations Committee--the Foreign Relations Committee. That is one of our principal functions. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues, we haven't had hearings. 
   Let me say one word in conclusion. 
   I am willing and anxious to have an up-or-down vote on this because, as the majority leader said, if we don't vote, the 
   treaty loses anyway. I would rather everybody be counted. I want everybody on the line. I want every Senator voting yes or no on this treaty so we all can put ourselves in line so that, if India and Pakistan end up--while we are pleading with them to ratify this treaty, while we are pleading with them not to deploy--if they end up deploying nuclear weapons, I am going to be on the floor reminding everybody what happened and the sequence of events. I will not be able to prove that is why they did it. But I can sure make a pretty strong case. 
   I want everybody coming up this next year--everybody from the Presidential candidates to all of our colleagues running for reelection--to be counted on this issue. 
   That is why I am willing--I am in the minority--to have the vote today. I am willing to go ahead. I am not the leader. But I will tell you, I think this is a critical issue. We have had no hearings. 
   It makes sense what my friend from North Carolina says--that we should have hearings, and we should do it in an orderly fashion. We should proceed this way. Apparently, we are not going to proceed this way; therefore, we will have to do it in a way in which the committee system was not designed to function. If that is the only way we can get a vote, fine. 
   I conclude by saying that I don't doubt for a second the intensity with which my friend from North Carolina believes this treaty is against the interests of the United States any more than he doubts for a second my deep-seated belief that it is in the ultimate interest of the United States. 
   But these are the issues over which people should win and lose. These are the big issues. These are the issues that impact upon the future of the United States and the world. This is the stuff we should be doing instead of niggling over whether or not you know somebody smoked marijuana or did something when they were 15. This is what this body is designed to do. This is our responsibility, and I am anxious to engage it. 
   If it is 10 hours, 2 hours, or 20 hours, the longer the better to inform the American public. Hearings would be illuminating. 
   But since that is probably not going to happen, I say to my friend from North Carolina that I am ready to go. I expect he and I will be going toe to toe on what is in the interest of America. I respect his view. I thank God for him. I love him. But he is dead wrong on this. But I still love him.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know my colleagues are anxious to get to the business at hand. I assure the floor I will take only 5 minutes. If the clerk will let me know when I am headed towards 5 minutes, I would appreciate it. 
   I will refrain from responding and speaking to the Test Ban Treaty at length at this moment. 
   The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is not only a colleague, but he is a personal friend. We have strong disagreements on this issue. 
   I don't mean to nickel and dime this, but we haven't had any hearings on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   At the outset, I send to the desk a list of all the hearings the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had for the 105th and 106th Congress's since submission of the CTBT.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I can understand why the Senator may think we have had hearings because we have had hearings on other subjects that implicate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is mentioned by witnesses. But we have never had a hearing on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--a treaty of great consequence to the United States and the world--conducted in the traditional way. We never had a hearing where we said this is what we are going to talk about. We need a hearing where we bring up the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, or major voices in America who oppose this treaty--fortunately, I think there are not that many--or significant figures and scientists who have spoken and know about this issue. We haven't had one of those hearings at all.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the chairman has been true to his word. He has had no hearings because that has not been done yet. 
   I think I understand how the Senator from North Carolina connects the rationale of these treaties, and he thinks the orderly way to do it is to do it only after we do other things, but that makes the point. We have had no hearings on this treaty. 
   I think the public may be surprised to know this treaty calls for no more nuclear testing by the United States and other nations. We haven't been testing. There is a moratorium on nuclear testing. That occurred in 1992 in the Bush administration. 
   What we are talking about doing that my friends are talking about is so dangerous and damaging to U.S. interests; that is, to sign a treaty to say we will not test, we are not testing now. The United States made a unilateral decision not to test. 
   Now we have the rest of the world ready to sign up, and we are saying we are not going to ratify, or up to now we are saying we are not even going to have a hearing on this subject. 
   Again, I will get into the merits of the treaty later because I am confident the leadership of the Senate will come up now with the proposal as to how to proceed. 
   But I urge my friend from North Carolina, and I urge my colleagues to urge my friend from North Carolina, to hold hearings. Bring the experts up. Bring the military up. 
   By the way, one last substantive thing I will say about the treaty is that we are the only nation in the world that has spent billions of dollars and committed billions in the future to a method by which we can take our existing stockpile of nuclear weapons and test them for their continued utility without ever exploding them. I will explain in detail later what I mean by the stockpiling program we have. 
   We, of all nations in the world, are the one best prepared and best suited for taking the last chance of any nation in the world to promise not to test because we are one of the few nations in the world with certainty that can guarantee that even if we don't test weapons we can test, by exploding them, their continued utility by very complicated, very sophisticated scientific computer models that we have designed. We have committed that we will continue in the future to fund to the tune of billions of dollars this program. 
   In a strange way, if you went out to the public at large and said: By the way, do you think we should sign a treaty that says we can't test nuclear weapons if the rest of the world signs a treaty that says you can't test nuclear weapons, knowing that we can detect all but those kinds of explosions that will not have any impact on another nuclear capability, when we have already decided not to test unilaterally, and we are the only nation in the world that has the sophistication and capacity to test by means other than exploding our nuclear arsenal; what do you think the public would say? 
   I conclude by saying this: We have had no hearings. There is a legitimate debate about whether or not we should do this. 
   This is a thing for which the Senate was conceived--to make big decisions such as this. 
   This is the reason the founders wrote in a provision in the U.S. Constitution that said a treaty can be negotiated by a President, but it can only come into effect after the Senate has ratified it. It didn't say the House. It didn't say a referendum. It didn't say the American people. It said the Senate. Other 
   than the Supreme Court of the United States, in a decision of who should sit on it, there is no other function that is of greater consequence that the Senate performs than determining whether to ratify or reject a treaty with the United States of America. 
   It seems to me that when we exercise that function, we should do it responsibly and thoroughly. 
   We have never done it on a matter of grave consequence without thoroughly investigating it through the hearing process and through one of the oldest committees that exists in the Senate--the Foreign Relations Committee--the unique function of which is to recommend to this body what our bipartisan considered opinion is after hearing the details of the treaty. 
   I look forward to the debate. 
   I have urged the President of the United States--I will urge him personally--and have urged the administration, if this date is set, that the President take this case directly to the American people on a nationally televised broadcast and lay out for them what the stakes are. 
   This is no small decision. This is a vote that I promise you, whether you are for it or against it, your children and your grandchildren and history will know how you cast it. I am not so smart to know exactly what the outcome will be in history's judgment, but I am certain of one thing: You are not going to be in a position where you can say at a later date this was a vote of little consequence. 
   Mr. President, as folks back home in Delaware say, this is what we get paid the big bucks for. This is why we are here. This is the purpose of our being here. 
   It is true. The amendments we are going to discuss on legislation that is before us are important. It is true that some of it will affect the lives of hundreds or thousands of Americans. But I can't think of anything we will do in this entire Congress or have done in the previous Congress that has the potential to have as much impact on the fate of the world as this treaty. I cannot think of anything. I defy anyone to tell me, whether they are for or against this treaty, what we could be discussing of greater consequence than how to deal with the prospect of an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust. 
   Tell me if there is anything more important to discuss than whether or not over the next days, weeks, months,  years, and decades we should make a judgment from both a survival as well as environmental standpoint that we will or will not continue to blow up, in the atmosphere or underground, nuclear weapons. I defy anyone to tell me what is more important to discuss. 
   That is not to suggest that those who think this treaty is a bad idea are motivated by anything other than good intentions. As my dear mother would say and as the nuns used to make me write on the blackboard after school when I misbehaved: The road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
   Failure to ratify this treaty, I firmly believe, paves the road to hell--to nuclear hell. I don't know whether it will work, but I am virtually certain in my mind--just JOE BIDEN, my mind--that if we do not ratify this treaty, we virtually lose any ability to control the proliferation of nuclear capability. 
   They talked about when the Russians detonated their first hydrogen bomb. I am not sure, but I think it was Edward Teller who said: Now we have two scorpions in the bottle. I am here to tell my colleagues what they already know. We have many more than two scorpions in that bottle now. If we do not begin to take a chance, a very small chance, on a treaty that says no more detonation of nuclear weapons, we will have dozens of scorpions in that bottle with not nearly as much to lose as the former Soviet empire and the United States. 
   There was one advantage when there was a Soviet empire: They had as much to lose as they had to gain. The only person I worry about in a contest of any kind--athletic, political, or as a representative of the Federal Government of the United States of America with another country--I don't like dealing with someone else who has little to lose but has significant capacity to inflict a vast amount of damage. 
   While I have the floor, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER. My friend from Pennsylvania has been one of the most outspoken proponents of bringing up this treaty. I am sure it will be before the Senate because of his advocacy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. If I may respond to the Senator, he raised the $64 question. He and I have been discussing how to get this up for a long time, over 2 years. He will recall, last year, I was of the view I did not want to take a chance of having the treaty up for fear it could be defeated before we had the ability to get all the data before the Senate that I believed would persuade Senators to overwhelmingly support the treaty. 
   I changed my mind. The reason I changed my mind is--I have great respect for my friend from North Carolina, Senator HELMS--I have learned one thing: When he says something ain't going to happen, it ain't going to happen on his watch. He made it very clear, there will be no hearings on this treaty. I have been with him for 27 years. We are truly personal friends. I know when he says it, he means it, which means I have lost any hope that he will be persuaded, or be persuaded by his Republican colleagues in the caucus, to have hearings. 
   I then reached the second conclusion: We are hurtling toward a disaster on the subcontinent with India and Pakistan, and with Korea. As the Senator knows, if they arm, if they deploy, we will see China making a judgment to increase its nuclear arsenal and we will see the likelihood that Korea will not be able to be leveraged. 
   Here is the point. I have made the judgment, for me--and I may be wrong--if we don't agree to this proposal, we will get no vote on this treaty for 2 years and the effect will be the same. 
   I am being very blunt. I believe I am looking for the political God's will to have people have a little bit of an altar call. It is one thing to say privately you are against the treaty or to say you are for it but there is no vote on it. It is another thing to be the man or woman who walks up in that well and casts the 34th vote against the treaty and kills the treaty. They will have on their head--and they may turn out to be right--and they will be determining by their vote the single most significant decision made relative to arms, nuclear arms, that has been made since the ABM Treaty. I think they may begin to see the Lord. If they don't, then I think the American public will make a judgment about it. The next President--whether it be Bush, GORE, or MCCAIN--will be more likely to send back another treaty. 
   I am at a point where it is time to bring in the sheep. Let's count them, and let's hold people responsible. That is as blunt as I can be with my friend.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise before you today in support of increased funding for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Specifically, two programs--housing vouchers for low-income families and the Community Builders program--of interest to both Delaware and the nation, need additional funding that is not in this bill. I hope that my comments will be helpful to my colleagues when we eventually head into conference on this bill. 
   Before I speak, I wish to commend the managers of this bill. Competing demands and good programs are a recipe for tough choices. These managers have done an excellent job in moving this bill along smoothly and effectively and with a spirit of comaraderie. 
   But this bill would not fund a single new housing voucher for low-income Americans to obtain housing. Not a single one. This just makes no sense for two basic reasons. First, these vouchers enable low-income families to afford a reasonable place to live, to afford decent housing--but we now have more than one million Americans waiting for housing assistance. Not only are these numbers abominable, but Americans are waiting months and even years to get affordable housing. In my home state of Delaware, people are stuck on waiting lists for an average of 10 months for public housing and 18 months for section 8 vouchers. In Philadelphia, just down the road, the waiting time is 11 years. In Cincinnati, it is 10 years. How can we be freezing a program that provides housing vouchers when, before the freeze, HUD-assisted households were growing at a rate of 107,000 households per year? We are freezing out the elderly, persons with disabilities, and persons trying to get close to a good job. And what is the alternative for these million people on waiting lists? It is substandard housing or a paycheck that goes almost entirely to rent. 
   Second, we are in a time of booming growth and prosperity. A time when we have an actual surplus in our treasury. But not all Americans are touched by this prosperity, as evidenced by the waiting lists. In fact, many Americans are discovering that they cannot pay their rents because this economy has driven up the cost of their rents. Over 5 million families have severe housing needs in this country. These vouchers are all the more necessary as rents rise more and more out of reach. 
   The administration has asked for a conservative number of new housing vouchers. These 100,000 vouchers would go to the elderly, the homeless and worst-case housing needs. In addition, these vouchers would support people moving from welfare to work. Mr. President, we are creating new jobs in this economy, but the people that need these jobs are not living where these jobs are. These vouchers would help get people to where they need to be in order to work and get off the welfare rolls. Last year we voted to add 90,000 new vouchers, the first growth since 1994. If we vote for new vouchers now, 259 families in Delaware would be able to receive housing assistance. To provide no new vouchers seems just unreasonable. 
   This bill also terminates the Community Builders 
   program. This public service program has put HUD out into the community to strengthen and revive our neighborhoods. Frankly, in the past, HUD has not been an exemplary representative of good bureaucracy. But this administration has gone to great lengths to turn things around--and begin to provide services effectively and skillfully to our communities. The Community Builders program is a successful example of this turn-around. The program is not even 2 years old, yet what it has accomplished in my state of Delaware is remarkable.  Let me tell you what the Community Builders program is doing in Delaware and why it is important. 
   We did not have a HUD presence in Delaware before the Community Builders. Now, for the first time, Delaware has a direct link to HUD programs. Let me tell you what that means. In Delaware, we have some pretty amazing people who are trying to help their communities by developing projects to create jobs and fair housing. They have the will and Community Builders gave them the way. The Community Builders, who are experts in technical assistance, are training these people on how to start community development programs. 
   Besides providing expertise, this program has literally put people on the street who facilitate and coordinate the community's access to HUD programs. Let me give you another example. Next week in the Terry Apartments on Bloom Street in Wilmington, computers will be installed for its elderly residents. The Community Builders helped secure the funding for these computers. It also teamed with the University of Delaware so that next week, people will come to the apartment building to train these residents how to use the computers. This means that persons living in section 8 buildings will now have access to the internet. 
   I have seen letter upon letter sent to HUD thanking them for what this program has brought to Delaware. Let me quote for you a letter from Patti Campbell at the University of Delaware written to HUD:  
   The Delaware Community Builders have been instrumental in our continued progress on building community Neighborhood Networks, and have made possible the first ever Statewide strategic discussion and conference of faith-based community development groups. The input and advice from HUD's Community Builder ..... provides a unique housing perspective that has helped the program make strong, well-thought out strategic decisions. This expertise is an invaluable tool that assists in the forward progress of many of our affordable housing and community based programs. HUD's Community Builders have a unique position in Delaware in that they can offer information about the overall community-based development process with the full knowledge and support of HUD's broader programs.  
   As this letter vocalizes, the Community Builders have created a partnership connecting organizations trying to develop affordable housing in Delaware--and has built their capacity to do so. It is clear that closing this office in Delaware, which would happen if this program is disbanded, would harm this partnership. 
   Mr. President, again, I commend the managers of this bill. This bill would be an even better one if it secured more housing for the people that need it and if it continued HUD's presence in local communities. I hope that my colleagues will be able to find the resources to fund these programs by the time this bill comes out of conference. 
   I know my colleagues are ready to move on. Let me make three broad points. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes. 
   No. 1, the fact is, we have asked the Housing Department, HUD, to become more innovative. We have asked them to trim down. We have asked them to become more efficient. We have asked them to become more customer oriented. I think under Andrew Cuomo they have done just that. Now, because of problems beyond the control of the subcommittee, this is the caboose at the end of the train that is going to be empty. This is not going to get the kind of attention, the whole of HUD is not going to get the kind of attention, it deserves. 
   The second point is very basic. My colleague from Missouri made a very compelling argument about section 8. He made the point, why this tax cut is so brain dead, why we are here talking about cutting what everyone on this floor acknowledges there is a need for, recognizing but not saying that in order to be able to come up with a surplus of $1 trillion over 10 years, which is the projection, that encompasses a 20-percent cut across the board in all programs. If we increase defense, it means a 40-percent cut in some programs. 
   Here we are debating, tying up the end of a session. This is totally beyond the control of my colleagues on the subcommittee, totally beyond their control. I am not suggesting they agree with what I am saying. I am telling Senators, this is the classic example of why we are in such trouble. 
   Here we are with this booming economy, a projected surplus, very few appropriations bills passed. The only thing we are talking about is an $800 billion tax cut that now has been vetoed and now it is said there will be no compromise on until next year. We are spending a surplus we don't have, and we are kidding the American public that there is somehow a painless way of arriving at the surplus so we can give it back in a tax cut. 
   I defy anyone to tell me how we are going to meet the needs. Democrats and Republicans have stood up, to the best of my knowledge, and said: You are right; we have this serious section 8 problem; we have this serious problem in providing affordable housing; we should do something about it. Tell me how you do it. This, as well as education, as well as 10 other things we could name--defense, where we all acknowledge there are significant needs--by spending a surplus we don't have and that is premised upon a continued cut of 20 percent beyond what we have cut over the last 6 years on balance. 
   As the grade school kids used to say, I hope we get real here. These folks managing this legislation can't manufacture an allocation. They can't come up with magic money. I hope people who are setting policy, making the decisions about how to proceed on these overall budget items and how to deal with the projected surplus, which seems to have us completely tied up in knots--I have been here for 27 years. My friend from Massachusetts has been here longer than I have. I don't ever remember a time when things were in as much disarray at the end of the year and in the appropriations process. The difference is, nobody has a plan. Nobody has a plan. At least when Gingrich was in charge over there, they had a plan. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. It was the proverbial freight train, but it was a light. He had a plan--a bad plan but a plan. We don't even have a plan. 
   We are careening down this hill, having no notion what is going to happen. At least I don't have any notion. Maybe others are smarter than I am and can tell me what is going to 
   happen in the next week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 weeks. I have no idea. I don't think there is a plan. 
   The plan relates to having a rational strategy towards the budget in terms of how we are going to deal with this booming economy, this projected surplus, and the spending priorities. Mark my words, this is not the only one. My friend from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, and my friend from Illinois have talked about education and how it has gotten just gored--no pun intended. This is crazy. 
   I hope saner leaders decide how to approach this problem, so we are not here talking about something we all think we should do something about and the American public, with the economy booming, can't understand why we can't do something about. Yet we have no idea how to do anything about it. I find that fascinating, I find that deplorable, and I find that frightening. 
   I hope this illustration on this small issue in relative terms is able to be looked at by people. If there is a problem here, it is everywhere. All these priorities we say we want, and yet we are fighting over a surplus that doesn't exist and trying to give away $800 billion in a tax cut.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, three years ago today, the United States led the world in signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Since then, 152 countries have followed our lead; and 45 of them, including Great Britain and France, have ratified the Treaty. 
   Two years and two days ago, the President of the United States submitted the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, plus six safeguards, to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. Since then, the Senate has done nothing. 
   That is an outrage. We--who are rightly called the world's greatest deliberative body--have been unwilling or unable to perform our constitutional duty regarding this major treaty. 
   Some of my colleagues have principled objections to this treaty. I respect their convictions. I have responded on this floor to many of their objections, as have my colleagues from Pennsylvania, North and South Dakota, Michigan and New Mexico. 
   Now it is time, however, for the Senate to do its duty. Administration officials, current and former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and eminent scientists are prepared to testify in favor of the Test-Ban Treaty. We, in turn, are prepared to make our case in formal Senate debate on a resolution of ratification. 
   It is high time that the Republican leadership of this body agreed to schedule Senate debate and a vote on ratification. It is utterly irresponsible for the Republican leadership to hold this treaty hostage to other issues, as it has for two years. 
   The arguments in favor of ratifying the Test-Ban Treaty are well-known. 
   It will reinforce nuclear non-proliferation by reassuring non-nuclear weapons states that states with nuclear weapons will be unable to develop and confidently deploy new types of nuclear weapons. 
   It will keep non-nuclear weapon states from deploying sophisticated nuclear weapons, even if they are able to develop designs for such weapons. 
   It will improve our ability to detect any nuclear weapons tests, with other countries paying 75% of the bill for the International Monitoring System. 
   U.S. ratification will encourage India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the Test-Ban Treaty--one of the few steps back from the nuclear brink that they may be willing to take, without a settlement of the Kashmir dispute. 
   U.S. ratification will encourage Russia, China and other states to ratify. 
   Our ratification will maintain U.S. leadership on non-proliferation, as we approach the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference next April. That U.S. leadership is vital to keeping non-nuclear weapons states committed to nuclear non-proliferation. 
   Equally important are the safeguards that the President has proposed, to ensure that U.S. adherence to the Treaty will always be consonant with our national security:  
   A: The conduct of a Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile....... 
   B: The maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory facilities and programs ..... which will attract, retain, and ensure the continued application of our human scientific resources to those programs....... 
   C: The maintenance of the basic capability to resume nuclear test activities....... 
   D: Continuation of a comprehensive research and development program to improve our ..... monitoring capabilities....... 
   E: The continuing development of a broad range of intelligence ..... capabilities and operations to ensure accurate and comprehensive information on worldwide nuclear ..... programs.  
   F: ..... if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) ..... that a high level of confidence in ..... a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT ..... in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.  
   Thus, if nuclear weapons testing should ever be required to maintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent, then we will test. 
   Thanks in part to these safeguards, our senior national security officials support ratification of the Test-Ban Treaty. These officials include not only cabinet members such as former Senator Cohen, but also the directors of our National Laboratories and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   Ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is vital to our national security. If the Senate dallies, India and Pakistan could fail to cap their nuclear weapons race; China could resume testing, to make better use of stolen U.S. nuclear secrets; and non-nuclear weapons states could give up on non-proliferation. 
   In the coming days, therefore, several of us will bring up in a more formal form the need for Senate action on this Treaty. I urge all my colleagues to support that effort. 
   Whatever our views on the Test-Ban Treaty, it is a national security issue. Let us agree that it is not to be held hostage to other issues. Let us agree that it is not just one more football in the Washington game of ``politics as usual.'' 
   If the Republican leadership does not handle this Treaty responsibly, I have no doubt how the issue will play out in next year's elections. The latest national poll shows overwhelming public support for the Test-Ban Treaty: 82 percent in favor and only 14 percent opposed. 
   Those results go beyond party lines. Fully 80 percent of Republicans--and even 79 percent of conservative Republicans--say that they support the Test-Ban Treaty. 
   Republicans may appeal to the far right by calling for a return to the Cold War of nuclear testing. Bob Dole did that in 1996 on the Chemical Weapons Convention; but he lost. Then he took the responsible stand. 
   This time, let's skip the politics. Let's do our job--with hearings, debate, and a timely vote, at least before next April's Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference. 
   We can address the Test-Ban Treaty responsibly. It isn't hard, and the American people know that. It's time the Senate did what Nike says: ``Just do it.''

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Delaware's top police officer--the Superintendent of the Delaware State Police, Colonel Alan D. Ellingsworth. 
   After one of the most distinguished careers in Delaware law enforcement history, Colonel Ellingsworth has retired following 24 years of service with the Delaware State Police. His life as a police officer began on August 1, 1975, when he was assigned as a road trooper at Troop 6 in Prices Corner. Moving up the ranks quickly, he worked in every major unit, including criminal investigations, as the officer-in-charge of the homicide unit and as a Troop Commander. 
   In May, 1994, he was promoted to Superintendent, where he has been a true leader for the citizens of Delaware, and a true partner and friend to me. 
   Mr. President, I want to mention something very near and dear to my heart, the 1994 Crime Law that I authored--it became a reality in Delaware thanks to Colonel Alan Ellingsworth. Under his leadership, the ranks of the Delaware State Police increased 10 percent, with a force of 525 officers today. With funding from the Crime Law, he not only put 60 more police officers on our streets--he established effective ``Community Policing'' units in Delaware's toughest neighborhoods. He personally tackled the drug problem in rural parts of Sussex and Kent Counties, creating new units to go into these poorer areas so that adult residents and their children knew the Delaware State Police were their friends and partners in ``taking back their neighborhoods.'' And he sent a strong message to drug dealers and criminals--get out and stay out. His officers arrested the drug dealers and users, and helped direct the neighborhood kids to Boys and Girls Clubs and other constructive, supervised activities. I've seen these officers at work in these communities--it is remarkable how residents trust them. Equally impressive are the results. 
   His strategy has worked. Crime in Delaware is down 12 percent. 
   But there's much more to his story. In another of his initiatives, he used Crime Law grants to put non-uniform police in every high school as Youth Resource Officers. Again, students get the message that, one, violence, bullying, drugs, gangs and guns will not be tolerated; and second, police are role models, coaches and mentors. 
   Under Colonel Ellingsworth, the Delaware State Police have established Community Police sub-stations in shopping malls, local communities--even in a converted laundry room in an apartment complex in Georgetown, Delaware. The goal and message are simple: police need to be on the beat to help prevent and readily respond to crime. 
   Colonel Ellingsworth's legacy to the Delaware State Police is even deeper than his accomplishments in reducing crime. The Delaware Crime Statistical Center is now state-of-the-art. The State's crime data is linked with the National Crime Information Center. Delaware's Sex Offender Registry was created under his watch and with his persistent doggedness that Delaware get this system implemented efficiently and effectively. 
   During his tenure, Colonel Ellingsworth presided over the memorable 75th Anniversary of the Delaware State Police and successfully pursued the fund-raising, building and dedication of the new Delaware State Police Museum. 
   During his career, Colonel Ellingsworth has received numerous awards and commendations, including Trooper of the Year in 1979 and 1985-- In the history of the Delaware State Police, he is the only officer who has been named Trooper of the Year twice. He also has received three Superintendent's Citations, and he was selected as the Crime Stoppers' Detective of the Year. 
   He is a 1988 graduate of the FBI's National Academy, and a 1987 graduate of the Pennsylvania State University Police Executive Development Institute. 
   As we like to say in Delaware, Colonel Ellingsworth is ``home grown.'' He was born in Sussex County, a 1972 graduate of Sussex Central High School, received his bachelor and master's degrees from Wilmington College, and now lives in Bear with his wife Ann Marie and their three daughters, Amanda, Lauren and Megan. 
   Mr. President, it is my great privilege to honor Colonel Ellingsworth on his career as Delaware's top police officer. His officers are the first to say he has served as a real ``trooper's trooper.'' He has been an officer who is tough as nails when solving a heinous crime, yet he always could be counted on as a sensitive shoulder of support to families of officers killed or injured in the line of duty. I will miss his counsel and advice, and I wish him and his family Godspeed, good health and good fortune in the years ahead.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution designating October 15, 1999, as ``National Mammography Day''. I have submitted a similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by approving it. 
   Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I look at the latest information from the American Cancer Society about breast cancer. This year, the news is depressingly familiar: in 1999, an estimated 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an estimated 43,300 women will die of this disease. 
   In the midst of these gloomy numbers, however, one statistic stands out like a beacon of hope: the 5-year survival rate for women with localized breast cancer is a whopping 97%. Moreover, we already know one sure-fire method for detecting breast cancer when it is at this early, highly curable stage: periodic mammograms for all women over age 40. Periodic mammography can detect a breast cancer almost 2 years earlier than it would have been detected by breast self-examination. The importance of periodic mammography for women's health is recognized by health plans and health insurers, and virtually all of them cover its cost. Low-income women who do not have health insurance can get free mammograms through a breast cancer screening program sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   Given all this, that modern mammography is highly effective in discovering breast cancer at a very early stage, rarely causes any discomfort, and generally cost nothing, why aren't all women over 40 getting this valuable test every year? One answer is that we are human, and we all forget things, especially as we get older. Even if we remember that we need a mammogram, we often have so many things going on in our lives that we just keep putting the mammogram off for that ``less busy'' day that never comes. Consequently, we need a ``National Mammography Day'' to remind us that we need to make sure all the women in our lives don't overlook this crucial preventive service. 
   How should we use ``National Mammography Day'' to achieve our goal of fighting breast cancer through early diagnosis? This year, National Mammography Day falls on Friday, October 15, right in the middle of National Breast Cancer Awareness month. On that day, let's make sure that each women we know picks a specific date on which to get a mammogram each year. I well understand how easy it is to forget do something that comes around only once per year, but for each of us there are certainly some dates that we don't forget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day our taxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to get a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the others that love you and want you to be part of their lives for as long as possible. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast cancer by cosponsoring this resolution to designate October 15, 1999, as National Mammography Day.

   Mr. BIDEN. I would like to welcome the guest Chaplain as well and say, in light of Mark Twain's reputation, Rev. Coleman could have helped him a great deal in his attitude with a little enlightenment in spiritual matters. 
   I think Hannibal could have used the Reverend back in the time of Mark Twain. It might have been a little bit different. I love Mark Twain, but he was a little wry. And I just want everyone to know I recognize the irony of the guest Chaplain being from Hannibal, MO, the home of Mark Twain.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is finally considering the nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be the United States Representative to the United Nations. 
   Before stating my reasons why I strongly believe that Ambassador Holbrooke should be confirmed, let me briefly review the process which led us to this day. 
   In June 1998, the President announced his intention to nominate Ambassador Holbrooke for the job of UN Ambassador. The formal nomination was delayed, however, until February of this year by an investigation into alleged ethical violations by Ambassador Holbrooke. 
   That investigation culminated in a settlement with the Department of Justice in which Ambassador Holbrooke agreed to pay five thousand dollars in civil penalties. 
   Once the Senate received the nomination in February, the Committee on Foreign Relations conducted its own inquiry, reviewing in great detail the investigation conducted by the State Department Inspector General and the Department of Justice. 
   In June, the Committee conducted three separate hearings on Ambassador Holbrooke's nomination, reviewing first the ethical matters, then reviewing issues related to the United Nations and UN reform, and then reviewing Ambassador Holbrooke's involvement in United States policy toward the Balkans. 
   On June 30 the Committee voted unanimously--on a voice vote--to report Ambassador Holbrooke's nomination to the full Senate. 
   Since the Committee reported Mr. Holbrooke's nomination, it has been subjected to a variety of reported ``holds'' by several senators, only one of which, as I understand it, had anything to do with Mr. Holbrooke's qualifications to be ambassador. 
   This delay is quite extraordinary for a position of this importance. The last two UN ambassadors were confirmed on the same day that the Committee voted, and in the last two decades, the Senate has, on average, voted within four days of the Committee's vote. 
   But we have now worked through all those and we are here today, for which I am grateful to the Majority Leader and the Chairman. 
   I believe the Senate should confirm Ambassador Holbrooke for a simple reason: he is highly qualified for the job. 
   There are few people who have had the kind of diplomatic experience that Ambassador Holbrooke has had. 
   Ambassador Holbrooke had been in public service since the early 1960s, when he entered the Foreign Service. Since then, he has served in a wide variety of diplomatic positions--in each case with distinction. 
   In the Carter Administration, he served as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Appointed at the age of 37, at the time he was the youngest person ever appointed as assistant secretary. 
   In 1993, Ambassador Holbrooke returned to government service as Ambassador to Germany. 
   In September 1994, he became Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs. Again, Ambassador Holbrooke established a precedent: he became the first person to serve as assistant secretary of state for two different geographic regions. 
   A key challenge facing him upon his return to the United States was the conflict in Bosnia, which by then had been raging since April 1992. 
   As Assistant Secretary, Mr. Holbrooke helped design and implement a strategy that culminated in the signing of the Dayton Accords in November 1995, which brought an end to the Bosnian war. 
   Of course, several people in the U.S. government deserve credit for the success at Dayton. But it cannot be denied that Ambassador Holbrooke--and the creativity and tenacity he brought to the task--was critical to bringing about this diplomatic achievement. 
   In February 1996, for personal reasons, Ambassador Holbrooke resigned from full-time government service. At  the request of Secretary of State Christopher, he remained available to undertake special missions and to advise senior officials in the State Department. In 1997, President Clinton also asked him to become special Presidential envoy for Cyprus. 
   Throughout the three and one-half year period since leaving full-time government service, Ambassador Holbrooke has never been paid a dime for his efforts. 
   Mr. President, I daresay that there are few people with the diplomatic experience that Mr. Holbrooke will bring to the job of UN ambassador. He has significant experience at high levels of government. He has deep experience in two regions. And he has recently supervised and managed a major diplomatic conference that culminated in the end of a tragic war. 
   Let me state it as bluntly as I know how: we need Dick Holbrooke in New York and we need him there now. It has been nearly a year since we have had a UN ambassador. 
   The agenda facing the next UN ambassador is a long one. 
   The United Nations is taking the lead in establishing a civilian administration in Kosovo. We need someone with Dick Holbrooke's skill and knowledge to make sure it gets done right. 
   The United Nations is greatly in need of reform. We have promised the UN that we will pay nearly one billion dollars in back dues if these reforms are made. Ambassador Holbrooke promised that UN reform will be his ``highest sustained priority.'' We need someone with Dick Holbrooke's negotiating skills to help bring them about. 
   The UN Security Council remains seized with the issue of dismantling Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction. We need someone with Dick Holbrooke's toughness to carry that task forward. 
   In sum, I believe Ambassador Holbrooke has all the qualities necessary to be an excellent UN ambassador, and I believe that the Senate should confirm him forthwith. 
   Let me turn briefly to the issues that delayed Mr. Holbrooke's nomination. 
   Last July, soon after the President announced his intention to nominate Mr. Holbrooke, an anonymous letter arrived in the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of State alleging that Ambassador Holbrooke may have violated ethics laws and regulations. 
   Spurred by this letter, the Inspector General opened a wide-ranging investigation that took over five months, involved dozens of interviews, and the production of thousands of pages of records. 
   Earlier this year, while the nomination was pending, the Inspector General opened a second investigation, this time based only on an oped article in the Washington Post. 
   The first investigation culminated in a civil settlement between Ambassador Holbrooke and the Department of Justice in which Ambassador Holbrooke agreed to pay five thousand dollars to settle allegations that he violated Section 207(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code. 
   To this day, Ambassador Holbrooke denies that he violated the law, but he settled the matter in order to avoid further delay of the nomination. The second investigation was closed almost as quickly as it was opened, with no punishment imposed against Ambassador Holbrooke. 
   The Committee obtained the thousands of pages of documents that were produced in the investigations of Ambassador Holbrooke, and has reviewed them independently. 
   I have reviewed all these matters closely, and I do not believe that they even begin to rise to the level where they should be considered disqualifying. 
   I do not make this statement lightly. I am a strong supporter of the ethics laws, and believe they must be rigorously enforced. Government employees, as Ambassador Holbrooke stated in his first hearing before the Committee, must maintain the public trust. 
   I have known Richard Holbrooke for two decades, and am presumptuous enough to call him a friend. I do not believe that he is an unethical person, and I find totally inconsistent with his character any suggestion that he is. 
   On the contrary: Dick Holbrooke is a dedicated public servant who, as the record compiled by the Committee demonstrates, willingly devoted dozens--if not hundreds--of hours to assisting the government in the past several years, to the detriment of his commitment to his private employer. 
   Every senator can be assured that the Committee has left no stone unturned. 
   The Committee sought and received access to every document reviewed by the investigators, and received access to internal documents of the White House, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice, including the memorandum setting forth the reasons why a criminal prosecution of Mr. Holbrooke was not warranted. 
   Mr. President, my friend from Virginia is very diplomatic. My friend from Virginia is a man of grace and elegance. My friend from Virginia is a man who is able to get things done not merely because of his intellect but because of his style. 
   I am not as elegant as my friend from Virginia, so I will just say it out loud. This would not have happened without my friend from Virginia. The truth of the matter is, it took a Republican of stature, seniority, and influence in this area to break this loose. He is going to get mad at my saying this, but I think it is a shame that was required, but I thank him for it because he was relentless over the last 5 months in trying to get us to this point today. 
   I will ruin his reputation here, but the President owes him a debt of gratitude, the Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, the Senate owes him a debt of gratitude, and Mr. Holbrooke, I know, is grateful for his effort. Because as the Senator from Virginia indicated, there is a significant agenda facing our next Ambassador to the United Nations.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I never had a doubt, nor did any of my colleagues, that if we ever got any forum in which we could discuss the qualifications of Richard Holbrooke, he would win unanimously. We never doubted that. But it took a lot to get it to the Foreign Relations Committee, to get a vote in the Foreign Relations Committee, and once it got to the floor, to move it forward. 
   I want to say something about these holds. I have been here 27 years. I have been a sitting Senator longer than the Senator from Virginia. There are only seven people who have been in the entire Senate longer than I. We have lost our sense of proportion. Holds have nothing to do with--nothing to do with--the balance of power here when used in the fashion they were used. 
   Let me explain what I mean by that. It is one thing to say, I am going to hold up that bill from passing because the bill left out two bridges in my State that are critical to the commerce of my State. There is a correlation between the spending of money and the impact on my State--a sense of proportion. 
   If I say that I am going to hold up the next Director of NASA because I want answers on how the space program is going to work, that is reasonable. There is a sense of proportion. There is a relationship between NASA and the head of NASA. 
   But when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for several years, or were I to become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I said: By the way--and, by the way, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee did not do this--were I to say: You know, I realize the President's nominee for the Supreme Court may be a good guy, or good woman, but I'm going to hold her up because the Dover Air Force Base is being closed, that is no sense of proportion, that is an abuse of power--an abuse of power. That is totally unreasonable. 
   Let's get straight what this was about. We held up one of the single most important foreign policy personnel decisions to be made by this administration. And not a person in this  Senate would disagree with that assertion. Why? Because one Senator wanted someone on the Federal Election Commission whom he did not get, and another Senator thought that some second-tier person who worked at the U.S. mission to the U.N., who in fact was disciplined, should not have been disciplined. 
   The process in the law that calls for review of that person's case is underway. The person who helped write that process into the law decides that the process isn't working quickly enough or getting the result he wants, so they hold up the Ambassador to the United Nations at this moment in our history. 
   I respect both the gentlemen who did those things personally, but I respectfully suggest--as we Catholics say, when you are a little kid and you go to confession, they say you learn to examine your conscience. Go examine your conscience and tell me whether there is any sense of proportion. 
   As I stated earlier, since 1981, in the case of nominations for UN ambassador, the average amount of time--the number of days between the time that nominee was reported by the Foreign Relations Committee and the time that that nominee was voted on in the Senate was 4 days--4 days. 
   The reason I mention this is, you know what I am afraid of? I say to my friend from Virginia and my Republican colleagues. When the Democratic Party takes control, we are going to learn wrong lessons from you all, we are going to learn the wrong lessons. 
   I remember when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we had the Clarence Thomas nomination. Before Anita Hill came along we had a vote, and it was 7-7. Guess what. Technically, that means he did not get enough votes to be voted out. I had some very liberal Democrats, hard-edged Democrats, like your hard-right Republicans, say: Mr. Chairman, it's within your power not to report him to the floor. 
   How responsible would it have been for me, as the chairman of the committee--which I could have done--to prevent the Senate from voting on a Supreme Court nominee? The Republicans would have done that, based on their conduct on this nomination. And guess what. If it happens again, mark my words, Democrats are going to join this place who are going to learn all the wrong lessons from this abuse of power, this lack of proportionality. 
   I am not going to say any more about it. The reason I am not is that it is done. But I really, truly hope and plead with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, have a sense of proportion here. We dodged a bullet here because of the incredible work of Senator HELMS and Senator WARNER on the Republican side and the eventual yielding on the part of others. Reason ultimately 
   prevailed. But this is a bad, bad, bad practice; and this is a good, good, good nominee. 
   I will conclude, because others want to speak, by stressing two points about Mr. Holbrooke. One, in all my years in the Senate, no one in the Senate who has come before our committee is more qualified to do the job for which he has been nominated than this man--none; not one. 
   Secondly, this is an ethical man. This man's ethics have been questioned under what I believe to be an aberration. We put in the law--and I voted for inspectors general, but guess what. The law can be triggered by an article in a newspaper. That can hold up a nomination for months and months, requiring intensive investigation. This is the most investigated man we have had for the United Nations, and there is not an unethical drop of blood in this guy's veins. 
   So I think there are three things we have to do. 
   Let's put this man in place. Let this incredible energy and intellectual horsepower that this fellow has go to work on behalf of America. Two, let's reexamine whether or not we exercised any proportionality here in holding this up. And three, I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider joining with me and going back and relooking at the way in which the inspector general's office is triggered and worked so we avoid this kind of thing in the future.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which provides equity for a group of veterans at their final moment: those veterans who are buried in State-owned veterans' cemeteries. 
   For a number of years, the amount of space in national veterans' cemeteries has been rapidly declining. With the strong encouragement of the Federal government, the States have undertaken to develop their own veterans' cemeteries. When certain categories of veterans are buried without charge in these State veterans' cemeteries, the Federal government pays the State a $150 ``plot allowance'' for the burial space. However, only limited categories of veterans are covered by this payment: those who were discharged for disability or who were receiving disability-related compensation; those who died in a veterans hospital; and those indigent veterans whose bodies were unclaimed after death. 
   For the many other veterans who don't fall into one of these few categories, the federal government will pay nothing for their burial space if they are buried in a State veterans' cemetery. By contrast, if any of these veterans were buried in a national veterans' cemetery, for which they are eligible, the federal government picks up the cost of the burial space. This disparity seems inexplicable, a final insult to the dedicated service of men and women who unselfishly served their country. 
   My bill removes this inequity by stating that, for any veteran who is eligible for burial in a national veterans' cemetery but who is interred in a State veterans' cemetery, the federal government will pay the State a $150 plot allowance for the burial space. That's it. No ifs, ands, or buts. No exceptions. 
   The government promised these veterans that they would be taken care of in their final passage, and it must live up to this vow. Regardless of whether veterans are buried in a State cemetery or in a national cemetery, their service in the armed forces benefitted all of us, and we should stop quibbling about whether the location of the grave has anything to do with the dignity and selflessness of the service to the country. 
   Mr. President, I urge my fellow Senators to support this bill in the name of fairness and in recognition of the service to the country of all our veterans in their final hour.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it has taken a lot of tough choices here in Washington--and a lot of hard work and restructuring in the private economy--to put our country's budget into the black. For the first time in a generation, we have a balanced federal budget. And for the first time in our modern history, we can project substantial surpluses for the foreseeable future. 
   There were times I believed we would never see this day, Mr. President, but our official forecasts now call for as much as one trillion dollars in surplus over the next ten years. That's on top of the two trillion in Social Security surpluses that will build up over that same time, money that is already promised to future retirees. 
   I want to say something about whether we should count on those surpluses actually materializing, Mr. President, but first I want to talk about what most families I know would do if they woke up to the kind of windfall in their household budgets that we anticipate in our federal budget today. 
   Take your average family, Mr. President, with a mortgage, maybe paying for one or two children already in college, maybe another child with college still in his or her future. They have some debts, some worries about how to pay for a retirement that gets closer every year, some aspirations for their children that they may not be able to afford. Maybe Grandma and Grandad have moved in with them, bringing with them some health care problems that add to the family's expenses. 
   Let's assume that after years of spending more than they took in, our family finally turns the corner. Let's borrow a story from today's new high-tech economy and say that the stock they hold in their new start-up company has just jumped in value. They cannot be sure that the stock will stay that high next year, or the year after that, but they feel a whole lot richer than they did before. 
   Now let's picture the discussion around their kitchen table, with this new problem to discuss. I'm betting that most of the families I know in Delaware would make plans to pay down their past debts, the mortgage hanging over their heads, make provisions for their children's education, their parents' health needs, and their own retirement. Maybe, after they had taken care of those priorities, they would allow themselves to relax and enjoy a more affluent lifestyle.  
   Mr. President, I don't claim that this is a perfect analogy to the situation before us in the Senate. I certainly don't claim that for many hardworking Americans sensible tax relief is some kind of luxury. But I think it makes an important point, which is simply that most Americans would be a lot more cautious, and a lot more prudent, in using any anticipated surplus in their family budget. 
   Those are the priorities that I think should guide us in our deliberations today. We should take the opportunity given us with the expectation of future budget surpluses first to pay down the debt that has built up in a generation of deficit finance, then we should restore solvency to Social Security and Medicare, and then we should prevent further erosion in funding for national security, law enforcement, education, and the other basic functions of a space-age, high-technology, industrial economy. 
   I think we can do all that, Mr. President, and still provide tax relief to the millions of Americans whose hard work and sacrifice--through downsizing, restructuring, and all the rest--has been the real driving force behind the remarkable economy we enjoy today. 
   But as we all know, Mr. President, the forecasts on which our projected surpluses are based make a lot of assumptions. That's all well and good for making long-term economic projections. But it is not good enough, as far as I'm concerned, for making long term economic policy. 
   I ask my colleagues to listen to some of these assumptions, and to answer honestly if our country can really afford the nearly $800 billion tax cut before us today. 
   The surplus that is forecast assumes no major interruption in the economic growth we have enjoyed in what is now the longest economic expansion in our history. That unprecedented economic growth has kept 
   revenues strong enough to meet and exceed our spending plans. But as Alan Greenspan has reminded us, it is not a question of if, but when, that growth will slow. Still, those who call for an $800 billion tax cut are basing policy on the false hope that inevitable day will never come. 
   Mr. President, the surplus that some of my colleagues want to use to pay for this tax cut also assumes that there will be no emergencies--no Bosnias, no Kosovos, no Iraqs, no hurricanes, no floods--that could increase spending, even though we regularly spend an average of $8 billion a year on such emergencies. 
   The surplus also assumes that we will continue deep cuts in national defense, in education, health care, law enforcement, in environmental protection. It assumes that we will continue to reduce spending beyond the current levels, levels that are already causing gridlock in our budget process this year. Right now, Mr. President, spending for the basic functions of government--as well as the number of people we pay to perform those functions, down more than 340,000 in the past seven years--are both at levels we have not seen since 1962. 
   We should recognize the hard work that achieved those low numbers, Mr. President. They are an important part of how we got to where we are today, with a balanced budget in hand, and surpluses in sight. As the private sector has become leaner and more efficient, the federal government has also moved in the same direction. 
   But we must also realize that national defense, the FBI, medical research, education, veterans' health care, air traffic control, water quality--all of those things we have learned to count on as citizens of the richest nation the world has ever known--combined now comprise just 6.5 percent of GDP. But the surpluses my colleagues expect to be there to pay for this tax cut depend on pushing that down to just 5 percent of GDP--a further cut of more than 20 percent. 
   But after years of defense cuts at the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon is asking for substantial increases to meet future threats. I agree with those who see the need for further investments in our nation's defense. If we actually increase defense spending to meet that request, we would have to cut the remaining functions of the federal government by almost forty percent. 
   Now, Mr. President, I hear a lot of calls for responsible budgeting these days, but I don't hear many people calling for cutting forty percent from our law enforcement, education, or health care programs. For example, cuts of those size would eliminate health care for 1,430,000 of our country's veterans. Cuts of that size would eliminate $6.0 billion from the research into cancer and other diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Cuts of that size would require the FBI to cut over 4,000 agents from its current force of 10,600. 
   That's what a $800 billion tax cut would require, Mr. President--either cuts of unacceptable size in basic services, or, just as bad, we would simply return to the destructive path of deficit spending. 
   Mr. President, one thing that ought to sober us up is what Alan Greenspan has been saying about delaying any tax cut until the surpluses actually materialize, until a downturn in the economy might justify the boost that would come from a tax cut. Twice he has come here to Congress in the past two weeks, to tell us that he continues to be concerned about our economy overheating, and that he is prepared to bump interest rates up again to prevent that from happening. 
   Every American with a mortgage should think long and hard about the trade off between a tax break now and the long term costs that an increase in interest rates would mean. The Treasury Department estimates that a household in the lower 60 percent of the population--10 percent above the middle and on down--would get just an average of $174 a year from the tax plan before us today. But a one percent increase in a 7 percent mortgage on a $250,000 house amounts to over $2,000 a year in additional payments. That is not a deal any informed American would take, Mr. President. 
   If Greenspan thinks the economy is already at risk of overheating, imagine his reaction if we throw an $800 billion tax cut into his calculations the next time he considers increasing interest rates. 
   Everybody here knows that low interest rates and low inflation have been the keys that have unlocked the potential of our economy. I can't think of anything more likely to throw both of those keys out the window than a return to unbalanced budgets. 
   That is why I will oppose a tax cut of the size before us here today. Not because Americans don't deserve tax relief--of course they do. But they also deserve our best judgement about how we manage the public finances of their country after so many years of deficit financing. And as far as I'm concerned, I'll take my guidance from the common sense of the average American family, and put first the priorities of debt reduction, Social Security and Medicare, funding national security and law enforcement, education and health care, and then, a more prudent, sensible tax cut.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise first to compliment my senior colleague from Delaware on his effectiveness. We agree on an awful lot of things. We disagreed on this tax bill, but that in no way diminishes my admiration for his effectiveness. As a matter of fact, this is one of the few occasions I wish he were not as effective as he has been. 
   I compliment him and I echo the comments of my friend from New York who said he is held in affection by Members on both sides of the aisle. I am first among those. I congratulate him for his success. I will not use the word ``deplore,'' but I disagree strongly with the outcome. However, I admire the way in which he--and maybe only he--could have been able to put this together.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, yesterday the Committee on Foreign Relations held a remarkable hearing on the prospects for democracy in Yugoslavia. Testifying were two of the Administration's top Balkan experts, two leading representatives of the non-governmental organization community with wide and deep experience in the Balkans, the executive director of the Office of External Affairs of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the United States, and a courageous woman from Belgrade who chairs the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia. 
   One of the many topics raised during this hearing was the question of the correctness of the decision of the United States to refuse to give reconstruction assistance--as distinct from humanitarian assistance--to Serbia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains in control in Belgrade. I completely support the Administration's policy in this matter, which, I am certain, comes as no surprise to any of my colleagues. 
   Since on this very day President Clinton and more than forty other world leaders are meeting in Sarajevo to discuss a so-called Balkans Stability Pact, which would deliver reconstruction assistance on a regional basis, I thought it would be appropriate at this time briefly to discuss two alleged historical parallels, one of which I believe is fallacious, the other which I would assert is directly applicable to the current situation. 
   At yesterday's hearing it was asserted that there was a moral imperative for NATO countries to offer reconstruction aid to Serbia just as after World War II the United States included Germany in its Marshall Plan assistance. 
   Mr. President, I would submit that this intended parallel falls short in several respects. First of all, in spite of twelve brutal years of criminal Nazi rule, post-war Germany still had the democratic tradition of Weimar as a basis for rebuilding its political system, with several prominent surviving leaders. Nothing like that exists in Serbia today. There are no Serbian Konrad Adenauers or Kurt Schumachers. 
   Secondly, the United States made as preconditions for Marshall plan assistance adherence to democracy, free-market capitalism, and cooperation with neighboring countries. Needless to say, the Serbia of Slobodan Milosevic would qualify on none of those grounds. 
   Finally, in order to guide post-war Germany toward democracy, the victorious allies occupied the country, dividing up responsibility into four zones. The Soviets quickly made clear their intention to impose communism in what became East Germany, and Stalin pressured the East Germans and other satellite countries to refuse the offer of Marshall Plan aid. In the U.S., British, and French zones of Germany, however, hundreds of thousands of troops and civilian officials essentially ran political life until the Federal Republic of Germany was established in 1949, and allied troops have remained until today. 
   It may well be that in order to bring Serbia into the family of democratic nations just such an international occupation would have to happen, but it is simply not in the cards. 
   So, Mr. President, the alleged parallel of today's Serbia with 
   post-war Germany is totally inappropriate. 
   There is, however, a historical parallel chronologically much closer to today, which is, in fact, an appropriate one. That is the case of the Republika Srpska, one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
   After the Dayton Accords were signed in late 1995 and the two entities--the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska--were established, the Congress of the United States put together a reconstruction assistance package. Because of the brutal crimes of the Bosnian Serbs under Radovan Karadzic from 1992 to 1995, the legislation excluded the new Republika Srpska, then under Karadzic's control, from any reconstruction assistance except for infrastructural projects like energy and water, which spanned the inter-entity boundary line with the Federation. That meant that in the immediate post-Dayton period the Federation received about ninety-eight percent of American development assistance to Bosnia. 
   Largely as a result of this policy, the Federation's economy immediately began to recover from the war, while the Republika Srpska, under Karadzic's control in the town of Pale, stagnated. 
   But our policy has not been one exclusively of sticks; there have also been carrots. If localities in the Republika Srpska cooperated with Dayton implementation, the U.S. Agency for International Development was prepared to channel assistance to them. USAID lays down strict conditions in contracts with the individual localities. The policy is not perfect, and it is carefully monitored by Congress. But, in general, it has worked, and it has had positive results. 
   People in the Republika Srpska saw the economic resuscitation of the Federation and noticed the assistance that a few of their own localities were receiving. They compared this modest, but undeniable economic progress with the persistent, grinding poverty of most of the Republika Srpska, led by Karadzic and his corrupt, criminal gang in Pale, which had been effectively isolated. The indicted war criminal Karadzic was finally banned from political life, but one of his puppets took his place. 
   No matter how ultra-nationalistic or even racist many of the people in the Republika Srpska were, most of the population caught on pretty quickly that their future was an absolute zero as long as their current leaders stayed in office. 
   The result was a reform movement, initially led by Mrs. Plavsic, which legally wrested control from the Pale thugs and moved the capital of the Republika Srpska to Banja Luka. Last year she lost an election, but the government of the Republika Srpska is now led by Prime Minister Dodik, a genuine democrat, who has survived attempts from Belgrade by Milosevic to unseat him, is supported by a multi-ethnic parliamentary coalition, kept the lid on the situation during the Yugoslav air campaign, and now is beginning to implement Dayton. 
   The situation in Bosnia, as we all know, is far from satisfactory, but real progress has been made. And, back to my original point, in the Republika Srpska we have the real historical parallel of a policy of excluding a government from economic reconstruction assistance as long as it is ruled by an indicted war criminal or his puppet. 
   I hope this discussion of historical precedents may be helpful as the Senate continues to debate our Balkan reconstruction policy.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before I get to the subject I wish to speak to, which is the nuclear test ban treaty, I will address a comment to my colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER. 
   I, as all Democrats and some Republicans, think a tax cut should be progressive and equitable. To tell you the truth, I would like to be in a position to give the wealthy a tax cut if that were the case. That would be fine as long as we first gave the tax cut to the poor and the middle class. 
   I was speaking to the Senator from Illinois a moment ago. In my State, which has, as all of our States, very wealthy individuals, I found an interesting phenomenon. Given a choice, if you go back to my State and ask anybody who made $1 million last year or is likely to make one next year, and said: We can continue the economy to grow the way it has the last 7 years, or give you a $30,000 tax cut a year, there isn't any question what they choose. They say: Whoa, leave well enough alone. I am making a lot more than $30,000 a year in the market. I am making a lot more than $30,000 a year in my investments. I am making a lot more than the $30,000 a year I would get in the tax cut from the lower interest rates. I am making a lot more. 
   How many times have we heard the only thing that has remained constant in this changing economic environment over the last decade is tax cuts are a stimulus? We have one guy sitting at the helm. His name is Greenspan. He has been doing everything but taking an ad in the New York Times to say: Whatever you all do, if this economy heats up, if you stimulate this economy, I am telling you what I am  going to do; I am going to raise interest rates. 
   He hasn't used those exact words, but the market responds to every word he says. 
   I don't know anybody who thinks that if there were almost an $800 billion tax cut, we are not going to have interest rates raised. 
   I don't understand the math. To be more crude about it, I don't even understand the politics. It used to be good politics for our Republican friends to try to paint us into a corner and say: We are for tax cuts; Democrats are not for tax cuts ever. Therefore, Democrats are big spenders; therefore, we are good guys. Therefore, vote for us. 
   I understand that. We do the same thing with them on Social Security. We assume no Republican can be devoted to Social Security, and they assume no Democrat could ever want a tax cut. That is politics. I understand that. 
   The part I don't understand is to whom they are talking. Even their very wealthy constituency--not all wealthy people are Republicans, but it tends to be that way--is saying: Hey, go slow here. 
   I hear the name of Bill Gates thrown around and others such as Gates. They are an aberration even among the wealthy. But the wealthy in my State, if they could pick any one thing out of the Roth tax proposal, I know what it would be. It would be the elimination of the inheritance tax. There are only about 820,000 people in all of America who would be affected by it, but that is something--I happen to disagree with them--that is a big deal. That is a big-ticket item. That is worth a lot more than 30,000 bucks, but that is not the thing that would fuel a heated up economy. I am not proposing that. I am trying to figure out the politics.

   Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to make an observation or a comment. I heard some of our Republican friends use the old phrase ``if it's not broken, don't fix it.'' They can't stand status quo. I think they can't stand the fact that it is happening on Democrats' watch. I think part of the problem is they have to say something. It is similar to cops, the very thing they said would not work. It was terrible what Charlton Heston--or ``Moses'' Heston--said. They are going to have 100,000 social workers. 
   Regarding the deficit reduction package in 1994, every Republican leader stood up and said this will mean chaos, recession, loss of world stature, et cetera, et cetera. They turned out to be wrong; these things are working. Cops are making the crime rate go down. The deficit reduction package worked. We are now in a position where we are doing better than ever. It is as if they have to have something. We politicians, I know, sit there and say if the other party does something, or my opponent does something, and it works, instead of saying it is working, we have to think of something better. 
   I think the public is prepared to give everybody credit. 
   Everybody deserves credit. The people who deserve the most credit are the people in the business community because of their productivity and the way they trimmed down. I can't figure it out. For the first time in my 27 years as a Senator, this seems to fly in the face of the orthodoxy of the Republican Party. I mean, if you had said to me 15 years ago--first of all, I would not have believed what I am about to say. But if you said to me 15 years ago: JOE, in 1999, you are going to be standing on the floor of the Senate, and one of the choices you are going to participate in making is not whether or not we balance the budget but whether we take money and reduce the accumulated national debt or give a tax cut, first of all, I would not have believed that option would be available. I would not have believed we would be in that position. Forget, for a moment, the two pillars: Social Security and Medicare. Leave them aside for a moment. I would have said: First of all, it won't happen. But if it does, on the idea of reducing the national debt, in every basic economics course you took when you were a freshman in college, they said if you can ever reduce the national debt, the impact upon interest rates, the impact upon home rates, the impact upon the economy would be incredible. 
   And then, if you asked me: OK, what do you think the Republican Party would do? I would say that is easy. They would reduce the debt. These are the pay-as-you-go guys, the guys who say pay off your debts. These are the guys who had a clock ticking in your city, in Time Square, or down by the railroad station, Penn Station, a big clock, saying the national debt is going up. It was paid for, I suspect, by some wealthy Republican. So the clock was ticking. And not only have we stopped the growth of the debt, but it is ticking in a way that we can have those numbers go in reverse.

   Mr. BIDEN. No. I must say to my friend from Illinois that I haven't. I really think a legitimate debate--a debate that is a close call, in my view, would be whether or not, for example, we should be spending the surplus to reduce the debt, or spend the surplus--we can do both--or spend more of the surplus to reinforce Social Security and Medicare. That is a traditional debate that we have. Republicans used to argue we are spending too much money on Medicare--not just that it is broken, but we are spending too much; and Social Security is inflated and we should be cutting it back. 
   If you told me 15 years ago that the debate would be Democrats saying let's not put as much away to reduce the debt, put more in Social Security and Medicare, and with what is left reduce the debt, and the Republicans would have been saying let's reduce the debt, and once that is done, let's try to fix Medicare and Social Security--well, I don't know. The third rail of politics has become Social Security and Medicare. Obviously, they have to be for that; everybody is for that. So nobody really talks about it. 
   Some courageous guys and women talk about it on the floor, about what we should be doing. But it is just a shame because there is a legitimate debate here. The truth is, for example, if you said to me reduce the debt or spend more money on cops, I would be for spending more money on cops. So it is true that there are some of us in this party who would want to spend more of the surplus for worthwhile things, such as education, law enforcement, et cetera. And it is a legitimate debate. They would say: Look, BIDEN wants to spend more money instead of putting it onto the debt. But that is not even a debate. That is not even a debate. 
   The debate now is to give a tax cut that no one seems to want. I would love a tax cut. My total salary is what I make here, and the American people pay me a lot of money. I would love a tax cut. I would love even more--since I have a third child going off to college for the first year, and room, board, and tuition in any private school in this country is about $30,000 a year, I selfishly would love a tax break there. But what I would not love is my adjustable rate mortgage to change. I would not want that to change. Give me a tax cut and one little bump in my adjustable rate mortgage, and I am up more than I can save by the tax cut. So I don't know. 
   Both of our parties are going through a little bit of establishing, going into the 21st century, what the pillars and cornerstones of our philosophies are. Ironically, I think for the change we are sort of a little ahead of the Republicans on where we are. It doesn't mean the American people agree with us. The debate over there seems to be that the jury is still out on where they will go. I hope, for everyone's sake, we get our bearings a little bit because it would truly be a shame if, as a consequence of a political judgment, we imperil what is the most remarkable recovery in the history of the world, essentially. 
   The economy in America has never been stronger within our borders or comparatively internationally. I hope reason takes hold because even I think Republicans and Democrats know more about what the polling data says than I do. But my instinct tells me this is yesterday's fight. This is yesterday's fight, but it could be tomorrow's tragedy if it prevails.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, speaking of polls, which are what I stood up to speak about this morning, I would like to turn to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the comprehensive test ban treaty that was signed nearly three years ago and submitted to the Senate nearly two years ago. The American people overwhelmingly support this treaty, yet it has not even seen the light of day here in the Senate. 
   The Senate, as we all know, is uniquely mandated under the United States Constitution to give its ``advice and consent'' to the ratification of treaties that the United States enters into. In a dereliction of that duty, the Senate is not dealing with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   Why is this occurring? In the view of my colleagues--including some Democrats who support the treaty--this treaty is not high on the agenda of the American people. There is very little political attraction in the issue. It is easy to keep this treaty from being brought up and discussed, because people who care about nuclear testing tend to assume that we already have a nuclear test-ban treaty in force. 
   President Bush did the right thing in accepting a moratorium on any nuclear tests, but that is not a permanent test-ban. It does not bind anybody other than ourselves. It merely implements our own conclusion that we don't have to test nuclear weapons anymore in order to maintain our nuclear arsenal. 
   Faced with this perception on the part of many of our colleagues, several of us encouraged supporters of the Test-Ban Treaty to go out and actually poll the American people. Frankly, we wanted real evidence to show to our colleagues--mostly our Republican colleagues--that the American public actually cares a lot about this issue. 
   I am not going to keep my colleagues in suspense. A comprehensive poll was done. The bottom line is that the American people support this treaty by a margin of 82 percent to 14 percent. That is nearly 6 to 1. 
   For nearly 2 years, we Democrats--and a few courageous Republicans like Senator SPECTER and Senator JEFFORDS--have tried to convince the Republican leadership that this body should move to debate and decide on this treaty. Let the Senate vote for ratification or vote against ratification. The latest poll results are a welcome reminder that the American people are with us on this important issue or, I might add, are way ahead of us. 
   I know some of my colleagues have principled objections to this treaty. I respect their convictions even though I strongly believe they are wrong on this issue. What I cannot respect, however--and what my colleagues should not tolerate--is the refusal of the Republican leadership of this body to permit the Senate to perform its constitutional responsibility to debate and vote on ratification of this vital treaty. It is simply irresponsible, in my view, for the Republican leadership to hold this treaty hostage to other issues as if we were fighting over whether or not we were going to appoint someone Assistant Secretary of State in return for getting someone to become the deputy something-or-other in another Department. This treaty isn't petty politics; this issue affects the whole world. 
   Some of my colleagues believe nuclear weapons tests are essential to preserve our nuclear deterrent. Both I and the directors of our three nuclear weapons laboratories disagree. The $45 billion--yes, I said billion dollars--Stockpile Stewardship Program--that is the name of the program--enables us to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons without weapons tests. 
   The fact is, the United States is in the best position of all the nuclear-weapons states to do without testing. We have already conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests. The Stockpile Stewardship Program harnesses the data from these 1,000 tests along with new 
   high-energy physics experiments and the world's most advanced supercomputers to improve our understanding of how a nuclear explosion--and each part in a weapon--works. 
   In addition, each year our laboratories take apart and examine some nuclear weapons to see how well those parts work. The old data and new experiments enable our scientists to diagnose and fix problems on our existing nuclear weapons systems without full-scale weapons testing. This is already being done. By this means, our nuclear weapons laboratories are already maintaining the reliability of our nuclear stockpile without testing. 
   Still, if nuclear weapons tests should be required in the future to maintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent, then we  will test. The administration has proposed, in fact, that we enact such safeguards as yearly review and certification of the nuclear deterrent and maintenance of the Nevada Test Site. 
   The administration has also made clear that if, in the future, the national interest requires what the treaty binds us not to do, then the President of the United States will remain able to say: ``No. We are out of this treaty. It is no longer in our national interest. We are giving advanced notice. We are going to withdraw.'' 
   Thanks in part to those safeguards I mentioned earlier, officials with the practical responsibility of defending our national security support ratification of the test ban treaty. In addition to the nuclear lab directors, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has spoken in favor of ratification. 
   Support for ratification is not limited, moreover, to the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The four previous Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs--also four-star generals--support ratification as well. Think of that. This treaty is supported by Gen. John Shalikashvili, Gen. Colin Powell, Adm. William Crowe, and Gen. David Jones, all former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs. Those gentleman have guided our military since the Reagan administration. 
   Why would those with practical national security responsibilities support such a treaty? The answer is simple: For practical reasons. 
   Since 1992, pursuant to U.S. law, the United States has not engaged in a nuclear weapons test. As I have explained, we have been able, through ``stockpile stewardship,'' to maintain our nuclear deterrent using improved science, state-of-the-art computations, and our library of past nuclear test results. Other countries were free to test until they signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Now they are bound, as we are, not to test. But that obligation will wither on the vine if we fail to ratify this test ban treaty. 
   One traditional issue on arms control treaties is verification. We always ask whether someone can sign this treaty and then cheat and do these tests without us knowing about it. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will improve U.S. monitoring capabilities, with the rest of the world picking up three-quarters of the cost. The treaty even provides for on-site inspection of suspected test sites, which we have never been able to obtain in the past. 
   Some of my colleagues believe that our imperfect verification capabilities make ratification of the test ban treaty unwise. New or prospective nuclear weapons states can gain little, however, from any low-yield test we might be unable to detect. Even Russia could not use such tests to produce new classes of nuclear weapons. 
   To put it another way, even with the enhanced regimen of monitoring and on-site inspection, it is possible that there could be a low-level nuclear test that would go undetected. But what all of the scientists and nuclear experts tell us is that even if that occurred, it would have to be at such a low level that it would not enable our principal nuclear adversaries and powers to do anything new in terms of their systems and it would not provide any new weapon state the ability to put together a sophisticated nuclear arsenal. 
   For example, the case of China is particularly important. We have heard time and again on the floor of this Senate about the loss, beginning during the Reagan and Bush years, of nuclear secrets and the inability, or the unwillingness, or the laxity of the Clinton administration to quickly close down what appeared to be a leak of sensitive information to the Chinese. We lost it under Reagan and Bush, and the hole wasn't closed under the present administration, so the argument goes. 
   We hear these doomsday scenarios of what that now means--that China has all of this technology available to do these new, terrible things. But guess what? If China can't test this new technology that they allegedly stole, then it is of much less value to them. They have signed the Test-Ban Treaty, and they are prepared to ratify it and renounce nuclear testing forever if we ratify that very same test-ban treaty. 
   Here we have the preposterous notion--for all those, like Chicken Little, who are crying that the sky is falling--that the sky is falling and China is about to dominate us, but, by the way, we are not going to ratify the Test-Ban Treaty. What a foolish thing. 
   The Cox committee--named for the conservative Republican Congressman from California who headed up the commission that investigated the espionage that allegedly took place regarding China stealing nuclear secrets from us--the Cox committee warned that China may have stolen nuclear codes. Congressman COX explained, however, that a China bound by the Test-Ban Treaty is much less likely to be able to translate its espionage successes into usable weapons. 
   As I noted, however, the Test-Ban Treaty will wither on the vine if we don't ratify it. Then China would be free to resume testing. If we fail to take the opportunity to bind China on this Test-Ban Treaty, that mistake will haunt us for generations and my granddaughters will pay a price for it. 
   The need for speedy ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is greater than ever before. In India and Pakistan, the world has watched with mounting concern over the past 2 months as those two self-proclaimed nuclear-weapons states engaged in a conventional conflict that threatened to spiral out of control. 
   Were nuclear weapons to be used in this densely populated area of the world, the result would be a horror unmatched in the annals of war. 
   This breaches the postwar firebreak against nuclear war--which has stood for over 50 years--with incalculable consequences for the United States and the rest of the world. 
   The India-Pakistan conflict may be back under control for now. President Clinton took an active interest in it, and that seems to have been important to the process in cooling it down. The threat of nuclear holocaust remains real, however, and it remains particularly real in that region of the world. We can help prevent such a calamity. India and Pakistan have promised not to forestall the Test-Ban Treaty's entry into force. They could even sign the treaty by this fall. The Test-Ban Treaty could freeze their nuclear weapons capabilities and make it harder for them to field nuclear warheads on their ballistic missiles. 
   This will not happen unless we, the United States, accept the same legally binding obligation to refrain from nuclear weapons tests. Thus, we in the Senate have the power to influence India and Pakistan for good or for ill. God help us if we should make the wrong choice and lose the opportunity to bring India and Pakistan back from the brink. 
   This body's action or lack of action may also have a critical impact upon worldwide nuclear nonproliferation. Next spring, the signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will hold a review conference. (The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is a different treaty; the treaty that we still must ratify bans nuclear weapons testing, while the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was ratified decades ago, bans the development of nuclear weapons by countries that do not already have them.) If the United States has not ratified the Test-Ban Treaty by the time of the review conference, nonnuclear-weapons states will note that we promised a test-ban treaty 5 years ago in return for the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. What we will do if we don't ratify is risk undermining the nonproliferation resolve of the nonnuclear weapon states. 
   Ask any Member in this Chamber--Democrat or Republican; conservative, liberal, or moderate--get them alone and ask them what is their single greatest fear for their children and their grandchildren. I defy any Member to find more than a handful who answer anything other than the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue states and terrorists. Everybody agrees with that. 
   We have a nonproliferation treaty out there, and we have got countries who don't have nuclear weapons to sign, refraining from ever becoming a nuclear weapons state. But in return, we said we will refrain from testing nuclear weapons and increasing our nuclear arsenals. 
   Now what are we going to do? If we don't sign that treaty, what do you think will happen when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty signatories get together in the fall and say: ``OK, do we want to keep this commitment  or not?'' If the United States says it is not going to promise not to test anymore, then China will say it will not promise not to test either. India and Pakistan will say they are not going to promise to refrain from testing. What do you think will happen in every country, from rogue countries such as Syria, all the way to countries in Africa and Latin America that have the capability to develop nuclear weapons? Do you think they will say: ``It is a good idea that we don't attempt ever to gain a nuclear capability, the other big countries are going to do it, but not us?'' I think this is crazy. 
   Let me be clear. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty must not be treated as a political football. It is a matter of urgent necessity to our national security. If the Senate should fail to exercise its constitutional responsibility, the very future of nuclear nonproliferation could be at stake. 
   Two months ago I spoke on the Senate floor about the need for bipartisanship, the need to reach out across the chasm, reach across that aisle. Today I reach out to the Republican leadership that denies the Senate--and the American people--a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I was joined on Sunday by the Washington Post, which spoke out in an editorial against what it termed ``hijacking the test ban.'' I will not repeat the editorial comments regarding my friend from North Carolina who chairs the committee. I do call to the attention of my colleagues, however, one salient question from that editorial:  
   One wonders why his colleagues, of whatever party or test ban persuasion, let him go on.  
   I have great respect for my friend from North Carolina. He has a deep-seated philosophical disagreement with the Test-Ban Treaty, and I respect that. I respect the majority leader, Mr. LOTT, who has an equally compelling rationale to be against the Test-Ban Treaty. I do not respect their unwillingness to let the whole Senate debate and vote on this in the cold light of day before the American people and all the world. 
   A poll that was conducted last month will not surprise anybody who follows this issue. But it should serve as a reminder to my colleagues that the American people are not indifferent to what we do here. 
   The results go beyond party lines. Fully 80 percent of Republicans--and even 79 percent of conservative Republicans--say that they support the Test-Ban Treaty. 
   And this is considered opinion. In May of last year, the people said that they knew some countries might try to cheat on the test-ban. But they still supported U.S. ratification, by a 73-16 margin. As already announced, today's poll results show even greater support than we had a year ago. 
   Last year's polls also show a clear view on the public's part of how to deal with the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. When asked how to respond to those tests, over 80 percent favored getting India and Pakistan into the Test-Ban Treaty and over 70 percent saw U.S. ratification as a useful response. 
   By contrast, fewer than 40 percent wanted more spending on U.S. missile defense; and fewer than 25 percent wanted us to resume nuclear testing. 
   The American people understood something that had escaped the attention of the Republican leadership: that the best response to India and Pakistan's nuclear tests is to rope them in to a test-ban, which requires doing the same for ourselves. 
   The American people reach similar conclusions today regarding China's possible stealing of U.S. nuclear weapons secrets. When asked about its implications for the Test-Ban Treaty, 17 percent see this as rendering the Treaty irrelevant; but nearly three times as many--48 percent--see it as confirming the importance of the Treaty. Once again, the American people are ahead of the Republican leadership. 
   The American people see the Test-Ban Treaty as a sensible response to world-wide nuclear threats. In a choice between the Treaty and a return to U.S. nuclear testing, 84 percent chose the Treaty. Only 11 percent would go back to U.S. testing. 
   Last month's bipartisan poll--conducted jointly by the Melman Group and Wirthlin Worldwide--asked a thousand people ``which Senate candidate would you vote for: one who favored CTBT ratification, or one who opposed it?'' So as to be completely fair, they even told their respondents the arguments that are advanced against ratification. 
   By a 2-to-1 margin, the American people said they would vote for the candidate who favors ratifying the Treaty. Even Republicans would vote for that candidate, by a 52-42 margin. 
   Now, as a Democrat, I like those numbers. The fact remains, however, that both the national interest and the reputation of the United States Senate are on the line in this matter. 
   The national security implications of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty must be addressed in a responsible manner. There must be debate. There must be a vote. 
   In sum, the Senate must do its duty--and do it soon--so that America can remain the world's leader on nuclear non-proliferation; so that we can help bring India and Pakistan away from the brink of nuclear disaster; and so that the United States Senate can perform its Constitutional duty in the manner that the Founders intended.

   Mr. BIDEN. He began:  
   The time has come for Senate action on the CTBT ratification.  
   Senator Hatfield adduces some excellent arguments in favor of ratification, which I commend to my colleagues. But I especially want recommend his conclusion, which summarizes our situation with elegant precision:  
   It is clear to me that ratifying this Treaty would be in the national interest. And it is equally clear that Senators have a responsibility to the world, the nation and their constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the Senate to consider this Treaty.  
   Senators, that says it all.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed S. 1217, the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. I want to take a minute now to express my serious concerns about the low level of funding for embassy security contained in the bill. 
   Just about one year ago, two United States embassies in East Africa were destroyed by terrorist bombs, killing hundreds of people and injuring thousands. The bombings underscored the great vulnerability of our diplomatic missions. In response, Congress promptly provided $1.4 billion in emergency funding to rebuild the two embassies and to take other urgent steps to bolster security at overseas missions. 
   Soon thereafter, two panels were convened by the Secretary of State to review the bombings. The two commissions were chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The Crowe commissions recommended that the U.S. government devote $1.4 billion per year for each of the next ten years to security. 
   Unfortunately, the legislation before the Senate falls far short of what the Crowe commissions recommended. The bill appropriates just $300 million for security in the State Department operations accounts, and just $110 million for security in the capital account. But of this latter amount, only $36 million is provided for construction or renovation of new embassies--$264 million below the President's request. Moreover, the bill rescinds $58 million in previously-appropriated funds in this same account. Neither the bill nor the Committee report explains how these funds will be restored to meet continuing and future needs. 
   Finally, the bill denies the Administration's request for $3.6 billion in advance funding for capital projects for Fiscal Years 2001 to 2005. The Department based this request on bitter experience. In the mid-1980s, after a commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Inman recommended massive increases in embassy security, Congress initially responded by providing significant funding and significant promises. But as the years passed, security became a second-order priority; the requested funding for security was denied by Congress, and some of the money that had been allocated for security was either rescinded by Congress or redirected to other priorities. By the mid-1990s, the Inman Commission report was collecting dust on government bookshelves, its recommendations barely recalled, and funding for security had been reduced considerably. 
   So, understandably, the State Department is skeptical that the grand promises made in the wake of the embassy bombings will be fulfilled. With considerable justification, the State Department experts have told Congress that it can best move forward on a sensible and rational construction program if it can be assured in advance of the necessary funds. Otherwise, the Department of State rightly fears, we will see a repeat of the experience after the Inman Commission. 
   The Committee on Foreign Relations, and then the full Senate, responded to this plea by providing a $3 billion authorization over five years in S. 886, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. But that was just the first step. The authorization will be useless without appropriations. Unfortunately, the Committee on Appropriations has ignored the State Department's request in this bill. 
   I believe this bill breaks faith with the bold promises that were made in the wake of the embassy bombings last summer. We need to do much, much more to protect our dedicated public servants working overseas. I strongly urge the chairman and ranking member to look for additional resources to fund this important account, without compromising the other important foreign affairs accounts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand I have a few minutes to speak, and I will take only a few minutes right now and reserve the remainder of the time when I have completed. 
   I want to be very brief at this point. Mr. President, I want to separate out two aspects of the Gregg amendment: One I wish to compliment him on, and one I am going to remain silent on. The one part I want to compliment him on is that I think the reauthorization of the violent crime trust fund for another 5 years is the single-most significant thing we could do to continue the war on crime. 
   In 1994, when we introduced the Biden crime bill, which eventually became the crime bill of 1994 which had the 100,000 cops in it, the Violence Against Women Act, and many other things, toward the end of that debate, with the significant help of the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, who didn't like many aspects of my bill, and the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, who did like the bill, we all agreed on what was viewed as sort of a revolutionary idea--that crime control was the single-most undisputable responsibility of the Federal Government domestically. We can argue about whether there should be welfare. We can argue about whether we should be involved in education. But no one can argue about the requirement of the Government of the United States to make the streets safe. That is the starting point for all ordered society. 
   So we had an idea, and the three of us joined together to set up a violent crime trust fund. The way we did that was not to raise taxes for America because everybody kept saying: BIDEN, your bill, over the next 5 years, is going to cost over $30 billion. They were r ight. Putting 100,000 cops on the street costs a lot. Building thousands of new prison cells costs a lot. Spending money on prevention costs a lot. The total of the Biden crime bill was about $30 billion over 5 years in 1994 when I introduced it. 
   They said: How are we going to pay for it? None of us likes telling the citizens the truth. We all like lying to you, telling you we are going to find a magic way to do this that is not going to cost you any money. The American public wants safer streets, and they have gotten them, I might add. Crime has gone down significantly every year since the crime bill was introduced. I am not claiming it is only because of that, but it is in large part because of that. 
   So the way we reached this accord was Senator GRAMM, who wanted to see the size of the Federal Government cut even more urgently than--I will speak for myself--even more urgently than I did--we codified, as part of this deal, the agreement that we would let 250,000 Federal employees go. We would shrink the size of the Federal Government. And we did. 
   The second part of the agreement I wanted was that the paycheck we used to pay the person working in the Justice Department or in the Defense Department or at IRS, who was not going to be rehired, we take John Jones' paycheck and put it into a trust fund to do nothing but deal with violent crime in America. Not an innovative notion--that concept of a trust fund--but it is fairly radical in terms of applying a Social Security-type trust fund--only this does have a lockbox--a trust fund of dedicated revenues to deal with nothing but crime. 
   The good news about that and the reason I felt so strongly about that at the time I wrote the bill was it is the one place no one can compete. If it is in general funds--and to people who don't share my view about the single-most important responsibility of Government is to maintain order--it is in competition. If it is general revenues, the COPS Program or the 
   prevention programs or building prisons is in competition with money for education, money for the space program, money for the Defense Department, and money for every other function of the Government. By having this trust fund, though, it is not in competition with anything. It is there. It is set aside. It is similar to a savings account to fight crime. 
   I respectfully suggest that it worked. Now, under the Biden crime bill, which is due to expire this year, the trust fund will end. This special, dedicated pot of money that nobody can compete for, which is not paid for by raising taxes, is paid for by not lowering taxes because it is legitimate to say: BIDEN, if you eliminate the trust funds, you can take John Jones' paycheck, the guy who left the Treasury Department in 1997, and you can give it back to the taxpayers as a tax cut. 
   That is true. But I choose safe streets over tax cuts. The tax cut would be minuscule, I might add. 
   So when I heard that my friend from New Hampshire was taking language essentially the same as the Hatch-Biden bill that passed out of here in juvenile justice, the same as the language I have been reintroducing everywhere I can and in every bill I can in the last 4 years, I thought not only is he an enlightened fellow but there has been a bit of an epiphany, that, my Lord, the powerful chairman of the subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee has seen the Lord, has seen the light, and I was overjoyed. 
   So I said to my staff: I am going to go up there and compliment him. Literally, I said this this morning. They said: Don't be so quick. I said: Why? They said: There is a little kicker here. The kicker is once this amendment that you, BIDEN, have fought so hard for over the last 12 years, even before the crime bill was passed--once it is adopted, there will be a little amendment attached to it that has to do with the way this place functions procedurally, affecting how we can move substantively. 
   I will not speak to that. I will only say and plead with my friend from New Hampshire, if and when the second issue is resolved, however it is resolved, that he not walk away from the substantive beauty of his amendment as it relates to the trust fund. I don't want to get into a fight with him about  legislating on appropriations and second amendments and the rest. I want to say to him publicly that I truly appreciate the practical impact of reestablishing the violent crime trust fund, if we can do it. 
   I hope in this procedural fight that is above my pay grade right now, which is about to take place, that a casualty of this fight will not end up being us committing for another 5 years to do what we did in the last 5 years--bringing crime in America down. The way to do that is to guarantee that the law enforcement agencies of the United States for 5 years do not have to compete with anybody, and we don't have to raise anybody's taxes. We are taking those old paychecks, and we are going to continue to make a deposit, similar to a trust fund in a family, for cops, for prisons, and for prevention.

   Mr. BIDEN. I truly appreciate that because I, quite frankly, think--and this is presumptuous of me to say because you know as much about these issues as I do, clearly--this is the single-most significant thing we can do to continue the successful fight against crime. I authored it, so you might say there is pride of authorship here. But I didn't do this alone. The distinguished Senator from Texas and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia were really the ones who made it happen. I hope, in a bipartisan way, we can continue the funding mechanism. I thank him for his comments. If I have any time, I reserve it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member. This is a bit unusual. I am violating what the Senator from South Carolina would recognize as the Russell Long rule. 
   When I first came to the Senate, Russell Long, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, was chairman of the Finance Committee. One day I walked up to him because I had an amendment to a finance bill. He said: I will accept it. I said: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Then I got back to my seat in the back row, and a staff person who had worked here longer than I had--I had only been here about 3 months--said: Senator, you really want a rollcall vote on that. 
   So I went ahead and I did my little spiel. Then I asked for the yeas and nays. The roll was called, and Russell Long voted against the amendment and encouraged others to vote against it. It was defeated. I walked up to him and said: Mr. Chairman, my Lord, you told me just 15 minutes ago you would accept my amendment. He said: Yes, I would accept your amendment. But I did not say anything about a rollcall vote. 
   We are not going to have, I hope, a rollcall vote on this amendment. I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for accepting the amendment. I apologize to him for speaking on something that is going to be accepted. But I think this is of such consequence that it is important to remind our colleagues of what we are about to redo. 
   A few weeks ago, the Appropriations Committee zeroed out all funding for the COPS Program, nearly closing the doors of what I believe to be the most successful Federal-State cooperative law enforcement program of our time. 
   This amendment corrects the committee's elimination of the funding for the COPS office in the fiscal year 2000. It restores funding for the COPS office to perform many of the significant functions in support of law enforcement--particularly in getting more cops out on the street. 
   In doing so, it supersedes--or, basically, makes void--the language in the committee report on pages 62 and 63 that would have directed the Justice Department to take steps to dismantle the COPS office. Under this amendment, the COPS office will remain alive and well for fiscal year 2000. 
   I am pleased today we have put aside partisan politics in support of this effective law enforcement program. Let me make it clear, although some of my colleagues on the Republican side worry a little bit about this being a Democratic program, it is not a Democratic program. It is a bipartisan program. It is a program where even this amendment has garnered the cosponsorship of four Republicans and the commitment of another several to vote for it. I predict there will be more Republicans to vote for it as well. 
   I am glad that we have listened to the police officers on the street, the police chiefs, the prosecutors, the mayors, the citizens of our communities, and our constituents about why they think the COPS Program has worked so well. 
   As I said, today, joined by 42 of my colleagues, including four Republicans, I offer this amendment to restore the COPS Program for fiscal year 2000. This amendment restores $495 million in funding for the COPS Program for the year 2000. 
   This is just one-third of the $1.43 billion that was appropriated in 1999. But it preserves this vitally important program that has thus far funded over 100,000 cops in communities across the country. 
   Here is how it will work: $170 million will come from unobligated balances for this fiscal year for the COPS office; $5 million in unobligated funds from the Bureau of Prisons; $140 million are shifted back to the COPS office for programs that it already has successfully administered in the past. 
   These include the Cops Connect Program, which provides equipment and upgrades so that officers from different jurisdictions can talk to each other and share vital information; it also includes targeted funding for equipment that protects police officers, such as bulletproof vests; and for training to identify and take down methamphetamine and other drug laboratories. 
   And $180 million are put back into the COPS Program to fund the hiring of up to an additional 2,400 officers in our public school system. 
   Most importantly, this amendment restores to the COPS office its primary function: putting more cops on the street. Under this amendment, there  will be funding sufficient to put 1,500 additional local law enforcement officers out on the streets in our communities. 
   I think we can all agree that this is a small price to pay for lower crime rates, safer communities, safer schools, more advanced law enforcement equipment, and more responsive police departments.

   Mr. BIDEN. It is a challenge for us to apply the lessons we have learned over the past years. More cops on the street means crime goes down. Law enforcement knows this. The American public knows this. We know this. And we must act now. 
   We all recognize the importance to communities across our country of ensuring the continued success of lowering crime rates. 
   Look at this chart. Since the COPS Program began as part of the 1994 crime bill, arrests have gone way up. 
   This is total arrests. Look at all the support we have on this. All the law enforcement organizations endorse this program. The mayors endorse this program. I thank, by the way, these organizations for their continued support of the COPS Program and for their extraordinary help with this amendment in particular. 
   To the law enforcement community, I say thank you. We should all say thank you. We could not have done this without your hard work and support, your phone calls, your letters. Your personal appearances have resonated with all of us. You are always on the frontline on this, and you have always taken a stand against crime. You should be proud. 
   I am proud of them. In a recent survey done for the National Association of Police Organizations, 85 percent of those surveyed think we should extend the COPS Program. The American people don't want the program to end. Although we do not extend the COPS Program beyond its authorized period through this fiscal year, my friend from New Hampshire and my friend from South Carolina know that I have continually attempted to extend the program. I will be back in another fora trying to extend the COPS Program so that we continue this beyond the year 2000. 
   For years, when I first wrote this crime bill, back in the early 1980s, we would debate this, and we would debate it and debate it. The editorial writers in this country, primarily from the most established newspapers, were very critical of my notion that we should vastly increase the number of cops. They would write editorials. One--I think it was one of the major papers, the New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, but I don't recall which--said: Been there, done that. 
   Well, the truth is, we were never there. The truth is, for the previous 20 years, before the Biden crime bill, we did not add appreciably to the number of cops in America. If my memory serves me, in the 20 largest cities in America over the previous 20 years, although crime had grown significantly, we only added about 1 percent more cops than existed 20 years earlier. We had never done this before. 
   After all the hearings I held as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, being exposed over all those years to the leading criminologists in the country, the psychologists, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers, social workers, all the experts, I came away convinced of only a few things. 
   One is, if there is a cop on one corner of the street and no cop on the other corner and a crime is going to be committed on a corner, it is going to be committed where the cop is not. Sounds pretty basic. It is basic. This single most important reason why, beyond the sheer numbers, this COPS Program has worked, in my view, is because in order to get Federal money to hire local cops under this program, local law enforcement departments had to decide, as my friend from Virginia knows, to set up community policing. When he was Governor, he talked about this. When he was Governor, a lot of the Governors and mayors knew about this. 
   It was hard to do. Cops didn't want to get out of their cars and walk on the beat, figuratively and literally. There was resistance. So we said: Look, if you want another cop paid for in part by the Federal Government, your whole department has to be a community policing department. You have to go back and interface with the community. You have to know who owns the 
   corner store. You have to know who lives in the house in the middle of the block. You have to know where the drug trafficking takes place. You have to know where the gymnasium is where the kids hang out. You have to know where the swimming pool is. You have to know the people. 
   And so one of the reasons, I argue, for the extraordinary success of the program is not merely the added numbers of cops but because of the way in which they are required to utilize their existing police forces in order to get any new cops. 
   Now, granted, in one sense this is a small victory in that it only continues the program through the time it was intended to continue it. 
   I hope we can reach some bipartisan consensus before we get to fiscal year 2001 to extend, as my friend from New Hampshire has proposed in an amendment we will vote on later today, the violent crime trust fund that pays for these cops, the Federal share. I hope we can get some bipartisan support on extending the program that continues to put more local law enforcement on the ground with the help of Federal dollars. 
   I will reserve the remainder of my time in a moment, but I want to make it clear that I truly appreciate the willingness of the Senator from New Hampshire to reinstate, at least in part, the funding for this program which would allow the office to continue through the year 2000. I see my friend has risen, and I am happy to yield to him at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make a few brief comments, and I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time. I thank my friend from New Hampshire for accepting the amendment. 
   This was part of an original bill called the Biden crime bill at the time. At the time, when we introduced the notion of all these new cops partially being paid for by the Federal Government, I was told a couple of things. One, local authorities would not like it because they would have to come up with part of the funding. Two, it would be cumbersome to administer. Three, we would find ourselves in the position where it really wouldn't make much of an impact on the community. 
   I suggest the reason I wrote the bill the way I did originally was to take into consideration all three of those concerns. First of all, everyone will know, from their home States, that there is no redtape in this program. The day after we passed the crime bill in 1994 in my office, I sat with the Attorney General of the United States and her staff, and, to her chagrin, I said we must get this application down to one single page. They looked at me as if to say: What do you mean, one single page? That is not possible for a Federal program which is going to cost $30 billion. But that is what it is. It is a page. That is the reason why there is an infinitesimally small portion of this COPS Program and the crime bill program money being spent for administration. 
   The second thing was, I remember my friend from South Carolina telling me at the time: If you don't do this the right way, this is going to get hung up in every State. That is why we didn't send this money to Governors. The Presiding Officer is a former Governor. We love former Governors. But this doesn't go through State legislatures. The local police chief in Columbus, OH, does not have to convince anybody in your State capital they need more cops. They can go directly to the source. 
   From a little town in Massillon, OH, they can go straight to the source. They do not have to go to the legislature; they can go straight downtown after their city council in Dover, DE, Smyrna, DE, Wilmington DE. It enabled local law enforcement agencies to determine their own needs and thereby eliminate the waste. By the way, I got in trouble with Governors for writing it that way, for not sending it through State legislative bodies. 
   The third thing it does, and there was criticism of this when it was done, it says you do not get any money unless you have a certain kind of police department. What do you have to do? If you have 10 cops in your police department, you cannot fire two and apply for Federal money to hire them back. That is what was done under the  LEAA, the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, when I first got here. This program said there was a maintenance of effort. We would help you get the 11th cop, but you couldn't cut it to 9 to go back to 10. 
   We said: By the way, you have to have a community policing operation. Why is that important? Mayors and Governors do not want community policing. It is harder to do. It costs more money. The cops organizations--I love them all--didn't want it. It costs more money. If I am a cop in a tough district, I would rather be riding in a patrol car with another 
   guy than I would be walking through by myself. So they did not want it. We said: No money unless this gets leveraged. If you have 10 cops and you want one of ours to raise your force to 11, all 11 have to be community cops. That is the key. 
   Why do I say this? If the Federal Government gets out of the business of helping here, it will not only be the loss of the money; I predict it will be the loss of the willingness to maintain community policing even though it works, even though every mayor knows it works and every county official knows it works. It is expensive and it is hard. Mark my words: The day the COPS Program ends, initially 5 percent, 10 percent of the communities in America will go away from community policing, and 10 years from now we will be back to where we were. 
   That leads to my second concluding point. People said back when the original bill was written: BIDEN, why are you only doing it for 5 years? I said, one of two things are going to happen. Maybe at the end of the 5 years those of us who support this concept are going to be right; it is going to be proven, as in the old expression, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. At the end of the 5 years, the pudding either tastes good or it tastes bad. If it tastes bad, all the king's horses and all the king's men will not keep the COPS Program going because it will be branded for what it is, a waste of time and money. But if the pudding tastes good, all the king's horses and all the kings's men cannot stop it from being reauthorized for another 5 years. 
   So far, the king's horses and king's men have stopped it from being authorized for another 5 years. It is a different issue. It is different than continuing it for this next year. But I want to say, I think the proof is in the eating. Our streets are safer. Go out and ask any of your mayors, any of your county executives, any of your town councils, any of your police departments. You come back and tell me anyone who said: Eliminate this program. They may have suggestions to make it better, and we should listen to them but not eliminate it. 
   This leads me to my exact last point. I am a Democrat. I take great pride in the fact that I wrote this bill. Originally, it was the Biden bill. When it passed and became law, I remember saying to President Clinton: Let's call it the Clinton bill. 
   We lost the Congress that year, and he thought we lost the Congress in part because of the gun amendments. He said: Keep it the Biden bill. 
   It started working really well, and now it is the Clinton bill. It is good it is the Clinton bill, but I want to make this the Republican bill, and I mean this sincerely. I want COPS to become like Social Security has become. Initially, Republicans hated Social Security and they were against it. Roosevelt came along, and Democrats supported it. Over the years, they have not only become politically committed, they are as committed as we are. They really understand how important it is, but for a long time it was not invented here. 
   This COPS bill was bipartisan in its inception. When the first so-called Biden crime bill that had this in it originally passed out of the Senate, it was called the Biden-Hatch crime bill until it got to the other side. Gingrich did not like the look of it politically, and even though it passed in the Senate with 97 votes originally--what passed the Senate originally was the same thing that ended up becoming law. It had 97 votes originally. It went over to the House of Representatives, and when it came back, I had to get seven Republicans to pass it. Only seven Republicans voted for it. 
   From that point on, the bad news about the crime bill has 
   been: We Democrats beat our chests about how we did it, and the Republicans did not, which is literally true. And the Republicans have said: My Lord, we can't continue to support a program from which the Democrats are getting such benefit. Let's end this. 
   Let's go back and pretend this was part of the crime bill that passed out of here, which it did, with 97 votes. This is a bipartisan idea, and my plea is let continuing the program through its authorization period of the fiscal year 2000 be the first step, and the second step, that Republicans and Democrats join together and reauthorize for another 5 years this program and reauthorize for another 5 years, as my friend from New Hampshire has suggested, the trust fund. 
   It is time--and I know this sounds ridiculous in this atmosphere--to take the politics out of this. This is working. There is enough room for all of us to claim credit. There is enough room for everybody to say, look, listen to what Ronald Reagan used to say when he first became President: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This ain't broke. 
   Now let's put a Republican stamp on it and a Democratic stamp on it--an American stamp--just as we do on Social Security. We will be doing the Nation a great favor, and maybe, just maybe, we will get back in the habit a little bit of cooperating as Democrats and Republicans. 
   I thank my friend from New Hampshire for being willing to accept the amendment. I appreciate his accommodation in allowing us to speak to it in spite of that, and I truly look forward to the possibility that in the coming months we will be able to move beyond this and have a bipartisan--a Republican amendment. I will sign on to a Republican amendment reauthorizing this and call it the Republican crime bill. I do not care what we call it. I sincerely mean that. But let's keep a good thing going. 
   I thank my friend, again, very much. I thank my friend from South Carolina who, when this bill was being written 5 years ago, was the major engine behind it. He was the one who allowed it to get through the committee in the first place. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friend from California, the distinguished Senator, Mrs. BOXER, feels a sense of compassion about a number of things, one of which is this amendment, and the way in which she, for the past 15 years, has been fighting and successfully, for the most part. 
   I have been at her side to make sure we, quite frankly, keep dolphins from being killed unnecessarily. It sounds like a simplistic message, but it is as basic as that. 
   What happened is we got rolled last year by the administration and by the Senate because there are more votes here. We had the Dolphin Protection Act in place. I will not take the time to discuss it now. Actually, it was basically eviscerated by what took place. 
   I was not particularly pleased with Vice President GORE's position on this, the administration's position, nor the position of my distinguished friend whom I respect very much, Senator BREAUX, and the distinguished Senator from Alaska. That was a formidable array we faced, and we essentially lost. 
   What did we do last year? Last year, we did basically what the treaty said, and said: Look, we have this mechanism set up where everybody pays their fair share to make it work. The treaty says that. And I will again, in the interest of time, not recite the elements of the treaty which say that and point out how the following sentence can be distinguished that lays out the pro portional requirement to participate in this. 
   But the bottom line is very simple. We made an agreement 
   last year involving countries in question. They said they agreed, the administration promised, and the Senate said everybody will pay their fair share. Simple. Wrong.  
   We are paying 70 percent or more of the administration of this arrangement, and we should only be paying 40 percent. The distinguished Senator from California comes along and says: Hey, look, let's make it 50 percent. We will pay more than we should, but not this disproportionate amount. And if they do not pay as they promised, they should not get the benefits that flow from the agreement that encompasses their participation. 
   So it is real simple, I say to my distinguished friend from South Carolina, who asked me to be brief. I will be brief. This is not fair. The Senator from California is right. She is willing to have us pay more than our fair share but not essentially twice what our fair share is. 
   So I support the amendment, and I hope the managers of the bill may see fit, based on their sense of justice and their notion of fairness, to accept the amendment. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 3 years ago this week I joined with my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator HATCH, to introduce the ``Hatch-Biden Methamphetamine Control Act'' to address the growing threat of methamphetamine use in our country before it was too late. 
   Our failure to foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one of the most significant public policy mistakes in recent history. Despite the warning signs of an outbreak, few took action until it was too late. But we did learn an important lesson from that mistake. When we began to see similar warning signs with methamphetamine, we acted swiftly to make sure that history would not repeat itself. 
   That Act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of the methamphetamine epidemic and avoid the mistakes made during the early stages of the crack epidemic. We increased penalties for possessing and trafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor chemicals and equipment used to manufacture the drug. We tightened the reporting requirements and restrictions on the legitimate sales of products containing precursor chemicals to prevent their diversion, and imposed even greater requirements on firms that sell those products by mail. We ensured that meth manufacturers who endanger the life of any individual or endanger the environment while making this drug receive enhanced prison sentences. And finally, we created a national working group of law enforcement and public health officials to monitor any growth in the methamphetamine epidemic. 
   I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic significantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive drug. Meth stimulates the central nervous system, making the user feel energetic, clever and powerful. Unlike crack, whose effects sometimes last only a matter of minutes, a meth high lasts for hours. 
   Last year in my home State of Delaware law enforcement officers busted what was described as ``the largest and most sophisticated drug lab in the Northeast,'' seizing 50 pounds of meth and meth base. This was only one of the 5,786 reported clandestine laboratory seizures in the United States last year. 
   We have countless heart wrenching stories of violence and families being tragically ripped apart by methamphetamine use, sadly reminiscent of what we saw with crack cocaine. A recent news story reported that a woman in California has been charged with the murder of her infant son. High on meth, she left him in a sealed car in the summer heat while she and her boyfriend slept in an air-conditioned motel room nearby. The innocent infant died a tragic and senseless death. 
   Unfortunately, this unspeakable tragedy is not an isolated incident. It is not unusual for a meth user to remain awake for days. And as the high begins to wane, the user is likely to be violent, delusional and paranoid. Not surprisingly, this behavior often leads to crime. In areas like San Diego where the meth epidemic rages, more than 33 percent of people arrested in 1998 tested positive for the drug. 
   On top of the violence associated with methamphetamine users, there is also the enormous problem of violence among methamphetamine traffickers and the environmental and life-threatening conditions endemic in the clandestine labs where the drug is produced. 
   But perhaps the most frightening fact of all is that despite all of the evidence that methamphetamine is a horribly destructive substance, the percentage of kids who perceive it as a harmful drug is on the decline. 
   And that I why I am joining my friend from Utah once again --along with Senators DEWINE, FEINSTEIN and BOND--to build on the 1996 methamphetamine legislation and continue to fight this pernicious drug. 
   Our Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, first and foremost, addresses the growing problem of amphetamines as a meth substitute by making the penalties for manufacturing, importing, exporting or trafficking amphetamine equivalent to those established for methamphetamine in our 1996 law. The two drugs are nearly identical --they differ by only one chemical. Whereas methamphetamine is made with ephedrine, a substance found in some over-the-counter cold remedies, amphetamine is produced with phenylpropanolamine, a chemical found in over-the-counter diet pills. The two drugs are produced in the same dangerous clandestine labs and are often sold interchangeably on the streets; the penalties for dealing in both substances should be the same. 
   This legislation also provides the Drug Enforcement Administration with much needed funding to clean up clandestine labs after they are seized  as well as to train state and local law enforcement officers to handle the hazardous wastes produced in the meth labs. Methamphetamine is made from an array of hazardous substances--battery acid, lye, ammonia gas, hydrochloric acid, just to name a few--that produce toxic fumes and often lead to fires or explosions when mixed. I am revealing nothing by naming some of these chemical ingredients. Anyone with access to the Internet can download a detailed meth recipe with a few simple keystrokes. Our legislation would make such postings illegal. 
   This bill also tightens the restrictions on direct and indirect advertising of illegal drug paraphernalia and Schedule I drugs. Under this legislation, it would be illegal for on-line magazines and other websites to post advertisements for such illegal material or provide ``links'' to websites that do. We crafted this language carefully so that we restrict the sale of drug paraphernalia without restricting the First Amendment. 
   Finally, the bill provides more money for law enforcement. This includes hiring more Drug Enforcement Administration agents to assist state and local law enforcement in small and mid-size cities and rural areas and providing more money to combat meth in places designated as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. 
   While I clearly support the goals of this legislation, I want to make it clear that I think we may need to tweak it as it goes through the process to ensure that we do not stymie a good idea with the fine print. Specifically, I have concerns about how we fund meth lab clean up. As written, some of the money would come from the asset forfeiture fund, a most important resource for law enforcement. We are now struggling with reforming the overall structure of asset forfeiture in this country and I would hope we could find an alternative pot of money to tap to do the important work of cleaning up meth lab sites. 
   That being said, I am confident that any concerns I may have at this time will be resolved during the committee process. 
   I want to commend Senator HATCH for his continued leadership on this issue. I urge all my colleagues to join us in protecting our children and our society from the devastations of methamphetamine by supporting this vital legislation.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no greater threat to our country than that posed by weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear, chemical or biological weapons--perhaps delivered by long-range guided missiles--could cause more destruction in a week or even a day than we suffered in all of the Vietnam war. 
   The United States has many nonproliferation and counterproliferation programs, but there are cracks in our organization for combating this terrible scourge. 
   The Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, also know as the ``Deutch Commission,'' has found those cracks. 
   Yesterday the Commission gave America a blueprint for repairing them. We dare not ignore its analysis, any more than we would ignore termites in our homes. 
   My colleague and friend from Pennsylvania, Senator ARLEN SPECTER, also deserves special recognition today. The Commission was his idea; he secured its establishment and later ensured its continued existence. As Vice Chairman of the Commission, he worked to ensure that its recommendations would be practical and politically feasible. 
   Today Senator SPECTER is introducing legislation to implement one of the Deutch Commission recommendations: that we require electronic filing of Shippers' Export Declarations on a secure, Internet-based system. 
   This legislation will provide more timely and usable data for non-proliferation analysis by executive branch agencies, without causing any significant burden for exporters or endangering the traditional confidentiality of Shippers' Export Declarations. 
   I am pleased to be an initial cosponsor of this legislation and I am confident that it will be enacted. 
   Shippers' Export Declarations are already required under chapter 9 of title 13, United States Code. The content of those Declarations is prescribed in part 30 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations. This legislation will not require any reporting by industry that is not already mandated under those regulations. 
   There is also an existing Automated Export System, but its use is voluntary and it has not gained much acceptance. This bill will require that shippers use an Internet-based Automated Export System, once it is certified as being secure and capable of handling the expected volume of information that would be filed. 
   I want to assure U.S. companies, as I have been assured, that this legislation will not cause difficulties for them. Exporters will have on-line assistance in filing their Declarations and will be able to double-check their Declarations for accuracy after filing them. 
   In addition, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which maintains the security of unclassified Federal Government communications, must join in certifying that the Internet-based Automated Export System is ready for use and has been successfully tested. 
   That will ensure the continued confidentiality of these Declarations. 
   This is hardly a revolutionary bill. Rather, it is one discrete, rational measure that is needed to improve our defense against the spread of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons to countries or groups that could otherwise rain chaos and destruction upon our country and the whole world. 
   We simply must take this step, along with others recommended by the  Deutch Commission. For our own sake and for our children's sake as well, we absolutely must respond to the challenge of proliferation.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the foreign operations appropriation bill is a crucial bill. It is integral to all of our assistance programs overseas. The bill's importance to American foreign policy cannot be over emphasized. This bill provides funding for development aid to poor countries, funds to combat terrorism and proliferation of nuclear weapons overseas, and monies for all of the multilateral financial institutions which lend to needy countries. 
   As I see it, the bill before the Senate has two major problems. First, the bill as a whole is significantly under-funded. The amount dedicated to our nation's foreign operations is almost $2 billion below the President's request for funding. 
   I understand that some of this is due to the caps placed on expenditures as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; however, we in the Senate cannot hide behind that piece of legislation every time we want an excuse for why the administration's appropriations requests are under funded. I am not saying that this is not a legitimate reason for not granting the President's entire request, but $2 billion is an enormous shortfall. 
   In addition to inadequate funding overall, there are particular programs and foreign policy initiatives which are either funded at a level which is drastically reduced from the President's request, or which have not been funded at all. 
   Mr. President, the administration in its statement of policy with respect to this bill has clearly stated that ``A bill funded at this level would be grossly inadequate to maintain America's leadership around the world. It would inevitably require severe reductions from previously enacted levels for programs managed by the Departments of State and Treasury, the Agency for International Development and other agencies.'' 
   The statement quite clearly states that if the significant funding and language problems in this bill as reported are not resolved that ``the President's senior advisors have no choice but to recommend that he veto the bill.'' 
   I wish to speak to several very important aspects of this bill that must be addressed in conference. First, the bill fails to provide the $500 million requested by the President to support the Middle East Wye River Agreement. 
   Second, it fails to fund the administration's Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, so important to our ability to reduce the proliferation threat and continue the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Third, this bill imposes new onerous conditions on U.S. funding for the 1994 Agreed Framework, the cornerstone of our North Korea policy. 
   I also have very strong concerns with respect to two provisions in the bill relating to Kosovo and our ongoing relationship with Russia. 
   Unfortunately, by withholding critical support for Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority, this bill would have us renege on the commitments that made the Wye River agreement possible. The leaders of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Israel have taken great risks for peace. We pledged to stand with them as they took these risks. 
   In the months ahead, we will undoubtedly be called upon to play a lead role in the peace talks. But by refusing to fund one penny of the President's request for the Wye River agreement, this bill calls into question our commitment to Middle East peace just as there is renewed hope for accelerated progress. 
   Some may argue that the Middle East gets enough assistance as it is. Relative to other accounts that may be true, but the levels of assistance to the Middle East are a reflection of the strategic and moral issues at stake. 
   The funds requested by the administration are in keeping with our commitment to Israel's security. They will help wage battle in Palestinian areas against the greatest enemy of peace--namely, the poverty and despair that provides a fertile breeding ground for extremism. They will help bolster Jordan--a close ally whose peace with Israel should serve as a model for others in the region. 
   I am convinced that the sums requested by the administration to support peace pale in comparison to the costs we would incur if conflict and turmoil returned to the Middle East. 
   One of the most disturbing elements of this bill is its failure to fund the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative that helps reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Technically the cuts are to the larger budget lines for aid to the Newly Independent States and for Nonproliferation and related programs. But report language calls the funding of Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative programs ``ill advised,'' and they will bear the brunt of these cuts. 
   Weapons of mass destruction dwarf the other threats to our national security. If we fail to help Russian experts find nonmilitary employment, we may foster Iran's nuclear weapons, or Iraq's biological weapons, or Libyan missiles. Even a single use of such weapons against the United States, U.S. forces, or our allies would be a terrible tragedy--especially if we failed to prevent it. 
   The failure to fund the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiatives means no funds--not even the levels appropriated last year--for helping Russian biological weapons experts find new careers. This is a vital program that has enabled biological weapons experts to resist offers from Iran and other rogue states. We should be expanding this program, rather than cutting it. 
   The Threat Reduction cut means no funds for the International Science and Technology Centers in Russia and Ukraine that have helped over 24,000 former weapons scientists since 1994. The Science Center program has been very successful. It has been praised for its tight management, under board chairman Ron Lehman, a former official in Republican administrations whom we all know to be a true patriot. Science Center support for Russian scientists is exempt from Russian taxes. We should be expanding this program, too, rather than cutting it. 
   The Threat Reduction cut means no funds--not even last year's levels--for the Civilian Research and Development Foundation, which gives vital training to Russian former weapons scientists who are trying to form viable businesses. We tell Russian weapons experts to adapt to a market economy. But they will never achieve that, if we don't give them the training. And if they fail, they will be ripe for the plucking by rogue states who would buy their weapons expertise. 
   The Threat Reduction cut means no funds--not even last year's levels--to assist customs officials in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union. The customs officials whom we assist are our most reliable allies in stopping the flow of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction materials. 
   For example, it was customs officials in Azerbaijan who stopped a shipment of specialty steel to Iran that would have been used for missiles. This bill also contains only $5 million--out of $15 million requested--for world-wide assistance to customs services. This is the program that aids border control agencies in the Baltic states, where we have seen Russian nuclear smuggling efforts in the past. It makes no sense to provide only $5 million for this vital function. 
   These cuts even wipe out the border security assistance to Georgia that Senator MCCONNELL instituted last year. 
   The Threat Reduction cut means no funds to assist in removing Russian troops from Moldova--a longstanding objective of the United States and of the Congress. Do we suddenly want the Russian troops to stay longer in a country that does not want them? Do we no longer care whether this exacerbates ethnic conflict in Moldova? 
   The Foreign Operations Subcommittee made these cuts without prejudice. But it makes no sense to let us guard our national security only by cutting important programs to support democracy, free media, and the rule of law in the former Soviet Union. 
   I am very pleased that the managers have accepted a sense of the Senate amendment I offered urging that the Threat Reduction funds be restored in conference to the level requested by the President. 
   I urge the managers of this bill to do their utmost to achieve this, and I wish them complete success in that important effort. 
   On the eve of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's visit to Washington, and just as former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry is completing his comprehensive Korea policy review, this bill places the Agreed Framework in grave jeopardy. 
   The bill not only provides inadequate funding for heavy fuel oil deliveries to North Korea--deliveries the United States is obligated to arrange under the 1994 Agreed Framework--it also effectively prevents the appropriated funds from being expended by requiring the President to certify the uncertifiable with respect to North Korea's conduct. 
   Under existing law, the President must already certify that North Korea is in full compliance with the Agreed Framework and its confidential minute in order to expend monies appropriated for heavy fuel oil deliveries to the North. This a reasonable requirement. But if the North is fulfilling its side of the bargain, we should fulfill ours rather than dream up new requirements on the North. 
   Do we have other serious concerns about North Korea, in addition to its nuclear ambitions? Of course we do. But these other concerns--missile development and export, narcotics trafficking, armed provocations along the DMZ--cannot be addressed successfully if we abandon the Agreed Framework. 
   For all of its imperfections, the Agreed Framework has served our national interest well, reducing the risk of war and capping the North's ability to produce fissile material for nuclear bombs. Five years ago, North Korea was on the verge of withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and acquiring the capacity to build dozens of nuclear weapons every year. Today, with the Agreed Framework intact, the North's nuclear facilities stand idle. 
   The spent fuel from its research reactor has been canned and placed under round-the-clock monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agreed Framework has also given us unprecedented access to North Korea, even to sensitive military sites, as demonstrated by the recent successful U.S. visit to the Kumchangni undergound facility. 
   These are not insignificant accomplishments, and we should think twice before we risk turning back the clock. 
   By underfunding the Korean Energy Development Organization and unilaterally imposing new obligations on North Korea, this bill could precipitate a crisis on the Peninsula and distance us from our key ally, South Korea. 
   In addition, I have two serious problems with sections of the bill relating to Kosovo. First, $20 million shall be available ``for training and equipping a Kosova security force.'' Mr. President, this language conveys the impression that we want to train something like a national guard or an army. In the real world, most people would see this as our training and equipping a KLA Army.  
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999), which gives international sanction to KFOR, is not specific about the future status of Kosovo. Any future Kosovo national guard or army presupposes an independent Kosovo. 
   Aside from that being counter to United States policy, it is completely irrelevant to this bill. For the duration of fiscal year 2000, security in Kosovo will be guaranteed by the heavily armed, NATO-led KFOR. There is absolutely no need for any kind of an indigenous ``security force'' other than a civilian police force. 
   The final legislation should make it crystal-clear that the appropriation will be used to train and equip a police force, not an army. 
   My second Kosovo-related objection concerns the requirement that the Secretary of State certify that the Russians have not established a ``separate zone of operational control'' and are ``fully integrated under NATO unified command and control arrangements.'' 
   This requirement has been overtaken by events. The Military-Technical Agreement between NATO and Russia found a formula to include Russian peacekeepers in KFOR. This formula has been accepted by our government, by all other 18 NATO members, and by the United Nations. 
   I have no doubt that Secretary Albright could broadly construe words like ``operational control'' and ``fully integrated'' and thereby make the required certification. 
   But what would we get by retaining this language and forcing her to do so? I'll tell my colleagues. We would be gratuitously sticking our finger in the Russians' eye at the precise moment we are trying to involve them in KFOR and in the entire reconstruction effort in Kosovo. 
   To sanitize a phrase used by an esteemed former President of the United States, I would rather have the Russians inside our tent looking out, than outside our tent looking in. 
   I would like to remind my friend Senator MCCONNELL that when the two of us recently appeared on the Sunday Fox Television News talk-show he said with regard to the Russians in Kosovo--and I quote; ``I don't know that we need to threaten foreign assistance.'' 
   Apparently he has changed his mind. I agreed with Senator MCCONNELL that day on television. I wish he had held to his position. 
   It is important that these problems be addressed in conference, and that a way be found to increase the overall funding levels. 
   At this time I will reluctantly vote to send this legislation to conference. However, I reserve the right to vote against it should these problems not be addressed in the final conference report.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for his statement and cooperation. I thank the chairman for working out a compromise with the Senator on his amendment. 
   I must say, I would be more comfortable if I could be pure on this, because I happen to agree with the Senator from Maryland. I think we owe a total amount of probably $1.021. The U.N. says we owe $1.509. We do not, in my view. I would be more comfortable if we could have gotten all of that. Quite frankly, I would be more comfortable, as a matter of principle, if there were no conditions. 
   So I began this process 6 years ago exactly where the Senator is. The arrearages began to mount in larger numbers, really with UNPROFOR in Bosnia. I know the Senator knows that a significant amount of what the United States ``owes'' is for peacekeeping missions. It is owed to France, the U.K., Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Germany. It is not dues in the sense that we belong to a club, or a country club, and you have yearly dues. This is more like at the end of the year when they say we ran over X amount of dollars and you assess the members beyond their dues. That is what we owe, in large part. 
   I know the Senator knows this, and I thank him for his acknowledgment of our attempt to do the best we could. But I think, as I said, on principle, we should pay our obligations in full with no conditions. 
   We should negotiate conditions from this point on, if we want to, because I think the Senator would agree with me that the U.N. is a badly run outfit in terms of its management skill. 
   It has been the employer of first resort for a significant number of countries, understandably. It is a bloated bureaucracy, which has been worked upon positively by Kofi Annan, and there has been progress made. But it is not an institution that we had in mind when we signed on in San Francisco. We didn't expect it to turn out to be as inefficient as it has, understandably. 
   It has also done an incredible amount of very good work. I believe, as the President said with regard to the United States, the United States is the ``essential nation.'' I believe it is the essential international organization. I am committed to it. 
   But, a friend of mine, when I used to serve on the county council in New Castle County, DE, a Republican named Henry Folsom came down to Washington--by the way, in the Reagan administration. Henry used to say, God bless his soul, ``Joe, remember. Politics is the art of the practical.'' 
   Practically speaking, my pure stand of saying ``no conditions and all the money'' was rhetorically very appealing. But it didn't do a thing. 
   It was only, quite frankly, when the Senator from North Carolina--who has been a critic over the years of the United Nations--decided we had to fix this somehow; that we ended up over a period, I would say to the chairman, of probably 2 years of talk, negotiating, arguing, and compromising that we ended up where we are today. Where we are today is four-fifths or more of the way home. 
   Still, I for one do not like the conditions that precede us paying. I would rather say that these are conditions that we hope would be met, notwithstanding whether or not we would pay. But we are where we are. 
   So this is a process. This is a process. 
   I have spoken with all but two of the former Secretaries of State on this matter. When I put the question to them, as I did to Kofi Annan--All right, do you want this or do you want nothing? --every single person involved with the United Nations to whom I have posed that question said: No. No we will take this. We will take this. 
   The truth of the matter is there are choices. Our choices are this or nothing. All of us who are devoted to the United Nations, in terms of thinking it an essential body, have been unable to get a penny--a penny--toward these arrears. We have been noble, myself included, in our efforts. But we haven't gotten a penny for those ``arrears.'' 
   Where we are today is with a decision. That is, is it partial, more than partial, is it the bulk of the arrearages to be paid, conditioned upon things which this Secretary of State says--by the way, the last piece of this was negotiated not by the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from North Carolina but by the Secretary of State speaking for the President of the United States and the chairman of the committee. 
   The administration has been candid. They said they are not sure they can get all of it done. They think they can. They are going to fight for it. But they think it is worth the fight--that it is worth the candlestick. 
   We are seized with a decision that I think is going to overwhelmingly pass, which is, do we keep these conditions that have been altered in light of the passage of 2 years of time to make them more likely to be able to be met, coupled with the $926 million paid out, as the bill calls for, much of it front-end loaded, or do we step back and say no, we are not going to? 
   I know the Senator from Maryland isn't suggesting this. But the other alternative is to step back and say unless we get it all, no conditions, all the arrears, we are not going to do anything, we 
   will not be creating new arrears with this deal. 
   By the way, even though we are authorizing less than the administration requested for contributions to international organizations, we are about $43 million above what is needed in the first place. 
   I understand the State Department will soon announce a $28 million surplus in the fiscal year 1999 international organizations account. This would be applied to reduce the amount requested for fiscal 2000. 
   Also, because of exchange rate gains, the request is $20 million too high, as of April 30. $7 million is requested for war crimes commissions in Iraq and Cambodia. As much as I would like to see the commissions, neither looks likely in the very near future. 
   Finally, there is $8 million in the budget request to cover exchange rate fluctuations, but the committee bill already contains language that guards against adverse exchange rate variations. Section 801(f)(1) states:  
   .....there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to offset adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  
   I am confident we have authorized enough funds to meet our current obligations to international organizations. I understand the Senator's concern and fear. But I do not believe when we pass this authorization bill, if it were appropriated as we suggest, that we are going to be further and further behind in this process. 
   It is true that we have not fully funded the administration's request for arrears payments to the United Nations and other international organizations. We are $95 million short of our request. 
   As I have said, in an ideal world I would like to pay our arrears to the United Nations in full, immediately, and without condition. But I have made a judgment, and I believe the correct one, a pragmatic judgment, because I know that such a proposal has no chance of passing--``no conditions, all the money.'' 
   In the last Congress, I asked the administration to give me a bottom line figure for arrears to the United Nations with which they could live. The administration responded with a memorandum to me which stated they were willing not to pay $68 million in arrears to UNIDO, an organization that we withdrew our membership from earlier in this decade. 
   Their judgment is that a total of $68 million in arrears is owed to an organization in which we are not a member, and to which we have no intention of paying membership dues. 
   They also told me they would apply an expected refund of $27 million from the U.N. to reduce our arrears. Unfortunately, that $27 million was used to  reduce the fiscal year 1998 contributions because our bill got stalled in the House. Otherwise, we would have been in pretty good shape. 
   For those who are wondering how we came up with $926 million, if we added $68 million to the $27 million and subtract that from the total of $1.021 billion we owed, then we would arrive at our figure. 
   What we did was essentially pay the entirety of the arrearages that we thought were owed absent the $68 million they said they didn't want to pay to an organization we weren't a member of, and not contemplating the fact they have to use the $27 million because this bill got slowed up. It is true that $27 million U.N. refund has already been used and, thus, is not available for arrears. But I would note that this sum can be easily subtracted from arrears owed to the specialized U.N. agencies. Even with the $926 million provided in our plan, many of the specialized agencies will have to create or expand programs to absorb the arrears payments they are going to receive. 
   It sounds a bit counterintuitive that a plan which is supposed to control the size of the U.N. could actually end up expanding it temporarily. That will be the short-term effect for many of the specialized agencies, if they decide to devise ways to spend the extra money that is going to be flowing in. 
   Again, I personally would like to fully fund the administration request. I think I have outlined a solid political and substantive rationalization for providing the lower figure. 
   Finally, I emphasize again that there is $8 million in the budget request to cover exchange rate fluctuations. The committee bill, as I said, already contains language to guard against an adverse exchange rate. It is section 801(F)1. It states:  
   There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary in each fiscal year 2000 and 2001 to offset the adverse fluctuations of foreign exchange currency rates.  
   I still agree with my friend from Maryland. That is, I believe the real hangup is the conditions. The truth of the matter is, we have basically paid all the arrears that we owe, that we say we owe. If you accept the administration's position that the $68 million owed to an organization we have been fighting with for 10 years, and we have been out of it for 3 or 4 years, that if we do not pay the $68 million owed--and had we not had the House stall with what Senator HELMS and I put together 2 years ago, we would be at the $1.021 billion. Again, it would be better if even that were done. I am not arguing that. 
   I almost hesitate to make the point, to be honest with my friend from Maryland, this is a fragile coalition we put together. I am not sure we would get all the Republican votes we need if we thought we were paying everything we owed. I don't want to go around making a big deal of the fact we are paying everything we think we owe, short of those two accounts, to be very blunt. I guess I shouldn't be so blunt. That is the truth of the matter, from my perspective, politically. 
   We have done a heck of a job. I don't know whether to praise my friend or not, because my praise on this issue is probably not very helpful to him, so I won't. But let me say there has been a very good-faith effort on the part of my friend from North Carolina. This is not nearly as draconian as it sounds. 
   Again, the single most significant thing my friend from North Carolina extracted in return for essentially paying off our arrears were the conditions that exist. The essence of the deal is, we basically paid all the arrears we say we owe, if this becomes law, if this is appropriated, in return for conditions to do things I don't disagree with my friend on, but I don't think we should have done it the way we did. I think we should have said, pay the arrears, and, by the way, from this point on, we are not going to unless these conditions persist. 
   However, politics is the art of compromise. The Senator from North Carolina has made a significant compromise here to get us to this point. Because of his standing on his side of the aisle and, quite frankly, his standing nationally, as one who is not about to be viewed as easily taken over by the U.N., I think the mere fact that he has done this adds a credibility to the process that exceeds by far and away the dollar value that would have been accomplished, had we gotten another $95 million or thereabouts in the account. 
   This is only the beginning of the fight. The Senator put his credibility on the line to get this done one time before. The House concluded that for reasons I will not take the time to go into now, that it would not do this. 
   The House committee, our comparable committee, has been good on this issue. But it is a different thing when it gets to the House floor. Although we are technically halfway there, if we pass this bill today, the truth of the matter is, we are probably only about 30 percent of the way there because there are other hurdles on the House side we have to overcome. 
   I truly appreciate the views of the Senator from Maryland, with whom I agree 100 percent. I also truly appreciate the statesmanship of my friend from North Carolina who has brought us to this point. Without him, quite frankly, this couldn't be done. That old expression we have overused, ``Only Nixon can go to China,'' only HELMS could take us this far. 
   That is literally true. That is not an exaggeration. I thank him for that. 
   Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that puts us in good stead, strengthens the United Nations, and makes it a more viable and tightly run organization. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the midst of the best economy our country has ever seen, while we have understandably focused on the good news, there has been another story that has only recently begun to get the attention it deserves.  
   Thanks to the leadership of Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator BYRD, and many of our other colleagues from our country's leading steel producing states, the story of American steel workers has been heard. Like so many other workers in America's core manufacturing industries, steel workers have been struggling with restructuring and modernization that has made them among the most productive in the world. But on top of the sacrifices--in jobs and job security, in pay, in benefits--they have been hit by the one-two punch of the international financial crisis over the last couple of years. 
   On top of the lost sales overseas, where once booming developing nations are no longer able to purchase steel from the U.S., our steel workers have watched as those same developing countries have dumped their own steel products here, often below the cost of production, literally stealing American markets out from under them. So, with lost sales at home and abroad, steel workers are losing their jobs as our mills cut production and even shut down. 
   For the tens of thousands of American workers whose jobs have been lost, whose families have been strained to the breaking point, whose communities have crumbled, this is not some abstract economic question about free trade and open markets. The question is what shall we do to help the people who, despite their hard work and sacrifice, are paying the ultimate price as the rest of us enjoy the many benefits of the new economy. 
   The question before us today, is how to deal with the kind of economic disruption that has come from a global economy with wide-open capital markets and instantaneous communication. The current crisis in our domestic steel industry is, at its roots, a crisis of overcapacity in the steel industry on a global scale. Too many developing countries built too many new steel mills, with less concern about the long term economic sense and more interest in the kickbacks and quick bucks to be made in the short run. 
   I believe that we have been right to respond to the recent international financial crisis by providing the IMF and the World Bank and other entities with the funds they need to put the international financial system back on its feet. But one unfortunate aspect of that process, in my mind, is that too many investors who were throwing money at ill-prepared and even corrupt developing economies will benefit from our attempts to prevent a collapse in the world economy. 
   Today, instead of high-rolling international investors, we are asked to consider help for those American workers and their families who are victims of that international economic crisis, for which they are completely blameless. We will be adding insult to that injury if we fail to act to help them. 
   But while I will vote for the motion to proceed to this bill, Mr. President, I could not vote for passage in its current form. 
   We already have many anti-dumping actions underway, a time-consuming and sometimes frustrating process to be sure, but a process designed to guarantee that we hit what we are shooting at--it requires evidence of who is dumping what kind of steel, and what the real economic damage is. We should continue to pursue those actions as quickly and as relentlessly as the law allows. 
   Just last week, the Senate passed legislation, brought before us by Senator BYRD, that provides $1 billion for the steel industry in loan guarantees to help them deal with the current crisis. 
   These actions are significant steps in the right direction, and they don't have the unintended consequences that the bill before us brings with it. Quotas on imported steel violate one of our oldest and most basic commitments to the international trading system we have worked so long to create. That system, for the most part, has been a key part of our current economic success. 
   If we impose unilateral quotas on other countries' steel exports--without showing any specific illegal practices or any direct economic damages--we will seriously weaken our leadership in international trade when we are fighting so hard to open other markets to our products. Chief among those products are our agricultural products, Mr. President, but virtually all of our exports are exposed to a trade war with other countries if we respond to the very real problems of our domestic steel industry by unilaterally imposing quotas. 
   That does not mean we cannot and should not do more to protect American steel mills and steel workers from the unfair and illegal trade practices of other countries. But I hope if we can proceed to a real debate on this issue that we can formulate a more effective way to right the wrong that has been done to them.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment before he turns to the second amendment, I can't emphasize how important I think the change is that the Senator suggests and the enthusiasm with which we accept the amendment. 
   I happen to like the Senator's second amendment that he is going to withdraw. I hope that will happen in the remainder of this year. If we can't get it done this year, I hope we can next year. I hope the committee will take a look at the entire functioning of the inspector general's office. Quite frankly, a similar thing came up in my other committee, the Judiciary Committee. 
   Quite frankly, I think we initiated reforms that were needed a decade or more ago to provide for these inspector generals, and they are throughout the Government, which is a good thing. It is not a bad thing. But what we haven't done, in my opinion, is we haven't given the same kind of scrutiny and oversight into how the offices function as we have, for example, the Attorney General's office, or the overall functioning of the State Department. 
   I hope this is the beginning of not any kind of witch hunt but just a serious, thoughtful oversight about whether or not the inspector general's authority puts it in a position where it has sort of incrementally involved itself in a way that the rights of individuals who are being looked at or who are caught up in a net are, quite frankly, not treated the way we would expect, for example, the U.S. Attorney's Office to proceed. 
   I thank the Senator. As I said, I like the second amendment which he is going to be withdrawing. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity, with his leadership, to revisit that on another piece of legislation, or on the floor independently.

   Mr. BIDEN. The managers amendment which I am pleased to cosponsor with the chairman amends this legislation to name it the ``Admiral James W. Nance Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal years 2000 and 2001.'' 
   Admiral ``Bud'' Nance was a dear friend of the chairman and a close friend of many of us in the Senate. 
   He served his country with extraordinary distinction, and in the final years of his life served as Staff Director to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. One of Bud Nance's objectives, which he shared with the chairman, was to see this particular legislation become law. 
   The Senate's approval today will be a major step to that end. When this legislation becomes law we will have authorized the payment of most of the United States arrearages to the United Nations and encouraged significant reforms in that body. 
   In addition, the Congress will have authorized the funding of our activities overseas for the years 2000 and 2001. 
   I look at those dates and can't help but think that in many ways, this being but just one, your friend, our friend, Bud Nance, will indeed be with us as we enter the new millennium. 
   I would like to thank the majority staff for their work in helping put this bill together--particularly Steve Biegun who assumed the role of staff director after our friend Bud Nance passed away. 
   Patti McNerney has been tireless as majority counsel in leading the complex staff negotiations that helped make this bill possible. 
   I would also like to thank Brian McKeon, our minority counsel for his hard work and the rest of the minority staff, including Jennifer Park and our Pearson Fellow, Joan Wadelton who put many long hours in with the rest of the majority and minority staff. We would not be looking at final passage today without all their dedicated efforts.

The managers' amendment, which he sent to the desk, I might point out, amends the legislation to name this legislation the Admiral James W. Nance Foreign Relations Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001. 
   Bud Nance was a man who was a dear, close friend to the chairman, and a close friend of many of us in the Senate. He served this country with extraordinary distinction in the final years of his life. He served as staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   One of Bud Nance's objectives, which he shared with the chairman, was that this particular legislation become law, and he began to reestablish the relevance of and the bipartisan nature of the committee. He deserves great credit for that. I think the idea of naming this legislation after him is very fitting and appropriate. 
   I thank the chairman again for his cooperation, for his willingness to listen, and for his help. He is a lucky man to have had such a close friend. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I had a very brief discussion with the chairman of the committee about the second part of the Senator's amendment, which I happen to support fully; that is, instead of going from 3 years down to 1 year. All the reasons the Senator stated seem valid to me. A 2-year time period, it seems to me, is more reasonable. I suspect the chairman may be inclined to agree with that. 
   With regard to the first part of the amendment of the Senator relating to this issue of the seriousness of the offense, right now it is 1 year and 2 years. This would allow the State Department to make an independent judgment as to whether or not a reprimand or suspension should stay in the file beyond the time period here.  
   I raise the question whether or not we may be able to work something out. I have not had a chance to talk to the chairman about this to see whether it makes sense to him, but it seems to me the greatest difficulty with the first part of the amendment of the Senator, as it relates to the reforms we are trying to implement, is leaving open-ended this notion of who determines the seriousness of the offense. Having the Director General of the Foreign Service determine the seriousness of the offense without us, the committee, knowing how he or she will go about making that determination, in effect leaves a hole wide enough to eliminate the reform. I am not asking my colleague from North Carolina to respond to this yet. 
   I raised a moment ago in private with the Senator from Maryland whether or not he would be agreeable to amend the first part of his amendment to suggest the Director General had to submit to the Congress and the committee a set of regulations about how he or she would determine what constitutes the seriousness of the offense; in other words, how that would be determined. We would put the burden on them to come back to us to tell us, so we had some faith it would not be an ad hoc way of approaching this and we would have some sense of how to proceed. 
   I do not know whether or not that is amenable. It obviously needs to be fleshed out more than I have just outlined it, whether or not that is amenable to the chairman. But I suggest there is a possibility that the Senator, if he is willing, could work with us to see if we could work out some procedure that may enable the chairman to agree, for his part, 
   to accept the amendment. Is the Senator amenable to that approach, I ask the Senator from Maryland?

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today we begin consideration of the State Department Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000 and 2001, which was reported out of the committee 17-1. 
   Mr. President, as I said, today the Senate begins consideration of the State Department Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001. The bill was reported by the Committee on Foreign Relations on April 21 by an overwhelming vote of 17 to 1. 
   The bill contains several titles, which Chairman HELMS has just summarize. Let me just take a few minutes to highlight the major provisions of the bill. 
   First the bill revives the so-called Helms-Biden legislation on paying our overdue bills to the United Nations. 
   This proposal, I remind my colleagues, was approved by the Senate in June 1997 by a 90 to 5 vote. Unfortunately, it was ultimately sidetracked by the other body in the last Congress. 
   The version in this bill contains several changes from the bill approved in 1997--changes that were made to reflect the time that has passed since the deal was devised in the 105th Congress. 
   This package meets the central objective that I have--to pay back most of our back dues, or arrears--to the United Nations. It provides for the payment of $926 million in arrears, nearly all that we owe to the United Nations, over the course of three years, with the amount of funding released in each year contingent on the achievement of specific reforms in the United Nations. 
   Significant changes have been made to the final plan that we passed in the last Congress: 
   First, the bill provides a waiver for the two toughest provisions in the package--the requirement to achieve a reduction to 20 percent in our regular budget assessment rate, and a requirement to establish a ``contested arrears'' account for those arrears that are in dispute between the United States and the United Nations. 
   Seocnd, the bill provides more money upfront. A provision permitting the President to waive $107 million in reimbursements owed by the United Nations to the United States has been moved from ``year three'' to ``year two'' of the bill. This will allow $682 million to be paid to the United Nations as soon as the ``year one'' and ``year two'' conditions are met. 
   That is enough to cover most of our $712 million debt to the regular and peacekeeping budgets, which together constitute the bulk of our arrears. I should emphasize here that a significant amount of this funding--$575 million--has already been appropriated in the last two fiscal years. 
   I expect that the third year of funding will be appropriated this year--because this money is exempt from the limits imposed by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. So once we pass this bill, and the Secretary of State makes the necessary certifications, the money can begin to flow. 
   This package is the product of lengthy negotiations that began over two years ago. 
   The final details of this revised package were negotiated earlier this year between the chairman, the Secretary of State, and me. It is supported by the Clinton administration. 
   I think we have a good deal here. It is not everything that I wanted. It is not everything that the Secretary of State wanted. And it is not everything the chairman wanted. That is the essence of compromise. And this is a solid compromise that I hope our colleagues will support. 
   Let me briefly discuss a few other provisions in the bill. 
   First, we fully funded the President's budget request for most of the bill, including the operating accounts of the Department of State, international and cultural exchanges, and international broadcasting operations such as the Voice of America. 
   Second, we developed bipartisan legislation to improve security at our embassies. The tragic bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August underscored the vulnerability of our diplomatic posts. Some 80 percent of our embassies do not meet government security standards for setback from the street. 
   An official review chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe concluded that there had been a ``collective failure'' in the U.S. Government in failing to address security at our embassies overseas, and called on the government to devote $1.4 billion a year over each of the next ten years to strengthen security. 
   The bill before the Senate authorizes $3 billion over the next five years for construction of more secure facilities. 
   This meets the President's requested funding level, and accelerates it by a year. Even though it is the amount that the President sought, we must recognize that it is just the beginning of what must be a sustained program of enhancing security. 
   Working overseas is dangerous. We can never make our embassies bomb-proof or risk-free. But we owe it to our dedicated employees who work overseas to provide the resources necessary to minimize known risks. 
   Third, the bill provides for the establishment of a new Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance, which will carry out a function that was handled at an equivalent level in the former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
   The verification function has long been headed by a Senate-confirmed official, and for good reason. Once a treaty is signed, we don't want its enforcement to be lost in the bureaucratic shuffle. Moreover, the existence this office will be of considerable importance in obtaining Senate approval of future arms control treaties. 
   Fourth, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia, which began broadcasting in 1996 pursuant to legislation that I introduced. 
   Although it has been on the air less than three years, Radio Free Asia already plays an important role in providing news and information to the people living under dictatorial rule in East Asia, particularly the People's Republic of China, where freedom of the press remains a distant dream. 
   I am pleased that we are giving our stamp of approval to continue the radio at an increased level of funding. 
   This bill is a solid piece of legislation which enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the Foreign Relations Committee--as was reflected in the strong vote of 17 to 1 in the committee. 
   I want to join the chairman in putting the Senate on notice in two respects. 
   First, we will oppose any amendments that address foreign assistance or security assistance. Those measures do not belong on the State Department authorization bill. 
   Second, we will oppose any measures dealing with ``sanctions reform'' or imposing new sanctions. 
   The chairman has scheduled hearings for next month to consider the various bills on sanctions reforms that are pending in the committee; therefore, it would be premature to consider amendments on that subject at this time. 
   I pay public tribute to the chairman. Quite frankly, his leadership and the consensus which he has built in the committee in the last 18 months has been remarkable. This bill is a product of JESSE HELMS. 
   There are some serious, significant changes we make--one of which I will speak to in a moment--with the United Nations. That is through the persistence of my friend from North Carolina. As my mom might say, everyone is capable of redemption, and of late, the State Department has finally redeemed itself on this one. I am confident--the Senator is correct--if and when Mr. Holbrooke is confirmed, we will have an advocate for the Senator's position at the United Nations. 
   This bill contains several titles which the chairman has summarized. I will take a few minutes to highlight the major provisions of the bill from my perspective. 
   First, the bill revives the so-called Helms-Biden legislation on paying our overdue bills at the United Nations. The Senator from North Carolina and I have always been friends. We have become very close friends, and we suffer from the same problem: Our friends get very angry with us when we compromise. 
   I am sure the friends of the Senator from North Carolina are very angry that he has worked out a solution to the so-called arrearages to get this moving, and Senator BIDEN's friends, on my side of the aisle, are very angry that I have agreed to it because they think it should be more. 
   The bottom line is, we have done some good work. The Senate acted on what we did once before. It was the herculean efforts of the Senator from North Carolina, taking on folks on his side of the aisle, which came to naught, and the not so herculean efforts on my part to take on folks on my side of the aisle who did not think this was enough. We are back. 
   Hopefully, a little reason has permeated the environment and the purists on both sides will understand that what we have done is necessary in the national interest, very much in the interest of the American taxpayers, and is coupled to genuine reforms with which, when one thinks about it, nobody really disagrees. 
   The argument on my side of the aisle is: We should not make them agree to the reforms by holding dues over their heads and holding arrearages over their heads. Nobody I have spoken with says what Chairman HELMS wants is unreasonable. 
   I do not hear anybody coming to the floor saying there is no bloated bureaucracy at the United Nations. I do not hear anyone coming to the floor saying that the United States should pay more. Everybody says we should pay less as a percentage. I do not hear anyone arguing about the substance the chairman has been insisting on for years. 
   We are down to: Are we doing it the right way? It reminds me of an expression--I will probably get myself in trouble with the French Government--which I think is classic. I was meeting with a State Department person, who will remain nameless, in a very significant position, negotiating a very significant agreement with the French relative to NATO. That is as much as I will say about it. 
   I asked this fellow: Are the French going to agree with this? 
   He said: Yes, I think they will, but it is kind of difficult. 
   I said: What do you mean? 
   He said: My friend's counterpart duly said to me last night, ``Yes, yes, yes, this will work in practice, but will it work in principle?'' 
   That is what we are hung up on here. What the Senator has suggested in these reforms is practically what everyone has acknowledged is needed. What we have been hung up on is the principle of whether or not it should be done the way in which we are doing it. 
   On the other side of the equation, nobody argues that if we do not come up with this $926 million we are going to badly hurt the United Nations. We are hurting our allies, we are hurting England, we are hurting the Germans, we are hurting others, because over $700 million of this money is for peacekeeping accounts that we agreed to sign on to with the Brits, with the French, with the Germans, and with our NATO allies. 
   I think and I hope, I say to the chairman, a little bit of reason is seeping into this debate--I hope. 
   I guess I am preaching to the choir here, but hopefully some of the congregation on the House side will hear what the choir is saying, because it is very important that we finally settle this issue and put it to bed. 
   The version in this bill contains several changes from the bill approved in 1997, changes that were made to reflect the time that has passed since the deal we put together--the chairman actually put together--devised in the 105th Congress which made sense. Time has passed. We have had to make some adjustments. I compliment and thank the chairman, as well as the Secretary of State, who was not overwhelmingly enthused about this approach. 
   We finally, through the leadership of the chairman actually, are all singing from the same hymnal, as they say up my way. The State Department is on the same page now, the Senator is on the same page, I am on the same page, hopefully, the House will get on the same page, and we can go on to the next hymn. 
   I think this package meets the central objectives that we have, at least  the ones I have--to pay back most of our so-called arrears to the United Nations. It provides for a payment of $926 million in arrears--nearly all of that we owe to the United Nations--over the course of 3 years, with the amount of funding released in each year contingent on achievement of specific reforms in the United Nations. 
   This package is a product of very lengthy negotiations begun over 2 years ago. The details of this revised package were negotiated earlier this year between the chairman, the Secretary of State, and me. It is now supported by the Clinton administration. I think we have a good deal. It is not everything I wanted, and it is not everything the Secretary wanted, and it is clearly not everything the chairman wanted, but that is the essence of compromise. This is a solid compromise. I hope our colleagues will support it. 
   Let me briefly discuss a few other provisions of the bill. 
   First, we fully funded the President's budget request for most of the bill, including the operations account in the State Department, international and cultural exchanges, and the international broadcasting operations, such as the Voice of America. 
   Second, we developed a bipartisan legislative approach to improve the security of our embassies. The tragic bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August underscored the vulnerability of our diplomatic posts. Some 80 percent of our embassies do not meet Government security standards for setbacks from the streets, just to state one aspect of the problem. 
   The official review, chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe, concluded that there had been a ``collective failure'' in the U.S. Government in failing to address the security of our embassies overseas and called on the Government to devote $1.4 billion a year over each of the next 10 years to strengthen security. 
   The bill before the Senate authorizes $3 billion over the next 5 years for the construction of more secure facilities. This meets the President's requested funding level and 
   accelerates it by a year. Even though it is the amount that the President sought, we must recognize that it is just the beginning of what must be a sustained program of enhancing security. 
   I know my colleague in the Chair knows better than anybody in this building what it is like to have a Government building vulnerable to and subject to terrorist attacks. No one knows the tragedy that flows from that better than the Presiding Officer. 
   We are as exposed in our foreign embassies around the world as buildings are in this town. We cannot and we should not become ``Fortress America'' internally. But we must do the reasonable things that can be done outside of the country in hostile environments or environments where we have less control over the protection of our citizens. 
   Working overseas is dangerous. We can never make our embassies bombproof or risk-free. But we owe it to our dedicated employees who work overseas to provide resources necessary to minimize the known risk. 
   Third, the bill provides for the establishment of a new Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance, who will carry out a function that was handled at the equivalent level in the former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
   I might add, all we are doing now is putting in place what the distinguished chairman is the father of, and that is a significant reorganization of the State Department apparatus. When people ask me, why was this so important to Senator HELMS and why did he work so hard to get it done, I analogize it to what our former colleague, Barry Goldwater, did in terms of the reorganization of the Defense Department. It is as consequential, it is as significant, and I believe it will be remembered as successful as Senator Goldwater's initiatives were with regard to the Defense Department. 
   It basically takes us into the 21st century and recognizes how fundamentally changed the world is. I think he is to be complimented for it. I plan, as long as I am here, that every time we implement a new aspect of his reorganization plan, to remind our colleagues why it is occurring. It is occurring because the Senator from North Carolina was as persistent as he was, and as consistent as he is, in making sure this organization is modernized. 
   The verification function had long been headed by a Senate confirmed official, and for a good reason. Once a treaty was signed, we did not want its enforcement to be lost in the bureaucratic shuffle. Moreover, the existence of this office will be of considerable importance to obtaining Senate approval of future treaties. 
   Fourth, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia, which began broadcasting in 1996 pursuant to legislation I introduced. 
   I must tell you that we all have our pet initiatives that we care a great deal about because we think they have a significant impact on our security and our interests. I have been ferocious, and some suggest too vocal, in my support of the radios. 
   But I want to again publicly thank the chairman, who maybe disagreed with me in some aspects of this, but was willing to go along with my basic approach on how to deal with the radios. I know, from his many years during the cold war, of his devotion to Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. I appreciate his lending his considerable support and weight to 
   the way in which we are approaching, under the reorganization, the so-called radios. 
   Although it has been on the air less than 3 years, by the way, Radio Free Asia already plays an important role in providing news and information for people living under the dictatorial rule in East Asia, particularly the People's Republic of China, where freedom of the press remains a distant dream. I am pleased that we are giving our stamp of approval to continue the radio at increased levels of funding to make it workable. 
   There is much more to say, but I will stop at this point in the interest of accommodating my colleagues. But this bill is a solid piece of legislation which enjoys strong bipartisan support in the Foreign Relations Committee. Again, I want to remind everybody, this, as the defense authorization bill, usually attracts every contentious issue that is out there. It is because of the leadership of the chairman that we came out of the committee with a 17-1 vote. 
   My colleagues should understand--it is presumptuous for me to say this--that this is a reflection of the fact that what is in this bill is solid. It is a solid, solid bill. We would not have gotten this kind of consensus out of an ideologically divided committee but a committee where we are totally committed to making sure we have the strongest ability, the greatest ability, to project our foreign policy around the world. 
   Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership. I still think people are probably scratching their heads: How do BIDEN and HELMS get along so well and produce such bipartisan approaches? Because I think we both respect each other, but also because I understand that the chairman's motivation here is to make this committee's work a product that can pass the bipartisan muster of the Senate and the Congress. I compliment him again for his leadership. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has agreed to pass S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   This bill helps maintain the autonomy and self-worth of some of our most vulnerable citizens, the disabled, by removing barriers that prevent them from returning to work. Disabled citizens in Delaware and elsewhere almost uniformly state that their most important goal is to return to work, not only for the income but for the need to be productive. However, because our laws currently put many obstacles in the way of disabled individuals who want to return to work, they often discover that they are better off financially and medically if they remain unemployed. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act helps tear down some of these perverse provisions of law that block the disabled from achieving their goal of becoming productive, taxpaying citizens. First, and probably most important to the disabled, this bill helps them maintain appropriate health insurance through extensions and expansions of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Most employer-sponsored insurance does not provide the specific types of coverage that the disabled need to enable them to return to work. 
   Second, the Work Incentives Improvement Act helps the disabled obtain appropriate employment and vocational rehabilitation services through the Ticket To Work and Self-Sufficiency program, which extends access to such services provided by the private sector. 
   Finally, this bill continues the demonstration project that allows the disabled who return to work to keep a portion of their cash payments as their work income increases; currently, the abrupt loss of these payments when income reaches a specific threshhold has been a severe disincentive for the disabled to return to work. 
   Mr. President, I am honored to be a cosponsor of this important legislation that helps restore the disabled citizens of Delaware and throughout the United States to their rightful places as equal participants in our society, and I applaud its passage by the Senate.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the military technical agreement signed by NATO and Yugoslavia. That is a fancy way for saying that we accepted the surrender of Slobodan Milosevic. 
   I just got off the phone with the Secretary of State who called me from Germany with another piece of very positive news. She indicated that because the G-8 was meeting in Germany, they put together a group of Europeans to flesh out in detail a Southeastern Europe Stability Pact, which is an idea generated by the German Government. 
   The objective of that pact is to encourage democratic processes in southeastern Europe, in the Balkans, and to reduce tensions in the area. They have set up a very elaborate but clear timetable, and what they call ``regional'' tables, to promote democracy, economic reconstruction, and security. They have involved as the lead group the European Union, plus the OSCE, the United Nations, NATO, and to a lesser extent, the United States. 
   The reason I bother to mention this is that the hard part is about to come. I hope we will have the patience that we did not show on this floor to win the peace. We have won the war, notwithstanding the fact many thought somehow we should be able to do this in less than 78 days. 
   I think it is astounding that we talked about how this ``dragged on.'' We will probably find that close to 10,000 paramilitary and Serbian troops were killed. Only 2 Americans were lost in a training exercise--as bad as that is. Yet, we began to lose patience, because it wasn't done in a matter of 24 hours. 
   If we have the patience, we can win the peace, because unlike pursuing the war, the bulk of the financial responsibility, organizational effort, and guidance will come from the Europeans. The European Union will take on the major portion of the responsibility for rebuilding the region, reconstructing the area. 
   The American people should know that the President of the United States has tasked the Secretary of State to see to it--we will hear phrases such as ``mini Marshall Plan''--that the United States of America is not going to bear the brunt of the financial burden in reconstructing southeastern Europe. It is fully within the capacity of the Europeans. It is their responsibility. It is in their interest, and they are prepared to do it. 
   On the military side, the first part is in place. The Yugoslav Government has capitulated on every single point NATO has demanded. The last several days of discussions between NATO and Yugoslav military commanders were not about negotiation. They were about the modalities of meeting the concessions made by Milosevic's government on every single point NATO demanded. It took some time to work that out. 
   ``Modalities'' is a fancy foreign policy word. Translated, it means: How in the devil are they going to leave the country? In what order are they going to leave the country? What unit goes first? When do NATO forces, KFOR, move in so that no vacuum is 
   created? By ``vacuum,'' I mean when there are no Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. 
   That is what was going on. I got sick of hearing commentators on the air talking about how negotiations were going on between NATO and Milosevic. There were no negotiations. It was a total, complete surrender by the Yugoslavs, as it should have been. 
   There is now a firm, verifiable timetable for withdrawal of all Yugoslav and Serbian military, and all special police--those thugs who have roamed the countryside in black masks, raping women, executing men, and wreaking havoc on a civilian population. Those thugs--half of whom are war criminals themselves, and should be indicted as such, like Milosevic--are required to leave. The worst of all are the paramilitaries. They all are also required to leave. If they do not leave, they will be killed or forcibly expelled. 
   As I speak, this withdrawal has begun, although I trust Mr. Milosevic and the Serbian military about as far as I could throw the marble podium behind which the Presiding Officer sits. I am not worried, because even if they default, I am convinced of the resolve of NATO. We will pursue them. General Clark said 78 days ago that we would pursue them and hunt them down. And we did. And we will again, if necessary. 
   The fundamental goal of NATO's air campaign has been achieved, notwithstanding all the naysayers on this floor, all the talking heads on television, and all the columnists.  
   There has been an agreement for the return of all internally displaced persons and all Kosovar refugees who fled abroad. This is a monumental achievement, as it involves well over 1 million people. Some commentators have hesitated to call it a victory, but I do not. I understand why they hesitate to call it a victory. They called it a mistake up to now. So why would they call it a victory now? 
   It is a victory--a victory for NATO, a victory for the United States of America, a victory for Western values, a victory for human rights, and a victory for the rule of law. In personal terms, it is a victory for President Clinton and his administration, which, despite unrelenting and often uninformed criticism that began almost immediately, stayed the course. 
   I had some tactical disagreements with the way the administration proceeded. I don't think the President should have said at the outset that ground forces were off the table. He had to move back on that and make it clear that everything was on the table. That is susceptible to criticism. 
   I point out, however, that the President of the United States of America never once wavered on his commitment to do whatever it took to end this ethnic cleansing. 
   But, above all, it is a victory for the brave fighting men and women of NATO who carried out this air campaign, a majority of whom were Americans. Conversely, it is an unmitigated defeat for an indicted war criminal, the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. 
   Just in case anyone wonders, he did not just become a war criminal. He was already a war criminal in 1993 when I spoke to him. He was a war criminal for his actions in Krajina. He was a war criminal for his actions in Bosnia. He is a war criminal for his actions in Kosovo. Had he not been stopped, he would have continued his vile ethnic cleansing. 
   By the way, I encourage my colleagues to read the Genocide Convention. I will not take the time now to recount it, but what has been perpetrated by Milosevic in Kosovo is genocide. 
   Our victory, I suggest, shows that patience and resolve can pay off. It should leave no doubt in the minds of the people throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world of the ability of a unified NATO to achieve its objectives. Now we have to move more swiftly to the second stage of the Kosovo campaign--peace implementation. 
   I read with some dismay today in the major newspapers that the House of Representatives is considering denying the funds to allow any U.S. participation in the implementation of peace. They seem determined to compound the mistake they made just several weeks ago. The reconstruction of Kosovo, as I said, and confirmed by my conversation with the Secretary of State from Germany a half-hour ago, is primarily the responsibility of the European Union. 
   I met with Helmut KOHL, the former Chancellor of Germany, just before the 50th anniversary summit of NATO. We met over at the Library of Congress for the better part of an hour and had a lengthy discussion. He is a very knowledgeable man and until last fall was the longest serving leader in Europe. He pointed out that there were 12 million refugees in Europe after World War II, and that the Europeans were able to handle the problem. He pointed out that the fifteen countries of the European Union have a combined gross domestic product larger than that of the United States of America. Anything remotely approaching a mini Marshall Plan is fully, totally, completely within the financial capability of our European friends, and it is primarily their responsibility. We should and must and will participate. But as I said to the President of the EU, as well as to the chancellor, and as well to every front-line state leader and every leader of the NATO alliance with whom I met, the sharing of the reconstruction burden in southeastern Europe should not be as it is in NATO, roughly 75-25. It should be more like 90-10. It is primarily their responsibility, and they understand they will greatly benefit from a reconstructed and more unified southeastern Europe. I wish them well and hope their initiative will succeed. 
   This ratio, as I said, should be juxtaposed with the heavy responsibility we bore militarily in the Yugoslav campaign. The overwhelming majority of airstrikes when ordinance was dropped was carried out by our forces, and we have footed the lion's share of the bill. We have done this as the leader of NATO and as the only military power in the alliance capable of shouldering the burden. I do not complain about America's shouldering more of the burden when no one else is capable. But I do and will complain when others are equally or more capable than we are, and they do not take the lion's share of the responsibility. But in this case there is no argument, because the Europeans understand their obligation in economic reconstruction, and they are able and willing to carry it out. As I mentioned, they have already demonstrated the willingness to take the lead by proposing a Stability Pact for southeastern Europe, which at a later date I will discuss in detail. The European Union plan, in my view, should be coordinated with our own ongoing SEED program, which has already accomplished much in economic and democratic reconstruction in the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. 
   But the key question is the reconstruction of Serbia. There should be no reconstruction of Serbia as long as an indicted war criminal is Yugoslavia's President, as long as he is on the political scene. Once the Serbian people remove him, the Western World will be ready, willing, and able to come to the aid of Serbia and do it gladly. I hope that we will have the nerve to arrest Milosevic, send him to the International Criminal Tribunal at the Hague, and God willing, see him convicted. Only then, only when Serb people understand the extent of the atrocities Milosevic is responsible for, will they face up to the harsh reality of what they, quite possibility unintentionally, but nonetheless enabled to happen. It is time to end the perpetuation of the myth that Serbia is a victim. 
   I do not propose to be able to say exactly when and how Milosevic will leave office, but I predict there will be no Milosevic in power at this time next year. I think his days are numbered for three reasons. 
   First of all, most Serbian citizens realize if Milosevic had accepted the Rambouillet accords last February, they would have had substantially the same result but without having their country crippled by 11 weeks of bombing. 
   Second, as the troops return from Kosovo, the word will spread of the horrible casualties the Serbian troops have suffered. They do not know that yet because of the repressive Milosevic regime that manipulates the news. The number of Serbian military, paramilitary and police casualties will, I predict, total nearly 10,000. When the Serbian people learn of this carnage, I predict they will be angry, not merely at NATO but at Milosevic for bringing this upon them. Ten thousand Serbian soldiers and special police were killed, many of them slaughtered in B-52 raids in the last days of the war when Milosevic was stalling on signing the military technical agreement. When the extent of Serbian combat losses sinks in, there will be fury against Milosevic and his cronies. 
   Third, as KFOR--that is the acronym for the NATO implementation force--occupies Kosovo, I am convinced that every prediction I made here about the atrocities that were taking place will unfortunately be proven correct. You will be stunned at the evidence that will be uncovered of the brutality and the atrocities committed by the Serbians on a mass scale, far greater than the horrible massacres we already know about. These revelations, I believe, will further alienate the many decent Serbs who rallied behind Milosevic as their patriotic duty during the bombing campaign. 
   We know that KFOR's task will be a daunting one. Millions of mines must be removed. All booby traps must be found and disposed of. And--I do not know how it can be avoided--surely some NATO forces will be killed. I pray to God that this will not happen. I pray to God that KFOR turns out as successful in that category as the military campaign has, but I do not think we can count on that. 
   All armed locals and irregulars in Kosovo must be intimidated into submission. The KLA must be turned into  a demilitarized police force under civilian control. 
   All these will be difficult tasks, but I am confident that they can be accomplished if we maintain resolve. Nothing, however, that happens from this point on can detract from the magnitude of the victory we have achieved. 
   Had President Clinton heeded the call to negotiate with Milosevic, it would have been a disaster. 
   Had President Clinton heeded the call to stop the bombing, it would have been a disaster. 
   Had President Clinton heeded the call to run roughshod over our NATO allies and disregard their wishes, the alliance would have fractured and that, too, would have been a disaster. This place, including Democrats, would have run out from under him faster than I can walk from here to the door of the Chamber. It is remarkable how he was able to keep the alliance together. Most importantly, had President Clinton not stayed the course and achieved this victory, our geopolitical position in North Korea, in Iraq, and in many other parts of the world would have suffered grievously. I ask my colleagues to think about what at this moment Saddam Hussein is thinking. Had we listened to those who said: Cease and desist, partition, stop bombing, negotiate with Milosevic, cut a deal--what do you think would be happening in Baghdad now? 
   But the President did stay the course, and our magnificent fighting men and women performed in an exemplary way. Because we have succeeded in the military campaign, and because we have the ability to succeed in the civilian reconstruction that will follow, the world has seen that the President of the United States, the American people,, and a united NATO have the will to respond to crises and successfully defend Western values and interests. 
   I will be taking the floor again many more times in the following weeks on this issue. I know my colleagues are probably tired of my speaking on this. It has been something I have been discussing since 1990. But we are finally finding our sea legs. 
   I will conclude by saying that in the case of Kosovo and Yugoslavia, American interests are at stake, the cause is just, the means are available, and the will was present. For Lord's sake, let's not now, out of some misguided sense of isolationism or partisanship, do anything other than finalize this victory and secure our interests. 
   Think about it: the removal from Kosovo of the Serbian troops means, at a minimum, that Slobodan Milosevic's goons will no longer be able to harass, rob, rape, expel, or kill over a million Kosovars. I believe he has lost his ability to overthrow the Montenegrin Government, and certainly to overthrow Macedonia's government and to fundamentally destabilize Albania, Romania, and Bulgaria. This is a significant accomplishment, but most importantly, it demonstrates that not only this President, but also the next President, whether he or she is a Republican or a Democrat, is going to be faced with very hard choices. I respectfully suggest that he or she should not underestimate the will, the grit, the patience, or the common sense of the American people. They know what we did was right. 
   I was in Macedonia. I have been in the region a half a dozen times. I have also had the displeasure of meeting alone for almost 3 hours with Slobodan Milosevic, at which meeting, in early 1993, he asked what I thought of him. I told him then that I thought he was a damn war criminal and should be tried as such. He looked at me as if I had said, ``Lots of luck in your senior year.'' It did not phase him a bit. Even some of my staff said as we were leaving: You said that to a President of a country. 
   I said: I don't care. He is a war criminal. 
   The justification of what we did was best summed up on my last trip a few weeks ago. I was sitting in the airfield outside of Skopje in Macedonia. I walked into a tent where there were about 15 young Americans ranging in age from 18 to 30, all noncommissioned officers. They were the crew that was gathered together from all over the world to make that airfield compatible for our Apache helicopters and for the large C-130s that were flying in with food deliveries. 
   I walked in, and we started talking. They were taking a break. We were sitting on cots. I thanked them for what they were doing. I said: You know, I am getting a lot of heat back home. Some of my colleagues, including some of my seatmates, refer to this as ``Biden's war.'' Some of my friends are telling me this is another Vietnam. What are you guys--there was actually one woman--what do you all think about that? Do you think this is another Vietnam? 
   One, I believe a sergeant about 24 years old, looked at me and answered: Senator, let me ask you a question. When you were 24 years old, if they had called you up and sent you here, would you have had any doubt about the justice of what you were doing? 
   All of a sudden it became clear to me. They had no doubt. Our young fighters have no doubt about the justness of what they have undertaken. They knew it was right. We did the right thing. 
   I pray to God that we have the courage and the patience and the ability to resist our partisan instincts on both sides and stay the course. Because if we do, we can bend history just a little, but bend it in a way that my grandchildren will not have to wonder about whether or not they will have to fight in Europe in the year 2020 or the year 2025. 
   I congratulate the Senate for, at the end of the day, every day, having done the right thing in this war. I congratulate the President and his administration for having had the political courage to stay the course. I plead with my colleagues in the House to do the right thing. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words today about a man who is one of America's finest civil servants and a man who I am proud to call a friend, Jim Kallstrom. 
   Jim Kallstrom had an illustrious career with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI''), one in which he played a major role in building up the Bureau's counter-terrorism capabilities. Jim Kallstrom led the successful FBI investigations into the World Trade Center bombing and the intended bombing of the Lincoln Tunnel. Those investigations broke the back of one of the most violent terrorist groups ever  to operate in this country. Their speedy conclusion also did much to reassure the American public in the wake of the World Trade Center bombing, and they sent a message to terrorists around the world that no person or group can expect to get away with terrorist actions in the United States. 
   Assistant FBI Director for the New York Metropolitan Area, Jim Kallstrom led the Bureau's largest field office. He supervised agents handling many of the FBI's most sensitive criminal, counterintelligence and counterterrorist cases. He was, and is, a vigorous investigator--truly a cop's cop--and an effective administrator. 
   One of Jim Kallstrom's best known accomplishments--and his most controversial role--was his direction of the investigation of the TWA Flight 800 explosion of July 17, 1996. My colleagues will remember that 230 people died in that crash and that there was immediate and great suspicion that this was the result of a terrorist or criminal act. There was also a recurrent allegation that the U.S. armed forces had accidentally shot down the aircraft and were trying to cover up their role. That allegation was utterly false, but it acquired a life of its own despite the facts. It was, in fact, one of the first cases of a rumor spread and perpetuated by the Internet. 
   In the initial days of this case--as the desperate search for any survivors turned into a continuing and heroic mission to retrieve and identify the hundreds of bodies, and as a raft of local and federal agencies converged to handle a multitude of tasks--Jim Kallstrom stepped in and imposed order on the incipient chaos. Over the coming weeks and months, it was the determination and competence of Jim Kallstrom that reassured the American people and gave us all confidence that no stone would be left unturned in the search for any criminal evidence. 
   In recent weeks, one of my colleagues has raised the possibility that Jim Kallstrom, in the course of pursuing his counterterrorist investigation to the fullest, may have delayed or tried to delay the transmission to the National Transportation Safety Board of a report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (``BATF'') that concluded that the TWA Flight 800 explosion appeared to be caused by a mechanical flaw in the center fuel tank. 
   Mr. Kallstrom denies that allegation. He insists that he forwarded the BATF report to the National Transportation Safety Board within a few days of receiving it. He admits that he was angry that BATF would issue its conclusions while the counterterrorist and criminal investigation was still ongoing. 
   I do not know whether Mr. Kallstrom delayed transmission of the BATF report, although I note that two FBI officials testified that he did not. What I do know is that Mr. Kallstrom was performing most admirably in a situation fraught with challenges. 
   Let me emphasize those challenges. Millions of Americans drew the initial conclusion that this explosion was caused either by a bomb or by a missile. There was an urgent need not only to conduct a thorough investigation into that possibility, but also to demonstrate to the American people that the United States Government was doing everything humanly possible to bring any perpetrators to justice, while still doing anything humanely possible to meet the needs of hundreds of bereaved families and showing proper respect for the dead. 
   This was no easy task, and no small one, either. Jim Kallstrom assumed those duties and brought the TWA Flight 800 investigation to a successful conclusion. I say ``successful'' very purposely, for the investigation did not fail to uncover any terrorist or criminal act. Rather, it eliminated those possibilities and gave the American people confidence that the explosion was instead a tragic accident. 
   Some have expressed concern that the FBI might have unwittingly delayed necessary action to correct safety flaws in U.S. commercial aircraft. I understand this concern and I would agree that recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board have not been given sufficient attention by the Federal Aviation Administration. But safety board officials apparently reached the same conclusion as BATF weeks earlier, and they reportedly do not believe that any delay in receiving the BATF report hindered their ability to persuade the FAA to take corrective action. 
   Some people feel that the FBI was too determined to find evidence of a terrorist or criminal act. I don't doubt for a moment that some investigators found Jim Kallstrom rather intimidating in his determination to find any such evidence. The bad news is that Jim Kallstrom is sometimes intimidating. The good news is also that Jim Kallstrom is sometimes intimidating. He gets the job done. He also projects confidence and determination. That is what was needed of the head of the FBI's New York office, and that is what was needed by the head of the TWA Flight 800 investigation. 
   I am sorry if some investigators felt that Jim Kallstrom stepped on their toes. But I am happy as can be that he was the man to whom our nation turned when a conspicuously thorough investigation was needed--so as to catch and convict the murderers if there were any, and otherwise to give us complete confidence that the Flight 800 explosion was truly an accident. Jim Kallstrom accomplished that feat, and we are all in his debt for his tremendous service to his country.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to our colleague from Oklahoma and our colleague from New Hampshire. They are among only a few who will bluntly state why they want out. They are straightforward. The Senator from Oklahoma says this is a way out of Kosovo, just like we should find a way out of Bosnia. They say we have no interest in Yugoslavia. We have no ability to do anything about it. And we have no right. 
   I find this absolutely fascinating. We talk about a sovereign nation being invaded by a horde of 19 democracies who are doing such an injustice to them. 
   Then I hear that one of the reasons we should not be involved is because Yugoslavia is a sovereign country. I cannot remember what their explanation was as to why we should not be involved in Bosnia, where Slobodan Milosevic was crossing the Drina River with these very forces that are cutting off the noses, ears and then cutting the throats of captured men in Kosovo, who are taking their 
   women to the third floor of army barracks for the pleasure of the troops and picking what they believe to be the most attractive of the women who happen to be Moslems. These are the same fellows that crossed the Drina River and invaded another country. I heard the same arguments from you all about how we should not be involved there. So do not let anybody fool you, this is not about sovereignty. 
   The second point I would make is that we have reached the conclusion, straightforwardly, that Slobodan Milosevic's business is his business. What do we have to do with that? Let them work it out. 
   I never thought I would live to see the day when a European leader was herding masses of women and children onto boxcars and trains in the sight of all the world, shipping them off to another border, destroying, as they crossed the border, their licenses, taking their birth certificates, going into  the town halls and destroying the property records of those very people. And it is so convenient to say that is not our business. 
   Then I hear another argument. You know, we have commitments around the world. We will not be able to fight a two-front war. But what is the threat to America beyond the nuclear one? And that will not be deterred by American ground forces. I hear my friend from New Hampshire say: Let the Europeans take care of this. Have we not shed enough blood in Europe? 
   But we have to worry about Korea? Why not say let the Asians take care of Korea? There are more of them than us. We have shed enough blood in Asia. 
   Are we protecting the use of American force in Europe so we can use it in Korea? 
   If that is the logic, explain to me why the Japanese and the South Koreans cannot take care of themselves. I find this incredibly selective logic. 
   And, by the way, this so-called failure in Bosnia--what a fascinating notion. Nobody is being killed there now; the raping, the rape camps, the ethnic cleansing have stopped; people are actually living next door to one another again. There are 6,800 American forces there, and that is supposedly too high a price to pay without, thank God--as my mother would say, knock on wood--one American being killed? I am sure glad you guys were not around in 1955 and 1956 and 1957 to say: By the way, all those forces we have in Germany, they are sitting there occupying a country and protecting a country, but their mission must be a failure because if they left, there would be war.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my senior colleague, Senator ROTH, for carrying the load on this. 
   As we look forward to Memorial Day observances this weekend, most of us will take time to reflect on the honorable and noble traditions of our military. The amendment sponsored by myself and my good friends Senator ROTH, THURMOND, and KENNEDY is an effort to make sure Congress does its part to uphold those noble traditions. 
   Just to highlight two or three points: First of all, my friend from Virginia talks about the historical record. The historical record was made at that time when history was least likely to be served in the immediate aftermath of a national tragedy, and a need for an explanation that the country yearned and desired. I am not suggesting those who conducted the original investigation had any benevolent intent. I am suggesting that history is best viewed with a little bit of distance. There was not any distance. I just ask everyone to think about what would happen if something, God forbid, similarly happened today and this Senate, this body, and the administration decided they needed to investigate something immediately. My overwhelming instinct tells me there would be a need to find specific individuals who were responsible in order to satisfy our collective need for an answer. 
   I respectfully suggest that that is what happened here, and I respectfully suggest, as well, that we should not be fearful of the truth and we should not be fearful of going back in this open society of ours and not rewriting history, but setting the facts straight. 
   Ultimately, it is the President who must take action, but it is important that we in the Senate send the message that the historical truth matters and that it is never too late to acknowledge that the government did not treat the two commanding officers at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, fairly. 
   Here's how I see it. Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter Short were publicly vilified and never given a chance to clear their names. 
   If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the truth, then there would be no need for the President to take action. But we don't. We live in an open society. Eventually, we are able to declassify documents and evaluate our past based on at least a good portion of the whole story. I believe sincerely that one of our greatest strengths as a nation comes from our ability to honor truth and learn the lessons from our past.  
   If we perpetuate the myth that Admiral Kimmel and General Short bear all of the blame for Pearl Harbor then we miss the real story. We fail to look at the readiness shortfalls they were facing--the lack of adequate reconnaissance planes, pilots, spare parts, and maintenance crews. We fail to look at the flawed intelligence model that was used--the disconnect between what was obtained and what got to the commanders in the field. 
   I mention these things in particular because there are some striking parallels to the problems facing today's military. Today's problems are of a different scope and scale, but it is important to see the parallels so that we can accurately judge our progress and our endemic problems. 
   The historic record is not flattering to our government in the case of the two commanding officers at Pearl Harbor and that is why it is our government's responsibility to acknowledge its mistake. I want to emphasize that point, because it is important. 
   In last night's debate over this amendment, both those for and against it agreed on most of the facts. Where there was disagreement, it seems to me, was in what to do about the facts. I believe we should urge the President to take action, because government action in the past shrouded the truth and scapegoated Kimmel and Short. 
   I know Senator ROTH and Senator THURMOND discussed some of the history last night, so I will just briefly review some of the critical parts. 
   In 1941, after lifetimes of honorable service defending this nation and its values, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were denied the most basic form of justice--a hearing by their peers. Instead of a proper court-martial, their ordeal began on December 18th with the Roberts Commission. A mere 11 days after the devastating attack at Pearl Harbor, this Commission was established to determine the facts. 
   In this highly charged atmosphere, the Commission conducted a speedy investigation, lasting little over a month. In the process, they denied both commanders counsel and assured both that they would not be passing judgement on their performance. That assurance was worthless. Instead, the Commission delivered highly judgmental findings and then immediately publicized those findings. The Roberts Commission is the only investigative body to find these two officers derelict in their duty and it was this government that decided to publicize that false conclusion. As one might expect, the two commanders were vilified by a nation at war. 
   Every succeeding investigation was clear in finding that there was no dereliction of duty. The first of these were the 1944 Army Board and Navy Court reviews. Again, it was government action that prevented a truthful record from reaching the public--a decision by the President. The findings of both of these bodies that placed blame on others than Kimmel and Short were sequestered and classified. 
   Fifty-seven years later, such falsehoods and treatment can no longer be justified by the necessities of war. Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Major General Walter Short were not singularly to blame for the disastrous events of Pearl Harbor in 1941. In fact, every investigation of Admiral Kimmel and General Short's conduct highlights significant failings by their superiors. 
   This amendment does not involve any costs, nor does it seek any special honor or award for these two officers. It does not even seek to exonerate them from all responsibility. Instead, it seeks simple fairness and their equal treatment. They are the only two eligible officers from World War II denied advancement on the retirement lists to their highest held wartime ranks. 
   I know my colleague from Virginia is concerned that there may be a long list of junior officers who can make similar claims. It is my understanding that there was a list of officers from World War II eligible for advancement under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the only officers on that list that were denied advancement on the retirement list. 
   I want to stress again for all my colleagues that this amendment simply sets the record straight--responsibility for Pearl Harbor must be broadly shared. It cannot be broadly shared if we fail to acknowledge the government's historic role in clouding the truth, nor if we continue to perpetuate the myth that Kimmel and Short bear singular responsibility for the tragic losses at Pearl Harbor. 
   These two officers were unjustly stigmatized by our nation's failure to treat them in the same manner with which we treated their peers. To reverse this wrong would be consistent with this nation's sense of military honor and basic fairness. 
   As we honor those who have given their lives to preserve American ideals and national interests this coming Memorial Day, we must not forget two brave officers whose true story remains shrouded and singularly tarnished by official neglect of the truth. 
   We introduced this amendment as S.J. Res. 19 earlier this year and it now has 23 co-sponsors. As I know Senator ROTH indicated last night, it has the support of numerous veterans organizations and retired Navy flag officers. These knowledgeable people and about a quarter of the Senate have already spoken up on behalf of justice and fairness. 
   I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us and support this amendment.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is a rhetorical question. The report suggested that Generals Marshall and Stark were also partially responsible. My point is that the idea that the entirety of the blame, that the children and the children of the children of these two men will live forever thinking that they were the only two people responsible for this, is a historical inaccuracy, unfair, and a blemish that is not warranted to be carried by the two proud families whose names are associated with them. It is as simple as that.

Presidents make commitments all the time. Commitments and obligations do not a treaty make and do not require a supermajority vote under the Constitution by the Senate to ratify those commitments. I, at least for the time being, object and hope that after we finish this debate, before we vote, my colleague and I can have a few minutes in the well to see whether he will consider amending it to add the word ``legal'' on line 7 of his amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the things that we sometimes confuse here--I know I do--is what is a political obligation and what is a constitutional obligation. I respectfully suggest that there is no constitutional requirement for the President of the United States--this President or any future President--to submit to the Senate for ratification, as if it were an amendment to a treaty, a Strategic Concept that is a political document. We use the words interchangeably on this floor. A new commitment or obligation, as I said, does not a treaty make. 
   Our Strategic Concept has always been a political, not legal document. Before last month's summit, NATO had revised the Strategic Concept five times in the past and never once had required the Senate's advice and consent. Doing so now would gravely undermine NATO's alliance and our efforts, as well as being a significant overreach in terms of our constitutional authority. 
   Let's not be fooled by the fact that the Roberts-Warner amendment only expresses the sense of the Senate. My concern is that unless we know exactly its dimension, it will be read in other NATO capitals as much more than it is. Just as my friend from Kansas quoted from the headlines and editorials of other newspapers--I might note that they were not governments, but other newspapers--I point out that people in other countries can misread actions taken by a country or group of countries. My concern is that in NATO capitals our actions will be misread. 
   The amendment sets out political criteria in point 1; and then in point 2 transforms them into legally binding ones that would require the Senate's advice and consent. This is a clever use of a non sequitur. 
   NATO's Strategic Concept has always given political guidance to the alliance's members. To that extent, this sixth revision of the Strategic Concept imposes commitments. But contrary to the assertions made by my distinguished friend from Kansas, it in no way changes the fundamental purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. 
   We should oppose this amendment for four reasons, but if we are not going to oppose it now that it has been changed from its original amendment, we should at least recognize four important points: 
   One, to suggest that--if it were to be suggested--the Strategic Concept should be treated as an amendment to the treaty would set a terrible precedent and send a horrible signal at a time when we are striving to maintain alliance unity. 
   It would signal our NATO allies that the United States will not implement the new Strategic Concept without formal Senate advice and consent. 
   If we pass this amendment, couldn't the British, French, or Germans say tomorrow that they are going to disregard NATO's operating procedures? Couldn't they say tomorrow that they are no longer going to be bound by their commitment to beef up their military capacity as they committed to in 1991? 
   Given that NATO's decisions require unanimity, and that all 19 NATO member parliaments might then assert that they would have to ratify each and every future change in an operating procedure, we would be building in chaos to the alliance. How could we operate under those 
   circumstances? 
   The second point I want to make is that we should remember that there have been many other changes in the Strategic Concept, as my friend from Michigan has pointed out, and they were never considered the equivalent of a new international treaty. 
   As I mentioned, before this year, NATO's original 1949 Strategic Concept had been revised five other times. Included among those were three fundamental transformations. 
   In 1957, the alliance adopted a new strategy, which would have shocked my friend from Kansas. It was called Massive Retaliation. Talk about a commitment--a commitment that was, I might add, totally consistent with the provisions of the treaty. It was an operating procedure. 
   In 1967, NATO abandoned the doctrine of Massive Retaliation in favor of the doctrine of Flexible Response. And then, in 1991, to continue to make the treaty relevant operationally, NATO recognized that after the end of the Soviet threat, NATO would nonetheless be confronted by a series of new threats to the alliance's security, such as ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes. It altered the Strategic Concept accordingly. 
   These were dramatic changes to alliance strategy, yet not once did the Senate, notwithstanding the fact it was not asleep, believe it had to provide its advice and consent. 
   There was a great deal of discussion about the 1991 Strategic Concept. I participated in it, others participated in it, and it revolved around what was the purpose of NATO and how we were operationally going to function now that the worry was no longer having 50 Soviet divisions coming through the Fulda Gap in Germany--a recognition that the territorial integrity of member states was still threatened, and instead of Soviet divisions rolling through the Fulda Gap with Warsaw Pact allies, there was a different threat, nonetheless real, nonetheless warranting this mutual commitment made to defend the territorial integrity of member states. 
   We discussed it. We debated it. There were those who thought it didn't go far enough. There are those who thought it went too far. But it wasn't that we were asleep and didn't pay attention. In fact, maybe it was because--and I am not being facetious--my friend was in the House where they don't deal with treaties, where it is not their constitutional obligation, and where foreign policy is not the thing they spend the bulk of their time on. But we weren't asleep over here. In fact, the current 1999 version of the Strategic Concept is much more similar to its 1991 predecessor than the 1991 document was to any of its predecessors.  
   My third point is simple. The revised Strategic Concept does not require advice and consent because it is not a treaty. 
   The rules under U.S. law on what constitutes a binding international agreement are set forth in the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, as well as in the State Department regulations implementing the Case-Zablocki Act. 
   Under the Restatement, the key criterion as to whether an international agreement is legally binding is if the parties intend that it be legally binding and governed by international law. (Restatement, Sec. 301(1)). 
   Similarly, the State Department regulations state that the ``parties must intend their undertaking to be legally binding and not merely of political or personal effect.'' (22 Code of Federal Regulations 181.2(a)(1)). 
   Thus, many agreements that are not binding are essentially political statements. There is a moral and political obligation to comply in such cases, but not a legal one. 
   The most well-known example of such a political statement is the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, negotiated under the Ford administration and credited by most of us as the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union, the most significant political act that began to tear the Berlin Wall down. That was a political statement--commitments we made, but not of treaty scope requiring the advice and consent of the Senate. 
   The second key criterion is whether an international agreement contains language that clearly and specifically describe the obligations that are to be undertaken. 
   An international agreement must have objective criteria for determining the enforceability of the agreement. (22 C.F.R. &#167;181.2(a)(3)). 
   Another criterion is the form of the agreement. That is, a formal document labeled ``Agreement'' with final clauses about the procedures for entry into force is probably a binding agreement. This is not a central requirement, but it does provide another indication that an agreement is binding. (22 C.F.R. &#167;181.2(a)(5)). 
   A reading of the Strategic Concept clearly indicates that it is not a binding instrument of which treaties are made. 
   Rather, the Strategic Concept is merely a political statement with which my colleague from Kansas and others disagree. I respect that. I respect their disagreement with the political commitment that was made. But their political disagreement with a political commitment does not cause it to rise to the level of a binding treaty obligation requiring the advice and consent of the Senate, no matter how important each of them may be, no matter how relevant their objectives may be, no matter how enlightened their foreign policy may be. 
   Rather, the Strategic Concept is merely a political statement that outlines NATO's military and political strategy for carrying out the obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty. 
   Nowhere in the Strategic Concept can you find binding obligations upon the members of NATO. 
   For, if that were the case, all of our European allies as of a year ago, with the exception of Great Britain, would have been in violation of their treaty obligations--would have been in violation of their treaty obligations because of the commitments they made to build up--I will not bore the Senate with the details--their military capacity. Yet no one here on the floor has risen to suggest over the past several years, even though we have decried their failure to meet their obligations, that they have violated their treaty obligations. 
   Instead, the language of the Strategic Concept contains general statements about how NATO will carry out its mission. 
   The most important question, as I stated, is the intent of the parties. As the President wrote to the Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services on April 14, ``the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States.'' 
   Of course, the Strategic Concept creates a political commitment. And we take our political commitments seriously. 
   All member states, the United States included, assume political obligations when they take part in the alliance's integrated military planning. 
   That is what target force goals are all about. And, Mr. President, that lies at the heart of burden-sharing, whose importance several of us continually stress to our NATO allies. 
   The 1999 Strategic Concept creates a planning framework for NATO to act collectively to meet new threats if they arise. 
   So I would summarize the key point in this way: the Strategic Concept imposes political obligations to create military capabilities, but it does not impose legal obligations to use those capabilities. 
   My fourth point is that I understand the concern that NATO's core mission--alliance defense--not be altered. It has not been. 
   Our negotiators at last month's NATO summit did exactly what the vast majority of Senators wanted. 
   They consciously incorporated the Senate's concerns that NATO remain a defensive alliance when they negotiated the revised Strategic Concept. 
   The revised Strategic Concept duplicates much of the language contained in the Kyl amendment to the Resolution of Ratification on NATO Enlargement. 
   You all remember the Kyl amendment. We were not asleep at the switch. We were not failing to pay attention. We debated at length--my friend from Virginia, and I, and others--NATO enlargement. It is one of the few areas on which we have disagreed. 
   We debated at length the Kyl amendment. Let me remind my colleagues that the amendment was adopted by the Senate in April of 1998 by a 90-9 vote. 
   Rather than reviewing the specifics of the document, because time does not permit, nor do I think memories have to be refreshed that clearly, because everyone remembers, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to enter into the RECORD a document provided by the Clinton administration that reviews paragraph by paragraph the similarities between the Kyl amendment and the 1999 Strategic Concept.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me also remind my colleagues that NATO's decisions require unanimity. I know we all know that. We got that unanimity at a recent Washington summit after long and tough negotiations. 
   By appearing to withhold U.S. support for the revised Strategic Concept--and perhaps eventually even blocking its implementation--this amendment, if misread, would put the alliance in great jeopardy. 
   And that could lead to the collapse of NATO, which I am sure is not the goal of my colleague from Kansas. 
   One final comment. I know that my friend from Kansas is strongly opposed to the conduct of the current war in Yugoslavia, and, while disagreeing with him, I respect his views. 
   But, I would remind him and the rest of my colleagues that the 1999 revision of the Strategic Concept is neither the justification for, nor the driving force behind, NATO's bombing campaign or actions in Kosovo. 
   NATO's bombing campaign began a full month before the newest revision of the Strategic Concept was approved at the Washington Summit. 
   To sum up, there are no compelling political or legal arguments for the Roberts amendment. 
   in terms of making this concept subject to treaty amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this amendment. 
   I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Strategic Concept does not rise to the level of a treaty amendment, and the Senator from Michigan has pointed that out. Therefore, it is a benign amendment, we are told, and in all probability it is. But it is unnecessary. It does mischief. It sends the wrong message. It is a bad idea, notwithstanding the fact that it has been cleaned up to the point that it is clear it does not rise to the level of a treaty requiring a treaty vote on the Strategic Concept. 
   But I agree with the Senator from Arizona. He painstakingly on this floor laid out in the Kyl amendment during the expansion of NATO debate exactly what we asked the President to consider in the Strategic Concept that was being negotiated with our allies. They did that. We voted 90 to 9. 
   This is a bad idea.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be necessarily brief. 
   It is not often I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER. I think he is right in the fundamental sense that if the President is going to send American ground forces into a war, it needs congressional authority. 
   Very honestly, this amendment is, in my view, flawed. First of all, it is clear that the President has to come to Congress to use ground forces and that the President has already stated--I will ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a copy of his letter dated April 28, 1999, to the Speaker of the House in which he says in part:  
   Indeed, without regard to our differing constitutional views on the use of force, I would ask for Congressional support before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo into a non-permissive environment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, not only must the President, but he said he would. 
   This amendment is flawed in two respects. First, as a constitutional matter, I believe it is unnecessary. The Constitution already bars offensive military action by the President unless it is congressionally authorized or under his emergency powers. 
   The Senate resolution we adopted only authorizes the use of airpower. If Congress adopts this amendment, it seems to me we will imply the President has carte blanche to take offensive action, and anywhere else unless the Congress makes a specific statement to the contrary in advance. In short, I think it will tender an invitation to Presidents in the future to use force whenever they want unless Congress provides a specific ban in advance. 
   Putting that aside, however, the amendment is flawed because its exceptions are much too narrowly drawn. The amendment purports to bar the use of Armed Forces in response to an attack against Armed Forces. 
   For example, we have thousands of soldiers now in Albania and Macedonia.  Let's suppose the Yugoslav forces launch an attack against U.S. forces in Albania or in Macedonia. This amendment would bar the use of ground forces to respond by going into Kosovo. 
   The power to respond against such an attack is clearly within the power of the Commander in Chief. So, too, does the President have the power to launch a preemptive strike against an imminent attack. The U.S. forces do not have to wait until they take the first punch. 
   The second point I will make in this brief amount of time I am taking is that the amendment does not appear to permit the use of U.S. forces in the evacuation of Americans. Most constitutional scholars concede the President has the power to use force in emergency circumstances to protect American citizens facing an imminent and direct threat to their lives. 
   In sum, notwithstanding the fact that my colleague from Pennsylvania is going to amend his own amendment, it does not, in my view, appear to be necessary and it unconstitutionally restricts recognized powers of the President. 
   This comes from a guy--namely me--who has spent the bulk of the last 25 years arguing that the President has to have congressional authority to use force in circumstances such as this, and he does. But to bar funds in advance, before a President even attempts to use ground forces, in the face of him saying he will not use them and in the face of a letter in which he says he will not send them without seeking Congress' authority, seems to me to not only be constitutionally unnecessary but sends an absolutely devastating signal to Mr. Milosevic and others. 
   For example, I, for one, have been encouraging the Secretary of Defense, our National Security Adviser, and the President of the United States to get about the business of prepositioning right now the 50,000 forces they say will be needed in a permissive environment. That is an environment where there is a peace agreement. If tomorrow peace broke out in Yugoslavia, if Mr. Milosevic yielded to the demands of NATO, there would be chaos in Kosovo because there would be no force to put in place in order to ensure the agreement. 
   I worry that an amendment at this moment not only is unnecessary but would send a signal to suggest that we should not even be prepositioning American forces for deployment in a peaceful environment. I think it is unnecessary. 
   I thank the Chair for his indulgence and my colleague for the time. I oppose the amendment.

   Mr. BIDEN. He may recall that I am the one who stood up and said: Mr. President, you do not have the authority to send in ground troops without congressional authorization. Since you have said, Mr. President, you have no intention of doing that, why don't you affirmatively send a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives committing that you will not do that without their authority? He said: I will. And he did. I think we accomplished that. 
   To now say that we are going to add to that the requirement to cut off funds, that we will cut off funds, is a very direct way of saying: We don't trust you, Mr. President. You gave your word; you put it in writing; you put your signature on it; and we still don't trust you. 
   I am not prepared to vote for that.

   Mr. BIDEN. Yes, Mr. President. I think there is. If I may respond. 
   There are several. There is a third and a fourth alternative. One of the alternatives would be, were the resolution merely to say: Mr. President, by concurrent resolution, we believe you do not have the authority to put ground troops in place without our 
   authorization; we expected that you would request of us that authorization before you did, that would create an incredibly difficult political barrier for any President to overcome. It would not be an advance cutoff of funds. 
   I do not recall where we have in advance--in advance of a President taking an action--told him that we would limit the availability of funds for an action he says he has not contemplated undertaking in advance. I think it is a bad way to conduct foreign policy. I think it complicates the circumstance. It sends, at a minimum, a conflicting message. At a minimum, it sends the message to Europe, for example, and our allies, that we, the U.S. Congress, think the President is about to send American forces in when he has not said he wishes to do that. 
   Secondly, it says in advance, to our enemies, that the President cannot send in ground forces unless he undoes an action already taken, giving an overwhelming prejudice to the point of view that the President could never get the support to use ground forces. 
   I understand my friend from Pennsylvania--and I have said this before, and I mean it sincerely, there is no one in this body I respect more than him, but he has indicated that he would be amenable to a consideration of the use of ground forces, if asked. But I suspect that is not how this will be interpreted in not only Belgrade but other parts of the world. I think it will be interpreted as the Senate saying they do not want ground troops to be put in under any circumstances. That is not what he is saying. But that is, I believe, how it will be interpreted. 
   So let me sum up my response to the Senator's question: A, we could, in fact, say to the President: Mr. President, if you are going to use ground forces, come and ask us, with no funds cut off in terms of a resolution. 
   Secondly, we could say to the President: Mr. President, we have your letter in hand. We take you at your word and expect that that is what you would do, memorializing the political context in which this decision was made, which Presidents are loath to attempt to overcome.  
   The bottom line is, the President of the United States can in fact go ahead and disregard this as easily as he could disregard the provisions of the Constitution. If a President were going to decide that he would disregard the constitutional requirement of seeking our authority to use ground forces, I respectfully suggest he would not be at all hesitant to overcome a prohibition in an authorization bill saying no funds authorized here could be used. 
   He could argue that funds that have already been authorized have put force in place, with bullets in their guns, gasoline in their tanks, fuel in their aircraft; that he has the authority to move notwithstanding this prohibition. 
   I understand the intention of my friend from Pennsylvania. I applaud it. I think it is unnecessary in a very complex circumstance and situation in which the President of the United States has indicated he does not intend to do it anyway. And I just think it sends all the wrong messages and is unnecessary and is overly restrictive.

   Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, and I had an amendment to attempt to preauthorize the use of ground forces. The Congress debated, as the Parliamentarian can tell us, in the context of the War Powers Act, having been triggered by a letter sent by the President to the Congress. 
   We have already spoken. We have already spoken as a Congress. We have made it clear to the President of the United States, unfortunately, in my view, that under the War Powers Act, we believe he should not at this moment be introducing ground forces because the McCain-Biden amendment was defeated, which was an affirmative attempt to give him authority in advance to use ground forces. So we have already debated this issue of ground forces in the context of the War Powers Act, which was one of the two documents cited by the Senator from Pennsylvania, the other being the U.S. Constitution. I argue we have done that. 
   Second, I point out that I can't imagine a modern-day President, in the face of an overwhelming or even majority congressional decision, saying you should not use force and having the political will or courage to go ahead and use it anyway. I do not think such a circumstance exists. If you think this President is likely to do that, then you have a view of his willingness to take on the Congress that exceeds that of almost anyone I know. 
   The idea that this President, in this context, having said so many times that he would not and does not want to use ground forces, would fly in the face of a majority of the Members of the Congress saying he should not do it without coming here, in what everyone would acknowledge would be a difficult political decision to make in any instance and difficult military decision to make, and then if, in fact, he is not immediately successful, I believe everyone in this Chamber would acknowledge that it would probably effectively bring this Presidency down. I just can't imagine that being the matter. 
   Let me conclude by saying, Professor Corwin is credited with having said that the Constitution merely issues an invitation to the President and the Senate does battle over who controls the foreign policy. Seldom will Presidents take action that is totally contrary to the expressed views of the Congress which risk American lives and clearly would result in American body bags coming home. 
   I wish he had a view different than the one I am asserting, because I think we need to have that option open and real. I am not sure it is. I am almost positive there is no reasonable prospect this President, or for that matter the last President, would have moved in the face of the Congress having already stated its views that it was not willing to give him that power in advance, which is another way of saying: Mr. President, if you want this power, come and ask us. 
   So I think it is unnecessary. I think it is redundant. I think it has already been spoken to as it relates to the War Powers Act. I think it is a well-intended, mistaken notion as to how we should be limiting this President's use of ground forces. 
   I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding me that time.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to salute a distinguished servant of the legislative branch of the U.S. Congress in the field of foreign affairs. In June 1999, Dr. Robert Sutter will leave the Congressional Research Service after 22 highly productive years as a source of expertise on China and the Asia-Pacific region. Dr. Sutter is resigning from his current position as a Senior Specialist in Asia and International Politics in the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of CRS to become the National Intelligence Officer for East Asia, a critical intelligence community assignment. 
   Since 1977, when he first came to work at CRS as a China specialist, Dr. Sutter has provided Members of Congress and their staffs with authoritative, in-depth analysis and policy options covering a broad range of foreign policy issues involving China, East Asia, and the Pacific. It should be a matter of pride to this body to know that Dr. Sutter is well known both here and in the Asia-Pacific region as one of the most authoritative and productive American Asia hands. 
   In his government career to date of over 30 years, Dr. Sutter has held a variety of analytical and supervisory positions including service with the Foreign Broadcast Information Service and temporary details with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of State. It is in service to Congress, however, specifically with the Congressional Research Service, that Dr. Sutter has spent most of his distinguished career. I want to make a few comments that illustrate the strengths and great contributions of both the institution and the man himself. 
   The first point to make concerns one of the great institutional strengths that CRS offers to the congressional clients it serves, and which Dr. Sutter's tenure and contributions here epitomize perfectly: institutional memory. Dr. Sutter's first published report at CRS was entitled U.S.-PRC Normalization Arguments and Alternatives. Published first as a CRS Report for general congressional use, on August 3, 1977, it soon became a Committee Print of the House International Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. The report and subsequent Committee Print addressed a number of highly controversial issues arising out of President Carter's decision to normalize relations with China. Congressional concern about the consequences of derecognition of the Republic of China, and dissatisfaction with the terms of the agreement negotiated with the People's Republic of China, directly led to the landmark Taiwan Relations Act, which still governs our policy decisions today, and which continues in 1999 to be a factor in debates in this very chamber. 
   Besides Bob Sutter, only 48 Members of Congress serving today, in the 106th Congress, were here in 1977 and 1978 to witness these initial steps of U.S.-China relations. In the more than 20 years since then, both U.S.-China relations and the U.S. Congress itself have undergone tremendous change, both for the better and for worse. Bob Sutter has been an active participant in congressional deliberations on China policy, and in the U.S. national debate over these issues, from normalization of relations, to the Tiananmen Square crackdown, to the recent tragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Dr. Sutter's two decades of service spanned the tenures for four U.S. presidents and some ten Congresses. Despite several shifts of party control in the Senate, and one 
    in the House, Dr. Sutter continued to deliver timely, accurate, objective, and non-partisan analysis. The institutional memory represented by CRS analysts, which Dr. Sutter so perfectly exemplifies, is of incalculable value to the work of the Congress. 
   The second point I want to make concerns Dr. Sutter himself. He has, for one thing, consistently demonstrated an astonishing capacity for work. In 1974 Dr. Sutter received his Ph.D. in History and East Asian Languages from Harvard University, writing his Ph.D. thesis while maintaining a full-time job. Routinely, he has been one of--perhaps the most in terms of sheer output of written work--productive analysts in CRS. In the last 5 years alone, Dr. Sutter has been called on for advice from Members of Congress and their staffs nearly 6,000 times--an average of 1,140 times each year. He has regularly maintained six or more ongoing, continually updated products, and his output of CRS written reports for Congress totals at least 90 since late 1987 alone. As is evident in these products, he excels at providing accurate, succinct, and well-organized analysis of congressional policy choices and their likely consequences. His work always reflects up to date knowledge of issues, usually based on personal research in East Asia and/or close contact with the U.S. private and official community of Asian analysts and scholars. 
   Even more to the point, Dr. Sutter has always understood the powers and special needs of Congress, including its legislative and oversight responsibilities, and our obligation to represent  the interests of our constituents. In his research and writing, Dr. Sutter never forgets the unique role of Congress and the importance of reflecting the full range of competing viewpoints. 
   Reflecting his commitment to service and cheerful willingness to assume responsibility, Dr. Sutter has fulfilled a number of roles in the CRS. He has served as Chief of the Foreign Affairs Division in CRS, as well as Chief of the Government Division in CRS, in both cases maintaining a full research work load for Congress in the midst of significant management duties. He has frequently conceived, coordinated, and moderated Asia policy seminars and workshops for Members of Congress and their staffs. He routinely serves on special advisory groups in CRS and the Library of Congress. As a well-known and respected analyst, he has been a sought-after speaker at dozens of foreign policy seminars, panels, and conferences in Washington and around the world. 
   In recent years, he has maintained this outstanding record of productivity for the Congress while managing in his spare time to teach several college courses per year at Washington area universities. He has also found time to write more than a dozen books on foreign policy issues during his tenure at CRS. 
   Finally, Dr. Sutter's simple decency, modesty, engaging manner, and professionalism set a high standard for others and make it a great pleasure to work with him. He cheerfully volunteers for onerous tasks. He is pleasant and good-humored. Moreover, in the midst of the pressured environment of Washington and Capitol Hill, he has always found time to serve as a mentor, counselor, and friend to others, whether they be his own students, younger colleagues, or new congressional staff. And, a fact known only to close friends, he has a record of community service, including Church work and teaching of English to native Spanish speakers, that is nearly as impressive as his professional contribution. 
   Dr. Sutter will be greatly missed, but the loss of his service to the Congress will be partly compensated for by bringing to the Executive branch his knowledge of the Congress and its special role in the making and oversight of U.S. foreign policy. When he comes back to Capitol Hill for one-on-one meetings, briefings, and testimony, he will bring with him a high degree of credibility and a special awareness of congressional needs for information and analysis.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as our nation gratefully remembers the deceased men and women of our military, I have a special commemoration for this Memorial Day, 1999. This year, as brave American patriots willingly put themselves in ``harm's way'' to defend the values and national interests of all Americans in places like the Balkans and the Persian Gulf, I rise to remind my colleagues here in the United States Senate and the American people of one distinguished group of patriots who gave so unselfishly at a time when their rights of citizenship were restricted--the Navajo Code Talkers of World War II. I want to let everyone know how honored we Delawareans are to welcome to my state one of these Native American patriots and World War II veterans this Memorial Day weekend. 
   The Clarence Vinson-John Chason Post #3238 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, in Camden, Delaware will have the distinct privilege of hosting Mr. Samuel Billison. Mr. Billison was one of the Navajo Code Talkers who helped the United States of America defeat the Axis Powers in the Pacific during World War II. Mr. Billison is traveling from Window Rock, Arizona to be the featured speaker at the May 31st Memorial Day observances being conducted by VFW Post #3238 at the Ceasar Rodney High School auditorium. 
   My state--the First State, the State that started our nation--has a long and proud history of celebrating the culture and accomplishments of Native Americans. It is only fitting, therefore, that Post Commander Mark Newman and Memorial Day Program Director Thomas E. Weyant sought out Mr. Samuel Billison, once one of the select Navajo Code Talkers. 
   Each Navajo Code Talker made an invaluable personal contribution to the success of our nation's effort in World War II to preserve freedom and democracy. What is most astonishing about this is that they were willing to take on the responsibilities of democracy at a time when they were not allowed to enjoy the full blessings and rights of democracy here at home. 
   Their communications contribution to World War II began in 1942 with a small group of 29 Navajos who shared their unique and unwritten language with the United States Marine Corps. Together they developed an unbreakable verbal code. By 1943, nearly 200 Navajo Code Talkers were dispersed to three combat divisions of the U.S. Marine Corps. As part of Marine Corps signal units, they participated through 1944 in the Pacific battles whose names bear witness to the honor and bravery of America's Marines--Bouganville, Tarawa, Cape Gloucester, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Peleiu. 
   As 1945 unfolded, all six divisions of the Marine Corps in the Pacific theater were using the distinctive skills and loyal services of approximately 400 Navajo Code Talkers. These brave Native Americans joined other courageous Marines to recapture Iwo Jima and Okinawa. In the first two days of the battle for Iwo Jima, Navajo Code  Talkers flawlessly translated over 800 messages. At the end of that month-long blood bath, it was Navajo Code Talkers who spelled out ``Mt. Suribachi'' as the flag was raised. By late 1945, the Navajo Code Talkers were serving with the occupation forces in Japan and China. 
   The historical accomplishments and story of the Navajo Code Talkers must be preserved and retold for future generations. These Native American communications experts used their native tongue to thwart the enemy; to expedite military operations for critical territory; and to save countless lives in combat. Learning their story and repeating it is more than a matter of historical accuracy and completeness, or even a matter of just recognition and gratitude. As my friend Tom Weyant pointed out--speaking, I believe, for all Delawareans--it is also critical that Americans enter the New Millennium understanding the community ethos and deep patriotism of the Navajos who fought in World War II. The Navajos saw that ``pulling together'' was a matter of national survival. They gave unselfishly to defend ideals that even today, all we Americans still have not fully realized here in the United States, because the Navajos had faith that America would always continue to move toward the realization and fulfillment of those ideals. 
   Mr. President, we in Delaware salute the Navajo Code Talkers of World War II. They are unsung heroes who played a vital role in our ultimate success in the Pacific by providing a code which the Japanese never could decipher. While many knew that Native Americans faithfully served in the war, including Navajos, it was not until 1968 that the existence of this top-secret code was finally declassified and made public. Our entire country is indebted to Mr. Billison, to all the Navajo Code Talkers, and to the thousands of Native Americans from various tribes who served so loyally and selflessly in both the Pacific and European theaters of World War II. We must never forget the ultimate sacrifice these Native Americans were willing to make at a time when they and their families were not even allowed to vote or participate in the full fruits of American citizenship in several states. 
   Mr. Samuel Billison, the Navajo legacy of patriotism, the Navajo contribution of their unique skills, the Navajo heritage of heroism, and the Navajo example of love for America must be carried forward by us all. Your story embodies all that we Americans look for in our heroes today and that we revere in the rich tradition of our United States Marine Corps. To you and to all who served, I thank you.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I send this amendment on behalf of the primary sponsors: The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER; the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER; the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER; and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. KOHL; and others. 
   This is a pretty straightforward amendment. My amendment extends for another 5 years the COPS Program which was created in the 1994 crime bill. As we all know, the COPS Program has put over 100,000 police officers on the--well, they are not all on the street yet, but it funded 100,000 police officers, of whom about 11,000 are in training now. I have put on the desk of every Member of the Senate a list of the number of police officers, State and local police officers, that have been funded under the COPS Program in their States. 
   I have put on the desk of every Member of the Senate the reduction in violent crime, in property crimes, that has occurred in their State since the crime bill of 1994, which was passed, and I would make the argument that we do not have to reinvent the wheel here; it works. Cops on the street through the COPS Program work. 
   The COPS Program is going to expire next year. Our amendment authorizes $1.15 billion per year through the year 2005. 
   Let me explain what it does. There is $600 million more for police on the streets every year, which would give the States up to another 50,000 police officers over the next 5 years. This money, though, can always be used to retain current officers hired under the COPS Program; it can be used to pay overtime; it can be used to reimburse current cops for college and graduate school courses up to a percentage of the total money here. 
   Since the original crime bill was the Biden crime bill that became the 1994 crime bill--we put in this COPS amendment. At the time, we were told by everyone, whether it was liberal newspaper editorials saying, we have tried this 
   before and more cops don't work, or conservatives arguing that this was just a great big social welfare program--it was going to hire a bunch of social workers--we have demonstrated that it had never been done before and it works when it is done. 
   I am reminded of the quote attributed to G.K. Chesterton. He said, it is not that Christianity has been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried. 
   The truth of the matter is, up to the time of the crime bill of 1994, we had never made a full blown major commitment to help local law enforcement officers increase their number. We have, in fact, increased the number of cops wearing uniforms--of local police officers, not Federal cops--by 100,000 cops. The crime rate has plummeted, not solely because of that but, I would argue, in large part because of that. 
   Now, I have been here long enough to know that one of the dangers of being here long enough and having worked hard on setting up a government program, which you thought about and conceived and worked on for years and years to get adopted, is that you become a captive of your own program. So the Senator from Pennsylvania and I would talk, back in the early days when he got here and I got here, about community policing and how important it was. 
   Cops didn't want community policing. Mayors did not want community policing. No one wanted it. My friend from Pennsylvania talked about career criminals and pointed out that only 6 percent of the criminals in America committed over 60 percent of the violent crimes in America. To both of us, it didn't seem like rocket science. If you focused on going after that 6 percent and you put more cops on the street and you took them out of patrol cars and put them on a beat, that would have a positive impact. 
   I didn't have the experience my friend from Pennsylvania had of being a prosecutor. I might add, the office he was the chief prosecutor of in Philadelphia tries more criminal cases in 1 year than the entire Federal system tries in a year. The entire Federal system tries fewer cases than are tried in the Philadelphia prosecutor's office, the Philadelphia DA. I didn't have the experience, but I was smart enough to listen to him. And I was smart enough to listen to enough people who have been out there and had the experience. So as hard as it is to believe, it took us about 6 years to convince people that putting local cops on the beat made sense. 
   I have spent, as has the Senator from New Mexico who was on the floor, a long time in this body. I think we both agree that if you take this job seriously and you sit in hearings year after year, day after day, month after month, unless you are an absolute idiot, you eventually learn something. Every single, solitary criminologist, every single expert, every single person who testified before the Judiciary Committee in the 16 years I chaired it or was a ranking member, said, we don't know a lot about crime but one thing we know: If there is a cop on this corner and no cop on the other corner and a crime is going to be committed, it is going to be committed where the cop is not. 
   The second thing we know: If you have a cop in a neighborhood and they get to know the folks in the neighborhood, a simple thing happens--trust gets built. They know the cop's name. If they know who the cop is, they are going to be more inclined to call the officer aside when a crime has been committed and say, Officer John, I know who did that. If it is a wave-by and a cop is going by in a car and he is not a community cop, they don't want to take the chance of putting them on the line. 
   I realize these are very simple, basic, trite-sounding things I am saying, but this program works. It works well. 
   There are a lot of ideas here that ended up being rejected because they do not pass the test of ``not invented here.'' I realize there are some concerns, on the part particularly of my Republican colleagues, that this may be--and I am not talking about the Senator from Pennsylvania or anyone in particular--a program that is viewed as being identified with the Democratic Party, the President; therefore, why do we keep it going for another 5 years? 
   I respectfully suggest that there have been some incredibly good ideas that have come out of the Republican caucus, including the block grant notion for police departments, including more flexibility to be given to local law enforcement officers. I want my colleagues to know--and I understand the limitations my friend from Utah had in being able to reach an agreement here--I was prepared to accept the community block grant portion of the Republican program in order to get a consensus in this process. We didn't get there. I hope that when this passes, if it passes, we can still, as we move on through this year, move on to that good idea as well. I didn't try to incorporate it here because it is not my idea, it is the idea of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and others on the Republican caucus with whom I have to agree. 
   Now, let me say this: One of the things we learned from the COPS Program and its functioning is that, as well as it works, it can be made to work better. I say to my friend from New York, Senator SCHUMER, he has  been deeply involved. He carried this load in the House when we did this in 1994. He was a leader on the COPS Program. What he and I have both found out from our local law enforcement officers is that they need more flexibility. They need to be able to use this COPS money in ways that go beyond hiring a new shield, to be able to keep cops who are on the beat and use this money. They also want to be able to pay overtime, because they get the same coverage as they would if they hired a new cop, if they are allowed to pay overtime. So we built into this extension of the COPS Program more flexibility. 
   To the best of my knowledge--my staff is behind me; I don't have it in front of me--I believe every major police organization has endorsed this and endorsed it on this bill, because it works. 
   The second thing--and I will shortly yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, and then I want to reserve time for my friend from New York as well--is that there is $350 million in here for law enforcement to get new technologies to enhance crime fighting, such as better communications systems so cops in different jurisdictions can communicate, and even the ability to target hot spots, and new investigative tools like DNA analysis. The cops have come to me and they have said, this is what we need; this is what we need. 
   I am one who believes that as long as they keep doing the job as well as they have been, we should give them the tools they need. 
   There is one last piece, and then I will yield. The cops have been doing such a good job that the prosecutors in Senator SPECTER's old office are overwhelmed. They are overwhelmed. You put 100,000 more cops on the job, 545,000 cops who have already been on the job and who had not been in community policing but are all now community police, and you have had a phenomenal impact on crime, but also a phenomenal impact on putting more pressure on the court systems in the State and local governments. 
   So there is in this bill $200 million for community prosecutors to expand the community policing concept to engage the whole community in preventing crime. These cops, as I said, have been so successful with their jobs that the next piece of the puzzle, the new bottleneck, is State prosecutors. Local prosecutors, they need help. So the next major piece of this bill is $200 million for community prosecutors. 
   Lastly, you are only allowed to use a portion of the COPS money for this, but one of the things the cops have come to us and said is, we have a lot of cops who want to increase their education; we have a lot of cops who want to go back to college, who want to be better cops. If you are a schoolteacher in most districts and you go off and teach school and you go off and get your graduate degree, the school district helps you pay for that. I think we should be allowing the cops to take a portion of the money they get and pay for the continuing education of law enforcement officers. I still believe that the greatest safety lies in educated police officers who fully understand the Constitution, who increase their educational background. So that is another innovation in this bill. 
   There is much more in it that I will not bore the floor with at this time. I know a lot of people are trying to get through this bill. I respectfully suggest--and it is imprudent of me to say this--I think this is, in a substantive sense, the single most important amendment we could add to this bill. 
   I guarantee you--and I am willing to bet anybody in this body dinner--that if we add another 50,000 cops out there and this technology, we are going to have a significantly greater impact on reducing juvenile crime than we would without it. It works, folks. Let's not reinvent the wheel. 
   I have a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time remains in control of the Senator from Delaware?

   Mr. BIDEN. Benjamin Disraeli says there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics. 
   I don't know where my friends have been. Every major police agency in the United States of America strongly endorses this particular bill. The National Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Police Organizations. 
   You all ought to go home and speak to your chiefs. Find me in your State more than a handful of police officers who will come and say this is a bad idea. Find me anybody in this country who will say adding 92,000 cops on the street has not had an impact on crime. 
   Where have you been? What are we talking about here? This doesn't even pass the smell test. Those cops don't matter? Ask Rudy Giuliani, who picks up the phone and calls me and says, JOE, great idea, when the COPS bill passed. 
   Mr. Riordan, a Republican mayor in Los Angeles: Great bill. 
   I wonder if anybody goes home to their States. My Lord, I don't know where you all are. I look at these numbers. 
   Let's talk about that report. Remember, I said there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics. 
   That report referred to by the inspector general says 1.2 percent of the COPS Program could have been spent better. Name for me a multibillion-dollar program the Federal Government has ever conceived that has a 1.2-percent problem. 
   Come on. As my daughter's friends would say, Get real. What are we talking about here? 
   I was so amazed by the assertions being made, I lost my train of thought here. The inspector general's report, ``Summary of the Findings of the IG,'' page II:  
   In considering our COPS audit results it should be kept in mind that they may well not represent the overall universe of grantees because, as a matter of policy, the COPS program has referred to us for review those riskiest grantees.  
   Do you get this? Unlike the Defense Department, the Department of Education, any other Department, the Attorney General's Office said, we think maybe some of what we put out there may not be being used properly, so you go out and investigate for us. Give me a break. 
   When is the last time you heard someone at the Defense Department say: You know, we may have overpaid a contract; you ought to go investigate. 
   When is the last time you heard someone at the Department of Education say: You know, we think we may have given a school district too much money; go investigate. 
   With the Attorney General of the United States of America, in the COPS Program, there is a department called COPS. They said: We want you to look at this. We could have made some mistakes here. We are not certain that every municipality used this money for cops the way we wanted to use it. Go look at it. 
   Now these guys are trying to hoist them on their own request? 
   By the way, 1.2 percent? I ask my friend from Oklahoma, let's look at the Defense Department; 1.2 percent? I will lay you 8 to 5 I can find a 50-percent waste of money in half the programs you support: 1.2 percent, what an indictment. Come on. You do not like the COPS Program because it was not invented there. 
   By the way, I find it fascinating. One of my friends said: You know, part of the problem here is this has nothing to do with COPS. It had to do with political leadership. 
   Guess who has been in charge. A guy named Clinton. That is the first admission I have heard: Clinton reduced crime, more than the COPS Program. More than the COPS Program. I find that not true, but kind of encouraging. 
   Look, COPS makes a difference. Ask your folks back home, ask the people in the gallery, ask the people out in the street, where would they rather have their money being spent? This works. This works. 
   By the way, this bill has a little provision BARBARA BOXER has in here. It says we will pay for all the money it costs to put a cop in a school. Go home and tell the folks you do not want to do that. Go home and tell the folks that is simply a local requirement. 
   Inflexibility? The reason it is under $25,000 is flexibility. We want to give them more flexibility to use the moneys they can use, still requiring the local municipality, the State, to put up their own money to do this. Come on, name a program that has worked this well. Name a program that has had this much success. Name a program that has this little amount of waste. Name a program that has fewer Federal strings attached to it. Name a program. 
   By the way: Oversight; oversight. We have had 5 years to have oversight. One of the reasons we have not had oversight hearings, I suspect, is you do not want to hear the results. Call in your mayors, call in your chiefs of police, call in your citizens, call in the PTA, call in the Marines. Call in anybody you want. Say: ``By the way, I'll tell you what we are going to do. We are going to cut funding for COPS, that's what we're are going to do.'' I dare you. Come on. 
   In New York City--I do not know how many New York received. I will tell you what, New York State over this period received--I bring up the subject because New York was mentioned --New York State has 10,550 cops. ``But they did not make any difference, by the way. New York is safer because there is a Republican mayor. That is the reason. COPS had nothing to do with this, nothing to do with this. I want you all to know that, COPS had nothing to do with crime going down.'' 
   Does everybody hear that? Is everybody listening? ``The additional cops have nothing to do with this.'' That is the Republican position. COPS do not have anything to do with this. If they do, the Federal Government should not be involved. 
   Let me conclude by saying this. My friend says, why should the Federal Government be involved? Because Federal policy is part of the problem. The drug problem in America is a Federal problem, not just a local problem. A significant portion of the crime is caused as a consequence of the international drug problem, and it is a Federal problem, Federal responsibility. 
   I thank my friend. I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to speak today in support giving the Senate's advice and consent to ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol to the Convention on Conventional Weapons. This amended protocol was adopted on May 3, 1996, and submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification on January 7, 1997. The Foreign Relations Committee approved this resolution of ratification on March 23 of this year, with no dissents. 
   While this is not as big an issue as NATO enlargement or the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol will be a real achievement. Its enactment is a further demonstration that the Senate and its Foreign Relations Committee can, in fact, reach agreement upon treaties that deal with difficult issues. 
   My colleagues are well aware of the humanitarian crisis that has developed in the world as a result of the millions of unexploded land mines left from the last generation of wars in the world. The United States is a leader in humanitarian de-mining efforts, and we have all supported those efforts. But a few examples may help explain to the public why the issue of land mines is of such deep concern.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have served since January of 1973 with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. We have been on opposite sides of a lot of issues, occasionally on the same side. I have seen and listened to and been on the opposite end of some very powerful and difficult speeches he has made. But I am presumptuous enough, know him well enough to say until now he has never had a more difficult time making a speech than today. 
   There is a reason for that, to state the obvious. There is an old expression: You can know a man by his enemies. I suggest you can judge a man by his friends. Anybody who had a man of the stature of Admiral Nance love him as much as Admiral Nance loved this guy, means there is something awful, awful, awful, awful good about the Senator from North Carolina. 
   I am not doing that really to be solicitous. I truly mean that and I believe that. The irony of all ironies, as I told the chairman, on the Friday before Bud died, the chairman asked him whether or not he could come down to my office to see if we could work out--and we did, by the way--work out some legislative language and discuss a nominee. We sat there with staff--his staff and mine. Afterwards, the staff left and Admiral Nance and I sat there for the better part of 45 minutes, basically asking  him questions and him telling me stories. 
   They were all about JESSE HELMS, his buddy. They are all about the guy he grew up with and loved. I suspect, one of the few men or women, other than Mrs. Helms, who has ever been able to tell the chairman: Enough, JESSE; slow down, JESSE; no, JESSE. Senator HELMS, I don't think in all the time I have known him, has ever respected anybody as much as he respected Admiral Nance. 
   It was a wonder to behold, I think my Democratic colleagues would agree with me, to watch this relationship. It was almost, I say to my friend from North Carolina, like you had an older brother, a brother who loved you and guided you and occasionally, like all of us do when you sort of get off and you were going too far or not far enough, would whisper in your ear, would put his hand on you--I watched him put his hand on your shoulder. It was like he didn't have to say anything to you. So all Members on this floor and all Members watched in wonder and with a sense of envy the relationship the Senator had with Admiral Nance, and we have an appreciation for how difficult a moment this is for you. 
   We respect you for your ability to pull it off with the grace that you have thus far. 
   Mr. President, I have only on a couple occasions in 27 years come to the floor to pay a tribute to a staff member. We have had great, great, great, great staff members who have guided us all. I think the best kept secret from the American people is the incredible quality, patriotism, capacity, educational achievement, and personal commitment of the staffs that sit back in these chairs behind that rail. It is a trite thing to say, but the Nation could not run without them. 
   I know of no staff member who was the peer to this fellow, Bud Nance. The Senate family and the Nation--it sounds like hyperbole--suffered a loss when Admiral Nance passed away. Since 1971, Admiral Nance has been the staff director of the Committee on Foreign Relations, serving first as the minority staff director, and then as the staff director for the minority under the chairman and senior Senator of North Carolina, 
   Mr. JESSE HELMS. 
   Working in the Senate was something of a second career for Admiral Nance. Prior to coming to the Senate, Admiral Nance spent 35 years in the U.S. Navy. A pilot by training, Admiral Nance rose to hold several senior command positions on aircraft carriers, including command, as mentioned earlier, of the U.S.S. Forrestal and senior commands in the Pentagon. He retired in 1979 with the rank of rear admiral. I might note, parenthetically, one of the great, great, great, great advantages of having Bud Nance, with the ideological divisions that exist in matters relating to foreign policy, was that you always knew you would get down to the final question of how it worked. 
   I remember two Fridays ago talking to him and him saying--I hope no one is offended by my saying this--the reason why we haven't in the committee taken the administration to task on some of the NATO questions is I know how hard it is to get consensus in NATO. I sat there. I was in charge of planning. I know how difficult it is. 
   He also knew how easy it would have been for the committee, under the chairmanship of the Senator from North Carolina, to demagog the living devil out of the targeting questions and whether or not the French and the Germans and the Brits--he said until you are there and have to get 15 other nations to agree on something, you have no notion how difficult it is. 
   To steal a phrase from the chairman, this is one little vignette that illustrates how, even though he had serious disagreement with the policy of the President of the United States, he believed it wasn't fair play--my translation, not his; mine--to take advantage of something, that the people wouldn't understand how complicated it was, but he understood that it was complicated. It was just simply not fair game to take advantage of it, in addition to the fact he always thought of the people who were jumping in the cockpits of those planes. He always thought of the people who were over there putting their lives on the line. 
   That came from 35 years of experience. It wasn't merely because he was a good, honorable and decent man which you will hear more about, because he was. You can ask any of my colleagues, and I suspect my Democratic colleagues will say the same. All Bud Nance had to do with me is say that this is what we are going to do, and I can absolutely, positively trust it as certain, as certain as if my closest staff aide said that to me. 
   The magic of Bud Nance was he made each of us feel like he was our staff, like he was looking out for our interest. I knew without any question that if he said something to me, even if there was a miscommunication between the chairman and Bud Nance, the chairman would never undercut Bud Nance, either 
   that whatever Bud Nance said was going to happen. 
   You have no--yes, you do, Mr. President. I was going to say you have no idea. You do have an idea. Anyone who serves here has an idea what an incredible, incredible asset that is. If we were able to do that, if we had that kind of faith in each other's staffs, this place would move so much more smoothly than it does because so much is necessarily propelled by staff. 
   During the 1980s, Admiral Nance served as deputy assistant to President Reagan for national security affairs, and in private business with the Boeing Corporation. In 1991, his boyhood friend, JESSE HELMS, as the chairman has indicated, who grew up in the small town of Monroe, NC, called Bud Nance to serve his country once again. Although at the time he got the call he had long-since retired and he was 70 years old--a time when most people would choose to take it easy, spend time with their wives, their children and their grandchildren--Bud Nance answered the call of his friend, JESSE HELMS, and he came to work for the Foreign Relations Committee. He did so not out of a desire for power or money, to state the obvious. In fact, he received only a nominal salary, which at one point, as he enjoyed putting it, amounted to a few dollars per week. That is literally true, by the way--literally true. Because of this law we have about double dipping, literally he worked for pennies here--full time, 60 hours, 70 hours a week. He worked literally for nothing. 
   Rather than the dollars, he enjoyed the work--because of his powerful sense of duty to his country and its people and his powerful and palpable loyalty to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   In the last several months, as he struggled with illness--and I might point out, for the last year anybody else would have quit. Anybody else would have walked away and everyone would have said: God bless him. We understand. 
   Here is a guy whose hands were literally beat up because of the transfusions, because of the IVs, because of all of the painful way they had to go to get blood. They could not get it out of his veins anymore. They had to go into his hands and his feet. He came in black and blue--black and blue, barely able to walk. I would say: Bud, what in the heck are you doing here? He'd say: We have to get this done. No problem. 
   I never, never, never heard him complain. I never watched him even wince knowingly. This is a guy who literally dragged himself in and out of the hospital to show up for work. Instead of staying at home, getting the care he needed in the hospital, he kept the staff and all of us focused on the task at hand. 
   In my 2 1/2 years as ranking member of the committee, I came to know Bud even better than I did the previous years, both as a professional colleague, and, I am presumptuous to say, and this is presumptuous--as a friend. 
   I was kidding with the chairman the other day. I said: You know, JESSE, my mom has an expression. 
   I will not mention the little girl's name, but I remember as a kid I got picked up second on the bus on a long bus ride to school, about a 35-minute ride. Every morning, a little girl who was not very popular and wasn't very attractive, every morning would get on the bus. It would be empty and she would sit next to me. Then everyone else would fill up the bus by the end. 
   I would get home and I would say to my mother: Mom, every morning--I will not mention her real name; it was not Sally--Sally gets on the bus and sits next to me. All the guys make fun of me. The girls even make fun of me--because Sally 
   was not a particularly popular little girl.  
   I will never forget what my mother said. My mother said: JOEY, remember one thing. Anybody who loves you, there is only one thing you can do. Love them back. 
   It is real simple. I was kidding the chairman the other day. I know Bud Nance loved me because he knew how much I thought of him. He didn't have a choice. He may not have wanted to, but it was in his nature. He couldn't return the affection. So, although I do not have one one-hundredth of the history or the relationship that the chairman had with Bud Nance and it seems presumptuous for me to call him a friend in the shadow of his closest friend in life, I want you to know, Mr. Chairman, that a lot of us--and you will hear from more--a lot of us took great personal pride in believing that Bud Nance liked us. The mere fact that Bud Nance liked us in part validated what we did here. That is a remarkable thing, Mr. Chairman. That is a remarkable thing to say about any individual. 
   His word was his bond in a literal sense. Although he worked for a darned Republican, Bud Nance was far from partisan. I always wanted to ask him--and I never did, JESSE--about back in the days when you were a Democrat, I suspect he was, too, back in those days. I kind of harbored the illusion in my soul a little bit that maybe--maybe he still was. I knew he wasn't, but maybe he still was.

   Mr. BIDEN. I always want to say Bud, Bud--they are all laughing, all the Republican staffers. But I would get back in the subway car and I would head over here and I would say: You know, maybe.......maybe. 
   I want to tell you, he was well liked by every Senator, every staff person. The guy who is the minority staff director, Ed Hall, who is sitting in the back, considered him a close friend. It was remarkable to watch their relationship, watch how they dealt with one another. I haven't found anybody who was better liked, more respected, more fair, or more knowledgeable than Bud Nance--of all the people with whom I have worked. Above all, Bud Nance was--and this is not said lightly; I don't often use the word--Bud Nance was a genuine patriot. 
   At all times, he would focus on the central question. We would get involved and we would be arguing, we would be talking, and Bud Nance always, always brought us back to the central question: Is this in the interest of the country? Is this in the interest of the country? Because, as we Senators know, we can get carried away. We believe in what we are doing, but we get invested in what we are doing. We get invested in our position. Sometimes, although we don't consciously do it, in my opinion, we get so wrapped up in winning our point that it takes somebody like Bud Nance to say--and I know he has said it to JESSE; he has said it to me--whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold up here. 
   He had that great ability, as the old saying goes, to see the forest for the trees. We get lost in the forest. We start numbering the trees. He could stand back. He would stand back and he would say, Look at the whole picture. 
   As I said, I will end where I began. I have a sense of envy that you, Senator HELMS, had the relationship you had. My dad's expression is: At the end of your days, if you can count one person who you can call a true friend, you are a lucky man. 
   You are one of the luckiest men that I know, Senator. You have had a guy who everyone is honoring, honoring you. 
   Our profound sympathy and our prayers go out to his loving wife of 53 years. I don't know Mary, but I know of her. I have heard her name invoked a thousand times. To Bud's four children and his seven grandchildren, to use my grandpop's expression, I say: You got good blood. You got good blood. I am telling you, remember where you came from. This guy--your grandfather, your father--was the real thing. The real thing. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues a few thoughts on the announcement that Treasury Secretary Rubin will be leaving his job in July. 
   It is hard to believe how far we have come in the six and a half years of Bob Rubin's tenure at the Treasury Department. Our most fundamental ideas of how the world works--at least the world of economics and finance--have been transformed during his leadership of President Clinton's economic team. 
   In our domestic finances, Mr. President, we have gone from a generation of seemingly intractable federal deficits to a new era of budget surpluses. It turns out that it is no easier to make budget policy now than it was before--in fact, it is probably harder. But the federal government is paying its own way now, and the payoff in the private economy--strong growth, low and stable interest rates, international confidence in the dollar--are there for everyone to see. 
   As someone who came to the Senate over a quarter of a century ago, I can tell my colleagues that there has been no more fundamental change in the way we do business around here. 
   And virtually everyone agrees that Bob Rubin's influence was the deciding factor in this Administration's successful fight to restore balance and responsibility to our federal budget. If that were his only legacy, it would put him in the pantheon of our greatest Treasury Secretaries. 
   But Bob Rubin has left his mark on the international economy as well. The United States--restored to its historic role as the strongest and most influential economy in the world--was the indispensable leader during the financial crisis that shook international markets in the last two years. And it was Secretary Rubin's credibility that was on the line as international financial institutions like the IMF scrambled to meet the first financial crisis of the new global economy. 
   Because he knew what key financial markets needed to see and hear from policy makers--and because he knew the strengths and the weaknesses of those markets first hand--his guidance was the essential ingredient that contained the damage from that crisis. 
   Today, in the calm after the storm, there is still a lot of rebuilding to do--and too much troubling weakness in too many economies to say that the crisis is over. But it is not too early to say that the crisis was a direct challenge America's leadership in the world's economy, and Bob Rubin kept us on top. 
   I might add that among the many facets of that financial crisis, Secretary Rubin had to invest his considerable energy, skills, and reputation to get this Congress to provide the funds necessary for the IMF to do its job. If they gave medals in his line of work, Mr. President, he would have one for that campaign, too. 
   Robert Rubin was the recognized leader--with all of the heat that can come in that position--in two of the biggest economy stories of this decade: the battle against the deficit and the global financial crisis. His decisiveness, clarity of purpose, and calm persistence made a difference in this history of our time. 
   I noticed, Mr. President, that the financial markets genuflected yesterday at the news of Secretary Rubin's impending departure. They dipped for a while at the initial disappointment, but inevitably they recovered because his replacement is an equally formidable--and tested--veteran of those  same battles that have made Bob Rubin's reputation. 
   Larry Summers, as Deputy Treasury Secretary, has earned Bob Rubin's confidence as his envoy to key countries in critical negotiations in the global financial crisis and in many other important jobs. He inherits a healthy economy, sound federal finances, and a strong team at the Treasury Department. But if the past few years are any guide, Mr. President, he will not lack for challenges. 
   I noticed that he thanked his teachers today in accepting the new opportunity President Clinton has offered him. Surely he had no more valuable teacher than Bob Rubin. That should give us all confidence that the Treasury Department remains in good hands.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, this bill has been a long time in coming. We have been debating this bill in the Judiciary Committee for some time. We have attempted to come up with a compromise that made sense. Later in the day--if not today, tomorrow--the distinguished chairman of the committee and I are going to offer an amendment that is essentially a substitute, but we will not probably offer it in the form of a substitute; it will be offered in the form of an amendment. At that time, I will speak to the distinctions of the bill before us and the provisions Senator HATCH and I will be amending. 
   Let me speak to the general proposition of juvenile crime in America. 
   I listened to my friend from Alabama and others who have spoken today, and I sometimes get confused. I get confused because the assertions that are made do not always comport with what the legislation says. 
   For example, there is a general assertion made, and a general consensus, that we should not be federalizing juvenile crimes; we federalize too much already, yet we do that in this bill in terms of attempts to deal with preemptive jurisdiction, imposing upon the States judgments about how and under what circumstances they should try adults, and children as adults, and so on. 
   The second thing that we do is we go through episodic periods in this body. I have been around long enough that I have been in more than one episode. I remember when I first came here, I say to my friend from Minnesota. We all kind of forget the consensus, the academic consensus, the criminal justice consensus, the political consensus we reached in the early 1970s. That was that we had horrible cases--and legions of them--where we put juveniles in adult prisons, we put juveniles in adult holding tanks, we put juveniles in circumstances where they were exposed to adult-convicted criminals. 
   There were legions of reports about their being raped, their being beaten, their being sodomized, their being dealt with in the most horrendous way. The Nation rose up in the late 1960s and early 1970s, led by the academics of this Nation, led by the criminologists, who said this has to stop, this has to stop. 
   I was here when Birch Bayh, the distinguished father of the Senator from Indiana, led the fight on the Judiciary Committee and the bipartisan consensus to change the rules. We ended up with things called sight and sound requirements. We ended up with things that dealt with recordkeeping. We ended up with changes in the law that dealt with the ability to try juveniles as adults and under what circumstances. And they worked. They worked. They worked very well, because you are not reading in our press about 13-year-old boys being sodomized in a jail, while they are held in a holding tank to be arraigned. You are not reading about that now. 
   For those of you who have not done this as long as I have, I suggest you go back and look at the RECORD and what we read about in the 1960s. It happened all the time. It does not happen anymore. 
   A little bit of power given to anybody is almost always abused. The bureaucrats got a little bit too much power, and over a long period of time we came up with some stupid rules, stupid applications of the sight and sound restrictions. 
   For example, if you in fact are in a rural community, in your State, I say to my friend from Minnesota, and you arrest a kid, a 16-year-old at 2 o'clock in the morning for a violent crime and there is no facility in town except one that has two adults in it, and the nearest juvenile facility is 4 hours away, we have been in some cases insisting--it is rare--that that kid be driven 4 hours all the way to that other facility when you have a one-cop town. 
   It doesn't make sense. There should be accommodations made for 6 or 8 hours until the next shift comes on so you can work this out. Well, what we do is we make accommodations for that. 
   Let's not blow this out of proportion. I remind people, you are not reading in the press, as you did in the 1950s and 1960s and early 1970s, about juveniles being abused in adult prisons. In my own State, it doesn't take much. Let me remind everybody: You put a young kid, maybe even a status offender, not a violent criminal, in a cell next to somebody who is a hardened criminal. You lock the door. The hardened criminal starts telling the kid about what he is going to do to him and how he is going to enjoy doing it to him. The records are replete with jailers coming back and finding the kid hanging himself in a jail, committing suicide. They are not happening now. So let's not get trigger happy here, no pun intended, and decide that we are going to overcorrect. 
   Back in the bad old days, when I was chairman of this committee, a ranking member for about 18 years, we had scores of hearings. We brought everybody in. The cops who come in want to solve the problem--the example I gave in Minnesota or Vermont or Montana or Delaware. We can do that. But let us not go into this routine where somehow this sight-and-sound provision has taken on some bureaucratic hubris where what happens is that we have people going awry with power and preventing us from trying violent juvenile children or young adults and they are on the rampage in the countryside because of this stupid Federal rule. Not true. Not true. 
   Let's get some facts straight. Remember when I introduced the Biden crime bill back in 1984. It took 6 years to get it passed finally, the one with the 100,000 cops in it. I used to say all the time, Why can't we learn to walk and chew gum at the same time? When the crime bill, which everyone has stood up here and is giving great credit to for the significant reduction in violent crime among adults in particular, was written, I might point out, a number of people giving it credit here voted against it, thought it was a bad idea, for 2 years tried to amend it. 
   Well, there have been a couple altar calls. I welcome everybody to the party. What is that old expression: Success has 1,000 fathers; defeat, none. I am delighted there are so many strong supporters for the crime bill now. I am delighted. But let them remember why it worked. 
   We finally got liberals and conservatives to agree that they were both wrong and both right. I don't know how many times my colleagues had to listen to me on the floor during the 1980s and 1990s saying: Look, liberals have been harping on the following point: It is the society that makes these young criminals, and all we have to do is give them love and affection. All we have to do is intervene with the right programs. All we have to do is deal with prevention. All we have to do is deal with treatment. 
   My conservative friends would come in and say: The answer is tougher penalties, hang them higher, put them in jail longer. 
   The facts were sitting before us just as they are now. Let's get some of the statistics straight, lest we be confused. I know facts sometimes bother us in this debate. Our friend Alan Simpson, the former Senator, as you know well, used to say--I loved him, still do--he used to stand on the floor and say--I will never get it as well as Alan said it and never get it quite as right, but I think this was how his phrase went--he 
   would stand up, when someone was spouting off about something they didn't know, and say: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts.  
   Crime is the only issue on which everyone thinks they are entitled to their own facts. Everybody has an opinion on crime. Everybody has an answer, whether they know anything about it or not. I am not talking about my colleagues now. I mean the whole world. If you ask the public what caused the increase in the value of the dollar, they won't pretend to have an answer. If you ask them what will stop murder, they have an answer. If you ask them why is there violent crime, they have an answer. It is one of the areas that affects us all, and we are entitled to our opinion. But let us look at some of the facts. 
   Since 1993 the national rate of juvenile crime is down. Juvenile arrests for murder and manslaughter have decreased almost 40 percent, from 1993 to 1997, the last time we have the numbers. Juvenile arrests for forcible rape are down almost a quarter, 22.8 percent. Juvenile violent crime arrests are down by 4 percent from 1996, from the previous year. There was no decline in adult crime then. 
   Now, let's look at what we are talking about--again, the facts: There are basically three categories of kids. When I introduced the Biden crime bill for adults years ago, which became the crime law, I used to stand on the floor and say there are basically three types of criminals we have to deal with, and we need different solutions for each category. If I am not mistaken, I am the first one to write a report that about 6 percent, only 6 percent of the violent criminals in America back in the 1980s and 1990s, and even now, committed over 60 percent of all the violent crimes in America. If you went out and you could gather up all 6 percent of the career criminals, gather them all up, put them in jail and throw the key away, violent crime would drop by over half. That is No. 1. So we need a specific program for career criminals. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, had a career criminal bill that became law, a gigantic help. 
   The second category is people who have committed a violent offense but are not career criminals. The third category is people who had crimes of property and status offender crimes, victimless crimes. 
   They all required different solutions. So that is why in the Biden crime bill we did three things: We took about $10 billion and hired more cops, about $10 billion and built more prisons, and about $10 billion to deal with drug treatment, prevention, and other programs. Guess what. It works. 
   The conservatives were right, that you have to get tougher, but with one segment. The liberals were right, you have to pay more attention to what brings people into the crime stream, for one section. One size doesn't fit all. So we finally got it right, and crime has dropped dramatically. 
   Now guess what. For juvenile crime, we have decided we are going to reinvent the wheel. 
   What is the formula here? The formula is simple. It is simple but hard. G.K. Chesterton once said about Christianity: It is not that Christianity has been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and left untried. 
   Well, it is not that this is so complicated, but boy is it political. 
   In all of America, in that first category of kids, career criminals for adults, there are 115,000 kids who were arrested for murder or arrested for a violent crime; 2,000 of the 115,000 were arrested for murder; 113,000 were arrested for violent crime. They are clearly in one category. They are the bad actors. Everybody wonders why they have all these floppy clothes. Walk through the train station down here, walk in any city. Those floppy clothes allow you to conceal a gun. Guess what. These kids are bad. They are bad seeds. 
   I want to tell you something that the liberals do not like hearing said: Some of these 16-year-olds are beyond redemption. They are beyond redemption for all practical purposes. And if and when they are redeemed, we don't know why they were. They may have seen the Lord in a blinding light. They may have come to their senses. But when it occurs, we don't know why. And it doesn't occur that often. 
   But think about it, all the children in America we are talking about--115,000. 
   There is a second category. 
   There are 685,000 kids who are arrested for nonviolent property crimes ranging from stealing your car to mutilating your property, or, as we say in my section of the country, ``turfing your lawn.'' Nonviolent property crimes, 685,000. They require a different solution. 
   Mr. President, locking them up in juvenile detention facilities as they are only getting into the crime stream usually only makes them better criminals. That is where the graduated offenses come in. 
   If I am not mistaken, I think I am the first guy who had James Q. Wilson testifying before a committee up here. Everybody now talks about the ``broken window theory.'' Most don't understand it. It is a simple proposition. It is not complicated. If, in fact, you have a sanction the first time a young person is brought before the courts, no matter how small the sanction is, it has a greater impact than waiting three or four times and throwing the book at them. It is not rocket science. It is not a big deal. It is pretty easy to figure out. 
   Then there is a third category of kids. There are at least a few million of them. They are in the at-risk category. BIDEN, what is that fancy term, ``at-risk?'' 
   From 8 to 5, walk into any schoolyard in America. Take two or three teachers. Say to them: Point out the kids out there who are the ones on the edge and haven't done anything wrong, but the ones you are most worried about. They can identify the at-risk kids for you. 
   Again, a second time using the phrase ``not rocket science.'' They can identify them for us. We have civil liberties and civil rights that do not allow that to occur, and shouldn't. But, as Barry Goldwater used to say, ``In your heart you know I am right.'' You know that we know that you can identify them. 
   What are we going to do about those kids? Are we going to build jails for them? Are we not going to take the time and effort to use prevention programs that work? 
   That is a third category. 
   I wrote a report a couple of years ago referring to the ``baby boomlettes,'' pointing out that the largest cadre of young people since the baby boom is about to reach their crime-committing years--39 million kids under the age of 10. 
   If not one single thing happens in terms of the crime rates going up with juveniles, every single category of crime will increase significantly--every one of them--because, guess what. There is just a heck of a lot more kids. 
   If we do ``as well as we have been doing,'' and there is not a one one-hundredth of 1 percent increase in crime among juveniles that occurs, we are going to have several thousand more murders; we are going to have a 20-percent increase in the juvenile murders by the year 2005, and the overall murder rate will go up 5 percent. Violent crime will increase by the same 
   percentage if we do not allow one single percentage increase, because there are so many kids coming. 
   Mr. President, the interesting thing about crime--only a few things we know perhaps even with certainty--is that if we have a cop on this corner and no cop on that corner, and there is a crime going to be committed, it will be committed on the corner where there is no cop. That is one thing we know. Another thing we know is that violent crime decreases when you get older. 
   Do you know why? It is harder to jump that chain-link fence. It is a little harder. It is harder to jump that chain-link fence. That is why it decreases. 
   You don't need a degree in criminology to figure this stuff out. 
   So why do we keep trying to reinvent the wheel? 
   I remember when I introduced the first crime bill; there was a New York Times editorial saying: But we have tried this before. 
   More cops, we never tried that before. For the previous 20 years, the top 20 cities in America had less than a 1-percent increase in the total number of police on their forces, yet their population increased by about 18 percent. We used to have three cops for every one violent crime committed in America. We have gotten to the point where we have one cop for every three violent crimes.  
   So we did it. We hired more cops. And it is working. 
   The same principles work with regard to juveniles. 
   Look, a couple of my friends said: You know what we ought to really do is, this Clinton administration ought to get in gear. Get in gear? This Clinton administration has done better than any administration in history in reducing crime. 
   By the way, that ``truth in sentencing,'' I am the guy that wrote that law. It is called ``The Federal Sentencing Commission.'' 
   I might add that a lot of people who are speaking about it now were against it then. As a matter of fact, a colleague who used to be on the floor, Mac Mathias, called the Biden law ``the same-time-for-the-same-crime law.'' 
   So what are we doing now? We are changing the game. This administration that came along and supported ``truth in sentencing'' is the administration that pushed community policing; is the administration that has targeted the most violent criminals; is the administration that has provided more money and effort from the Federal level for fighting crime than any in the history of the United States of America, and has succeeded. Let's get off this poppycock about whether or not this is a Democrat or Republican deal. The hope was that once we passed the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994--by the way, it is not coincidental. If you notice when all the charts go up, violent crime starts to drop in 1993. Guess what. That is when we introduced the bill, and it passed in early 1994. 
   Mr. President, juvenile justice requires our attention. It requires us to be honest with one another and honest with the American people. 
   There are three categories of kids we have to focus on. The 115,000, 2,000 of whom have been charged with murder, but 115,000 who are the violent offenders, we should be building prisons for them. We should put them in juvenile facilities. And we should treat them in some cases as adults. 
   I might add, all my States rights guys, guess what. Most States have a surplus. 
   I love these Governors. They come and tell us about how to run the Federal Government. And then they come to us and tell us if we want to deal with building a juvenile facility, we had better send Federal money. But it is a local issue, it is a local problem, and it is a local crime. Local law enforcement does it, but you send the money, Federal Government, to build the prisons. 
   They can build the prisons. There is money in here to allow help for that. But they should get responsible, I would respectfully suggest, in the State legislature in Dover, DE; in Springfield, IL; and every other capital in America to acknowledge what their responsibility is. 
   There is a second category, Mr. President--those that committed crimes against property. 
   We can save these kids. We can intervene. A lot of them we can keep from being violent criminals. But it doesn't mean building more jails for them. 
   The third category of 3 million-plus is those at-risk kids. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. Just look at what we have done. 
   Mr. President, at some point I will be joining my friend, the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the committee, to introduce an amendment in the nature of a substitute that makes the necessary corrections in a bill which has already made some progress. 
   My colleagues have heard me say this over and over again for the last 15 years. A trial lawyer with whom I used to practice used to always say to a jury: Keep your eye on the ball. The prosecution will tell you this, this, this, and this about the defendant. The question is, Did the defendant pull the trigger? Keep your eye on the ball. 
   I respectfully suggest that in this debate we keep our eye on the ball. What are we going to do about the 115,000 very violent kids in America? What are we going to do about the 680,000 in the crime stream who have not committed crimes of violence but are on the edge? What are we going to do about the 3 million kids who are on the edge, who are ready to slip into the crime stream? 
   The problem that still exists beyond what we have to deal with here and beyond guns and beyond prevention--and the Hatch-Biden substitute puts in more money for prevention--what we really have to do is deal with the drug problem in America. 
   I said before that we learned in the early 1980s that if we could take the 6 percent of career criminals in America and remove them from the scene by an act of God, violent crime in America would drop over 50 percent. Nobody disputes that now. I respectfully suggest, if any Member can have one wish that would fundamentally alter youth violence in America, ask God to come down and take alcohol and drug abuse out of the system. If we did that one thing and nothing else, we would affect the course of juvenile justice in America more than anything we can do. 
   Obviously, we can't do that. As I said years ago when I introduced the first bill, there are three things we have to do: One, deal with adult crime, particularly focusing on violence against women; two, we have to fix the juvenile justice system; and three, we have to deal with the drug problem. They are the three pieces. It hasn't changed. 
   I urge my colleagues, as the debate gets underway, keep your eye on the ball. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Look at what is working. Stick with what is working. I am not suggesting we don't try new ideas, but stick with what is working. 
   By the way, I point out that the very people who now are all for juvenile Brady--what was in the original juvenile justice bill I introduced--are the very people who were against the Brady bill before. So there is progress. There is hope. 
   Brady made a difference.

   Mr. BIDEN. I will be brief because we will discuss this when the amendment comes up, but I am happy to answer the question. 
   There are four block grants in the bill. The one in which the distinguished Senator from Utah has agreed to make an alteration is the provision for $450 million that is available for up to 25 percent; $113 million of that will now be able to be used for afterschool programs, for drug treatment programs, and for any program which is designed to deal with the cadre of kids who, from the time the school bill rings at 2:30 until they go to a supervised situation at 6 or 7 o'clock at dinner, commit the majority of crimes committed by young people. 
   However, there are two other provisions in the bill. There are two other block grants of $200 million apiece. Those two allow money to be used for prevention and afterschool programs. 
   As I told the Senator, I happen to think in the original bill which I introduced 2 years ago--that was the juvenile justice bill--that had a number of cosponsors. 
   I think we should be spending closer to $1 billion on this prevention notion. From the time I was a kid, I went to a Catholic grade school. I don't know whether the nuns got this from my mother, or my mother got this from the nuns, but as my Mother would say, an idle mind is the Devil's workshop. 
   Give a kid no supervision from 2:30 in the afternoon until dinnertime, and I promise--I promise--good kids are going to get in trouble and bad kids are going to do very bad things. This is not rocket science. We should be doing much more. 
   The Senator from California has focused very much as a Congresswoman and now as a Senator on dealing with afterschool programs. Again, if you could wave a wand, and all the school boards and school districts that say they care so much about their children--and they do--if they could have baseball, basketball, cheerleading, chess, girls' field hockey, lacrosse, I would have those programs for every junior high in America. Almost no junior high in America has the programs. Do you want to keep kids out of trouble? This is not hard. This is not hard.  The people in the gallery know it; they understand it. The American people understand it. Why don't we understand it? Why don't the local authorities understand it? It is hard to tell people you will raise your taxes in order to do this. 
   The other thing this bill does, with the help of Senators PHIL GRAMM and ROBERT BYRD: When the Biden crime bill passed in 1994, we set up a violent crime trust fund. We let go 300,000 Federal workers. Under this administration, we have the smallest federal workforce since John Kennedy was President. I know the Senator knows this, but what we did with that money is take the paycheck that used to go to the person working at the IRS or the Department of Energy or wherever, and when they left their job, we didn't rehire people. We reduced the workforce. We put their paycheck in a trust fund, like the highway trust fund. This extends the trust fund until the year 2005. 
   I say to my friend that there are a lot of programs worth spending money on--education and defense--but I can't think of anything more fundamental than taking the streets back and giving our kids a safe environment in which to live. 
   There are two things we do. We add prevention money as a permissible use. We earmark it. It adds up only to $113 million. It has part of the other $400 million in this bill that can be used for prevention, but it is short of what we should be doing. 
   I am looking forward to supporting the Senator from California when she tries to do more for afterschool programs.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, there are a number of revisions that have been worked out here in the core bill that is before us. As the ranking member, Senator LEAHY, knows, and as the chairman knows, this began over 2 1/2 years ago. We have come a long way. We have narrowed the gap between the position held by Senator HATCH and myself and by Senator SESSIONS and myself and many others. Primarily what the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment does, it takes the underlying bill and it does three or four, I think, very important things. 
   No. 1, it adds prevention uses to permissible uses of the so-called accountability block grant. When I am home  sometimes watching this on TV, I wonder how the people understand anything we are saying. What is an accountability block grant? What it means is that there is $450 million in this bill that we give to given States to be able to use for various purposes. One of those chunks of money, the $450 million, prior to the Hatch-Biden amendment, did not allow the money to be used for prevention. This allows, earmarks, requires 25 percent of it to be used for prevention. You have about $113 million that is to be used for prevention out of that grant. 
   In addition to that, it adds other allowable uses that we hope the States will do. That is, it allows them to use money for drug treatment, alcohol treatment, drug and alcohol treatment, school counseling, school-based prevention programs. Then, in addition, what it does is--in the Biden crime bill, which became the crime law of 1994, what we didn't do was we did not put in money for prosecutors. We found out, as the former Governor of Nebraska knows, what happens in a lot of these courts is we add more cops and they arrest a lot more people. There are not enough prosecutors, there are not enough judges, and there are not enough facilities. So the cops do their job, but the process gets bottlenecked. So we have $50 million in here, which was initially resisted, $50 million for prosecutors at a State level, State prosecutors, money for the States to hire prosecutors to prosecute juvenile justice cases and for the States to train them to in fact prosecute crimes in juvenile court, because that always takes the hind quarter of these cases. One of the things is, there is not enough resources devoted to pursuing these cases. 
   The prosecution of the case doesn't mean we are just putting more prosecutors here to send kids to jail. We are putting more prosecutors in here to resolve these sets of graduated sanctions the States have set up so there is a prosecutor following through and saying, this kid is going to go on a work project, this kid is going to go to the State reform school, this kid is going to have to pay restitution for what he did, this kid is going to, in fact, follow through on the sanction that the court is imposing on him. And we, the State, are going to be able to pursue this--we, the prosecutor in such-and-such a county or such-and-such a State. 
   Finally, and perhaps most important of all, I think the best thing we did in the crime bill we passed in 1994, the thing that people paid the least attention to but the thing I worked the hardest on was setting up a crime trust fund, a violent crime trust fund. 
   I remind everybody that we made a commitment with this administration and when the crime bill passed we would reduce the workforce of Federal employees. We would reduce that workforce, but instead of taking their paycheck and returning it to the Treasury, we were going to put it in a trust fund. So we reduced the Federal workforce by 300,000 people--the smallest Federal workforce since John Kennedy was President of the United States of America. We took that money and we put it in a trust fund that can only be used for the purposes outlined in the crime bill--for prevention, for enforcement, and for incarceration. It stopped us from bickering over how we are going to fund the programs. 
   We are not raising any new taxes to pay for this. We are not giving money back. We can. We could take this money that we are no longer paying the Federal employees in the Department of Education, or in the Department of Energy, or wherever--we could take their paycheck and give it back in terms of a tax cut, or we could take it and put it in this trust fund. 
   That is what has kept the funding of the 100,000 cops, that is what has kept the funding of the prison system, and that is what has kept the funding of the prevention programs. That expires in the year 2000. This will extend that violent crime trust fund to the year 2005. 
   Once we cut through all the specific things we could legislatively do, it is probably the single most significant thing we will do. 
   I thank my colleagues for agreeing to the compromise which includes extending that trust fund. 
   There are a number of pieces of this legislation that understandably--because this is a moving target--have in fact confused people. 
   My friend from Nebraska asked me the question about whether or not this federalizes juvenile crime, whether or not it sets a Federal aid limit at which you could try a young person as an adult that preempts State law. No, we don't do that. 
   It does say that in a Federal court, if a Federal prosecutor brings a case within Federal jurisdiction against a minor, they can in fact seek to try that minor as an adult under a certain set of circumstances. But it doesn't go in and say to the State of Nebraska or Delaware that you must in your State treat minors in terms of whether or not they can be tried as adults the same way the Federal system treats them. Some States try minors as adults at a much younger age. Some States don't allow minors under the age of 18 to be tried as adults unless it is under the most extraordinary circumstances. 
   The original legislation in iteration of four or five bills ago probably did do that. But we are not federalizing this notion of under what circumstances a person under the age of 18 can be tried as an adult. We are not allowing for Federal preemption where there is State and Federal jurisdiction. It is not an automatic preemption to the State by the Federal Government. We have built into this legislation a rational way of approaching that. 
   In the interest of time, I am not going to take the time to explain that now.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation on a subject that we will be spending a great deal of time talking about on the floor this week--youth violence. At the outset, I would like to make clear that this bill is not a comprehensive one that addresses every aspect of this complex area. Other of my colleagues already have introduced legislation broadly addressing these issues with many good ideas that I support. 
   My bill today recognizes the need to get tough on juvenile crime and violence. But this bill goes farther. It also recognizes that the best thing the Federal Government can do in dealing with youth crime and violence is to focus on prevention. In other words, it ensures that what we do about juvenile crime and youth violence is a balanced approach. My colleagues and I have heard over and over again from law enforcement, prosecutors, and juvenile judges alike that the best way to deal on the front lines with juveniles who are committing or are at risk of committing crimes is to implement prevention as well as sanctions. 
   What the Federal Government does best in the area of fighting crime--and the significant drop in crime as a result of the 1994 crime bill is proof of this--is for it to provide local law enforcement, prosecutors, juvenile courts, schools, and community-based organizations funds for them to develop creative, comprehensive strategies on juvenile crime that are tailored for their community. It is important to hold kids accountable when they commit crimes. But it is equally--if not more--important to keep kids out of trouble, to keep kids out of the juvenile justice system in the first place. 
   Before I get to the specifics of what my bill does, I want to highlight the importance of early prevention in curbing youth violence. 
   To put the youth violence problem in some context, I would like to begin by outlining the specific--and different--  challenges we are facing when we discuss ``youth violence.'' Distinguishing among these different problems is important because each demands a different response. 
   To be specific--we are really facing three separate issues when we confront youth violence: 
   First, we have some number of children who are tragic cases--so violent that we really have no choice but to get them behind bars and keep them there, for a long time. 
   Second, we have kids who have already started down the crime path. They aren't committing violent crimes, but they are clearly getting into trouble. And, while the evidence is that most will never go on to commit violent crimes, it is clear that we have to reach these kids and turn them around. 
   Unlike the first category where public safety requires very severe, very long sentences, the key strategy for turning this second category of kids around appears to be certain, graduated punishments, as well as anything we can do which lessen the factors which may be pushing them deeper into the crime stream--keeping them away from drugs, away from guns and out of gangs. 
   Third, we have a category of children in what the demographers call the ``baby-boomerang.'' In a report I offered in December of 1995, I detailed what inevitably lies ahead--39 million children now younger than age 10. Each of these 39 million children--the children of the baby-boomers--stand on the edge of their teen years, exactly those years when they are most at-risk of turning to drugs and crime. 
   The implications of this demographic inevitability--even if we do everything right, and the rate at which kids commit crimes does not rise at all, we will have a 20% increase in juvenile murders by 2005, which will mean an increase in the overall murder toll of about 5%. 
   Clearly, most of these 39 million will never turn to drugs and crime. But, equally clear, we have a rising number of at-risk children--at-risk of turning to drugs, at-risk of being the victim of violence, and at-risk of turning to crime. 
   For this third category--the rising number of at-risk children--I believe we have to incorporate prevention as a key part of our strategy to combat youth crime and violence. 
   These three categories--lost, violent kids; kids just falling into the crime stream; and at-risk kids who may be nearing the edge of the crime stream--outline the targets of, and basic strategies for, a successful effort against youth violence. 
   As we begin to debate strategies for addressing youth violence, let's get at least some idea of the size, the magnitude, of each of these three segments of the youth violence question. 
   Starting in reverse order--with the third category of at-risk kids. Of course, all 39 million children in the ``baby-boomerang'' will not fall into this at-risk category. But, equally clear, that number of at-risk children will be at least a few million. 
   For the other two categories, the facts are that there are relatively few children in the ``lost'' category and while a significant number are in the ``falling into the crime stream'' category--both categories are much smaller than the few million in the ``at-risk'' category. 
   The facts for the youngest juveniles: In 1994, 379 juveniles younger than 15 years old were arrested for murder, 39,000 were arrested for a violent crime but more than 260,000 were arrested for a non-violent property crime. 
   For older teens, the pattern holds: 2,700 juveniles aged 15 to 17 were arrested for murder, 86,000 were arrested for a violent crime, but more than 350,000 were arrested for a non-violent property crime. 
   In sum: About 3,000 kids were arrested for murder--clearly ``lost'' children; 
   Another 115,000 kids were arrested for a violent crime--all are not irretrievable, but plainly all must be subject to serious punishment; 
   About 600,000 kids were arrested for a non-violent property crime--not lost to us yet, but clearly falling deeper into the crime stream; and 
   At least a few million children are in the at-risk category. 
   It is my hope that throughout the debate on youth violence that we will not lose sight of these fundamental facts about what we are talking about when we say ``Let's do something about youth violence.'' I believe that is the goal we all share, so let's be smart. Let's keep our eye on the ball. 
   In short, just as it would be foolish to spend all our efforts and money on the millions of at-risk kids and do nothing about the lost, violent kids--it would be equally foolish to spend all our efforts and money on the lost, violent kids and ignore the millions of at-risk kids. 
   Local officials throughout the country have looked at the facts, they have been smart, they have used their resources from the 1994 crime law--and guess what: adult violent crime has plummeted. We now have the lowest murder rate since 1971. That says one thing--if we are smart, we can make a difference on a problem everyone thought was unsolvable: violent crime. We ought to be able to do the same when that violent crime is committed by children. 
   We even have real world, working models of how to do so. Look to the experience in Boston--an experience that the judiciary committee recently heard about again in a hearing on juveniles and guns. In Boston, a combination of tough enforcement, cracking down on illegal gun dealers, focusing the forces of police, prosecutors and probation officers, and comprehensive community-based prevention efforts have slashed youth violence. 
   I have outlined the three basis elements of the youth violence problem. So let me turn to the specifics of what I believe we must do to address each of these three basic elements. 
   Tough punishment of the first group of kids--the ``Almost lost, already violent kids''--is necessary--for public safety purposes we really must look first to incapacitate very violent criminals, just getting them off the streets. 
   For the second group of kids--the ``just getting into trouble kids''--we must provide certain, graduated sanctions--so that instead of our current system of not punishing a kid until he has 10, 15 or 20 arrests, we give the kid at least some sanction from the very first offense. 
   And finally, for the third group--the ``baby bomberang kids''--who are not getting in trouble yet but are ``at-risk'', we must target the factors which push kids into--or deeper into--the crime stream: 
   Getting kids off drugs and alcohol through drug testing and follow-up with supervision and treatment; 
   Keeping kids out of gangs; and 
   Cracking down on the flow of guns to kids. 
   We must also keep as many at-risks kids as possible from turning to drugs and crime in the first place--in most practical terms, this means keeping kids busy and supervised during the 3:00 to dinnertime hours. 
   Those 3 hours represent about 12% of the day, about 20% of the hours when kids are awake--but at least 40% of juvenile crime occurs during those hours. 
   Here is what the bill I am introducing today would do: 
   It creates a block grant for use by States and local governments to develop strategies that are 
   aimed at all three of the categories of kids I just described. That block grant does the following: 
   First, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop more effective ways to investigate, prosecute, and punish those kids in the first group I described, who are already committing violent crimes. 
   Second, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop more effective ways to ensure accountability through graduated sanctions and other means, and to address risk factors such as drug and alcohol abuse, truancy, or involvement with gangs. 
   And third, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop programs targeted for at-risk kids for prevention--to keep these kids out of trouble, out of the juvenile crime system, and diverted from going down the path to becoming a career criminal. 
   To do these three things, my bill authorizes $450 million. Of that amount-- 
   25 percent--$112.5 million--must be spent on prevention and drug and alcohol treatment. 
   25 percent--$112.5 million--must be spent on prosecutors and courts.  
   The rest--$250 million--can be spent on a variety of uses, including graduated sanctions and prisons. 
   My bill also separately authorizes $50 million to hire, train, and fund programs run by prosecutors. We have heard over and over again that prosecutors, who are on the front lines in dealing with juvenile offenders, across the country are developing innovative, comprehensive approaches to juvenile crime that are resulting in significant drops in the juvenile crime rate. 
   For example, in Jacksonville, Florida, the state prosecutor there has developed a multi-tiered approach. Those programs provide schooling and counseling, they intervene with first time juvenile offenders to divert them from the system, they provide prevention programs for at-risk kids that include mentoring and talking to judges and kids already in jail, and they fight truancy. 
   It contains a ban on gun ownership by persons who, before their 18th birthday, adults who have been adjudicated to have committed a serious drug offense or violent felony. This provision, popularly known as ``Juvenile Brady'', is an important step towards keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. Violent juveniles who commit serious crimes should be stopped--early--from getting access to weapons to commit such crimes as adults. 
   Extending the Violent Crime Trust Fund to 2002. The Violent Crime Trust Fund--created in the 1994 crime bill--has been the key to our successful fight against crime over the past few years. It has been the vehicle for providing billions of dollars to State and local governments to implement a variety of law enforcement and crime-fighting--from the Cops Program to the Violence Against Women Act to youth violence initiatives. The Violent Crime Trust Fund is due to expire in fiscal year 2000--my bill extends it to 2002. Without the trust fund, we will fail in the future to replicate and to surpass our past successes in combating crime, including juvenile crime, in the future. 
   We must renew our efforts to save our Nation, our communities and our children from crime and violence. We must begin by ensuring that our children are safe--safe from both the temptation of crime and safe from those who commit crime and horrific acts of violence. 
   We must protect our children through meaningful prevention and intervention programs, a crackdown on drugs and the violence that accompanies them, and we must insure that meaningful, appropriate and swift punishment is imposed on all juvenile offenders. I believe that the bill I introduce today, while not a comprehensive answer to every part of the juvenile crime problem, will go far in addressing one of its key components--prevention.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am truly appreciative of the comments my  friends have made--my old-new friends, my old-old friends, and my close buddies from across the State line. 
   I began to wonder about casting my 10,000th vote on the occasion of the majority leader indicating there would be no more votes for 4 days and the last planes heading west were leaving. I thank my colleagues who put in the RECORD their comments. I will withhold specific comment until I read them, because God only knows what they said. But let me say that I find it no particular feat to have cast 10,000 votes. If you are around here long enough and still standing, that happens. 
   I hope I have cast some votes that have made this country a little bit better. I am confident there is none that I have cast that have enhanced the standing of America, or the condition of the American people, that weren't bipartisan. I can't think of any that were done that weren't done in a bipartisan manner in the end. 
   I look at ORRIN HATCH. ORRIN HATCH came here, and is still one of the leading conservative lights on the American political scene, and yet we have worked together for years and years and years. I cannot think that we have ever had a cross word to one another in 25 years. We have had very different views.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator SPECTER today in introducing legislation that will create a fund to finance the building and renovation of stadiums and ballparks for major league baseball and professional football sports leagues across America. For too long, baseball and football teams have threatened to move if state and local governments do not ante up the money to renovate or build new, publicly financed stadiums for the home teams. The scene is, by now, a familiar one: multi-millionaire team owners demand new, taxpayer-funded state-of-the-art stadiums, so that they and their players can make even more money for themselves--at taxpayer expense, of course. The taxpayers are impaled on the horns of a dilemma: either pony up or risk losing the team. 
   This bill will strike an equitable arrangement between teams and local governments to share the costs of stadium renovation and construction--ensuring that professional sports teams put up their fair share. The way the bill would accomplish this is straightforward. Team owners owe much of their wealth to revenue from network  telecasts of their games, a boon they receive courtesy of the antitrust exemption granted by us--the Congress. The antitrust exemption contained in the Sports Broadcasting Act permits teams to pool their television rights, yielding annual revenues of $2.2 billion to the National Football League and $425 million to Major League Baseball. 
   This legislation would require, as a condition for retaining this lucrative antitrust exemption, that Major League Baseball and the National Football League place into a trust fund 10 percent of the revenues the Leagues receive from network telecasts. Each sport's trust fund, in turn, would be used to finance up to one half the cost of constructing a new stadium or park, or renovating an older one, for any of the teams seeking such financing--so long as the local government has agreed to provide one dollar for every two furnished by the trust fund. In other words, if a pro team in Wilmington wanted to build a $200 million stadium, it could obtain $100 million from the trust fund, a government entity in Delaware would have to kick in $50 million, and the remaining money would have to come from the team owner or some other source. In addition to allowing the Leagues to retain their current antitrust exemption, the bill would expand the exemption to give the Leagues the authority to prevent member clubs from moving their franchises. 
   To my mind, this bill strikes just the right balance. Let us not saddle cities and taxpayers with the exorbitant--sometimes mind-boggling--costs of building new stadiums while the teams and their owners sit back and wait for the highest bidder. If the Leagues want to keep their antitrust exemption, the major source of their millions, they should be willing to do their fair share. This legislation's condition that in exchange for the exemption, the teams set aside 10 percent of their broadcast revenues, is a reasonable and much needed measure to restore some balance to a negotiating process that is out-of-whack.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to remind the Senate and the American Public that this is Arson Awareness Week. It is that time once a year that we stop to assess how arson affects our lives. Each year hundreds of Americans die because of the arsonist's match. Mr. President, I am outraged at this and the countless firefighters who are killed every year attempting to extinguish intentionally set fires. Arsonists should be swiftly brought to justice, especially when firefighters lives are put on the line. 
   When a fire is intentionally set in the center of a retail city district the damaged property becomes blight on the entire community. Like cancer, arson degrades the whole area. Jobs are lost, tax bases are depleted and, most importantly, people are often killed. 
   As a member of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I have long been associated with the war against arson. I have consistently supported stricter penalties for convicted arsonists. I have supported the efforts of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that assist our fine state and local fire investigators. I have also supported the United States Fire Administration which provides valuable research grants and public education efforts geared toward controlling arson. 
   Mr. President I remind all Americans that arson is still a serious problem, one we must continually work together to solve.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with utmost respect and admiration that I rise today to acknowledge the contributions of a woman who, at the age of 99, has never tired of giving her all to her country and to the men and women of the Mill Creek Fire Company--Elma F. Brittingham of Marshallton, Delaware, affectionately known to everyone as ``Mom.'' On May 8, 1999, Mill Creek will honor her at its 72nd Annual Dinner for 72 years of unmatched volunteer service to the Mill Creek Fire Company. Yes, Elma is a charter member of the Mill Creek Fire Company and she remains an institution in the Fire Hall. 
   This well-deserved recognition is much less than I or anyone in Delaware could ever do to capture just how significant Elma's life has been to everyone with whom she has come in contact. Her legacy is etched in the memory of every fire service professional and volunteer in our State and her life continues to be an inspiration to all of us. 
   While many remember Elma for her 50 years of preparing turkey dinners for the Annual Volunteer Fire Conference, or her playing Yen Man in the company minstrel show, she is most remembered for her work on the front-line, fighting fires under the most dangerous circumstances. The one she most vividly remembers was during World War II when she helped put out a fire at an old prison farm on Duncan Road in Wilmington during a thunder and lightning storm. With this same energy and vigor, Elma is as spirited  today, five decades later, as she was more than a half-century ago. 
   I know that there may be someone like Elma Brittingham in other States, but none can be more important to a community than this totally committed, selfless woman that I honor today. She is what we, as Americans, should aspire to be--a loyal public servant, an example of excellence and achievement in everything she has committed to accomplishing, and a credit to her community and to her country. I am deeply privileged to know this woman and proud to call her a heroic Delawarean and an outstanding American.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there are few issues that this body debates which are of consequence equal to what we are debating today. We are literally talking about the life and death of thousands of people, including possibly American personnel, American soldiers. 
   I have been here for 27 years, and on those occasions when I have been put in the position of having to vote on matters that relate to whether or not someone will live or die, I have tried my level best to be as intellectually honest and rigorous 
   with myself as I possibly can. I have listened to the debate on the floor today with great interest and with some disappointment. It comes as no surprise to my colleagues that have served with me in the last 10 years or so, or even those in the last year or so, how strongly I feel about the Balkans. I am given blame, or credit, depending on the place from which you come, for getting us as involved in Bosnia as we are. I came back in the early nineties from a long, several-hour meeting late in the night in the office of Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Yugoslavia, and I came away convinced that this was a man with an agenda that was anathema to our interests and was literally genocidal. 
   I wrote a report years ago, referred to as ``lift and strike,'' whereby I urged us to change our policy. And so I don't want to attempt to hide in any way the intensity of my feelings about what the appropriate action for the United States, NATO, and the world is relative to Mr. Milosevic. But when I recently got back from Macedonia late at night on a Sunday, I got home. After flying, I guess, for 12 or so hours--whatever the timeframe was--I did what most people do after a long trip. I took a shower and brushed my teeth and tried as quietly as I could to climb into bed and not disturb my wife, who was asleep. 
   After I got settled, thinking I had accomplished not awakening her, she leaned over and said, ``Welcome home.'' Then she asked me a question, which I suspect the American people are asking. You are going to ask every one of us. My constituents are going to ask me. It was absolutely sincere. She said, in the dark of the night--and I could not even see her face--``Joe, are you sure you're correct?'' 
   That sort of cut right to the quick of things. I had been so outspoken on this issue, and that took me aback for a moment. I answered her with complete honesty and candor. I said, ``I don't know. I am not positive. I can't guarantee it, but I feel so strongly that I'm right, that I'm going to continue to pursue pushing us in the direction of doing what I think is right.'' 
   If my wife is asking me if I'm sure I'm right, and she is privy to my thoughts, concerns, and serious contemplations about whether or not I should be a party to causing some Americans to die, then I wonder what the majority of the American people must think. They must be moved by, or find appealing, the arguments of some of my colleagues today on the floor: It is not our fight. We should not be there. We are doing it the wrong way. The President of the United States is not worthy of our trust as Commander in Chief. We should bring the boys home. We have no vital interests. 
   You know, I sit in a seat now that men such as Vandenberg sat in. I am a senior Senator. There is only one person on the Foreign Relations Committee that has been there as long as I have been there. When I was the age of these pages--this is the truth--I used to wonder, when I was in high school and college, as we studied about Hitler and Germany, why nobody did anything in 1934 or 1935 or 1937 or 1938 when the price would have been incredibly lower. You look back now and just think what would have happened had the world united and gone in and taken Hitler out. Just think how different it would have been. 
   By the way, I note parenthetically that I am not equating Milosevic to Hitler in terms of his capacity, ability, or his danger. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, he does 
   not represent a country of 50 million people, an industrial giant. He does not have the military power of a country as great as Germany. He does not present the same threat. 
   But it is analogous in the following way: In a closed meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee, with senior Members of the Senate in attendance from the Committee on Appropriations and, I believe, Armed Services, I was making a case several months ago about why we had to be involved. 
   One of my colleagues, for whom I have an overwhelming amount of respect, a veteran who put his life on the line for this country, a very promilitary guy, looked at me and asked the following question, which answered for me that question I could never answer as a young man, Why did we not act? After listening to my case as to why we should be involved with NATO, he said, ``But, Joe, can you guarantee me no American will be killed?'' It was as if somebody took one of those little hammers that the doctors use to test your reflexes, those little rubber hammers, and went bing, and hit me right in the head. The light went on, and all of a sudden I realized why the Vandenbergs of the world didn't do anything. 
   It is difficult to explain to the American people how you would risk even one American life, or more than that, how you would be able to say I can assure you that Americans will die for something that hasn't happened yet. How do you do that? I am sure somebody said, in 1935: If we go in after Hitler, it is going to cost 100 or 1,000 or 2,000 American lives to get the job done. 
   I am sure Senators like the Presiding Officer and me sat there and said, ``How am I going to go home and explain that to my folks? How can I go home and explain we are going to lose several thousand American lives to take out a guy they do not know anything about, who is no immediate threat to them now, and all he is doing is beating up Jews and gypsies?'' Hard sell. That is where we are now. We have a guy who is doing more than beating up Jews and gypsies. We have a guy who, if you turn on your television, is loading thousands of people into railroad cars in the heart of Europe. He has corralled them like cattle, putting them in railroad cars. I looked at it, and I thought to myself: This is almost like a video game, or something. Is this real? This is 1999. They are loading people on railroad cars because of their ethnicity and religion. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. INHOFE, said he was recently in the camps in Macedonia. So was I in the same camps. We came away with two different impressions. We agreed they were happy to be there. We agreed they were getting fed well. But do you know what struck me? As a Senator, I have been in refugee camps all over the world. It was the following. I was standing there talking to people. And there was thousands of people in line--like a long movie line. They were about six or eight wide, snaked all through this camp. I was standing there answering questions for people, and asking questions of refugees. All of a sudden it struck me. I was standing next to a guy who had on a sport coat that must have cost $750. Another guy--I looked down at his shoes. They had been to be $300 Italian-made leather shoes. In between them was an old lady in a babushka with her teeth missing. All of a sudden it came to me. This is the enormity of the cleansing. It had nothing to 
   do with their economic station. It had nothing to do with the specific territory they lived in. It had to do with their religion and their ethnicity. 
   It is as if someone marched into an office building in downtown Washington and took out the $400,000 lawyers along with the cleaning lady because they were both Moslem. 
   People say ``no vital interest.'' Let me ask my colleagues who are listening and the staff of my colleagues who are monitoring this debate. Ask yourself the following question: Can anyone say that they will be leaving their children and grandchildren a more secure future if NATO and the United States do nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing in the heart of Europe? Forget for a moment whether or not I and others are right, that if we do not act, it will result in an open war and the split between Greece and Turkey, a division within Europe that is reminiscent of 1910 and 1915, although the Hapsburg, Ottoman, German, and Russian Empires were still in existence. Forget  that. Assume we are wrong about that. Tell me, anybody explain to me, how my child and granddaughters are going to be more secure if, in fact, you have a million people displaced, you have thousands of people--at least now documented hundreds of people --brought out in the backyards of their homes and knelt down and had their heads blown off. 
   There are 11 million ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. There are thousands, tens of thousands of Hungarians living in Romania. There are hundreds of thousands of Turks living in Bulgaria. Tell me how this works. Someone explain to me. And then, even if they can explain that, explain to me how the United States of America can be prevent itself from being dragged into a war in Europe. 
   Look, I am not saying to you all that if we don't act right now, within the next 5 years our future is doomed. But tell me what Europe looks like in 20 years. Tell me how it is possible that the United States can conduct its foreign policy anywhere in the world without a stable and secure Europe, not because we are ``Europhile'' and we only think Europe is important or more important than Asia. But tell me how with our economic, political, cultural, and military ties there can be a Europe divided and our interests not be affected. I find it absolutely astounding that anyone in this Chamber could say we have no vital interest. 
   I also find this moral relativism very fascinating. It kind of goes like this. If there is an injustice anywhere in the world and we can't deal with every injustice, then we should deal with no injustice. If in Rwanda African tribes are killing one another and the carnage is greater there, or in Cambodia where 2 million people were killed--and the list goes on--if we didn't get involved there, how did we get involved now? 
   Well, I point out two little facts: 
   One, we have the means in Europe that do not exist in those other parts of the world; two, we have the ability with the means available to us if we are willing to execute an outcome that we desire; and, three, if Europe begins to disintegrate, we are in trouble, because we are a European power. 
   I said that I would try my best to be as honest with myself as I could because, by the way, I tell you we are political. I am not suggesting those who oppose our involvement in Kosovo do it for this reason. But I can tell you that it is a lot easier 
   for me in my State to be for noninvolvement. That is a sacred place to be, Mr. President. That is the easier place to be. I didn't look for this fight. This is not why I came to the Senate at age 30 saying I want to be for pushing us to go to war. That is why I examine these arguments the best I can, because if there is a better way that doesn't include war, I am for it. 
   I listened to all the arguments today. The only one, with all due respect, that I think made sense was PETE DOMENICI's. He is in opposition to the McCain-Biden resolution. What he said, from my perspective at least, adds up, and it makes sense. He said, ``Hey, look. The President didn't ask for this authority. Why are you forcing it on him? He doesn't want it yet. So don't give it to him.'' And we should send him a letter that says, ``If you want it, Mr. President, ask us and we will act on it quickly.'' 
   When the Senator from Arizona and I introduced this resolution, that was basically our intention. We didn't--at least I didn't--contemplate that the Parliamentarian would rule correctly--I am not challenging the ruling--that the War Powers Act was implicated and that we must vote on this resolution. That was not what we anticipated. We anticipated, when we introduced this, for it to be here on the floor ready and able to be brought up when it was needed, because we--at least I--concluded that we should give the air campaign a full opportunity to succeed--I haven't given up on that yet--but that Milosevic and the rest of the world should know we were prepared to do whatever it took to win. 
   Here we are, voting on it because of the procedural rules not of the Senate, but of the statute, and thereby by the Senate rule. 
   I understand Senator DOMENICI's argument. By the way, I believe, notwithstanding all the speeches today, if the President of the United States asks for ground troops with NATO, that this body will vote for it; that there are over 51 votes for it. When the rubber meets the road and Members have to vote yes or no, I predict we will see a lot of opinions change. 
   Now, I heard today time and again the Gulf of Tonkin analogy. With all due respect, it is not at all analogous. In the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, the U.S. Congress said to the President, and I am paraphrasing, Mr. President, use whatever means at your disposal. It didn't say what the McCain-Biden resolution says; it didn't say use whatever means is at your disposal--assuming 18 other nations sign on with you. You do not, if McCain-Biden passes, Mr. President, have the authority to use force unilaterally. It is in conjunction with NATO; not alone, in conjunction with NATO. 
   At the time of Vietnam and the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, we were essentially alone in the world in concluding that force need be used. With regard to Kosovo, we are in the majority. The entire civilized world, including the Russians, acknowledge that Milosevic is engaged in behavior that violates every notion of civilized conduct. They disagree on the means we should use to deal with that. 
   I was in Macedonia. I went into a tent city about which my friend from Oklahoma talked. He is right, these are courageous young men and women. I sat in a tent that housed about 20 military folks. I walked in and said, They make the 
   analogy back home about Vietnam; what do you guys think of that? There were two women, as well. What do you think of that? A sergeant looked at me, he was 23, 24 years old, and he said the following:  
   Senator, when you were 23 years old, if they had sent you here, would you have any doubt about the morality of what you were undertaking?  
   The answer is no. It is not analogous to Vietnam. I was a student during Vietnam. We were told there was a monolithic communism that was going to roll out of Moscow and Beijing, roll down through Southeast Asia. Our history professors would say, Wait a minute, the Chinese and the Russians aren't getting along together. And, wait, the Chinese and the Vietnamese have been fighting each other for 300 years. So explain to me how this domino is going to fall. 
   Did anybody notice fleets of Russians in Cam Ranh Bay? Not because of us, the Chinese weren't going to let them be there. This monolithic communism didn't exist. 
   I don't want to relitigate Vietnam but it is not analogous, not only for the reasons my friend from Massachusetts stated--the size of the territory, the population, the availability of the arms materiel, the allies. Sure, China and Russia cooperated because it suited their interest to keep the Vietnamese fighting us but not because of the rationale we were given. 
   I respectfully suggest there is nothing analogous. The Tonkin Gulf resolution is not analogous because it is not giving the President authority on his own in the McCain-Biden resolution as Tonkin Gulf did. It is a different continent, it is a different population, it is a different rationale. There is no doubt on the part of anyone about the morality of the undertaking. 
   That old joke, and I am paraphrasing, Can 18 European countries that don't have a lot in common be wrong, all at once? Can they all be wrong? 
   Listening to this debate, one would think the President of the United States just woke up one morning and said: ``You know, I need a war. I would like to have a war. I would like to test our new smart bombs. I would like to figure out if they work better than they did in Desert Storm. We put a lot of money and time into it, and I have just the guy to look to. Eighteen other nations said what this guy is doing is bad.'' 
   Some of my colleagues will say they have been fighting for thousands of years; all those people are the same. There are a lot of bad guys on all sides, but I don't see the Moslems loading up Serbs on cars and sending them off. I don't see this happening anywhere else in Europe. 
   There is one remaining dictator in the region. His name is Slobodan Milosevic. He is a bad guy. He is a smart bad guy. He is doing very bad things. The idea that the United States of America, when all of Europe has stood up and said this must stop, will  walk away, I think is absolutely bizarre. 
   Does anybody here truly believe we could stand aside, let this happen, and it not affect our vital interests in the year 2010 and 2012 and 2020 when my granddaughters and their husbands will be sent off? 
   It seems to me we are making a gigantic mistake here to try to hide behind a lot of arguments. I raise this question with my friend. We use that phrase all the time--``my friend.'' This guy really is my friend. We have been friends for 27 
   years. We were back in the Cloakroom talking. I said, what the heck is going on here? I think we both came to a similar conclusion, at least in part. On both sides of the aisle people are using code words because they don't want to be isolationist. This is about isolationism or internationalism. That is what this is about. 
   A lot of Republicans don't trust this President. I am not suggesting they trust him, but just sort of take that nickel when you do the cards at McDonald's for your kids and see whether you won a cup or something. Scrape it off a little bit and right below is the real link--isolationism. 
   On my side are a lot of the old antiwar Members. By the way, decorated veterans such as Senator MCCAIN and Senator KERRY say we should be doing this. 
   Look, folks, I don't know how to run an antiseptic foreign policy. I don't know how you can be President of the United States and make every decision you make based upon the following formula: If an American will lose their life, we can't get involved. 
   Look, if there is any man in this Chamber, or woman, who understands the loss of life in war and the brutality of war, it is my colleague here, Senator MCCAIN. I am not being gratuitous here. He may be the next President of the United States of America. Guys like him, and women like him, may have to say, ``I am going to have to do something that is going to cost American lives.'' 
   People who disagree with us, I say to my friend, act like we are cavalier about it. I don't understand it like my friend understands it, but I think I understand loss of life a little bit. It is not about that. It is about the recognition that this is a mean damn world out there. 
   So I listen to my colleagues make the strangest arguments. I hear a Democrat stand up and say: You know, we should not be involved in this at all. This is a terrible thing. I voted against the bombing. And, by the way, we have to save the refugees. We are going to save the refugees. 
   Where the heck are you going to save them?

   Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Arizona, and I spoke to this very briefly in his absence, it is the only argument that has any substance, in my view. I disagree with it. I disagree with it for a lot of reasons I have spoken to. I am going to vote and urge my colleagues not vote to table. We will do it the right way. But at least they have an argument that the President has not asked for it. I think we should be telling the President he has it. 
   We are not demanding, the Senator from Arizona and I, that he use ground troops. We are saying to him: We want to make sure you understand that you have to win this and you can't come back to us and say you didn't do it because you didn't have the means. At least that is why this Senator is pushing this. 
   The arguments I find totally disingenuous, though, are the ones that go like this. I heard today: You know, I voted against the bombing, but I tell you what, I am going to vote to table this use of the available ground troops to the President because I don't trust the President. But I tell you what, if this President were a leader, he would do whatever it took to stop this. But I am going to vote against giving him the authority it would take to stop it because I don't trust this President. 
   How? I don't understand.

   Mr. BIDEN. Only on one occasion. The point the Senator is making I understand. But only on one occasion. Two other occasions I can think of where Presidents have asked not to have more authority--when they thought they were going to lose. 
   I have personally spoken to the President. I have spoken to the National Security Adviser. The National Security Adviser would like to have this authority. But what he does not want to have is a vote that says he cannot have the authority. They are worried if there is a vote that is a straight up-and-down vote 
   and it loses, that it will mean, in conjunction with the House vote last week, that the Congress is on record against ground troops. 
   My argument to them is it does not mean that. It means they concluded they were not prepared to do it now without the White House asking for it. But I believe there have been circumstances in the past where Presidents have affirmatively suggested they not ask for authority and table something when they thought they did not have the votes. 
   My colleagues on this side have told them they do not have the votes, as have your colleagues. I think my colleagues on this side are wrong, and I think the colleagues on the other side are wrong about the votes. Because I find an interesting thing, Senator. On very, very important matters--and everyone knows how important this is--Congress likes to avoid responsibility. 
   I will take us back very briefly to the Persian Gulf. On the Persian Gulf we had great disagreement, and during that time I remember going to my caucus and saying: We must demand a vote. And my colleagues on my side, whose names I will not mention, but I give you my word to this, who were against the action in the Persian Gulf, said: No, no, don't ask for a vote, because they wanted to be in line. Because if it succeeded, they wanted to be able to say, ``Great job, Mr. President,'' and if it failed, they wanted to be able to say, ``Not me.'' I think that is at work here, I say to my friend from Arizona. 
   But the bottom line of it is that the Senator from Arizona, in my opinion, is dead right. I think the amendment is dead right on. I think we do more to bring a successful conclusion to this war by giving that authority whether or not it is used. I think we would make a tragic mistake being apologists for a policy that in fact makes no civilized sense, when we make moral equivalence about the people in the region, when we argue that a bombing pause would not affect anything, when we argue--my time is up. Ten seconds.  
   I compliment Reverend Jackson on bringing these folks home. But with all due respect, I can think of a lot of people with his standing who could have gone and probably gotten the same result, if in fact they were willing, and believed as he does, that we should stop the bombing. 
   I think it is a mistake. It is a little bit like saying: Give me three people back and I will not do anything about the 300 you massacred--which they did, by the way, just 4 days earlier. 
   I think it is a tragic mistake. I wish we would get our act together. I think the President is going to have to take the case to the Nation more forcefully than he has. I hope we do not table the McCain-Biden resolution, but it appears we are going to do that. As you can tell, I have spoken too long. But I think this is something in our vital interest with the capacity to affect the outcome that would be beneficial to all people, and the idea that it would be a failure if we had to have forces there in order to maintain the peace, who were not being killed, and the genocide stopped--I would consider that victory, not failure.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. 
   I say to my friend from Virginia, I think it is constitutionally required. I am in the minority in that view. I do not think the President has the authority to commit ground troops without the consent of the Congress, but I think it is politically necessary. I think it is politically necessary because it is of great value to any President to have the Congress on the line with him as he prosecutes a war. I think it is constitutionally necessary and politically wise. 
   I realize that there are those who disagree with me, that the war clause--not the War Powers Act, the war clause--of the Constitution I believe requires the consent of the Congress for the use of this force now, but it----

   Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry. If he were to use ground forces. But I acknowledge there is a constitutional argument that says that if the Congress had voted and the House did not, but if they had voted, as we had, for the use of air power, that he would not need that additional authority. 
   I do think there is a constitutional requirement for the Congress to assent to this action. I understand I am in the minority. Beyond that, I think there is a political necessity 
   that we be united. 
   My friend and I have talked about this privately before. We can all disagree about the lessons from Vietnam, but I think we both agree that one of the lessons out of Vietnam was that no matter how smart, no matter how brilliant a foreign policy is, it cannot be sustained without the informed consent of the American people and their elected representatives being signed on to it. 
   That is my primary motivation. The place my friend from Arizona and I disagree is, I am not doing this to embolden the President to do the right thing. The reason I signed on to it is to make sure the Congress goes on record saying that we will back whatever action the President takes to meet the four goals that he has stated. There is legitimate constitutional disagreement, but I fall down on the side that I think it is necessary.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, yes, I am. In the one case in Vietnam, it was given through the Tonkin Gulf. In Korea, I don't think it is constitutionally--by the way, I am not alone in this. I happen to teach--it does not make me an expert, but I happen to teach constitutional law and separation of powers now in law school. I can assure you one thing: The vast majority of constitutional scholars agree with me. 
   The point being, you do not need to declare war. As Louis Henkin, who wrote the Restatement of International Law, pointed out, it does not require a declaration of war; it requires a consent of the Congress, which is equivalent to the authority required, just like what we did in the Persian Gulf. When the Congress went on record granting the authority to the President to use the force in the resolution, that is the equivalent of a declaration of war. All constitutional scholars agree on that point.

The only relevant constitutional point--and this is getting us off the point here, but the only relevant constitutional point is whether or not the Congress granted authority, asked for or not. That is the only relevant constitutional point. 
   With the Senator's permission, I would like to ask unanimous consent  to print in the RECORD a legal brief which I have written on this point relative to the war powers clause and

   Mr. BIDEN. There was an issue, and all the Senate and House Members were assembled, and they were about to vote on the floor of the House of Representatives on a resolution relating to whether or not the President would ask for consent to use ground troops. Let me be precise. 
   A resolution was submitted characterized by the Speaker, as we sat there, as one that would say the following, and eventually was voted on. It said: Mr. President, before you introduce ground troops into Kosovo, you must come to us under the Constitution and ask for our permission. 
   And the President--I can say this because he said it publicly. The President said, ``I didn't want to do something no President has acknowledged that he has to do in a debate with Congress.'' And I stood up, and I said, ``Mr. President, let me respectfully suggest you send the following letter to the House,'' because I didn't want the vote to turn into the debacle it did. And I suggested the President say the following: ``Notwithstanding the fact that I am not required to ask permission, I assure you that I will, in fact, ask the permission of the Congress before I use ground troops, if I make that decision.'' 
   That is exactly what I said. And then we got a letter from the President which said essentially that. My purpose was not relating to the Constitution. My purpose was trying to keep the House from doing the thing I found to be imprudent, because I was worried that if they passed the resolution, which in fact they have the authority to do--the Congress--it would send a message to Milosevic and others that we were unwilling to use ground troops if need be. 
   The President was saying, ``I don't want ground troops now.'' So I said, ``The way to settle this, Mr. President, you don't have to give up what you think you're''--you may remember--I said, ``Mr. President, I think you do need authority from the Congress if you're going to send ground troops. But you don't have to give that up. You don't have to give up that legal argument. Say, `Notwithstanding the fact I, the President, don't think I need that, I promise you I will not introduce ground troops before I ask for your permission.' '' 
   That is not a constitutional commitment he is making. It is a personal commitment he is making, as President. 
   And my purpose, I say to my friend from Virginia, was to keep the House from voting on that inappropriate resolution ahead of time, the very inappropriate resolution that the Congress introduced and passed. That is why.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the best time to target a new drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug has overwhelmed our communities. 
   That is why I introduced legislation in previous Congresses to place tight federal controls on the date rape drug Rohpynol--also known as Roofies--which was becoming known as the Quaalude of the Nineties as its popularity spreads throughout the United States. 
   My bill would have shifted Rohpynol to schedule 1 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Rescheduling is important for three simple reasons: 
   First, Federal re-scheduling triggers increases in State drug law penalties, and since we all know that more than 95 percent of all drug cases are prosecuted at the State level, not by the Federal Government, it is vitally important that we re-schedule. 
   Second, Federal re-scheduling to schedule 1 triggers the toughest Federal penalties--up to a year in prison and at least a $1,000 fine for a first offense of simple possession. 
   And, third, re-scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to reschedule Quaaludes, Congress passed the law, and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. And, in 1990, I worked to re-schedule steroids, Congress passed the law, and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was reversed.  
   Despite evidence of a growing Rohpynol epidemic, some argued that my efforts to reschedule the drug by legislation were premature. Accordingly, I agreed to hold off on legislative action and wait for a Drug Enforcement Administration decision on whether to schedule the drug through the lengthy and cumbersome administrative process. 
   As I predicted, the DEA report on Rohpynol--handed down in November--correctly concludes that despite the rapid spread of Rohpynol throughout the country, DEA cannot re-schedule Rohpynol by rulemaking at this time. 
   The report notes, however, that Congress is not bound by the bureaucratic re-scheduling process the DEA must follow. Congress can--and in my view should--pass legislation to reschedule Rohpynol. 
   Sepcifically the report states: ``This inability to reschedule [Rohpynol] administratively *.*.* does not affect Congress' ability to place [the drug] in schedule 1 through the legislative process''--as we did with Quaaludes in 1984 and Anabolic Steroids in 1990. 
   Let me also note that the DEA report confirmed a number of facts about the extent of the Rohpynol problem: 
   DEA found more than 4,000 documented cases--in 36 States--of sale or possession of the drug, which is not marketed in the United States and must be smuggled in. 
   ``In spite of DEA's inability to reschedule [Rohpynol] through administrative proceedings, DEA remains very concerned about the abuse'' of the drug. 
   ``Middle and high school students have been known to use [Rohpynol] as an alternative to alcohol to achieve an intoxicated state during school hours. [The drug] is much more difficult to detect than alcohol, which produces a characteristic odor.'' 
   ``DEA is extremely concerned about the use of [Rohpynol] in the commission of sexual assaults.'' 
   ``The number of sexual assaults in which [Rohpynol] is used may be underreported''--because the drug's effects often cause rape victims to be unable to remember details of their assaults and because rape crisis centers, hospitals, and law enforcement have only recently become aware that Rohpynol can be used to facilitate sex crimes. 
   Nonetheless, ``DEA is aware of at least 5 individuals who have been convicted of rape in which the evidence suggests that [the Rohypnol drug] was used to incapacitate the victim.'' ``The actual number of sexual assault cases involving [the drug] is not known. It is difficult to obtain evidence that [the Rohypnol drug] was used in an assault.'' 
   I would also note that my efforts to re-schedule this drug have already had beneficial results: The manufacturer of Rohypnol recently announced that it had developed a new formula to minimize the potential for abuse of the drug in sexual assaults. 
   This is an important step. But pills produced under the old Rohypnol formula are still in circulation, and pills made by other manufacturers can still be smuggled in. Furthermore, the new formula will not prevent kids from continuing to ingest this dangerous drug voluntarily for a cheap high. 
   In short, stricter, Federal controls remain necessary; and DEA is powerless to respond to Rohypnol abuse until the problem gets even worse. 
   Therefore, I am reintroducing my bill to re-schedule Rohypnol in schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to take action against this dangerous drug now, rather than waiting for the problem to develop into an epidemic. 
   My bill also places ``Special K''--ketamine hydrochloride--a dangerous hallucinogen very similar to PCP, on schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. Despite Special K's rising popularity as a ``club drug'' of choice among kids, the drug is not even illegal in most States. This has crippled State authorities' ability to fight ketamine abuse. 
   For example, in Federal 1997, two men accused of stealing ketamine from a Ville Platte, Louisiana veterinary clinic and cooking the drug into a powder could not be prosecuted under State drug control laws because ketamine is not listed as a Federal controlled substance. 
   Similarly, a New Jersey youth recently found to be possessing and distributing ketamine could be charged with only a disorderly persons offense. 
   Prosecutors are trying to combat increased Ketamine use by seeking lengthy prison terms for possession of the drugs--like marijuana--that users mix with Ketamine, but if it is just Special K, there's nothing they can do about it. 
   I am convinced that scheduling Ketamine will help our effort to fight the spread of this dangerous drug by triggering increases in State drug law penalties. 
   Without Federal scheduling, many States will not be able to address the Ketamine problem until it is too late and Special K has already infiltrated their communities. 
   Medical professions who use Ketamine--including the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists--support scheduling, having determined that it will accomplish our goal of ``preventing the diversion and unauthorized use of Ketamine'' while allowing ``continued, responsible use'' of the drug for legitimate purposes. [Letter from Mary Beth Leininger, D.V.M., President of the American Veterinary Medical Association] 
   And the largest manufacturer of Ketamine has concluded that ``moving the product to schedule III classification is in the best interest of the veterinary industry and the public.'' [Letter from E. Thomas Corcoran, President of Fort Dodge Animal Health, a Division of American Home Products Corporation]. 
   Scheduling Ketamine will give State authorities the tools they desperately need to fight its abuse by young people--and end the legal anomaly that leaves those who sell Ketamine to our children beyond the reach of the law--even when they are caught ``red-handed.'' I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   In addition to raising controls on Rohypnol and Ketamine, the legislation I am introducing today would increase the ability of the Attorney General to respond to new drug emergencies in the future. 
   Our Federal drug control laws currently allow the Attorney General limited authority to respond to certain new drugs on an emergency basis--by temporarily subjecting them the strictest Federal control while the extensive administrative procedure for permanent scheduling proceeds. 
   But the Attorney General has not been able to use this authority to respond to the Rohypnol and Special K emergencies--because she does not have authority to--move drugs from one schedule to another, or to schedule drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has allowed companies to research but not to sell. 
   This amendment would grant the administration this important authority by--authorizing the Attorney General to move a scheduled drug--like Rohypnol--to schedule I in an Emergency; by applying emergency rescheduling authority to ``investigational new drugs''--like Special K--that the Food and Drug Administration has approved for research purposes only, but not for marketing. 
   And by providing that a rescheduling drug remains on the temporary schedule until the administrative proceedings reach a final conclusion on whether to schedule. This legislation would give the Attorney General the necessary tools to respond quickly when evidence appears that a drug is being abused. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the New Medicines to Treat Addiction Act of 1999, legislation that builds upon my efforts in previous Congresses to promote research into and development of new medicines to treat the ravages of hard core drug addiction. 
   Since the first call to arms against illegal drugs, we have learned just how insidious hard-core drug addiction is, even as the ravages of substance abuse--on both the addict and the addict's victims--have become ever more apparent. The frustration in dealing with a seemingly intractable national problem is palpable, most noticeably in the heated rhetoric as politicians blame each other for the failure to find a cure. What gets lost underneath the noise is the recognition that we have not done everything we can to fight this problem and that, like all serious ills, we must take incremental steps one at a time, and refuse to be overwhelmed by the big picture. 
   Throughout my tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I called for a multifaceted strategy to combat drug abuse. One of the specific steps I advocated was the creation of 
   incentives to encourage the private sector to develop medicines that treat addiction, an area where promising research has not led--as one would normally expect--to production of medicines. The bill I am introducing today, the New Medicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1999, will hopefully change that. It takes focused aim at one segment of the drug-abusing population--hardcore addicts, namely users of cocaine and heroin--in part because these addicts are so difficult to treat with traditional methods, and in part because this population commits such a large percentage of drug-related crime. 
   In December, 1989, I commissioned a Judiciary Committee report, ``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990's.'' In that report, I posed the question, ``If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find a medical `cure' for this disease?'' The report gave the answer ``No.'' Unfortunately, now a decade later, the answer remains the same. Developing new medicines for the treatment of addiction should be among our highest medical research priorities as a nation. Until we take this modest step, we cannot claim to have done everything reasonable to address the problem, and we should not become so frustrated that we effectively throw up our hands and do nothing. 
   Recent medical advances have increased the possibility of developing medications to treat drug addiction. These advances include a heightened understanding of the physiologist and psychological characteristics of drug addiction and a greater base of neuroscientific research. 
   One example of this promising research is the recent development of a compound that has been proven to immunize laboratory animals against the effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks cocaine from entering the brain. Researchers funded through the National Institute of Drug Abuse believe that this advance may open a whole new avenue for combating addiction. 
   Despite this progress, we still do not have a medication to treat cocaine addiction or drugs to treat many other forms of substance abuse, because the private sector is unsure of the wisdom of making the necessary investment in the production and marketing of such medicines. 
   Privarte industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for a variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties distributing medication to the target population, and fear of being associated with substance abusers. We need to create financial incentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market these treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between private industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active marketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to all addicts in need of treatment. 
   While pharmacotherapies alone are not a ``magic bullet'' that 
   will solve our national substance abuse problem, they have the potential to fill a gap in current treatment regimens. The disease of addiction occurs for many reasons, including a variety of personal problems which pharmaco therapy cannot address. Still, by providing a treatment regimen for drug abusers who are not helped by traditional methods, pharmacotherapy holds substantial promise for reducing the crime and health crisis that drug abuse is causing in the United States. 
   The New Medicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1999 would encourage and support the development of medicines to treat drug addiction in three ways. 
   It reauthorizes and increases funding for Medications Development Program at the National Institute of Health, which for years has been at the forefront of research into drug addition. 
   The bill also creates two new incentives for private sector companies to undertake the difficult but important task of developing medicines to treat addiction. 
   First, the bill would provide additional patient protections for companies that develop drugs to treat substance abuse. Under the bill, pharmacotherapies could be designated `orphan drugs' and qualify for an exclusive seven-year patent to treat specific addiction. These extraordinary patent rights would greatly enhance the market value of pharmacotherapies and provide a financial reward for companies that invest in the search to cure drug addiction. This provision was contained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me in 1990, but was never acted on by Congress. 
   Second, the bill would establish a substantial monetary reward for companies that develop drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addiction but shift the responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to the government. This approach would create a financial incentive for drug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to avoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance abusers. 
   The bill would require the National Academy of Sciences to develop strict guidelines for evaluating whether a drug effectively treats cocaine or heroin addiction. If a drug meets these guidelines and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the government must purchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed it. The purchase rights for the patent rights is established by  law: $100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for a drug to treat heroin addiction. Once the government has purchased the patent rights, then it is responsible for producing the drug and distributing it to clinics, hospitals, state and local governments, and any other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs. 
   This joint public/private endeavor will correct the market inefficiencies that have thus far prevented the development of drugs to treat addiction and require the government to take on the responsibilities that industry is unwilling or unable to perform. 
   America's drug problems is reduced each and every time a drug abuser quits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer hospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies and fewer neglected children. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment options such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. Each dollar we spend on advancing options in this area can save us ten or twenty times as much in years to come. The question isn't ``Can we afford to pursue a pharmacotherapy strategy?'' but rather, ``Can we afford not to?'' 
   Congress has long neglected to adopt measures I have proposed to speed the approval of and encourage greater private sector interest in pharmaco therapy. We cannot let another Congress conclude without rectifying our past negligence on this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting an important, and potentially ground breaking, approach to addressing one of our Nation's most serious domestic challenges.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I want to right a wrong--a small wrong, but a wrong nevertheless. It affects a handful of our diplomats who serve in the world's most dangerous places: Beirut, Bosnia, Kosovo, the unsettled nations of Africa and the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. And unfortunately, as the events of recent weeks prove, the need for Americans--soldiers and diplomats alike--to go in harm's way, is unlikely to abate. 
   Our diplomats, colleagues of those killed last summer in the tragic embassy bombings in Africa, receive an allowance for their service in the most frightening places in the world--a danger allowance. 
   This allowance is not unlike that paid to our military when they are in combat. In fact, in some places, such as Bosnia, where our military and diplomatic personnel serve side by side, both receive a special allowance for their sacrifices. 
   The military justifiably receives this benefit tax-free. But our diplomatic personnel do not. Through an oversight in the Internal Revenue Code, diplomats are taxed on their danger pay, even though they often face similar hardships and dangers. I think that's wrong. 
   I have a bill which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to right this wrong. It affects just a handful of people. But to them it will serve as recognition of the sacrifice they make when they represent the American people in dangerous settings overseas. I urge its quick passage.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this conference report on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. When this so-called ``Ed-Flex'' bill was last before this body, it contained a plan to cut back on the commitment this Congress made last year to help put 100,000 new teachers in our schools. Now that this contentious provision has been removed, I'm pleased this afternoon to support the final passage of this bill and to clear this measure for the President's signature. 
   There's little doubt that education is something that can help set an individual free or consign him or her to a lifetime of uphill battles. And as a Nation, the quality of our educational system can make us a world leader or relegate us to a second-class status. 
   While most education decisions are--and should continue to be--made at the state and local level, the Federal Government has a crucial role to play in helping schools to educate all our children for the high-tech world of the 21st Century. I believe this bill will help us to better reach our goals. 
   All across America, parents, teachers, school boards, students, and policy makers are looking to improve their schools, and the Federal Government has offered help to schools in developing and instituting innovative reforms. In 1994, we took the important step of setting up a demonstration program in six states to allow certain regulations in Federal education programs to be waived if those regulations impede progress on school improvement efforts. We later expanded that demonstration program to twelve states. 
   This legislation we are passing today will allow all states, including Delaware, the same flexibility that was afforded the states in the demonstration program. The Federal dollars will still be spent for the purposes intended, but states will be freed to use the money in the most efficient and creative ways, most responsive to local needs. Importantly, this bill also includes strong provisions to ensure that schools will be held accountable to meet educational goals. 
   In the struggle to improve our education system, this is an important step in promoting new ideas and solutions to better our schools and make the most of our education dollars.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am proud to join today with my colleague, the Senator from Maine, Mrs. SNOWE, in introducing a resolution honoring the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United States and commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the VFW, by declaring September 29, 1999 as Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Day. 
   Since its inception after the Spanish-American War in 1899, the VFW has dedicated itself and its members to improving twentieth century America. The value of the contributions that members of the VFW and its Ladies Auxiliary have made to their communities and to this nation cannot be overstated. After returning home from foreign service during times of war and armed conflict, these men and women have continued to give of themselves to ensure that this nation protects and maintains the democratic ideals upon which it was founded, and that the veterans and their dependents are cared for. From providing services for veterans and their families, to sponsoring community action and charity projects, the VFW strengthens not only its members, but each and every American as well. 
   On a personal note, I have had the unique pleasure of sharing the floor of the United States Senate with several decorated veterans, as well as enjoying the privilege of having several veterans of American conflicts on my own staff. I've also enjoyed the ongoing opportunity of meeting and working with the very patriotic citizens of Delaware whom this resolution honors. Throughout my entire tenure in the United States Senate, the members of Delaware's VFW have been, for me, a continued source of knowledge, insight, and inspiration. 
   Particularly with the members of our armed forces currently serving in the Balkans in mind, whom I just visited, I offer my humble recognition to all of those who have so bravely and selflessly served America in the past. I sincerely trust that my colleagues will join me in acknowledging the courage, the sacrifice, and, frequently, the sheer bravery of our members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, whose contributions to this country will be reaped for generations to come. I want to both demonstrate and convey to them my profound gratitude.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Connecticut for allowing me to proceed. I will be relatively brief. Unfortunately, I think we are going to have an awful lot to say on this issue for some time to come. 
   I thank Senator MCCAIN. Several weeks ago, Senator MCCAIN and I were on one of these national shows talking about this issue, and we spoke to one another after the show. We agreed on three things--and some of my colleagues assembled here on the floor have reached the same conclusions. First, that the President of the United States, if he were to decide to use ground troops, would need congressional authorization. Second, that we and the President should not ever take anything off the table once we are in a war, in order to be able to successfully prosecute that war. And third, that we consider a resolution that talks about the use of ground force. 
   Senator MCCAIN had a better idea. He said, ``JOE, why don't we do a resolution that suggests the President use whatever means are at his disposal in order to meet the objectives that are stated in the resolution?'' So we came back after the recess with the intention of introducing a resolution. We spoke with the Democratic and Republican leadership here in the Senate. We met with the President in a bipartisan group. And we concluded that it was not the time to press for passage of the resolution. But it is time to lay it before the American people and before the Congress. 
   This is a joint resolution. If passed, it would meet the constitutional requirement of the war clause in the U.S. Constitution. That is the equivalent of a declaration of war. 
   From a constitutional standpoint, in order to use ground forces, I am of the view--and I expect my colleagues will be of the view, whether they do or do not support ground forces, now or in the future--that the Congress should be involved in that decision under our Constitution. 
   So speaking for myself, my first and foremost reason for being the original cosponsor of this amendment with my friend, JOHN MCCAIN, is that I believe it is constitutionally required. 
   Second, I believe very strongly that we should not make an international commitment and then withhold the use of any means at our disposal to reach our publicly stated objectives. This resolution will allow us, as a nation and as an alliance, to fulfill our commitments. 
   So I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. We will have disagreements, as you will hear as this debate goes forward, as to whether or not the President and NATO have appropriately prosecuted this action thus far. I am not suggesting that all of us agree. But that will be part of a debate that takes place here on the floor of the Senate. 
   I, for one, do not have the military experience of JOHN MCCAIN; few in America do. I would not attempt to second-guess whether the military has the capacity to accomplish the objectives as stated by NATO solely through the use of air power. 
   There are men on the floor like Senator HAGEL--a war hero himself, a Vietnam veteran--who are better equipped to determine whether or not the military is accurately telling us what they can do. I am prepared to accept for the moment that the military does have that capacity. 
   Thus my sponsorship of this resolution is not for the purpose of making the case that the President and NATO should use ground troops at this moment. Instead, I think the President should be authorized to use those troops, if necessary, in order to prosecute successfully the NATO goals in the Balkans. We must have the flexibility to respond to one of the most serious crises of this century in the Balkans. 
   I just got back from Macedonia and Albania with TED STEVENS and others. I noticed most people in Europe are not using the phrase ``conflict'' anymore; it is a war. This is a war. We should not kid each other about it. This is a war. The fact that there have, thank God, not been any American casualties yet, the fact that ``only'' three Americans have been captured, does not mean this is not a war. This is a war. And to successfully prosecute our aims, people are going to die, including Americans. I think it is almost unbelievable to think that we will meet the objectives stated by NATO without the loss of a single American life. 
   So this is a war, and it is testing Europe and the alliance in a way that we have not faced since the end of World War II. However we choose to label it, this is a war in the Balkans, a war that is being conducted by a war criminal named Slobodan Milosevic, who has caused the greatest human catastrophe in Europe since World War II. At stake are the lives of millions of displaced persons and refugees, the stability of southeastern Europe, and the future of NATO itself. 
   Our goals must be the safe and secure return of all Kosovars to their homes; the withdrawal of all Yugoslav and  Serbian Army, police, and paramilitary forces from Kosovo; and permitting the establishment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, either through a permissive environment or--my phrase--a practically permissible environment, one in which we could go in and the military of Milosevic could not stop us. 
   With the stakes this high, we must give the President the necessary means to achieve our goals. The Constitution, as I said, requires that Congress consider giving such authorization. I have trust and confidence in our military leaders when they say that, at least for the moment, they do not need ground forces to achieve our goals. Nonetheless, they should have the authorization to use all military tools should they conclude otherwise. This resolution would provide that authorization. 
   This resolution also authorizes the President to use other means, which encompasses diplomacy as well as arms. I hope, of course, that a diplomatic solution will be possible without the use of ground forces, but only if the diplomatic solution achieves all of our stated goals. 
   Finally, through this resolution, we are putting Slobodan Milosevic on notice that the United States and NATO allies are deadly serious about doing what it takes to compel him to withdraw his vicious ethnic-cleansers, gang rapists, recently pardoned criminals, ski-masked thugs, and his now corrupted regular army troops from Kosovo. 
   So, let me conclude by saying once again that there will be plenty of time to debate whether or not NATO should have had a full-blown plan on the table for the use of ground forces. I suggest to my colleagues, as I suggested at the NAC in Brussels this past Sunday, that if we had done that, there is overwhelming evidence that several of our allies would not have gone along with even airstrikes. 
   I remind everyone who is listening that the good news is that we are an alliance. The bad news is, we are an alliance. An 
   alliance requires consensus. I respectfully suggest that as hard as it was for the Senators on this floor to convince our colleagues that air power made sense in the first instance, can you imagine what it would have been like if we were standing on the floor today authorizing the President to use all force necessary without 18 other NATO nations agreeing? 
   I respectfully suggest that Democrats and Republicans alike would come to the floor and say: It is not our business alone. We should only do this in conjunction with NATO. 
   So, there is a delicate balancing act, not unlike what Dwight Eisenhower had to deal with in World War II with the French and the British and others. The delicate balancing act involves keeping the alliance together and at the same time not diminishing the capacity to achieve the alliance's ends. 
   The message I would like to see sent to Belgrade today is that America is united, the United States Congress is united, and American citizens are prepared to use whatever force is necessary to stop him. I would also send a message to our allies that we are resolved and we expect them to stay resolved to achieve NATO's stated objectives. If we fail to achieve our stated objectives, I believe that NATO loses its credibility as a credible peacekeeping alternative and a defensive organization in Europe. If that occurs, I believe you will see a repetition of this war in Serbia, in Macedonia, in Albania, in Montenegro, and other parts of the Balkans. 
   Much is at stake. We should not kid the American people. American lives will be lost as this continues. But America's strategic interests and American lives in the long run will be saved if we resolutely pursue the NATO objectives. 
   Mr. President, I again thank my friend from Connecticut. I am proud to join with the Senators on the floor here today, for whom I have deep respect. I realize they have put aside their political considerations in order to pursue this effort. I compliment them for that. 
   I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I and my colleagues--Senators ROTH, KENNEDY, DURBIN, KERRY, HOLLINGS, LANDRIEU, HELMS, STEVENS, SPECTER, THURMOND, DOMENICI, KYL, MURKOWSKI, COCHRAN, CRAIG, ENZI, ABRAHAM, SMITH, COLLINS, VOINOVICH, and DEWINE--are introducing a resolution that seeks long overdue justice for the two commanders at Pearl Harbor fifty-eight years ago, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. 
   Some will ask, ``why now?'' After all, fifty-eight years have passed. I believe it is more important than ever to take this action now. It is not just the simple truth--that there can be no statute of limitations for restoring honor and dignity to men who spent their lives dedicated to serving America and yet, were unfairly treated. It is also because we have brave men and women in the military today who are fighting one of the most professional and precise battles ever seen against a brutal, genocidal dictator in Kosovo. They know that their cause is just. What too many people do not know is the sacrifice and dedication it takes to be able to do their jobs. 
   The tremendous ability of our pilots, our maintainers, and our support crews is a direct result of their commitment to professional excellence and service and their willingness to defend the values Americans cherish. We owe it to them to defend those same values here at home. When it comes to serving truth and justice, the time must always be ``now.'' When it comes to treating people with fairness and honoring their service, the time must always be ``now.'' 
   This is the second year we are bringing a resolution before our colleagues. We cannot give up because it is important that the Senate understand and act to end the injustice done to these fine officers. Ultimately, it is the President who must take action, but it is important that we send the message that the historical truth matters. At Pearl Harbor, these two officers should not bear all of the blame. If they continue to do so, both our nation and our military lose. 
   Today's military is a testament to our ability to confront and learn from our mistakes, but that can only happen if the record is accurate. Admiral Kimmel and General Short served with selfless dedication and honor. They were in command during a devastating surprise attack. They deserved to be treated as officers who used their best judgement to follow the orders they were given and to meet their command responsibilities. Instead, they were made singular scapegoats for that tragedy for fifty-eight years, without full consideration of the circumstances and options available to them. 
   I hope that most of my colleagues will read this resolution. The majority of the text details the historic case on behalf of Admiral Kimmel and General Short and expresses Congress's opinion that both officers performed their duty competently. Most importantly, it requests that the President submit the names of Kimmel and Short to the Senate for posthumous advancement on the retirement lists to their highest held wartime rank. 
   This action would not require any form of compensation. Instead, it would acknowledge, once and for all, that these two officers were not treated fairly by the U.S. government and it would uphold the military tradition that responsible officers take the blame for their failures, not for the failures of others. 
   Before I go into a more detailed review of the historical case, I also want my colleagues to know that this resolution has the support of various veterans groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. The Delaware VFW passed a resolution in support last June and the national VFW passed a resolution in support in last September. 
   Now, let me review what happened. First, I want to discuss the treatment of Kimmel and Short. Like most Americans, Admiral Kimmel and General Short requested a fair and open hearing of their case, a court martial. They were denied their request. After lifetimes of honorable service to this nation and the defense of its values, they were denied the most basic form of justice--a hearing by their peers. 
   Here are some of the historic facts. On December 18, 1941, a mere 11 days after Pearl Harbor, the Roberts Commission was formed to determine whether derelictions of duty or errors of judgement by Kimmel and Short contributed to the success of the Japanese attack. This commission concluded that both commanders had been derelict in their duty and the President ordered the immediate public release of these findings. The Roberts Commission was the only investigative body that found these two officers derelict in their duty. 
   Several facts about the Roberts Commission force us to question its conclusions.  
   First, Kimmel and Short were denied the right to counsel and were not allowed to be present when witnesses were questioned. They were then explicitly told that the Commission was a fact-finding body and would not be passing judgement on their performance. When the findings accusing them of a serious offense were released, they immediately requested a court-martial. That request was refused. 
   It is difficult to imagine a fair review of the evidence given the rules of procedure followed by the Commission. 
   It is also important to note the timing here. It would be difficult to provide a fair hearing in the charged atmosphere immediately following America's entry into the war in the Pacific. In fact, Kimmel and Short were the objects of public vilification. The Commission was not immune to this pressure. One Commission member, for example, Admiral Standley, expressed strong reservations about the Commission's findings, later characterizing them as a ``travesty of justice''. He did sign the Report, however, because of concerns that doing otherwise might adversely affect the war effort. As you will see, the war effort played an important role in how Kimmel and Short were treated. 
   In 1944, an Army Board investigated General Short's actions at Pearl Harbor. The conclusions of that investigation placed blame of General Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army at the time of Pearl Harbor and in 1944. This report was sequestered and kept secret from the public on the groups that it would be detrimental to the war effort. 
   That same year, a Naval Court of Inquiry investigated Admiral Kimmel's actions at Pearl Harbor. The Naval Court's conclusions were divided into two sections in order to protect information indicating that America had the ability to decode and intercept Japanese messages. The first and longer, section therefore, was classified ``top secret''. 
   The second section, was written to be unclassified and completely exonerated Admiral Kimmel and recognized the Admiral Stark bore some of the blame for Pearl Harbor because of his failure to provide Kimmel with critical information available in Washington. Then Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal instructed the Court that it had to classify both sections ``secret'' and not release any findings to the public. 
   The historic record is not flattering to our government. A hastily convened and procedurally flawed Commission released condemning findings to the public, while two thorough military reviews which had opposite conclusions were kept secret. 
   I hope that I have made my point that these officers were not treated fairly and that there is good reason to question where the blame for Pearl Harbor should lie. 
   The whole story was re-evaluated in 1995 at the request of Senator THURMOND by Under Secretary for Defense Edwin Dorn. In his report, Dorn concluded that responsibility for the disaster at Pearl Harbor should be broadly shared. I agree. 
   Where Dorn's conclusions differ from mine and my co-sponsors, is that he also found that he also found that ``the official treatment of Admiral Kimmel and General Short was substantively temperate and procedurally proper.'' I disagree. 
   These officers were publicly vilified and never given a chance to clear their names. If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the truth, then there would be no need for the President to take any action today. But we don't. We live in an open society. Eventually, we are able to declassify documents and evaluate our past based on at least a good portion of the whole story. I believe sincerely that one of our greatest strengths as a nation comes from our ability to honor truth and the lessons of our past. 
   Like many, I accept that there was a real need to protect our intelligence capabilities during the war. What I can not accept, however, is that there is a reason for continuing to deny the culpability of others in Washington at the expense of these two office's reputations fifty-seven years later. Continuing to falsely scapegoat two dedicated and competent officers dishonors the military tradition of taking responsibility for failure. The message that is sent is a travesty to American tradition and honor--that the truth will be suppressed to protect some responsible parties and distorted to sacrifice others. 
   This is not to say that the sponsors of this resolution want to place blame. We are not seeking to place blame in a new quarter. This is not a witch-hunt aimed at those superior officers who were advanced in rank and continued to serve, despite being implicated in the losses at Pearl Harbor. I think the historic record has become quite clear that blame should be shared. 
   The unfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were blamed entirely and forced into early retirement. 
   After the war, in 1947, they were singled out as the only eligible officers from World War II not advanced to their highest held wartime ranks on the retirement lists, under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. By failing to advance them, the government and the Departments of the Navy and Army perpetuate the myth that these two officers bear a unique and disproportionate part of the blame. 
   The government that denied these officers a fair hearing and suppressed findings favorable to their case while releasing hostile information owes them an official apology. That's what this resolution calls for. 
   The last point that I want to make deals with the military situation at Pearl Harbor. It is legitimate to ask whether Admiral Kimmel and General Short, as commanding officers, properly deployed their forces. I think reasonable people may disagree on this point. 
   I have been struck by the number of qualified individuals who believe the commanders properly deployed their assets based on the intelligence available to them. I am including this partial list of flag officers into the RECORD following my statement for my colleagues to review. Among those listed is Vice Admiral Richardson, a distinguished naval commander, who wrote an entire report refuting the conclusions of the Dorn Report. My colleagues will also see the names of four Chiefs of Naval Operations and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer. It was Admiral Moorer who observed that, ``If Nelson and Napoleon had been in command at Pearl Harbor, the results would have been the same.'' 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe this case is unique and demands our attention. As we honor those who served in World War II and who serve today in Kosovo, we must also honor the ideals for which they fought. High among those American ideals is upholding truth and justice. Those ideals give us the strength to admit and, where possible, correct our errors. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and move one step closer to justice for Admiral Kimmel and General Short.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer to the budget resolution would express the Senate's intention to give high priority to embassy security. 
   As was underscored by the tragic embassy bombings in East Africa last August, our embassies overseas are highly vulnerable to terrorist attack. Following the bombings, the Secretary of State ordered a worldwide review of the current security situation. 
   According to testimony provided by the Department of State to the Committee on Foreign Relations, over 80 percent of U.S. embassies and consulates have less than the required 100-foot setback from the street, and many missions are in desperate need of greater security improvements. 
   As required by law, the Secretary also convened ``Accountability Review Boards'' to examine the bombings. The Boards, chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe, concluded that the United States must--  
   undertake a comprehensive and long-term strategy for protecting American officials overseas, including sustained funding for enhanced security measures, for long-term costs for increased security personnel, and for a capital building program based on an assessment of requirements to meet the new range of global terrorist threats. This must include substantial budgetary appropriations of approximately $1.4 billion per year maintained over a ten-year period.....Additional funds for security must be obtained without diverting funds from our major foreign affairs programs.  
   Last fall, Congress provided $1.4 billion in supplemental appropriations to address the security situation. 
   But as the conclusions of the Crowe panels underscored, this was just a down payment. 
   In his budget request, the President requested an additional $300 million in security enhancements in Fiscal Year 2000, and advance appropriations totaling $3 billion from Fiscal 2001 to 2005 for an embassy construction program. I believe this amount is insufficient, a concern echoed by many members of the Committee on Foreign Relations during a hearing held on March 11. 
   We must recognize, as the Crowe panels did, that the kind of money required to enhance embassy security cannot be borne within the current State Department budget. 
   For example, the $1.4 billion in annual spending recommended by the Crowe panels amounts to more than one-third of the operating budget of the Department requested for Fiscal 2000. We are kidding ourselves to suggest that these resources can be found within the existing State Department budget. 
   It should be emphasized that funding for embassy security benefits the entire federal government. Embassies are not merely foreign outposts of the Department of State. They are platforms for the representation of American interests. 
   Everyone should recognize this essential fact: nearly two-thirds of the personnel in our embassies are from departments other than the State Department. They are from all over the government--the Commerce Department, the Agriculture Department, the Department of Defense, even the Federal Aviation Administration. In sum, embassy security is a government-wide imperative, for which the State Department should not bear an undue funding burden. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is this: security costs money, and we cannot pinch pennies. We send our people overseas to do a job. They are on the front lines of our national defense, representing our interests. 
   It is our duty to do that all that we reasonably can to protect them. And if we fail to protect our embassies, the costs will be not just in lives lost. They will be in wars not prevented, in narcotics trafficking unchecked, and in American jobs lost due to trade opportunities unattained. 
   So I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of embassy security as a high priority and support my amendment.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I get confused by this because I think the analyses, although clearly heartfelt and searching, 
   are totally out of proportion. This is Europe, not Asia. This is a place where we fought two world wars, where we got involved in the circumstances based upon the legitimate concern of the spread of communism. This is part of an industrialized world, not where we were in Vietnam. This is not a Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which was clearly open ended. This is closed ended. This is the circumstance. I find it fascinating--all these bad lessons we learned. What is the bad lesson we learned in Bosnia? We stopped bloodshed. We have 7,300 troops there. We have had as many as 365,000 troops in Europe to preserve stability and democracy in Europe for the past 54 years. We have 100,000 troops in Europe right now. We have 100,000 troops who sit there. 
   If, in fact, it is a bad idea, and it is an open-ended commitment to keep troops in Bosnia, to keep the peace with not a single American life having been lost, without the destabilization of the region, without Croatia and Serbia being at war, without a flood of refugees into Germany and into the rest of the area--if that is a bad idea--then we shouldn't even have anybody in all of Europe. This is about stability in Europe. 
   The idea of comparing this to Somalia--a life in Somalia is equally as valuable as a life in Kosovo. But the loss of a life in Somalia and the loss of a life in Kosovo have totally different consequences, in a Machiavellian sense, for the United States interests. If there is chaos in Europe, we have a problem. We are a European power. If, as a consequence of this, there is a flood of refugees into any of the surrounding--let's take Albania. Albania has a Greek population that is a minority population, where there is already a problem. If radicalized Albanian Kosovars are thrown out of Kosovo into Albania radicalizing that society--because, by the way, when they burn down your home, when they kill your mother, when they kneel your child on the ground and put a gun to the back of his head and blow it off, it tends to radicalize you. It tends to have that impact. We are talking about 400,000 to 800,000 refugees. What happens if, in fact, the flood of refugees goes rolling into Macedonia, where you have two-thirds of the population that is Slav, one-third Albanian? Just play out that little scenario for me. What happens in that region? 
   I will not take the time of the Senate to go through the litany of why this clearly is in our interest. But at least let's agree that this isn't anything like Vietnam in terms of our interests--like Africa, or like a whole lot of other places. We have an alliance called NATO. All 19 members of NATO are in agreement that this is necessary. All of Europe is united. All of Europe is united in that we have no choice but to deal with this genocidal maniac. 
   With regard to this notion of a peace agreement that this is designed--my friend from the State of Washington, I  respectfully suggest, misstated the objectives of the administration. The objectives of the administration are the objectives of the rest of Europe--all 19 other nations as well as the contact group, I might add--and the objectives are these: To stop the genocide, stop the ethnic cleansing, stop the routing, stop the elimination of entire villages in Kosovo, to have some guarantee that the civil rights, civil liberties, life and liberty of the people living in that region, 2 million people, are somewhat secure. 
   Why do we do that? Beyond the humanitarian reasons, why we do that is, we know what happens if 
   it spins out of kilter. We know what the downside is if the entire area is engulfed in this chaos. We also know from experience what happened in Bosnia. When we acted, when we put ourselves on the line, when we demonstrated that we would not allow it to ``happen'' again, it worked. 
   My friends say it isn't working in Bosnia, because, if we move through, all of a sudden everything will fly apart. 
   That was the case in most of Europe for 30 years. If we removed the troops in Europe in 1954, or 1958, the concern was all of Germany would go. The concern was all of Europe would go. So we held out. We decided that democracy tends to bring stability. I, for the life of me, do not understand why you can just cut out an entire--I wish I had a map here--segment of Europe and say it can be in flames and chaos, and it has no impact on us; it will have no impact on the alliance; it will have no impact on our national security. That I do not understand. 
   I do agree that this is not an easy choice. I do agree that to know exactly what to do is debatable, legitimately debatable. But I do not agree that the purpose of the administration is, as was stated, to hope to be permitted to send ground troops. 
   The only reason why the proposal that was put forward by 19 NATO nations in Europe was put forward was not because we want to put in ground troops. It was because we wanted a commitment that the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo would stop. I remind everybody, by the way, in 1989 and 1990 their rights were taken away. Their autonomy was stripped. During that first 7-year period, there was a policy of nonviolence on the part of the Kosovars led by a doctor named Rugova. And what happened was what some of us predicted: By failing to stop any of the actions of Milosevic and the ultranationalists in Serbia, one thing was bound to happen. Maybe it is because I am Irish I understand it. I watched it. We watched it historically for 80 years in Ireland. That is, when peaceful means fail and people continue to be cleansed, denied their civil rights and their 
   civil liberties, denied the ability to work, denied the ability to worship, denied the ability to speak their language, they become radicalized. So all of a sudden Rugova found himself odd man out, as the KLA gained credibility and momentum, basically saying: You are not getting it done for us so we are going to use the violent means. 
   What do we think is going to happen if we walk away? The objective is to stop the oppression of men, women and children who are a minority in Serbia, but make up the majority in Kosovo; to say it will stop. The only way it will stop is one of two: Either Mr. Milosevic is denied the means to continue his oppression, or he comes to the table, agrees to stop it, and allows international forces in there to guarantee that he will stop it. 
   That is what this is about. You may not think that is a worthwhile goal. I understand that. I understand that. But this is not about the desire to send troops. It is about the desire to keep that part of the world from spinning out of control. I see two of my colleagues wish to speak so I will cease with the following comment.

   Mr. BIDEN. There is a big difference. The difference is it is in the center of Europe, No. 1. No. 2, if Europe in fact becomes destabilized, we are deeply involved in matters far beyond what is existing now. 
   I acknowledge to my friend, though, what was at stake in the Middle East was oil, was economic security, and was a lot of other things at the time. So it is, in fact, a legitimate point to make that that was a critical vote. I voted against that involvement--I am sure the next point my friend was going to make. I voted against that involvement. I insisted, along with others, there be a resolution to authorize the use of force. 
   But the argument I would make is, although you can argue it made sense to do what we did, it is a different reason why we moved; a different reason why it occurred; a different reason why it was necessary. It seems to me, comparing what we did in the gulf, comparing that to what we do here either for purposes of justifying action here or not justifying action here, is an inappropriate analogy. It stands on its own. It either made sense or it didn't make sense. It turns out it made sense to move in the gulf and I argue it makes sense for us to take this action now in the Balkans. 
   So, if I can conclude so my friend from Kentucky, who has been seeking the floor, can get the floor, Senator NICKLES started off a few moments ago pointing out that seven of us, assigned by the leadership, met to see whether we could work out a compromise resolution. Senator NICKLES pointed out that the resolution that we agreed to move with, assuming the procedural circumstances allowed it to be done, was one that was a straight-up authorization for the use of airpower in conjunction with NATO against Serbia and Mr. Milosevic. That was the language as to how to proceed that was 
   agreed to. 
   Senator NICKLES indicated he would vote against that, notwithstanding the fact that he helped craft what the language would be. And that makes sense, by the way. He was trying to figure out what is the best, simplest, most straightforward way to get an up-or-down vote on what the President wants to do. 
   In the meantime, the President has sent us a letter asking for legislation to be able to do this. He has asked us whether or not we would support the use of airpower in conjunction with NATO. I think we should get, at the appropriate point, an up-or-down vote on that. I understand my friend from Alaska may have an amendment to that resolution, if it ever comes up freestanding, dealing with a prohibition of ground troops, but we should get to the business of dealing with that which we are getting at now. I hope through the leadership of the majority leader we can somehow clear the decks and get to a vote on the resolution.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the intervention by the Senator from Virginia. He is absolutely correct. Let me be even more precise. Seven of us agreed on the vehicle that we recommend to the leadership that we should be voting on. We agreed to that language. I came back with one of my  Democratic colleagues, Senator LEVIN, spoke with the minority leader, and indicated that this is what we had agreed to. He indicated he thought that was an appropriate vehicle, appropriate way to proceed and I might add, some of the Senators in the room, although they agreed to the language, I want to make clear, were not agreeing to the substance of the language. They agreed that this is an appropriate test vote. This is an appropriate vote to determine whether or not the Senate agrees or disagrees with the President. Several of them--one of them at least--said, ``I will not vote for it''; two of them said, ``I will not vote for it but I agree this is how we should decide the issue.'' 
   I understand that the majority leader has to make a judgment as to what vehicle we use, when we use it, how we will use it, but I hope we can get an up-or-down vote on some direct vote.

   I want to be clear. I think the recommendation and the suggestion of the Senator from Alaska, which is consistent with what the Senator from West Virginia and he both said today to the President, is a good idea. I personally am prepared to accept that. 
   I just add one caveat. I need another 3 or 4 minutes to run the traps. I want to make it clear, I accept this. I accept this personally. I think it makes sense. But I have calls in to several of our colleagues as to whether or not, since they were part of this on our side, they will go with this. I am confident. I believe they will. But I just want to be absolutely clear, and I think we should proceed. But I see the Senator from West Virginia who wishes to speak. I think it is a great and significant commitment that he has made with regard to the nonpermissive piece of this. I think it makes sense.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward concurrent resolution, but I think it bears reading again. 
   It says,  
   Authorizing the President of the United States to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
   Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That the President of the United States is authorized to conduct military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).  
   It is straightforward and simple. It is a clear up-or-down vote on whether or not we support the action that is contemplated by the President, that NATO, through its action order--so-called action order--has authorized Solana to call 
   for at his discretion and concurrence with the leaders of the 19 NATO countries. 
   I think we have debated this a lot. There are very strong views on this. I happen to think this is an authority that Congress should be giving the President, but at a minimum I think most of us agree that the President needs to hear from the Congress as to what our position is. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time.

   Mr. BIDEN. My understanding of the objective stated by the President is that his objective is to end the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and the persecution of the Albanian minority population in Kosovo and to maintain security and stability in the Balkans as a consequence of slowing up, stopping, or curtailing the ability of Milosevic and the Serbian VJ and the MUP to be able to go in and cause circumstances which provide for the likelihood of a half-million refugees to destabilize the region. 
   The objective at the end of the day: Hopefully, this will bring Milosevic back to the table. Hopefully, he will agree to what all of NATO said they wanted him to agree to, and hopefully that will occur. In the event that it does not occur, the objective will be to degrade his military capability so significantly that he will not be able to impose his will upon Kosovo, as he is doing now.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. Of the 3 minutes remaining, I yield myself 1 minute, and I ask my friend from Virginia to close on behalf of the proponents. 
   There are a number of Senators who wished to speak today--Senator SPECTER, Senator HAGEL, Senator SMITH. There are a number of people who wanted to speak. In the interest of a limited time, we have been unable to do that. And I apologize for that. 
   But the reason why I think it is appropriate that the Senator from Virginia close the case for us is that no one has been more instrumental in bringing about the ability to vote up or down on this proposal as well as the outline of the proposal. 
   I thank him for his leadership. 
   I yield the remainder of the time under the control of the Senator from Delaware to the Senator from Virginia.

   I point out I was here, too, during the gulf crisis. I recall we were not even going to hold hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. I recall the President said he would not send up a request for authority until it was clear that the Congress was going to revolt. Every President, of the six while I have been here, has been reluctant to do so.

   Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I referenced earlier the significant help and leadership of the Senator from Virginia, but what I did not mention was the person who carried the ball on this side of the aisle, the Senator from Michigan, Senator LEVIN. 
   You know that old expression, success has a thousand fathers and mothers and failure is an orphan. Hopefully, I am not going to be praising him and others and it turns out that what we have done tonight is a mistake. I think it is not a mistake. I think it is necessary. I think it is going to make for the possibility of some peace in the region. 
   I want to tell the Senator from Michigan how much a pleasure it is to work with him. I mean with him. As my grandfather used to say, he is the horse that carried the sleigh. He is the guy who maneuvered us through all this to get to the resolution. I personally thank him and tell him how much I enjoyed working with him.

   Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I concur with the Senator from Idaho on that score. I want to say just one more thing. This was a very difficult vote, and I echo the words that were stated by several people here. On these matters--and I give credit to Senator NICKLES, who is the No. 2 man on the Republican side--when we were negotiating, I asked him how many votes are for this. He said, ``I did not whip this.'' In our jargon, we know that to mean: ``I did not go out and count votes. This is not a partisan matter. This is something that should be left to the conscience of each Senator.'' 
   The fact of the matter is, when my colleagues came up to me before the vote started and said, ``How many votes do you have?'' I said to them, ``I did not do it.'' 
   I did not know how many votes were here for this resolution, but I thought it was important that the Senate go on record exercising its responsibility in this area. I do not think the President has the authority to use force in this nature without our approval, a concurrent resolution, or any statement by us, assuming the House makes a similar statement, and meets the constitutional criteria that he has the authority. 
   But again I want to make it clear that I respect those who voted against it. There are very strong reasons to vote no. I think the reasons to vote yes are stronger. And no one, particularly the Senator from Delaware, can tell this Senate where this action is going to lead. It is a very tough call. 
   I am confident, in my view, that there is more of a danger in not acting than in acting, both constitutionally and practically. But I just want the record to reflect that everyone in this debate, including the discussion at the White House--the Presiding Officer is younger than the Senator from Delaware, as is the Senator from Louisiana, who is on the floor, is younger than the Senator from Delaware. I came here in 1973 as a Senator. I was 29 years old. 
   I remember one of the things that I resented the most keenly was that at the time, for those of us who opposed the Vietnam war, at least in some quarters on this floor, and at times with the then-sitting President, we were told we were giving, by our opposition, this great deal of help to the  North Vietnamese; we were hurting our troops who were overseas; we were basically un-American for objecting to the war. 
   One of the generational changes that has taken place--I want the record to show this--sitting with a number of Senators and Congresspersons--I am guessing the number at 20--in the private residence this morning, the President of the United States said to us assembled he wanted to make one thing clear, that he respected the Congress voting. He knew some who opposed were going to be told that Milosevic is listening and he is going to take some confidence from this; he is going to somehow be emboldened by the opposition. 
   He said, ``I want you to know I think you have an absolute right and obligation, if you believe that way, to object. I will never be one who will tell you that, notwithstanding he is watching this on CNN in Belgrade, that somehow you're undermining our effort. Were we to apply that standard,'' he said, ``we would never be able to debate in this society the important issues.'' 
   So the reason I mention that is not to give particular credit to the President, although in this case he deserves it, but he came from that same generation. I think we have moved to a position here where we have debated, in the last several years, the major contentious issues relating to our peace and security, and that when the debate has been finished, when it has gone on, it has been cordial and it has not been partisan. 
   When it has been finished, there has been unanimity and support of American forces. The same occurred in the gulf. After the gulf, many of us voted no. I was one who voted no. And at the end of the day, we all said, once the Senate spoke, once the President spoke, once the Congress spoke, we would stay the course. 
   So I thank my friend from Idaho who was in opposition, my friend, the Presiding Officer, who had a different view on this to tell you. And I am not being solicitous. It is important for the American people to know we 
   do not always disagree based on our partisan instincts here. 
   The judgments made by every Senator on this floor today were made with their intellect and their heart, on the direction that they thought was in the best interest of the country. I think the right outcome occurred, but I do not in any way--in any way--question the motivation, or am I so certain of my own position that I would be willing to guarantee either of my colleagues that they are wrong. I think they were wrong. I think I am right. But we are approaching this in the way we should, openly and in a nonpartisan way. I want to thank the Republican leadership for proceeding this way and thank my colleagues for the way in which we conducted this debate earlier. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. 
   I want to begin by saying to Senator HUTCHISON, I think she is performing a valuable service. This debate needs to be undertaken. She and I have had very different views on the Balkans from the very outset. She, along with a majority of my colleagues, 3, 4, 5, 6 years ago, told me that bombing would not work in Bosnia and we should not be involved in Bosnia and they asked, ``Why are we getting involved?'' They were legitimate, real questions. And she could have turned out to be as right, though I think she and others have proved to be wrong. 
   No one knew then. I could not answer some of those questions then. I could not answer in 1992, when I came back from Bosnia and there was the report about what was happening in death camps, about the support of Milosevic across the Drina, with the VJ involved with the Serbs in Bosnia. I could not prove or convince people that there were massive massacres that had taken place and would be taking place. I could not convince anyone--either NATO or the President initially--that the longer we waited, the more the situation would deteriorate, and the harder it would be to put back together. 
   But the question I was always asked then is the one I am asked now as a vocal supporter of using force, along with NATO, to bomb Milosevic; and that is, people say to me now, ``Well, BIDEN, tell me what the last step is. You tell me the first step now. Tell me what the last step is. You've got to have an end game here, BIDEN. If you're talking to the President of committing to a lift-and-strike policy in Bosnia''--that was 6 years ago, or more than that now, 7 years ago--``you've got to be able to tell us, if you lift the embargo and you engage in airstrikes, what happens?'' 
   The following are the contingencies--if you list them, they are all reasonable questions. 
   I say to my friend, the Presiding Officer and former Governor of Ohio, the truth of the matter is the world has changed so fundamentally that this calculus of what the last step will be is no longer relevant, especially if we try to answer it before the first step is taken. It leads to a policy of paralysis. 
   I remember arguing then with a man I had great admiration for then and do now, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell. I remember him making the argument that unless we could submit front-end to put 300,000 troops in Bosnia, then we shouldn't put anybody in there. My argument was then and it is now that that thinking is an absolute policy for paralysis. I guarantee you that the world we are entering in the 21st century doesn't lend itself to that kind of calculus. 
   When there were two superpowers and we decided whether or not to go into Czechoslovakia when the Prague Spring was crushed, or when we decided whether or not we were going to invade the counteroffensive in Hungary when the Russian tanks rolled in, the calculus then was pretty clear. We could say if we responded, then there was a likely probability the Soviet Union would respond to our response, and there would be a likely possibility this would lead to World War III. 
   It was a reasonable calculus. We could do a cost-benefit analysis and ask if the cost of involvement was worth the possible payoff. And we do this balance, this calculus. We did this under Democrats and Republicans for 50 years and did it pretty darn well. Indeed, we won the cold war. 
   We are dealing with a different world now. We are not dealing with a group of people who are essentially cautious, who are part of a great empire, and who had scores of divisions along the Fulda Gap ready to roll into Western Europe if, in fact, war broke out. We are dealing now with a group of tin-armed dictators--malevolent, dangerous dictators. 
   In Iraq we are dealing with a man named Saddam Hussein. I heard when I urged, along with others, that we should bomb Saddam Hussein, ``If you bomb Saddam Hussein, what is the second, third, fourth and fifth step you are likely to take?'' We couldn't say then because these guys don't operate under the same rational basis that we do. They are cunning. They are smart. But they have fewer cards to play, and their cards are less obvious. 
   I approach things a little differently these days. I have been a Senator for 27 years, and I have been involved in foreign policy, deeply involved, for the bulk of that time here. I approach it this way now: Do we know what will happen if there is inaction? What happens if we don't act? 
   In Iraq, if we don't act, we know for certain Saddam Hussein acquires weapons of mass destruction. We know this because he has used poison gas before. We know he has used chemical weapons. We know he has invaded other  countries. We know that he has been willing to sacrifice tens of thousands of his people in a war with Iran. So we know where this guy is likely to go if we do nothing. 
   We have a different calculus now. In a superpower world, the calculus involved fairly cautious actors. We did not have Russian troops invading Latin America. We did not have Russian troops, in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis, storming into Cuba. We did not have Russians looking for opportunities to have a Russian soldier confronting an American soldier. It was a pretty cautious group of folks we dealt with. Dangerous, bad, an evil empire, but pretty cautious. 
   How about today? What is the downside of not acting? I will argue in a moment that it is immense. It is immense and it is clear, as clear as anything you can prognosticate in international affairs. 
   We must remember that we are a European power. Whenever I am asked why we would consider keeping 4,000-7,000 troops in Bosnia to protect 100,000 people from being massacred, I respond by saying that for 54 years we have kept as many as 365,000 troops in Europe 
   to prevent the subjugation of people. We now have 100,000 soldiers currently deployed in that theater. Why is the idea of using 2,000-4,000 of them to keep people of Kosovo from being subjugated and massacred such a radical intellectual breakthrough? 
   Were the United States of America not deeply involved in the affairs of Europe, how many in this Chamber think Europe would be able to avoid the instability that has characterized it for 300 years? Who is going to step to the fore? France? England? Germany? They are all great nations, all great allies, but they suffer from disabilities we do not. They have lived on the continent for an eternity. They have old and deep animosities and differences and allegiances. All of Europe has a history of dealing with Serbs and Moslems, Albanians, Kosovars, Bosniacs, Croats, and it affects significantly their latitude. 
   What might happen were America to leave? Ask the French whether they would like to see us pull up stakes and leave Europe, bring the boys and the women home. Ask anyone who has spent a lot of time dealing with European affairs what happens if the United States disengages. 
   As a student of history and a participant in history, I ask whether America has ever been able to keep its distance from an unstable Europe. Lucky Lindbergh thought it was a good idea. A lot of other people who were more deeply involved in the conduct of foreign affairs thought it was a good idea. This questions represents an historic isolationism versus internationalism debate we have had in this country for over 200 years. Internationalists are characterized as adventuresome by their critics, and isolationists are characterized as narrow and self-interested by their critics. 
   But it is a healthy, long-term debate. 
   My friend asks whether or not I would be happy to yield for questions. I am always happy to yield for questions from the Senator from Pennsylvania. I am not always able to answer them, but if he has a question, I am happy to yield.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond. 
   I think the Senator and I agree that there has hardly been any public knowledge or discussion of Kosovo. One of the reasons I am speaking on this matter is that I feel obliged to lay out the background on this issue: what is going on, what is at stake, why we must act, and the consequences of our action. I agree with what is implicit in the Senator's question: The American public has not been given sufficient facts to allow them to be informed as to whether or not the course of action the President wants to take is, in fact, wise. 
   I was telling my staff as I walked over here that, this weekend, I came out of a 5 o'clock mass, and a friend of mine--a very informed fellow, who is, I think, a supporter--pulled me aside on the steps of the church and said, ``JOE, look, you may be right, and I tend to trust your judgment in foreign policy; but I have tried my best to read everything I could.'' I listened, and he used this phrase: ``I listen to MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour every night, and I am waiting to hear somebody explain to me this deal in Kosovo. I know you spent a lot of time, JOE, on the Bosnia thing, but isn't this different? Explain it to me.'' 
   Then, the Wednesday before, I was at a St. Patrick's Day function where we raised money for a fund in the name of a deceased mayor, and a very intelligent fellow, a graduate of Annapolis named Healy, a premiere builder in our State, said, ``JOE, I'm a Republican''--I hope I am not going to get him in trouble--``but I've been liking you for a while. JOE, for God's sake, don't go down this bombing route.'' Then I started to explain some things to him and didn't change his mind, but he said, ``I didn't know that.'' 
   These are two illustrations, and I think you could probably canvas the gallery here and ask them how much they have heard about Kosovo and what do they know, and whether they believe what we are apparently about to undertake makes any sense. The very sure answer to your short question is that, no, the public is not sufficiently informed. 
   At our recent meeting at the White House, you will recall that I, and I think the Senator from Pennsylvania and others, stood up repeatedly and said, ``Mr. President, ultimately, you must educate the public.'' The President told us that in his first news conference he was going to lead with Kosovo. 
   But I have said to him and to the national security adviser, as well, that I believe the President has to address the Nation. I think the President should go on television at prime time, and 
   take a half hour and literally, with a map and a pointer, sit there and say: This is Kosovo, this is why it is important, this is what happens if we don't act. When we act, if we do, we think we will bring about the following result. American forces probably will be killed, but possibly not. None were in Bosnia, but this is a much more sophisticated air defense system in possession of the VJ. They are much more sophisticated militarily than we faced anywhere with a bombing campaign in Bosnia, and it is possible that American forces will be hurt.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond by saying two things. I will answer the second part of his question first, which is very easy. Clearly, his hand would be strengthened if he had one. 
   Second, the first part of the question: Would President support it? 
   I also said in my statement to the President and our colleagues that I believe the Congress should--should--be confronted with a specific piece of legislation authorizing the use of force. I think it is constitutionally wise and politically necessary that be done. 
   Mr. President, such a congressional vote will spark the very debate on this floor that I think is needed to further inform the American public about what is at stake. 
   By the way, I called the White House after we had our meeting with the President and reiterated that I hoped he would send up a resolution. He did not. So I wrote one. I was prepared to attempt to amend Senator HUTCHISON's amendment. But, in the meantime, as is his prerogative, the majority leader came in and offered a second-degree amendment to Senator HUTCHISON's. So I now have no ability to amend her amendment. 
   I am told that we are going to vote on cloture. If we get cloture--and I hope we will get cloture--then there will be an up-or-down vote on the Lott-Smith amendment. That amendment says that the President can't take any action in Yugoslavia until funds are authorized. I would prefer having an up-or-down vote on that notion. 
   My resolution says, ``The President is authorized to use the United States Armed Forces for the purposes of conducting air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, pursuant to a decision of the North Atlantic Council Treaty Organization in order to achieve the objectives in section 2.'' 
   Through my resolution, I want us to step right up to our constitutional task of deciding whether or not to authorize the use of force. 
   I am the guy, by the way, who, in a very contentious meeting with President Bush, insisted that we have hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee on a resolution for the use of force in the Persian Gulf war. I believe that is a congressional prerogative. 
   One might argue that the President doesn't need congressional authorization. I think he does. In my view, a President is always better equipped and better advised to go into a risky operation if the American people know what is at stake. 
   My experience, Mr. President, is that Senators and Congressmen do not like to be counted. Keep in mind that I have been here for six Presidents. We in Congress don't like to be counted on issues of war and peace--Democrats or Republicans--because if, in fact, the risky business the President wishes to undertake succeeds, we all want to be able to say, ``Good idea, Mr. President. I was with you.'' If it fails, Congress wants the luxury of saying, ``I told him. He never should have done that. Bad idea.'' 
   I came out of the so-called Vietnam war generation. The only thing most everybody in my generation can agree on is that a foreign policy of this great nation cannot be sustained very long without the informed consent of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me be precise. It is legally permissible but unwise. Let me explain what I mean. 
   I think the reason for the cloture vote is not because the majority leader expects anyone to filibuster. It is a tool  that he has learned and has sharpened and honed very well to gain control and maintain control of the agenda and provide for the inability of anyone to amend whatever he wishes us to vote on. That is what this is about. 
   This has nothing to do with anyone filibustering. Indeed, I have not heard a single person suggest a filibuster. It has to do with the leader using, skillfully, as he does, the tools to be able to control the agenda of the Senate and determine what we will vote on, how long we will debate, and if we will debate. 
   If the Lott-Smith amendment prevails and is attached to the supplemental, I predict that the entire supplemental will fail. If that happens we will never have any action on Kosovo or the supplemental for the near term. That is my guess. 
   There is some confusion in the House, because they thought, as the President thought, that there would be an agreement between the Kosovars and the Serbs as a consequence of the meetings in France. They concluded that they should debate whether or not we would place American forces on the ground, as offered by the President, if there was a peace agreement. 
   But there is no peace agreement. So someone introduced an amendment--a freestanding bill on the House side--thinking they could pass a prohibition on the use of any American forces to implement any peace agreement signed. That was voted down. 
   Again, the public and a lot of our colleagues are not adequately informed on this. The headlines when the House voted were: House Supports Use of American Forces In Kosovo. That is not quite true. The House said it would permit a deployment in a permissive environment. 
   Now we are going to vote in the Senate on something completely different, something that may produce a very ambiguous result. The Lott-Smith amendment bars all funding for the purpose of conducting military operations by Armed Forces of the United States in Serbia and Montenegro. 
   What does that mean? Does that mean that, under our Constitution, if this passes with the supermajority necessary to overcome a sure presidential veto, that airstrikes are not permissible because bombs cost money and they are going to be dropped on parts of Serbia? I suspect it does. Rather than take such an ambiguous vote, we should not shirk our responsibility here.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, you can tell the Senator from Pennsylvania and I are friends because I am happy to have his extended questions, because his questions always shed light on the subject. 
   I agree with everything he said so far. Let me be specific. When there is a Republican President, the Republicans argue the President doesn't need congressional authority. When there is a Democratic President, all of a sudden the Democrats support the President's unilateral war-making power. 
   Let me give you the argument that could be made by scholars as to why the President has the constitutional authority to act absent our approval. 
   They would argue that our actions in Kosovo are not an act of war. But as the Senator knows, the war clause does not require an act of war; it requires a use of force, a use of force that constitutes an offensive action. 
   They would argue that this is defensive in nature. Presidents do that all the time. Remember why President Reagan invaded Grenada. To save medical students. That was the reason. That was the thin reed upon which he held his entire rationale, because everyone acknowledges that if it is an emergency or it is to defend American citizens and their property, it could be done. 
   In Kosovo, the argument could be made that there are U.S. personnel on the ground who would be in harm's way. If we do not take action, the roughly 40,000 Serbian troops near Pristina could threaten the small number of American forces in Macedonia. I can picture the argument being put together by the President's legal counsel. Because the Americans forces in Macedonia are now in jeopardy, there was a requirement to act to save them. 
   There also could be an argument made that airpower would be used for the purpose of protecting American personnel in Belgrade. The President could argue that Milosevic, with a long history of genocidal acts and acts of brutality, is about to move on American personnel. That is the nature of the argument that could be made. 
   There is also an argument, which I think is totally specious, that this qualifies as an emergency. The Founding Fathers, in this Senator's view, clearly contemplated emergency situations where the President would have to use force. That is why they gave Congress the power to ``declare'' war rather than ``make'' war. They did not want to tie the President's hands in the context of an emergency. 
   Another argument being made, which is not accurate but is made all the time by people justifying Presidential action in an area of making war or using force, is that there are 200 years of precedent. They will list hundreds of times where American forces were used without prior congressional authorization. It is a specious argument, in my view, but it is one that has credibility only as a consequence of its repetition. That is the other argument that will be used.  
   People will cite Libya. Did the President have a right to go in? I found Senator HUTCHISON's rendition of history fascinating, because her memory of Reagan and my memory of Reagan were fundamentally different. I don't mean it critically. I mean it factually. She said Reagan never put American forces in harm's way. Well, hell, they flew all the way from England, all the way across the Iberian Peninsula, and bombed the living devil out of Libya. Was that a declaration of war? Most Senators said it basically worked. It cowed the Libyan dictator for a while, and no American got hurt. 
   I cite that not to be critical of anything President Reagan did, but to point out that we often hear the precedence argument used. They say the Congress didn't do anything then. Therefore, that makes it constitutional. Yet there is a seamless fabric to the Constitution. Action, no matter how often repeated, cannot make an unconstitutional undertaking constitutional. That argument has been put forward by this administration and at least six other Presidents. 
   I might point out that the Lott proposal, the very thing we are going to vote on, may also be unconstitutional. It bars Defense Department funds for the purpose of conducting military operations by the Armed Forces of the United States. The only exceptions to the funding restrictions are (1) intelligence activities, including surveillance; (2) the provision of logistics support; and (3) any measure necessary to defend U.S. Armed Forces against immediate threat. Note that this third exception would give the President the excuse I just mentioned. 
   So the Lott proposal is flawed in two respects. First, as a constitutional matter, it is unnecessary. The Constitution already bars offensive military action by the President unless it is congressionally authorized. If Congress adopts the Lott amendment, it would imply that the President has carte blanche to take offensive action anywhere unless Congress makes a specific statement to the contrary. 
   We are telling the President he can't do something that the 
   Constitution already says he can't do. Then we build in exceptions, exceptions that give him authority beyond what, in my view and the view of most constitutional scholars, he is entitled to as a matter of constitutional law. 
   Let me repeat the exceptions he builds. The amendment provides for providing intelligence activities. As the Senator knows, that can involve U.S. personnel. They may be all sitting up in Rhein-Main Air Force Base, or sitting in Italy. They may be on AWACS aircraft at a distance that can't be shot down. I do not know. It also could include spotters. It can include people on the ground. It could include U.S. military aircraft flying in Kosovo airspace, but not participating in the actual strikes. 
   Secondly, it provides for a provision of logistical support. That could include logistical support in the theater. If I were the President's lawyer on this one, I would say, Mr. President, don't worry about this sucker passing. You are OK. You can work this one out. You don't have to fight Congress on whether using force is constitutional. With this amendment, you can do what you want. 
   Thirdly, it excludes any measure necessary to defend forces against an immediate threat. Well, I guarantee you the argument will be made that once NATO decides to move, all those forces in Macedonia are in harm's way. Not only there, but American forces a little bit across the Drina River in Bosnia would also be in harm's way. 
   I guarantee you that the argument will be made, if this were to become law, that the Lott amendment gives the President the authority to bomb and use force.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would be delighted to do that, but I want to warn anybody who comes to the floor, I came to the floor to deliver what I thought to be, if not enlightened, a comprehensive rationale for why I think we should act. I am happy to stay here as long as possible, and I am happy to delay giving that speech, but as long as the Senator realizes that when we finish our discussion, it is going to take me 20 to 25 minutes to deliver this speech.  
   One of the arguments here that no one has laid out sufficiently--I am not sure I am capable of it--is why we should do what the President is seeking to do, why we should do what NATO has voted to do, and why we should be either for or against doing that. 
   We did discuss here a very important subject about whether or not it is constitutionally permissible to use force absent congressional consent. 
   All I am suggesting is that the President and those of us who support the use of airpower in conjunction with NATO should lay out why that action is in America's interest. What are the costs, what are the risks, what are the benefits, and why should we do it? Those who disagree with our position should lay out in one place, where people can go to the RECORD, why they think we should not do that. There are legitimate arguments in opposition beyond the constitutional arguments in opposition to the use of force in Kosovo. 
   As long as the Senator understands that, I am happy to yield for questions. I do not want to keep him here to have to listen to my speech. When we conclude this colloquy, if I do not lose the floor, I will be delivering that speech. 
   I am happy to yield for a question.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's question, for technical purposes, I agree with him 100 percent. I am an admirer of the Senator from Virginia, in no small part because he was in combat, because he was in the military and because he knows, I suspect, what it feels like sitting there, figuratively speaking, strapped in waiting for an order. 
   I am always very reluctant to argue a position that may get somebody killed, may get somebody maimed, may get someone put in a prison camp. And men like Senator KERREY, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, and Senator MCCAIN, who argued against my position for years on Bosnia--not Kosovo; Bosnia--when men who are brave like that, men like DANNY INOUYE, Senator CHAFEE, and Senator HOLLINGS, my seatmate, when they have questions about this, I take it very, very seriously.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I did not mean to misrepresent. I have great respect for the Senator. I know he was Secretary of the Navy. He also is more informed in a personal sense about this--not, I am reluctant to say, not the issue; I think I am as informed as he is, or quite frankly, as anybody on the floor--but in terms of all that goes into a young man's or woman's head as they are about to take off the deck of that carrier or off that piece of concrete, or whatever the mission. 
   But let me suggest that I will lay out for you why I personally am willing to do something that I am not happy about doing; and that is, vote to support asking the brave young women and men of our military, in this case the fliers--Navy, Marine, Air Force--to risk their lives. And it is a real risk. There is a probability someone is going to get hurt.

   Mr. BIDEN. Thank you. 
   Mr. President, let me begin my more formal remarks by referring to the concluding remarks I made on this floor on October 14, 1998, immediately after the agreement between Ambassador Holbrooke and the President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, was made public. 
   I said at that time:  
   [W]e must never again allow racist thugs like Milosevic to carry out their outrages while the alliance dawdles.  
   Referring to the just concluded agreement, I further stated:  
   [W]e must brook no more opposition from Milosevic on its implementation. To use a domestic American term, we must adopt a policy of ``zero tolerance'' with [this] Yugoslav bully. 
   Many of us had hoped that the mistakes that enabled the Bosnian horrors to take place would teach us a lesson. 
   Unfortunately, we have repeated many of those errors and have thereby allowed Milosevic and his storm troopers to repeat their atrocities in Kosovo. 
   Twice is enough. There must not be a third time.  
   I do not cite that to suggest any air of erudition, Mr. President. I cite that to say my position--right or wrong--has been consistent since the day this agreement has been signed. 
   Mr. President, from the bottom of my heart, I regret to report that there has been a third time. There have been more massacres, have been violations of the agreement, and both the massacres and the violations are continuing as we speak; indeed, as I speak at this moment. Let's look at the disgraceful record. 
   Everybody forgets that we are operating in the context of Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, an agreement that has been signed on by our allies and our friends. The President has been saying for the last month and a half that if Milosevic does not sign on to an agreement, assuming that the Kosovars do sign on, we will bomb. For an unusual thing, NATO already acted. NATO got together and debated this issue. And NATO members all voted unanimously to use airpower if in fact one side or the other did not--did not--agree. So what happened here is, there is an agreement. The context of this whole debate is that agreement in 1998. 
   Immediately following the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, machinery was set in place to prevent a recurrence of massacres that had already occurred in Kosovo and in Bosnia the previous years and to move toward an interim agreement on the future status of Kosovo. 
   On October 25, 1998, the Yugoslav Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization fleshed out the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, authorizing exact numbers--exact numbers--of troops, the so-called VJ, and Serbian Interior Police, so-called MUPs, who are a bunch of thugs, would  be able to be in Kosovo province. The agreement also specified the garrisons to which they were to be restricted. 
   That was signed by NATO and Milosevic, and a cease-fire took effect, monitored by unarmed NATO aircraft, and international compliance verifiers were allowed into Kosovo. 
   Like his ideological model earlier in this century, Milosevic has treated most of this agreement as a ``scrap of paper.'' The Yugoslav Government has flagrantly violated the limits stipulated in the October agreement. Rather than the 12,500 regular army troops and the 6,500 special police called for--a total of 19,000--there are presently 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers and Serbian special police forces in the province of Kosovo, in clear violation of the agreement. 
   As for the cease-fire called for--it is a total joke. Milosevic was afraid to refuse entry of the international verifiers or to shoot down NATO planes. So as a result, we have a documented ongoing pattern of warfare, both against units of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but especially against Kosovar civilians. 
   There have been countless massacres, but the most widely publicized one was perpetrated by the Serbs on January 15, 1999, in the village of Racak. There 45 Kosovar Albanian civilians--women and children--were slaughtered. The Serbs, of course, asserted that they all had been KLA fighters who had either been killed in combat or shot while fleeing. 
   Unfortunately for the Serbs, a Finnish-led team of forensic experts that examined the bodies reported unequivocally that the victims had been forced to kneel and had been executed by being riddled with small-arms fire. 
   They got down on their knees. These bullet wounds were in the back of their heads. They were executed, just like they did in Bosnia, just like Hitler did in World War II. 
   Just yesterday, Mr. President, 10 Kosovars were massacred by Serbs in the village of Srbica. During the past 10 days, the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian special forces have gone on the offensive, seizing the high ground above roads and railroads, moving in their most modern weaponry, including M-72 and M-84 tanks, and conducting a search and destroy mission against Kosovar villages suspected of harboring KLA sympathizers. 
   The net result is a new flood of refugees so great that their number is now approaching 450,000--450,000 the number reached last fall. 
   I might remind my colleagues, the only difference was, last fall when it reached that number, folks were able to flee to the mountains because they were not full of snow, they were able to hide. One of the reasons for the urgency that was being argued in the negotiations by Mr. Holbrooke was--and we all seem to agree--was that winter was coming and all these folks would die. Well, it is winter there now. 
   Mr. President, the tragic events of Kosovo have a clear historical causality which I will summarize now. Kosovo is considered by Serbs to be the heartland of their civilization. There, in the year 1389, on the so-called Blackbirds Field near present-day Pristina, the medieval Serbian knights were defeated by the Ottoman Turks, which led to more than five centuries of Turkish domination of the Balkans. 
   It was a courageous fight. They saved Christianity and the rest of Europe, but the bottom line was, they lost. And the bottom line was that the Balkans for 500 years were dominated by Turkey and many parts became Moslem. 
   The Albanians, however, also claim Kosovo as their own and, in fact, can trace their habitation there even further back than the south Slavs, the Serbs. 
   As a result of the policies of the Communist dictator of the former Yugoslavia, Marshal Tito--whom I had the interesting pleasure of having lunch with in his private residence in Split, Yugoslavia, with now deceased Ambassador Averell Harriman, one of the most interesting encounters I ever had in my career--the former Yugoslavian dictator, Marshal Tito. 
   In 1974, the Kosovar Albanians were granted the status of an autonomous region within the Republic of Serbia because of this history. Basically, the Albanians were allowed local control, while border security and foreign relations remained under the control of Belgrade. In the next 15 years, the percentage of Serbs in the Kosovo population dropped from approximately one-quarter to less than one-tenth. At the time this agreement was reached--this autonomy was granted by Tito in 1974--one out of four people living in the province of Kosovo were Serbs; three out of four were Albanians living within Serbia. They were basically Moslem, and the others were Orthodox Christians. Since that time, it has become 10-1; only 1 in 10 are Serbs. 
   Now, this has occurred for several reasons: A much higher birth rate among the Kosovar Albanians than among local Serbs; ``buyouts'' of many Serbian homesteads by Kosovars, some of whom earned hard currency abroad; and some harassment of Serbs by Kosovars, although nothing approaching the ethnic cleansing that is now being carried out by the Serbs. 
   Meanwhile, in Serbia proper, an ambitious young Communist politician named Slobodan Milosevic engineered a coup against the communist leadership of Serbia. He needed a vehicle to consolidate his power, and the time-honored vehicle used by most rogues is rabid nationalism. He needed to be able to spread his newly consolidated power to the Serb-inhabited regions of Yugoslavia outside of Serbia. So in a famous speech in 1989--he would have done proud any demagogue who has ever arrived on the political scene, and I am not referring to anyone here, I am referring to those folks who don't make it usually--in 1989, on the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Blackbirds Field, to which I earlier referred, Milosevic traveled to Kosovo and delivered a rabble-rousing speech in which he promised that no Serb would ever be pushed around by anyone again anywhere in the world, notwithstanding the fact that it was a hard case to make that that was happening. 
   On March 23, 1989, without the consent of the people of Kosovo, Milosevic amended the Constitution of Yugoslavia, revoking the autonomous status that they had had for roughly the past 15 years. 
   The following year, the parliament and the government of Kosovo were abolished by further unlawful amendments to the Constitution of Yugoslavia. 
   A thoroughgoing purge of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo followed. Thousands of hard-working citizens were summarily fired from their civil service positions, and the Serbian Government denied funding to basic institutions of Kosovo society. 
   It is absolutely necessary to note the reaction of the Kosovars to these massive violations of their human and civil 
   rights. What was that reaction initially? Under the leadership of Dr. Rugova, the Kosovars--and he is a Kosovar--the Kosovars set up a parallel, unofficial system of governance. They set up schools, hospitals, and other institutions that make society run. Mr. President, under Dr. Rugova's leadership, the Kosovars held to a policy of nonviolence for nearly seven years. I do not know any other example elsewhere of such self-restraint anywhere in recent years. 
   The United States recognized that Kosovo was a tinderbox that could explode at any time. For that reason, former President George Bush sent a warning to Mr. Milosevic at Christmas 1992, the so-called Christmas warning. Keep in mind, the Kosovars had not used violence; they were still peacefully trying to piece together their society. On Christmas of 1992, the three Senators in this Chamber at the moment were all here at the time--not in the Chamber--and President Bush, a Republican President, issued the Christmas warning that said the United States was prepared to intervene militarily if Serbia attacked the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

   Mr. BIDEN. As a matter of fact, I am about to come to that quote. 
   President Bush's warning was contained in a letter delivered to Milosevic and General Panic, the commander of the Yugoslavian Army. The New York Times and the Associated  Press quoted Bush's letter as saying: ``In the event of conflict in Kosovo caused by Serbian action, the United States will be prepared to employ military force against the Serbians in Kosovo and in Serbia proper. 
   Let me read it again: ``In the event of conflict in Kosovo caused by Serbian action, the United States will be prepared to employ military force against the Serbians in Kosovo and in Serbia proper.'' 
   Perhaps because of this Christmas warning, Milosevic refrained from an all-out military assault on the Kosovars, 
   contenting himself with the legal repression that I described earlier. 
   The Kosovars waited in vain for the West to help. They hoped that their plight would be placed on the agenda of the Dayton peace negotiations in November of 1995, but having been warned by Milosevic that he would walk out if Kosovo were brought up, the West, under this President, President Clinton, and our NATO allies, restricted the talks to Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
   So, finally, in late 1996, armed Kosovar resistance began on a small scale under the loosely organized Kosovo Liberation Army, abbreviated UCK in Albanian, but as KLA in the West. Gradually, the KLA escalated to larger attacks by February of 1998. Let me review the bidding again here, and I will get the letter, or the news accounts quoting the letter, if I can, for my friend from Alaska, and I will enter it into the RECORD. 
   Now, what happened? In 1989, this genocidal leader of Yugoslavia, named Milosevic, had seized power and attempted to consolidate Serbs throughout the former Yugoslavia. He made a speech on the 600th anniversary of Blackbirds Field near Pristina to enrage and bring up the blood of every Serbian living in the region. It worked very well in Bosnia. It got them going in Bosnia and, as well, in Kosovo. Then he, under the Serb Constitution, by most accounts, unconstitutionally amended the Constitution, taking away the autonomy that Tito had granted to Kosovo in 1974. But even when that was done, the Albanian Serbs did not use force or violence. They were headed by a guy named Dr. Rugova, who said they would, by nonviolent means, attempt to reestablish their societal institutions, allowing them their dignity and their right to work. 
   In the meantime, Milosevic comes in and he heads down from Belgrade and the orders are essentially: fire them all. Fire them all. All of the civil service jobs were eliminated, all of the schools were shut down, the language was not allowed, and so on. Still, the Kosovars did not use force. Still, they attempted, through peaceful means, to regain their autonomy. And with the help of President Bush--I can only surmise this, I can't read Milosevic's mind, but knowing what a coward he is, based on what he has done in the past, I expect that the Christmas warning by President Bush kept him from using the force he wanted to. 
   Dr. Rugova came to me and others and said, ``Get us into Dayton. While this is being discussed, get us on the agenda.'' We made a mistake, in my view. We said, ``No; you are not on the agenda; this is just about Bosnia. This is about Bosnia and nothing else.'' And so when peaceful means began to fail, and had clearly failed in late 1996, seven years later, the Kosovar resistance called the Kosovo Liberation Army--the UCK or the KLA, whatever you would like to call it--began to engage in larger attacks, a la the IRA. 
   Milosevic then saw an opportunity. Having been humiliated in his aggressive wars against Slovenia in the spring of 1991, and Croatia in the summer of 1995, and having seen the Bosnian Serb puppets routed in the fall of 1995 and forced to accept a compromise settlement in Dayton, the Yugoslav dictator needed another crisis to divert the Serbian people's attention from the massive failure of his authoritarian, Communist economic and political policies. 
   So what did he do? He did what is often done. He found a common enemy. He appealed to this naked, rabid nationalism and used the suppression of the KLA as a justification, as his vehicle, attempting in the process to drive the ethnic Albanian population out of large areas of Kosovo. What have been the results? 
   To date, approximately 2,000 Kosovar Albanians and Serbian civilians have been killed. More than 400,000 Kosovar Albanians have been driven from their homes, including tens of thousands during the past 10 days. Thousands of homes in hundreds of villages in Kosovo have been razed to the ground. One-quarter of Kosovo's livestock has been slaughtered and 10 percent of its arable land burned. A food blockade has been imposed upon large 
   segments of the Kosovar population. 
   The world has taken note of this. The United Nations Security Council has passed two important resolutions--Nos. 1160 and 1199--in 1998, decrying the repression and calling for an end to it. Milosevic publicly agreed to the U.N. demands and has cynically continued his state terrorism. 
   Mr. President, why should we be surprised by this? We saw it repeated and repeated in Bosnia, until we had the nerve to act. 
   What is at stake for the United States in all of this? In the interest of time, I will come back to the floor at a more appropriate time to enlarge upon this. But I will say that our entire policy in Europe since the end of World War II has been to promote stability through the spread of democracy. In order to create the security conditions for this development in Western Europe, we created NATO in 1949, and for 50 years this alliance has provided an umbrella under which our allies have survived and prospered. 
   Since the end of the Cold War, it has been our policy to extend this zone of stability eastward in Europe by three methods. 
   First, we have agreed to a well-conceived, measured enlargement of NATO, which has already brought Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the alliance. 
   Second, NATO has entered into partnerships with many countries in the region, which in time will probably yield additional alliance members, which also in the short run has created productive relationships with a great power like Russia. 
   Third--and here is where Kosovo comes in--we have determined to oppose directly the aggressive policies of demagogues like Milosevic who are trying to foment ethnic and religious hatred. 
   We know, as NATO knows, that its credibility is on the line in Kosovo. We have warned Milosevic countless times to halt his fascist aggression. We have cooperated with our NATO allies, and with Russia, in fashioning a fair interim settlement for Kosovo. 
   We know that if Milosevic's scorched-earth policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' is allowed to continue, the inevitable result will be a massive tide of refugees, which would destabilize fragile democracies in Macedonia and Albania. We also know that Milosevic is itching for the excuse to overthrow the democratic and reformist government of Montenegro, which is a direct challenge to his authoritarian communist rule in Yugoslavia. 
   We also know that the ultimate nightmare--which is not impossible by any means--is a widening of the hostilities to include NATO members Greece and Turkey, who have different interests in this outcome. 
   Mr. President, the national interests of the United States are directly threatened by the continued aggressive actions of the Yugoslav Government in Kosovo. 
   For that reason, Mr. President, I think we should do what I said earlier, which is, introduce a resolution authorizing air operations, in conjunction with the Activation Order voted on by the North Atlantic Council of NATO. 
   I urge my colleagues to support that resolution. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BIDEN. I think the way that the Senator phrased it, I can understand how he arrives at this issue as he does. I would argue that it is a distinction without much of a difference. 
   For example, the distinguished chairman talks about extermination justifying our action but relocation not. Historically, that is a distinction without a difference in terms of genocide. Historically, that is a distinction without a difference. 
   In Bosnia, it was a distinction without a difference. This guy has a track record. The track record is clear. The track record is documented. The track record is obvious. So it is not a significant leap from President Bush's letter, which said: If they move against the Kosovars. We could argue, and President Bush could enlighten us what he meant by that, but the truth of the matter is he has moved against the Kosovars, and he is moving as we speak against the Kosovars. And a half-million people up in the mountains is a pretty big deal. 
   Second, with regard to this notion of forcing a peace agreement on someone by saying, ``If you don't sign, we will in fact bomb,'' that would make sense, I would argue, if in fact we were arguing about a border dispute, if we are arguing about whether or not they were to pay reparations, if we were arguing about whether or not they are going to sell oil or whatever. It is not about that. It is about genocide and ethnic cleansing. The whole purpose of the agreement, the only reason why the rest of Europe--of NATO--agrees with us that there is a need for force on the ground in Kosovo, is to prevent--prevent--prevent ethnic cleansing; prevent the systematic isolation of Albanians, Moslem Kosovars, Moslem Serbs. 
   So I understand the technical point the chairman is making. I do not understand the practical difference. This agreement that was signed onto relates to a framework that will assure the international community that this thug is not going to engage in the genocide he already has, the ethnic cleansing he has been promoting since 1989, and the thing for which we have a tribunal in the Hague. His military leadership, his puppets, are on the indictment list of the people engaged in this. 
   I acknowledge that it has not reached the proportions it did in Bosnia. I acknowledge that 43 men and women forced to kneel down and have guns pointed to the backs of their heads and have their brains blown out is not enough to say it is genocide countrywide. But it sure is enough, in my view anyway, to get the tickler file moving a little bit and saying: Wait a minute, what happened after that when they did that in Bosnia? What happened after that when the intercepted communications we have between Milosevic and Karadzic and others in Bosnia said, ``Go get them, boys.'' Do we wait for Srebrenica to recur in Pristina? Do we wait for that? 
   What the international community said, I say to my friend from Alaska--international? Let me be more precise. The contact group in NATO--they said, ``We do not. We learned a lesson here. We are not going to wait until he does that in Kosovo. We are going to work out an agreement.'' So they went outside Paris in some fancy old castle and they sat down and negotiated. And the idiot KLA, like the IRA, scuttled it initially because they threatened the Kosovar negotiators who were up there negotiating this agreement. 
   But keep in mind the purpose of the negotiation. The only reason to put international forces on the ground in Kosovo--the only reason, none other--is to guarantee personnel and institutions that will prevent Milosevic from being able to do what President Bush was worried he would do and threatened him that, if he did do it, he would use force. So there is a distinction, I acknowledge, between preemptively making this case based upon recent historical record and waiting until it happens.  
   But I will just say only one thing to my friend, who has forgotten more--and I mean this sincerely--he has forgotten more about our national defenses, has forgotten more about the conduct of war and the way to pursue it, than I am going to learn; and I acknowledge that. I mean that sincerely. But the one thing I am prepared to bet--prepared to bet my career on it --is if we do not act, I will bet my colleagues anything they wish to, within two years--within I think eight months, by the time the snows fall next winter--there will be genocide, documented, on a large scale, in Kosovo. 
   My only argument is I think NATO is correct and the President 
   is correct. I believe President Bush was correct in saying that we are going to stop you from doing that. 
   The mechanism picked by the community, by NATO, was this peace agreement. That is the purpose of it. It was not to extract from Milosevic money, commitment, borders--anything else. It was to say: We are setting these folks in place to guarantee that you keep your promise that you are not going to eliminate these folks. 
   I understand the difference. I have enormous respect for my friend from Alaska, but that is the basis upon which the Senator from Delaware believes we should act, knowing full well what he says. I do not say it lightly, and never having been in combat myself, as my friend from Alaska has been, I want him to know I do not say lightly risk these young women and men. Because it is a risk. He was there in the room. We were both there with the President. I indicated that I thought the President, based on the intelligence community reports and also based upon the briefings I have received from the military, that it is probable--not possible, probable--that some American flier is going to lose his or her life. So I do not say it lightly, but I think it is balanced off against whether or not we set a chain reaction in place, again, where we watch genocide. Either we have to act at a higher price or don't act and see it spread. 
   I thank my colleague for his time. I know he has other business he wants to get to.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, proponents of S. 257, the bill we are debating now, suggest that this bill is vital to our country's defense. The very distinguished Senator from Tennessee just got up and made his case, and as an illustration he pointed to the technology that the Chinese Government, apparently through espionage, has acquired. 
   I want to make it clear for the record, I am not confirming anything at this point. But assume that what was said is accurate--and I am not disputing it either. One of the two things the Senator pointed out, as things we should be worried about, is that they may have acquired the capability of MIRVing missiles. For the public, that means they can put more than one nuclear bomb on the nose of a missile, an intercontinental ballistic missile. And they may have gained the capacity to independently target those warheads. 
   Put another way, we know what the Russians can do. The Russians have SS-18s and other intercontinental missiles, each with any of 3, 7, 10--depending on the missile--nuclear bombs with a combined capacity that exceeds Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They could launch a missile, and within 30 minutes they could have one of those warheads, one of those nuclear weapons, landing in Wilmington, DE, a small town, in relative terms, in my State, taking out all of the Delaware Valley and its 10 million people, and the same missile could send one warhead to Washington, DC, one to Roanoke, VA, et cetera--all with one missile. That is a very, very, very awesome capacity. 
   We are worried that the Chinese may have acquired some of that technology. 
   It is also suggested that the Chinese may have acquired the capacity to target with more accuracy. An accurate missile can breach the overpressure limit of certain missile silos--the pounds per square inch they could sustain from a blast and still be able to launch--so it became important during the time of the arms buildup between the Soviet Union and the United States what the hard kill capacity was. That is, could you fire a missile that would not only kill all the people in all the Delaware Valley, but, assuming there were silos that had Minuteman rockets in those silos with nuclear weapons, could also knock out that missile itself? That is what they called the hard kill. Accuracy became a big deal because you could take out the other guy's missiles, and not just his cities. 
   We had the capacity to drop these missiles 12,000 or 13,000 miles away within 30 minutes on pinpointed areas the size of a soccer field in the Soviet Union then, in Russia now. We are worried the Chinese may have acquired that capacity. I think my friend from Tennessee is absolutely correct to be worried about that; so am I. 
   What are we doing here today? We are debating what I believe to be a political document, not a substantive piece of legislation that adds anything to the concept of what our strategic doctrine should be. We are saying that Taepo Dong missiles in the next 1 to 5 years--the Koreans may be able to get up to five of them--may be able to hit the United States, assuming the regime in North Korea lasts that long or outlives the research that would be required to get this done. We are talking about building a thin nuclear defense system to counter that immediate threat and future threats from Iran, Iraq, and other rogue states, and we are talking about it in almost total disregard of what impact it will have upon the ABM Treaty. 
   People say, ``What is the ABM Treaty?'' The ABM Treaty, as Senator DORGAN discussed, is the basis upon which we have gone from somewhere on the order of 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear warheads--and the capacity that my friend from Tennessee is worried about the Chinese acquiring--down to 12,000 total, roughly, or 13,000 maybe, roughly evenly divided between the United States and Russia. 
   Guess what? George Bush came along and said the single most destabilizing thing of all--in what I call ``nuclear theology''--are these ``MIRVed'' missiles, those missiles with up to 10 nuclear bombs on their tip, able to be targeted independently, once they separate, able to go in ten different directions with significant accuracy. 
   Why are they destabilizing? They are destabilizing because of the nuclear scenarios about who strikes first and whether you can strike back. Anybody who faces an enemy that has this capacity has to target those missiles, because they are the single most dangerous thing out there. That means that in a crisis, if a missile were accidentally launched, or we thought one was launched, what we would have to do is go and strike those missiles first. 
   What would the Russians now have to do? They would have to launch on warning. Knowing that their MIRVed missiles were logical targets, they would adopt the use-it-or-lose-it philosophy. It is the only rational decision a nuclear planner could make. 
   So George Bush figured out these are incredibly destabilizing weapons. They are vulnerable to a first attack by sophisticated missiles and they are awesome--awesome, as the kids say--in their destructive capacity. So what do you do? As long as they are around, it means they must be on a hair trigger. No country who possesses them can wait for them to be struck before they fire them. Everybody can understand that. The gallery is nodding; they all get it. They figured it out. When it is explained in simple terms, everybody understands it. That is called crisis instability. 
   What did we do? George Bush came along and said these are bad things to have hanging around, so we negotiated this treaty called 
   the START II treaty where, in an incredible bit of negotiation on the part of the Republican administration, they convinced the Russians they should do away with these MIRVed missiles--do away with them. That means we would achieve crisis stability; it adds up to stability. 
   What is left on both sides are single-warhead missiles that don't have to be launched on warning, because they are less tempting targets in a first strike; therefore, you pull back from the hair trigger. So if, God forbid, there is a mistake, it doesn't mean Armageddon is guaranteed. That is a sound policy. 
   There is only one little trick. Russia has a quasidemocracy--my term, ``quasi'' democracy. They have learned the perils and joys of living with a parliament, a congress, a legislative body, called the Duma. The Duma has not ratified this agreement yet. 
   Why hasn't the Duma ratified the agreement? The Duma has not ratified the agreement for a lot of reasons. Some Nationalists think it is a bad idea; some old apparatchik Communists think it is a terrible idea; some of the democrats there don't quite know what to do as the next step. Here is what happens: Unfortunately for the Russians, the bulk of their nuclear arsenal is in these MIRVed, silo-based weapons, these intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads. The bulk of ours are on submarines (which are less vulnerable to a first strike), in single-warhead missiles called Minuteman missiles, or on B-1 bombers and B-52 bombers. 
   The Russians, if they go forward with the deal to destroy their silo-based MIRVed missiles, at the end of the day will have less destructive capacity in their arsenal than we will. Now, they don't have to keep it as less, because they are allowed to build single-warhead missiles so we would each end up with the same number of warheads. But guess what? They are bankrupt. They don't have any money. They hardly have the money they need to destroy the missiles they have agreed to destroy. That is why we have the Nunn-Lugar program, spending millions of dollars a year to send American technicians over to Russia to help dismantle, destroy, break up, and crush strategic weapons. 
   Think about that. If I had stood on the floor 20 years ago and said that, my colleagues would have had a little white jacket ready for me. They would have hauled me off to the nearest insane asylum, I having lost my credibility completely by suggesting that the Russians would ever let Americans come over and destroy their nuclear weapons. 
   The reason they made that agreement is that they realized it is in their long-term interests, and they had no money to do it. If they don't have money to do that, they also don't have money to build these new weapons that only have one bomb on the end. It costs a lot of money to do that. So if they can't do that and they keep the agreement called START II, they end up at the end of the day with fewer nuclear bombs than we have--something we  would never do. We would never allow us not to have parity with the Russians. 
   That is their dilemma right now. That is why the administration is arguing about a thing called START III. At Helsinki, President Clinton said not only should we do START II, we could jump and do START III and take the total number of nuclear warheads each of us has to between 2,000 and 2,500, from 6,000 to 6,500 which is in the first stage of the reduction. 
   Obviously, the Russians are very interested in being able to go right to START III. They don't want to spend a whole lot of time where we have more bombs than they have, and they don't have the money to build many new missiles. Although they are allowed to build more missiles, they don't have the money to do it. 
   What are we debating? We are here debating as if it were a serious part of our nuclear strategy whether or not we will deploy some time in the future a system that has not yet been developed, that if it is developed may be able to take out what might end up being up to five weapons that might be able to get to the continental United States, from a government that might be in place 5 years from now. 
   So, what to worry about, right? No problem, it is not going to stop the Russian missiles, so they are not going to get worried about this. Let's put this in reverse. Let's assume we were about to ratify a START II that was going to put us at having fewer nuclear bombs than the Russians, 
   and we heard that the Russian Government was about to erect a nuclear shield--they called it a ``thin'' shield--to intercept missiles that were going to come from Iran. Now, I am sure not a single Member on this floor would say the following:  
   You know, what those Russians are really doing is erecting something that is going to stop our missiles from being able to strike. What have they done to us? They have convinced our administration to destroy missiles that we have that can penetrate their territory now; they convinced them to do that. We are going to end up with fewer missiles than them, and they are going ahead at the same time and building this nuclear shield. And you actually have some people in the Duma saying, ``The ABM Treaty doesn't mean anything to me.''  
   What do you think would happen with my right-wing friends, my left-wing friends, my middle friends, all my friends? There would be a mild frenzy. I can hear the Republican Party now; they would be talking about the selling out of America, and they would have good reason to think about that. We would have Democrats joining, and I can hear Pat Buchanan now--he could make a whole campaign out of that. 
   Well, what do you think is going on in Russia right now with the Nationalists and the old Communists? Are they listening to our debate about the ABM Treaty, which some people say doesn't apply anymore? That is not what the sponsor of the amendment is saying, to the best of my knowledge, but others are. And we say to them that they should not worry. Why worry? We are only building this tiny, thin shield. Our shield isn't designed to affect them. 
   Yet, to the best of my knowledge, the sponsor of this bill would not even accept an amendment that would say, by the way, if whatever we come up with would violate the ABM Treaty, we will negotiate a change with the Russians first. It seems like a simple proposition, doesn't it? 
   Now, where does this leave us? I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that at best, it leaves us with essentially a congressional resolution of no meaning, of no consequence, changing nothing that the administration has said about seeking the ability to have a thin missile defense system, for it doesn't appropriate money; it says this is subject--which is obvious--to the yearly appropriations bill. It doesn't make any guarantees; it doesn't say anything of consequence. In one sense, it is a meaningless resolution. 
   But in another sense, because we have debated it so vigorously, it is invested with a meaning beyond its substance. What I worry about now is that it will be taken as viewing our national strategy on nuclear weapons as no longer envisioning as the centerpiece of that strategy the ABM Treaty--the very treaty that allows us to keep reducing the number of strategic weapons on each side. 
   Let me make one more point. You may say, ``Well, BIDEN, what does the ABM Treaty have to do with the START agreement and reducing these nuclear weapons?'' Well, there are two kinds of truisms in this nuclear theology. One is, if you are incapable of building a missile shield, and you think the other side might build one, then there is only one thing you can do: build more missiles to overwhelm the defense system. That is axiomatic, it is cheaper, it is consistent with old-line policy, and it is doable. At a minimum, you would say, don't destroy the number of weapons you have. 
   Look at it this way. If you think the other team is about to put up this missile shield--thin, thick or medium--and you now have 6,500 weapons that can reach their territory, you know, as a matter of course, that if you reduce that number to 2,500 or 2,000, you have a two-thirds fewer opportunities to penetrate that shield. So why would you do that? Why would you do that? 
   I realize my friend from Louisiana is about to offer an amendment that I hope will at least be read as having the impact of saying, hey, look, arms reduction is still important to us--translated to mean the ABM Treaty still makes a difference. But let's understand that, at best, this bill is hortatory. At worst, 
   it is a real, real bad idea because, to the extent that the threat is real--and there is a potential threat from Korea--to the extent that it is real, it pales, pales, pales in comparison to the threat that remains in Russia--a country that is, at its best, to be characterized now as struggling to keep its head above water; at worst, it is losing the battle of democratization. 
   Mr. President, the threat of a missile attack on the United States is real and disturbing, but the true test is not how angry we get, but how rationally we deal with the threats to our national interests. A rational development and deployment of a limited nuclear missile defense does not require us to ignore our ABM Treaty obligations. Only fear and politics drive missile defense adherents to take such a risk in the bill before us. 
   My generation understands both that fear and the dream of a ballistic missile defense. Anyone who has ducked under his desk in grade school in an air raid drill knows the collective sense of vulnerability and futility caused by the thought of a nuclear holocaust. 
   We have spent well over $100 billion in our effort to ease that sense of helplessness through civil defense or missile defense. But the role of this Senate, over two centuries, has been to resist those savage fears and passionate dreams that would otherwise take us down a dangerous path. America needs a balanced strategy to meet the rogue state missile threat, while also preserving the ABM Treaty, continuing the START process, and using nonproliferation assistance to combat loose nukes in Russia and, at the same time, advancing entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That is what I believe to be a sound and balanced strategy, and that is what I hope Senator KERRY and Senator LEVIN and I will propose in a thing called the ``National Security Policy Act of 1999.'' 
   I respectfully suggest that it is a far cry from the ``bumper sticker'' bill that is currently before us. If reason can overcome fear, perhaps reason can also overcome politics. If the Republicans have the courage and foresight to pursue their goal of a limited national missile defense, while preserving arms control and strategic stability, I urge them to get to the business of talking about that. 
   But right now, what is left uncertain is not whether or not we should have a limited nuclear defense--we should and could if it is capable of being done--but it can and must be done only in the context of the ABM Treaty, START II and START III, as well as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That constitutes a national strategic policy. 
   Mr. President, I have departed from my text in order to convey the depth of my concern over this bill. Allow me now to restate those concerns in a more precise manner. 
   When I said that this was nothing more than an exercise in political theater, I may have sounded like the Police Commissioner in the film ``Casablanca.'' I am ``shocked ..... shocked'' to discover politics in the U.S. Senate. But we ought to make one thing clear:  the issue at stake is not--is not--whether to deploy a national missile defense. 
   Recent Administration actions make clear that it will deploy a missile defense system if that should be in the national interest. The real issue here is whether we will be pragmatic or ideological about it. 
   The pragmatic solution considers the cost of a missile defense; this ideological bill ignores it. 
   Serious technical challenges remain in developing a national missile defense system. But that is not for a lack of trying. In fact, we have committed significant resources to the effort. Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre testified last October that the National Missile Defense program ``is as close as we can get in the Department of Defense to a Manhattan Project.'' 
   The Clinton administration has submitted plans to spend approximately $30 billion in additional funds between 1999 and 2005 for missile defense development and deployment. Of that, roughly $11 billion is earmarked for deployment of a ``thin'' National Missile Defense with 20 interceptors. The Defense Department estimated last summer that an expanded 100-interceptor system at a single site would cost upwards of $15 billion to deploy. 
   That $11-15 billion may very well provide us with a deployed system that is effective against rudimentary countermeasures. It is not at all clear, however, that it will buy a system that is capable against truly advanced countermeasures, such as are claimed for Russia's new SS-27 missile or even other current Russian or Chinese missiles. 
   Now, before my colleagues remind me that our missile defense system is not aimed at Russia, I would refer them to the Rumsfeld Report. That report warns that technology transfer is the key way that potential antagonists might acquire missile capabilities against the United States. 
   The danger is that we will spend billions of dollars deploying a missile defense system that may work against SCUD-like technology, but will not work even five or ten years down the road, against the potential threat from rogue states who have bought or developed more sophisticated missile technology. 
   It may be the case that we will have to spend those $11-15 billion dollars on missile defense deployment. It seems to me, however, that a much smaller sum might suffice to remove much of the threat that concerns us here. 
   If we could move from START to START Two and START Three, a portion of that $11-15 billion could be spent on dismantling Russian nuclear weapons and securing its large quantity of fissile material. This would make a real, immediate, and lasting contribution to our security. 
   Another portion of those funds could be used to curb North Korea's efforts to develop intercontinental missiles or weapons of mass destruction. It is clear that we need to inject new life into the 1994 Agreed Framework if we are to curtail North Korea's nuclear program. It is also clear that we need to take proactive steps to halt North Korea's long-range missile capability. 
   To be taken seriously, any U.S. initiative toward North Korea must combine carrots and sticks. We must bolster our deterrent posture to demonstrate to the North Koreans the penalties they face if they threaten United States security. Improving our theater defenses, increasing our capability for pre-emptive strikes if we should face imminent attack, interdicting North Korean missile shipments abroad, and increasing our security cooperation with other regional actors are all possible sticks we can wield. 
   At the same time, our policy should also provide adequate incentives to persuade the North Korean elite that their best choice for survival is the path of civil international behavior. These incentives could include our joining Japan and South Korea in funding two light-water reactors in exchange for our possession of the spent fuel in North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear reactor, sanctions relief in return for a verifiable end to North Korea's missile programs, and security assurances that we have no intention of forcing a change in North Korea's political system. 
   While these initiatives would cost money, together they could be funded for far less than the $11-15 billion we plan to spend for missile defense deployment. Thus, an article in Sunday's Washington Post noted that North Korea has already offered to cease exporting its missile technology in return for only one billion dollars. 
   We rejected that proposal, and I think we can get that deal for a lower price. But we should remember our experience in negotiating access to that suspect underground site in North Korea. In this time of famine, North Korea would settle for food aid instead of cash. And a billion dollars spent on food aid goes to American farmers, rather than to North Korean weapons. 
   I don't know how much it would cost to truly end North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, but we might consider putting our money where our mouth is. While an embryonic missile defense program might increase our sense of security, halting the North Korean's missile and nuclear programs would provide real benefit to our national security. 
   The pragmatic solution considers whether the first ``technologically possible'' national missile defense will be reliable and effective, especially in light of warnings by the head of the Ballistic Missile Defense Office that national missile defense is a ``high risk'' program. This ideological bill commits us to spend at least 5 million dollars per day to build and deploy that first system, even if it has only a mediocre test record. 
   Most importantly, the pragmatic solution considers ballistic missile defense in the context of the U.S.-Russian strategic relationship. 
   Perhaps we will need to deploy a national missile defense. But this ideological bill would foolishly sacrifice arms control, non-proliferation and strategic stability with Russia in order to field an imperfect missile defense. 
   And the fact is, we don't have to make that sacrifice in order to address the ballistic missile threat. But we do have to reject simplistic answers to complex issues. 
   The basic problem with this bill is not that it advocates a national missile defense, but that it is so narrowly ideological about it. What a shame, that we spend our time debating right-wing litmus tests. A bill that looked more broadly at challenges to our national security would be much more worthy of our attention. 
   To underscore that point, I intend to introduce in the coming days the ``National Security Policy Act of 1999.'' Working with me on that bill are Senator KERREY of Nebraska, who is Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee; and Senator LEVIN of Michigan, who is Ranking Member on the Armed Services Committee. 
   We earnestly hope that our bill will provoke a much more serious debate than is possible on the one-sentence bill before us. We invite our Republican colleagues to join with us in forging a comprehensive, truly bipartisan consensus on critical national security issues. 
   One such issue is the future of deterrence. Is deterrence so weak that we must deploy a national missile defense to combat third-rate powers like North Korea, Iran and Iraq? If so, then I believe we must reinforce deterrence. 
   Deterrence is--and will remain--the bedrock of U.S. nuclear strategy. Rogue states must never be allowed to forget that utter annihilation will be their fate if they should attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction. We should emphasize that basic fact. 
   What about the risk of ICBM's in the hands of a leader too crazy to be deterred? If that should happen, we should make it clear that the United States will destroy--pre-emptively--any ICBM's that such a leader may target at us. I intend that our bill will do that, building on our basic deterrence policy. 
   What is it about nuclear deterrence that makes it so hard for some people to support that strategy? Nuclear deterrence between the United States and the Soviets, and now between the United States and Russia, is based upon what is sometimes called ``Mutually Assured Destruction'' or a ``balance of terror.'' Each country maintains the capability to destroy the other, even if the other side strikes first. 
   Both the right wing and the left wing of American politics rebel against this.  They abhor leaving our very fates to U.S. and Russian political leaders and military personnel. They also hear the warning of some religious and ethical leaders that no nuclear war can ever be a ``just war'' in moral terms. 
   But the ``balance of terror'' remains in place, fully half a century after the Soviet Union joined the United States as a nuclear power. And those of us in the center of the political spectrum continue to support it. 
   Why is that? To put it simply: ``because it works.'' 
   Yet one of the implicit purposes of this bill is to substitute our policy of deterrence with one of defense. Instead of deterring an attack on our territory we would defend against such an attack with missile defenses. 
   Some people believe we must make this transition from deterrence to defense--in this case using a National Missile Defense--because the leaders of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq cannot be deterred by the same means we have used to deter Russia and China. I disagree. These countries' leaders take tactical risks, but none has been willing to risk complete annihilation. 
   Let's consider the record of deterrence against extremist leaders. 
   In the 1950's, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin was deterred from a conventional invasion of Western Europe. But why? Why did the Soviets not crush the Berlin Airlift? Because Stalin--that great butcher of souls--feared a nuclear war. 
   Why did the Soviet Union pull back from confrontation in Berlin in 1961 and Cuba in 1962? Because Nikita Khrushchev--that foolish risk-taker who was later deposed by his nervous cohorts--still feared nuclear war. 
   Why has China not invaded Taiwan? Because every Chinese Communist leader--from the consummate butcher Mao to the would-be capitalist dictators of today--has feared nuclear war. 
   More recently, Saddam Hussein was deterred from using chemical or biological weapons during the Gulf War, despite his threats to do so, by the United State's promise that such an attack would meet with a devastating U.S. response. 
   The record demonstrates that extremist states are deterred when we credibly threaten to retaliate, and when our threatened retaliation imperils their vital interests. 
   That is what has deterred the Iraqis, the Soviets, and the Chinese from using weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests in the past. That is what has brought the Serbs to the bargaining table, both in the Bosnian and Kosovo crises. That is what has deterred the Syrians from directly attacking Israel. 
   Yet our concern today is over the North Korean threat. At some point in the near future, the North Koreans may achieve a limited ability to strike U.S. territory. We must ask ourselves whether the logic of deterrence--a logic that has worked in so many other instances--will work against the North Koreans. Again, lets consider the record. 
   For years, North Korea has had the ability to rain short-range missiles on all of South Korea and to kill untold thousands within range of North Korean artillery. Yet the South Korean and U.S. militaries have kept the peace by threatening punishing retaliation should the North Koreans attack. We have kept the peace by threatening to destroy the very heart of the North Korean regime--its military--which is crucial to its control over its population. 
   Our military will continue to have that retaliatory capability in the North Korean theater of operations--whether we have a national missile defense or not. We maintain approximately 37,000 troops on the ground in Korea, including the 8th Army and 7th Air Force, to say nothing of the 47,000 American troops in Japan or the portions of the 7th Fleet deployed in the region. 
   Moreover, the North Koreans must know that our early warning radars could pinpoint the source of any missile attack on the United States and that such an attack would bring a devastating response. 
   Maintaining U.S. retaliatory forces, and demonstrating our willingness to use them when necessary, are the keys that have kept the peace. There is every prospect that the credible threat of retaliation will continue to deter extremist states in the future. 
   So let us all think carefully--and rationally--before letting our fears of destruction move us away from a policy that has avoided destruction so well and for so long. 
   Traditional deterrence may unnerve us because it depends upon rational leaders and weapons control systems. But the alternative--missile defense--depends in turn upon the perfection of complex systems and their human components. 
   Think of the great computer-assisted systems of our time: the Internal Revenue Service, the air traffic control system, credit bureaus, or the National Weather Service. 
   Then ask yourselves whether missile defense will really make you safe--especially if the price of it is the end of the START process and, therefore, continued Russian reliance upon MIRVed ICBM's. 
   Whatever missiles a rogue state might build, however, the one missile threat to our very existence is still from Russia. A rogue state might deploy a few tens of nuclear warheads; Russia has thousands. And what is especially appalling is this bill's cavalier treatment of the U.S.-Russia relationship. 
   As we debate S. 257, I have to ask myself: Why is the other side so determined to pass this bill, rather than a more serious piece of legislation? The sad truth is that the real goal of many ballistic missile defense adherents is to do away with the ABM Treaty. 
   Why would they want to do that? Because they know that the ``thin'' missile defense proposed in this bill is at best a strictly limited defense. It may work against a handful of incoming missiles, but not against an attack of any serious magnitude. 
   To achieve a defense against a serious ballistic missile attack with nuclear weapons, we would probably need multiple radar sites--perhaps using ship-borne radars--and surely more interceptor sites. (The Heritage Foundation proposes putting the interceptors on ships, as well.) 
   To stop a serious missile attack using chemical or biological warheads, we might well need a boost-phase intercept system, either ship-borne or space-based. That is because the chemical or biological agents could be carried in scores of bomblets dispersed shortly after boost-phase shut-off. The national missile defense systems currently under development would be nearly useless against such bomblets. 
   So missile defense is rather like Lay's Potato Chips: it's hard to eat just one. For the real ballistic missile defense adherents, even ``Star Wars'' is therefore not dead. But the ABM Treaty bars both ship-borne and space-based ABM systems. 
   Still, the dream persists: if only this bill were passed, if only the ABM Treaty were killed, then ``Brilliant Pebbles'' or some other system could be pulled out of the drawer, dusted off, and contracted out to every congressional district to keep the money coming. 
   Many missile defense adherents are quite open about their determination to kill the ABM Treaty, and frustrated because Congress lacks the Constitutional authority to do that. Some fall back on strained legal theories to argue that the break-up of the Soviet Union left the ABM Treaty null and void--while hoping that nobody will apply that reasoning to other U.S.-Soviet treaties. 
   At other times, missile defense adherents press to deploy a ballistic missile defense regardless of whether this requires violation or abrogation of the ABM Treaty. That is what this bill would do. 
   If we enact S. 257 and make it U.S. policy to deploy an ABM 
   system without addressing Russian concerns and U.S. treaty obligations, then Russia will almost certainly use its thousands of ICBM warheads to maintain its nuclear deterrence posture. 
   That would end strategic arms control. It would also sacrifice our long-standing goal--ever since the Reagan Administration--of removing the greatest threat to strategic stability: land-based, MIRVed ICBM's. 
   MIRVed ICBM's--with Multiple, Independently-targeted Re-entry Vehicles--are the cheapest way for Russia to overwhelm a missile defense. But they also put nuclear Armageddon just  a hair-trigger away, because a missile with 3, or 7, or 10 warheads is a truly tempting target for a first strike by the other side. 
   In a crisis, a Russia that relies upon MIRVed ICBM's may feel it has to ``use them or lose them.'' That's why President Bush signed START Two to ban those missiles. 
   Today, maintaining the START momentum is a real national security challenge. The Russian Duma has balked at ratifying START Two, largely because Russia cannot afford to replace its MIRVed ICBM's with enough new, single-warhead missiles to maintain the force levels permitted by the treaty. 
   But major force reductions under START Three, to reduce nuclear forces to a level that Russia can hope to maintain, could get the Russian Duma to permit Russia to give up MIRVed ICBMs. 
   Serious legislation would call for lower START Three levels than those proposed at the Helsinki summit in 1997. The bill before us, by contrast, would put the final nail in the coffin of START Two. 
   That is because Russia truly doubts that it can do without MIRVed ICBM's if the United States deploys a national missile defense. Now, U.S. officials are explaining to Russian leaders how a limited missile defense could defend America without threatening Russia or the basic goals of the ABM Treaty. 
   The Administration thinks there is a reasonable chance of bringing Russia around. But that will take time. Our bill will endorse that process of education and negotiation. 
   Passage of S. 257, by contrast, risks torpedoing those important U.S.-Russian talks. This bill will very likely be seen by Russia as a slap in the face. And it's hard to blame them, when the litmus-testers set up a vote just a few days before Russia's Prime Minister is due here for talks with Vice President GORE. 
   If my colleagues want a limited national missile defense without sacrificing the ABM Treaty, we can get that. If, however, their real aim is to kill the ABM Treaty and strategic arms control, then they are making a tragic mistake.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator GRASSLEY and Senator TORRICELLI, along with our colleague from the Judiciary Committee, Senator SESSIONS, to introduce legislation to reform our nation's bankruptcy laws. 
   In a time of rising incomes, historic levels of job creation, and strong economic growth, America has seen an unexpected rise in the number of personal bankruptcies. Last year, 1.4 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy, and we expect that number to grow again this year, as it has for the last 4 years. This means more people are filing for bankruptcy now than during the worst years of job losses in the 1980's. 
   Bankruptcy laws give Americans a very special kind of protection from the worst form of financial distress. As a nation of immigrants, our country is  the very embodiment of the idea of a fresh start. Bankruptcy protection was considered so important that it was among the specific powers granted to Congress in our Constitution. That is why we provide in law that no one should have to shoulder an unsustainable burden of debt, a burden that can hurt us all by threatening the weakest links in our society. 
   But at the same time, Mr. President, our nation is founded on the idea of personal responsibility, the only foundation that can sustain and protect our freedom. Until recently, bankruptcy was considered a stain on one's personal reputation, an admission of failure, something to be avoided at all costs. While we may sympathize with the special circumstances that can throw an individual into unexpected hardship, Americans expect that those who have the resources must meet their financial obligations. 
   But the explosion in the number of personal bankruptcies, in a time of economic prosperity, raises serious questions. Mr. President, every time one of us fails to pay a legitimate debt, the rest of us pay a little more, because of the higher interest rates lenders must charge to cover their loses. When the circumstances are unavoidable, and when it is clear that a fresh start is deserved, bankruptcy must be there for those who need it. But when those who have the ability to pay use the bankruptcy system to walk away from their debts, something is wrong. 
   It is now clear to most of us that our bankruptcy system--and the laws that guide it--are in serious need of reform. Last year, in the Senate, we passed a bipartisan bill by the nearly unanimous vote of 97 to 1 to fix the problems in our bankruptcy laws. While that proposal did not become law, we reached agreement that bankruptcy reform--done the right way--is something we all can support. 
   Working closely with his new ranking member, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator GRASSLEY has once again shown us the leadership on this issue that he provided last year. I believe that we have built a foundation in this bill for a reasonable approach, one that restores some of the balance that has been lost in recent years. To that end, this legislation assures that those who have the ability to pay will continue to meet their obligations, and that bankruptcy is not seen as a financial planning device, but the last resort for the most extraordinary circumstances. 
   At the same time, again with the help of Senator TORRICELLI we have gone a long way toward addressing the honest concerns that many of our colleagues have expressed about the needs of those, like single parents and those who receive child support, who deserve greater protection. 
   This is a tough balance to strike, and I will continue to work with Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLIE, and Senator SESSIONS, and with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, to listen to the concerns of other Senators, to achieve the kind of consensus that we found here in the Senate last year.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when the Prime Minister of Israel, the late Yitzhak Rabin, and the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, signed the Declaration of Principles on September 13, 1993, they each made a commitment to put nearly a century of conflict behind them and agreed to settle their differences through negotiation. 
   Since then, the process they set into motion has had its ups and downs. Many innocent lives have been lost at the hands of those opposed to peace and reconciliation. But progress has been sustained because both sides have ultimately demonstrated a willingness to resolve their disputes at the bargaining table. 
   Were Chairman Arafat now to take the unilateral step of declaring a Palestinian state, I fear that it would threaten the progress that has been made over the past 6 years. 
   The Declaration of Principles stipulates that the toughest issues--Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders--are to be resolved by permanent status negotiations. It is dangerous to argue that the end of the interim period on May 4 gives either side the right to decide an issue that both sides agreed to negotiate. 
   Any action or proclamation by either side that prejudges the outcome of negotiations can only hurt the cause of peace. it invites the other side to respond in-kind, and it serves only to delay a lasting peace settlement. 
   Mr. President, last August, I had the opportunity to meet with the Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu. At the request of President Clinton, I discussed with them some of the key issues in dispute. 
   Contrary to what many were saying at the time, I found both leaders to be committed to the peace process. Not many believed that these two individuals would overcome the profound differences over territory and security that were holding up an agreement on the second redeployment. With the Wye River Memorandum, both leaders proved that negotiations can resolve disputes, if both sides share the same goal. 
   It is in that spirit that I trust that the Palestinian leadership will not proceed with a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   I am confident that they will realize that their aspirations can best be realized through a commitment to the principles of negotiation. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with the end of the Cold War, the threat of a nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia has largely receded. There remains a real risk, however, that former Soviet weapons of mass destruction or the technology needed to build them will find their way to rogue states, terrorist groups, or even criminal organizations. If such weapons should ever be used, their impact will be catastrophic. It will hardly matter that ``only'' one or two cities have been so hideously slaughtered. 
   The war against these so-called ``loose nukes'' is as important as any war we have fought. It is a war fought with assistance to states of the former Soviet Union, rather than with armed force. Its battles are the battles against unemployment and lax security. Its fronts are an array of firms and institutes and so-called ``nuclear cities,'' as well as the international frontiers where smugglers try to move sensitive materials to states like Iran, Iraq or Libya. 
   This is a war that we dare not lose. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that in December, the chief of Russia's Federal Security Service in the Chelyabinsk region said that employees at one sensitive plant had tried to steal 40 pounds of weapons-usable nuclear material. A month earlier, 3,000 workers at Chelyabinsk-70, a ``nuclear city'' similar to our nuclear weapons design laboratories, had held a protest over unpaid wages. In 1996, the head of that city committed suicide in despair over his inability to pay his personnel.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man who has been a pillar of loyalty, integrity and continuity in Delaware's U.S. Attorney's office for the past 15 years. 
   We all know men and women who are the pillars of federal government offices--people who keep the wheels of government turning as changes occur around them. Richard G. Andrews is that pillar who keeps Delaware's U.S. Attorney's Office standing tall and strong. I respect his legal talents, professionalism, work ethic and people skills. And I recognize this dedicated public servant today, not because he's retiring--fortunately he's still working as hard as ever--but simply because he deserves the recognition. 
   As an Assistant U.S. Attorney since 1983, and Chief of the Criminal Division for the past five years, Rich has earned a reputation as a tough, fair prosecutor in the nearly 40 felony jury cases he has tried. He was involved with the most far-reaching FBI undercover sting operation in Delaware history that sent several top State and County officials to prison for bribery convictions. He also sent the Vice President of the Pagan Motorcycle Club to jail for 25 years for running a drug distribution ring. And he prosecuted the men convicted of bilking the federal government and taxpayers out of nearly half-a-million dollars in a student loan scam. 
   Rich Andrews started his legal career learning from the best--he was law clerk to the late U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the Third Circuit, Chief Judge Collins J. Seitz. 
   It's no wonder that distinguished experience marked the beginning of many more honors to come. In 1996, FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a commendation to him for the convictions of three top officials of Madison & Co. in $1 million securities fraud case. In 1993, he was commended for prosecuting ocean dumpers off the Delaware coast. 
   Rich continues to pass on his craft to young attorneys, teaching Criminal Trial Advocacy courses. And he goes the extra mile for victims, serving as Chairman of Delaware's Criminal Justice Council's Victims' Subcommittee. 
   Delaware and our country's U.S. Department of Justice are better for the continued service of Rich Andrews. He is an honest, down-to-earth, tough prosecutor and dedicated public servant. It is my pleasure to recognize this second-in-command as he continues to serve as the Chief Criminal prosecutor  for Delaware's U.S. Attorney's Office. It's a simple thank you for a job well done.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues in introducing this important legislation. In particular, I want to thank Senator CHAFEE for his foresight and leadership on this most difficult issue. The science, politics, and economics of climate change all present major issues, and only someone as dedicated and tenacious as Senator CHAFEE could provide the leadership to get us to this point today. My good friend, JOE LIEBERMAN, who has been another leader in the Senate on this tough issue, and CONNIE MACK, deserve our thanks for bringing us together around this first step in the long path toward managing the problem of climate change. 
   The science of climate change is sufficiently advanced that we know we face a threat to our health and economy; but we are only beginning to come to grips with how we can manage that threat most effectively, and--this is the key--most efficiently. Climate change presents us with a classic problem in public policy--it is a long-term threat, not completely understood, to the widest possible public. And it is an issue whose resolution will require taking steps now with real costs to private individuals and businesses, costs that have a payoff that may only be fully apparent a generation or more in the future. 
   Mr. President, we have learned a lot in the years that we have been making federal environmental policy here in the United States. We have much more to learn, but we have made real advances since the early days, when we did not always find the solutions that got us the most environmental quality for the buck. The bill we are introducing today reflects one important lesson: businesses can be a creative and responsible part of the solution to environmental problems. In fact, it is fair to say that we would not be here today if it were not for the leadership of groups like the International Climate Change Partnership and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, both of which have provided a forum for responsible businesses to reach consensus on this issue. Significantly, it was a leading environmental group, the Environmental Defense Fund, that has provided indispensible technical expertise to turn good intentions into the bill we have here today. 
   Drawing on our experience with tradable sulphur dioxide credits, this bill looks to the day when we have reached the kind of agreement--whether based on our evolving commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or some other authority--that establishes an emissions credit trading regime for greenhouse gases. The best science--and political reality--tells us that current rates of greenhouse gas emissions are likely to result not only in measurable change in global temperatures, but also in a public demand to do something about it. That in turn will change the cost of doing business as usual for the industries that are major sources of those gases. 
   But right now, if responsible firms--like DuPont and General Motors, if I can mention just two that operate in Delaware--want to do something to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they not only get no credit in any future trading system--they actually lose out to firms that decide to delay reductions until such a system is in place. Those who procrastinate, under current law, not only avoid the cost today of cleaning up their emissions, but they would be in a position to receive credits for the kinds of cheaper, easier steps that more responsible companies have already taken. This is certainly not the way to encourage actions now that help air quality in the short term. And every action we take now, by reducing the long-term concentrations of greenhouse gases that would otherwise occur, lowers the overall economic impact of complying with any future climate change policy. 
   One way out of this problem, Mr. President, is the bill we are introducing today--to assure firms who act responsibly today that their investments in a better future for all of us will be eligible for credit. At the same time, we will thereby raise the cost of delay. 
   As with so much in the issue of climate change, this bill is a work in progress. Different kinds of firms, with different products, processes, and histories, face significantly different problems in complying with the demands of an early credit system. We must be sure that we provide the flexibility to encourage the widest variety of reductions. And while we want to encourage the greatest reductions as soon as possible, we must be sure that we have the best information--and credible verification--on the effects of various kinds of early action. Without accurate verification and reporting, we cheapen the value of actions taken by the most responsible firms. 
   This bill marks a real change in our approach to climate change: we have moved beyond the days of heated, irreconcilable arguments between those who see climate change as a real threat and those who don't. Now, cooler heads can discuss the best way to face the future that we are building for our children.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, perhaps because of the title of his book, ``Too Funny to Be President,'' a lot of people will remember Morris Udall chiefly for his wit and his humor. And that, in and of itself, is not a bad way to remember Mo Udall. Because all of us need to remember that while what we do, and the issues we deal with, are serious matters, there is neither need nor reason to take ourselves too seriously. Morris Udall excelled in using humor to remind us of that. 
   But his quick wit and often self-deprecating humor never could mask his deeply-rooted commitment to public service, his love of the land and people of Arizona, and the seriousness with which he took his responsibilities to the Congress, to his state and its people, and to this nation. 
   Morris Udall was a legislator in the most proud tradition of the term. He understood that legislation is the process by which we recognize a problem or an injustice and, as a nation, undertake to rectify that wrong. He understood that legislation did not mean introducing a bill and putting out a press release; that legislation was not complete simply because we held a hearing to let everyone know that we were aware of the problem; or that simply because a bill was passed and signed into law our responsibilities were ended. 
   Mo Udall understood that until--at the instigation of the legislation we passed and under our oversight--someone from the United States government actually went out there and corrected the problem, ended the injustice, or righted the wrong, the legislative process was not complete and our job remained undone. And Mo Udall was always willing to stay the course until we had fully met our responsibilities.  
   He is probably most remembered for his environmental initiatives; for his belief that this land is the most sacred trust bestowed upon the American people--and that blessed as we are by vast natural beauty and resources, we have a moral responsibility to preserve and protect that trust and to make wise use of those resources. 
   Anyone who has ever seen the natural wonder that is the Arizona landscape understands at once the roots of Mo Udall's love for this land. Clearly he had a vision that generations yet unborn should grow up and enjoy nature's bounty and splendor just as he had. And my granddaughters--and their grandchildren--will have that opportunity in large part because of years of hard work by Mo Udall. They will have the opportunity to enjoy and appreciate America's natural wonders and resources not just in Arizona but across this land. And Morris Udall's family--including a son and a nephew who have followed him here to the Congress, as well as his brother Stewart who proceeded him to the House of Representatives and then moved on to become Secretary of the Interior and was a partner in many of Mo's accomplishments--can point to so much: acres and acres of natural beauty, clean water, and spectacular wildlife, and say, ``There, that is part of Morris Udall's legacy.'' 
   But there is another aspect to Morris Udall's legacy that I hope will be remembered equally, and that is his understanding of both the role and the limits of politics. He was an enormously talented politician, winning re-election year after year through changing times and shifting constituencies, and building a national following through his work on issues whose scope reached far beyond the boundaries of his congressional district. And he understood that politics is important, because the political process is the way in which a democracy defines its priorities and allocates its resources. 
   But Morris Udall understood that politics has its limits as well. That whatever our internal debate, partisan politics must end at the water's edge and the nation's borders and that Americans will speak with one voice when it comes to dealing with the world, and ensuring our national interests. He also said that when it came to the people of Arizona, they had not elected Morris Udall to be a Democratic Congressman just as they had not elected Barry Goldwater to be a Republican Senator. They had elected an Arizona congressman and an Arizona senator to look out for their interests and the interests of their state. And whether Carl Hayden or Barry Goldwater or John Rhodes or Dennis DeConcini shared his party label or not, he joined with them to look out for the interests of the people of Arizona here in the Halls of Congress. 
   And there was somewhere else that Mo Udall believed politics had its limits, and that was off the House floor or the campaign trail, away from the harsh debate, where friendships can develop regardless or partisan political stripe or ideology. He could count among his friends liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans; simply because of his decency, his character, his interest in so many things both within and outside the political arena, and yes, his humor. 
   And perhaps most of all--at least in terms of his relationships with those of us here in the Congress--because Morris Udall could look beyond all of our differences and see that which I believe all of us have in common: the desire to make life better for our children, our neighbors, our states, and out nation. 
   That, I hope, will be as much a lasting part of Morris Udall's legacy as the natural wonders that will be there for our grandchildren because Mo Udall recognized a need and saw it's resolution through.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, promoting human rights is now, and must remain, an important component of our overall relationship with China. That is why I support Senate Resolution 45, calling on the administration to voice our concerns about China's human rights abuses before the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
   Even as we try to expand cooperation in areas of mutual interest--stability on the Korean peninsula, nonproliferation, trade, and the environment--we must take note of China's violation of international norms in the area of human rights. 
   Last year, the administration decided to remain silent in Geneva, arguing that more progress could be achieved through quiet diplomacy than through public pressure. China did, in fact, release some high profile political prisoners. China also signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
   In recent months, however, we have witnessed a crackdown on dissent, including the arrest of prominent democracy party organizers. China continues to jam the broadcasts of Radio Free Asia and to closely monitor China's domestic media. 
   With respect to Tibet, China's leaders have yet to establish a dialogue with the Dalai Lama, and they refuse even to meet with U.S. officials responsible for coordinating U.S. policy on Tibet. 
   Mr. President, we should not stand mute in the face of China's continuing violation of basic human rights. Our silence would be deafening. 
   If we are not going to call on China to respect human rights before the UN Human Rights Commission, where will we make our concerns known? 
   And if we must act alone, without support from our European and Asian allies, so be it. There is no shame in being alone on the right side of history. 
   Ten years ago this June the world watched in horror as Chinese authorities used lethal force to suppress the Tian-an-men democracy movement. I am convinced that the gradual improvement in human rights in China over the past decade would not have occurred without concerted diplomatic pressure--public and private. 
   Now is not the time to let up.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with great honor, yet immense sadness that I stand today to pay tribute to a man--Rabbi Herbert Drooz--whose spirit, vision, and voice will live on for generations to come in my State of Delaware. 
   As a respected religious leader and social activist for 30 years, he was a builder--literally and figuratively--who dreamed big and made big things happen. 
   When I got back to Delaware from law school--I went out of State, we didn't have a law school in the State at the time, in 1968--Rabbi Drooz was one of the first civic activists that I came in contact with. He oversaw the building of a new synagogue for the reform congregation of Beth Emeth, that he led, which is now the largest synagogue in Delaware, along with the construction of the school on Lea Boulevard, not far from where I had gone to school in Wilmington, Delaware. These two buildings stand as not only monuments to his vision and his dedication to religious service, but they also had the very practical impact of enhancing the region and the neighborhood, and causing people to invest not only physically and financially, but psychologically in our city. 
   He built a community esprit de corps as well--founding the Delaware Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, which recently was renamed the National Conference for Community and Justice, which is one of the most significant civic organizations and moral barometers in my State. At the University of Delaware, my alma mater, he organized the popular student Hillel group. When I was a student at the University of Delaware in 1961 to 1965, it had a very small Jewish student body. It now has a vigorous, engaged and involved Jewish student body, and the Hillel group at the University is, again, a major force for justice, focusing on the moral dilemmas of our time. 
   What most Delawareans remember about Rabbi Drooz was his voice. He was known as the Rabbi who speaks. Every Sunday morning, you could turn on WDEL radio station, one of the largest radio stations in my State, and hear his words of wisdom and compassion, on a program that was titled, ``The Rabbi Speaks.'' 
   He spoke to and reached out to more than Delaware's proud Jewish community. He was one of the first people who went the extra mile to reach out to the non-Jewish community. 
   He spoke during times of social unrest in my State. He spoke about more than religious issues. In 1954, he used his leadership and oratorical skills to speak out forcefully against the racist hatred exhibited by a militant in the southern part of my State, in a city called Milford, who tried to defy the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. the Board of Education, to end racial segregation in our public schools. It may come as a surprise to many, but to my great shame, my great State has the blot upon its history that we were segregated by law, and in 1954 it was not particularly popular to speak out on that issue. 
   His words from the Beth Emeth pulpit still ring out. 
   He questioned, quote:  
   Why no leader has risen from among the citizens of Milford to combat this merchant of hate from another. We have been tardy. Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously, brother against brother?  
   The Rabbi speaks, indeed. He spoke, and he spoke at a time when few were willing to speak. 
   In 1966, he joined with bishops from the local Catholic and Episcopal dioceses in leading the Methodists and Presbyterians in opposing American involvement in the war in Vietnam--not very popular at the time and not always popular among his congregation. 
   Rabbi Drooz led the Rabbinical Association of Delaware for two terms as President. He spoke out as a board member on the board of the Fair Housing Council, Pacem In Terris, the American Red Cross, the Mental Health Association, and Delaware's Urban Coalition. 
   Everything that mattered, every issue that required some moral bearing, every issue that people tended to shy away from because they were controversial, Rabbi Drooz spoke out. 
   A point of personal privilege, Mr. President. You know as a former Governor and a former mayor and a Senator now, occasionally things get said about us that are totally untrue. We never fail to forget those voices in the community who have significant standing, who are willing to risk their reputations to speak out for us.  
   Rabbi Drooz spoke out for JOE BIDEN, too. He spoke out for me at a time that could have stopped me in my tracks from winning the election in 1972. 
   Please allow me this point of personal privilege to tell this brief story. Just days before that election, I was falsely accused of being anti-Semitic in an unfounded charge by a disgruntled, former campaign worker. I was 29 years old. Hardly anybody knew me. Those who knew me knew, and my record as a Senator has demonstrated, I am far from an anti-Semite. As a matter of fact, I am accused these days by my opponents of being the other way. 
   At the time, as a 29-year-old guy from a family with no influence or money running for the U.S. Senate in a year when George McGovern was being trounced in my State. I was accused in this sort of Pearl Harbor sneak attack the weekend before the Tuesday of being an anti-Semite, and it was printed in our largest paper. 
   Rabbi Drooz immediately went into action on the Sunday prior to the election. Rabbi Drooz organized a meeting of Delaware's Jewish community, enlisting the support of the very influential Governor of Pennsylvania who happened to be Jewish, Milton Shapp. Rabbi Drooz spoke out for JOE BIDEN and supported me against this untrue, unfair accusation. Needless to say, he was effective in setting the record straight, or I would not be standing here today. The mere fact that Rabbi Drooz said, ``I know JOE BIDEN,'' was good enough for the entire community in my State. 
   I will forever hold Rabbi Drooz in the highest esteem for his courage, his leadership, his boldness and for getting me back on my feet at a time when I needed his courage, leadership and boldness the most. 
   After I became a Senator, on a regular basis I would brief Rabbi Drooz on the situation in the Middle East. He would put together people for me to speak to. Seldom did we disagree, but when we did, there was no question about my independence, and he never questioned whether or not I should be. 
   Rabbi Drooz was a fighter to the end. Alzheimer's stole his mind, but not his spirit. Just six months before he died, as an octogenarian, he agreed to participate in a study for Alzheimer's to test new medication. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion, I point out that I truly believe his spirit lives on in his son Daniel and his daughter Johanna, his brother Arnold and his six grandchildren. They are respected in the community and continue to participate in the community. 
   I say goodbye to Rabbi Drooz. Shalom and peace be with you, my friend, and may all that you did for the good of Delaware be remembered. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the resolution being submitted by Senator FRIST and Senator FEINGOLD condemning the escalating violence and violation of human rights in the nation of Sierra Leone. The past six weeks we have seen the end to peace and security in that country as a result of the renewed offensive by the combined forces of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council military junta, known as the AFRC and a rebel group known as the Revolutionary United Front, or RUF in a effort to once again overthrow the democratically elected government of Sierre Leone. 
   The Economic Community of West African States stepped in almost a year ago, sending its Military Observer Group, called ECOMOG, to restore President Tejan Kabbah to power. Since that time, ECOMOG has been the sole thin line standing between notoriously inhumane AFRC/RUF forces and the fall of the democratically elected government. 
   Unfortunately on January 6 of this year, the AFRC/RUF once again attacked Freetown and continued waging an inhumane and unbelievably brutal war on the civilian population in the countryside. There are disturbing reports both in the media and from our embassy in Sierra Leone that the AFRC/RUF has rounded up civilians including men, women and children for the purposes of torture and mutilation. AFRC/RUF soldiers use machetes to amputate one or both hands, feet, ears, arms, and fingers of their civilian victims. 
   These reports indicate that victims are sometimes instructed to take a severed limb, body part or note to the government or ECOMOG stating that the government should replace the amputated body part, and that ECOMOG should leave Sierra Leone. These atrocities are carried out regardless of age or gender, and do not appear to be ethnically or religiously motivated. 
   Women and girls are kidnaped and forced into sexual slavery. Some kidnap victims are used as labor in rebel camps. Boys and young men are compelled to join the AFRC/RUF as soldiers against their will. Witnesses say that children as young as seven years have been forcibly recruited by the rebels. 
   The result of the escalated violence has been the exodus of over 450,000 people into neighboring Guinea and Liberia. Nearly twice as many are wandering around within the borders of Sierra Leone, their homes and villages destroyed, vulnerable to further attacks from insurgents, without access to food or medicine. 
   With the help of external actors who are acting in direct violation of a United Nationals arms embargo, the AFRC/RUF has been able to effectively sustain its assaults against civilians and ECOMOG troops. However, the AFRC/RUF has demonstrated no organized political platform or agenda. It enjoys no popular support among the people of Sierra Leone. In short, this group can accurately be described as a band of well armed, determined thugs. 
   I applaud the administration for providing aid to ECOMOG. However, as I wrote to the Secretary of State this week, and as this resolution indicates, the United States can and should do more to support ECOMOG financially. While ECOMOG is far from perfect, it is the only thing standing between the civilian population the fall of the duly elected government to indiscriminate, brutally violent AFRC/RUF forces. 
   It is for all of the above reasons that I join my colleagues Senators FRIST and FEINGOLD in sponsoring this resolution. 
   In addition to condemning the heinous actions of the AFRC/RUF rebels and the involvement of external actors in support of the rebels, the resolution urges the Administration to continue to give a high priority to solving this conflict. 
   Thousands of innocent men, women and children have been wounded, maimed and killed in the past months alone. We must do all we can do to bring about a swift and long-term political solution to this war. This is the  only way to put a decisive end to the suffering of the population of Sierra Leone.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. Like many of my colleagues, I am very aware of the strains on America's military personnel. I have only to look at the pace of operations at Dover Air Force Base, in my home state of Delaware. Dover's strategic airlift and air cargo terminal support every single on-going operation and new troop and equipment movement to Europe, Southwest Asia, and Africa. A quick look around the world today shows that Dover personnel are working hard, alongside their colleagues throughout the force, and need to be recognized with adequate pay and benefits. America's military is doing an exceptional job defending vital American interests in Bosnia, Iraq, and South Korea. Our troops are also using their incredible logistics skills to assist our Central American neighbors who have been devastated by hurricane damage. These are just a few examples among many of the United States' military working every day to create a more stable and safe world for all of us. In today's dynamic world, the military's task is a demanding one. 
   With this bill, we make it clear that we understand those demands and that we will continually strive to take better care of our troops. I have long been concerned that we have not always adequately addressed the compensation needs of our military, nor have we always provided for pay equity. For that reason, last year I amended the Defense authorization bill to include an increase in hazardous duty incentive pay for mid- and senior level enlisted aircrews. I am pleased that this year we have a comprehensive bill addressing the critical issue of compensation and equity. I have said it before and I will say it again, the patriotic men and women who serve in our military do not do so to become rich, but that does not change the very real needs they and their families have for adequate recompense. 
   The bill enhances the President's request for a pay raise, pay table reform, and changes to the military retirement system. The Joint Chiefs have said repeatedly that these three steps are their top priority this year. The 4.8 percent basic pay raise and the decision to increase future year raises by 0.5 percent more than the civilian raise index is an important step toward closing the pay gap between military and civilian employees. The pay table reform, which is identical to that suggested by the President, will make the pay structure more equitable and focused on performance. 
   Another important equity issue for the past thirteen years has been the military retirement system. The changes made in the summer of 1986 created an inequity in the retirement benefits for members of the armed services who chose to retire after 20 years. The end result was that experienced service members decided that the reward was too small to stay in the service for 20 years, compared to the benefits offered in the private sector and the needs of their families. This bill corrects 
   that inequity by allowing personnel to revert back to the pre-1986 system of receiving 50 percent of their base pay. It also provides an option to stay with the post-1986 system of receiving 40 percent of base pay along with a $30,000 bonus. This sends an important message to our troops that their service and experience today are just as valuable and important as they were before 1986. 
   I want to compliment the committee, and the leadership of Senator CLELAND, for including enhancements to the Montgomery G.I. bill. The original bill was written in World War II and needed to be adapted to the challenges that face members of today's military. Increasing the actual benefits and providing more flexibility in how they are used makes it easier for service members to attain their educational goals for themselves and their immediate family. In an era where education is increasingly vital and expensive, these changes are long overdue. 
   I am also pleased that this bill was amended to include important reforms of TRICARE, the military health care  benefits system. The bill will help the Department of Defense provide better services, reduce the bureaucratic hassle of obtaining those services, and make sure benefits are tranportable to different TRICARE regions. It also provides the necessary authority to increase the amount TRICARE reimburses providers in areas where such increases are needed to keep an adequate number of qualified health care providers available. Military health care systems must be able to compete with private health care systems for the services of quality providers. In addition, the bill will help the military better utilize its facilities by allowing TRICARE facilities to be reimbursed by other insurance agencies. It is my hope that this legislation will make it easier for American servicemen and women to get the quality health care they and their families deserve. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I share with my colleagues a concern that we need to be careful in our allocation of limited resources before we have adopted a budget. It is imperative that this bill actually help our troops and not create new resource problems in other areas. For that reason, I am also very pleased to see the requirement for the Secretary of Defense provide an annual report on how this bill impacts recruiting and retention. This requirement will allow us to measure the effectiveness of the bill and make sure that we have chosen the right mix of incentives for the brave men and women who work so hard in defense of all of us. 
   Overall, I believe this bill is an important step in support of our troops. It improves pay equity and overall compensation levels. It also addresses inequities in the retirement system and it enhances the benefit system, including military health care benefits. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. BIDEN. Let me begin by stating what I believe the American people view as the obvious. There are no good guys in this sordid affair. Rightly or wrongly, the public has concluded that the President is an adulterer and liar; that Ken Starr has abused his authority by unfair tactics born out of vindictiveness; that the House Managers have acted in a narrowly partisan way and are now desperately attempting to justify their actions for their own political reputation. Finally, they have concluded that Monica Lewinsky was both used and a user, while Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg, Paula Jones and her official and unofficial legal team are part of a larger political plot to ``get the President''. 
   All of that is beyond our ability to effect. Our job is not to dissect the motives or even the tactics of Ken Starr, the trial lawyers, Linda Tripp, and others. Our only job is to determine whether the President of the United States by his conduct committed the specific acts alleged in the two Articles of Impeachment. Not generally, but specifically: Did he do what is alleged? And if he did, do these actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors necessary to justify the most obviously anti-democratic act the Senate can engage in--overturning an election by convicting the President. 
   It is very important--both for history's sake and for fairness' sake--that we keep our eye on the ball. When I tried cases, I learned from a man named Sid Balick--he used to say at the outset to the jury:  
   Keep your eye on the ball. The issue is not whether my client is a man you would want your daughter to date--a man you would invite home to dinner. The issue is did my client kill Cock Robbin--period.  
   But if we listen to the oft-times confusing presentation of the House Managers--they would have us think that it is sufficient for us to conclude that we would not trust him with our daughters and not invite him home for dinner in order to convict. 
   Much more is required. The House set the standard we must repair to in the Articles--did he commit a criminal offense? That is what they allege; that is what they must prove. 
   The Managers keep saying that this case is about what standards we want our President to meet. We hear Flanders Fields intoned--the honor of our most decorated heroes. How incredibly self-serving and autocratic such a plea is. 
   The American people are fully capable--without our guidance or advice--to determine what standards they want our President to meet. That is an appropriate question to ask ourselves when we enter the voting booth to vote--it is not when we rise on this floor to vote. 
   Spare me from those who would tell the American people what standard they must apply when voting for President. Ours is an Impeachment standard and our oath to do justice under that standard. 
   Impeachment is about what standard to use in deciding whether or not to remove a President duly elected by the people. 
   These are two very different questions and we must not, we cannot, get them confused. You and I and the American people can apply any standard we want our President to meet when we go to the polls on election day. 
   Only the Constitution can supply the standards to use in deciding whether or not to remove the President--and--in my view, this case does not meet that standard, for two reasons. 
   First, the facts do not sustain the House Managers' case. According to the House's own theory, we must find that the President has violated federal  criminal statutes--not just that he did bad things. In all good conscience, I just cannot believe that any jury would convict the President of any of the criminal charges on these facts. I also believe that it is our constitutional duty to give the President the benefit of the doubt on the facts. To me, the allegations that the President violated Title 18 were left in a shambles on this floor. 
   But I do not have time to dwell on the facts. So let me turn to the second reason: the President's actions do not rise to the level required by the Constitution for the removal of a sitting President. 
   We have heard it argued repeatedly that the Constitution does not create different standards for Judges and the President. But that argument fails to comprehend the organizing principle of our constitutional system--the separation of powers. The framers divided the power of the federal government into three branches in order to safeguard liberty. This innovation--the envy of every nation on earth--can only serve its fundamental purpose if each branch remains strong and independent of the others. 
   We needed a President who was independent enough to spearhead and sign the Civil Rights Act. We needed a President who was independent enough to lead the nation and the world in the Persian Gulf War. We still need an independent President. 
   The constitutional scholarship overwhelmingly recognizes that the fundamental structural commitment to separation of powers requires us to view the President as different than a federal judge. Consider our power to discipline and even expel an individual Senator. In such a case, we do not remove the head of a separate branch and so do not threaten the constitutional balance of powers. To remove a President is to decapitate another branch and to undermine the independence necessary for it to fulfill its constitutional role. 
   Only a President is chosen by the people in a national election. No Senator, no Representative can make this claim. To remove a duly elected President clashes with democratic principles in a way that simply has no constitutional parallel. By contrast, there is nothing anti-democratic in the Senate removing a judge, who was appointed and not elected by the people. 
   Another contention we continue to hear is that the Framers clearly thought that obstruction of justice of any kind by a President was a high crime and misdemeanor. For this they cite the colloquy between Colonel George Mason and James Madison, who argued that a President who abused his pardon power could be impeached. That colloquy illustrates that it is not any obstruction that would satisfy the Constitution--rather, that the framers were immediately concerned about abuses of official power, such as the pardon power. 
   The House Managers have relied repeatedly on Alexander Hamilton's explanation of impeachment found in Federalist No. 65. But careful reading demonstrates that these articles of impeachment are a constitutionally insufficient ground for removing the President from office. Federalist No. 65 states:  
   The subjects of [the impeachment court's] jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.  
   Hamilton had the word ``political'' typed in all capital letters to emphasize that this is the central, defining element of any impeachable offense. Having emphasized its meaning, he did not leave its definition to chance. While all crimes by definition harm society, impeachable offenses involve a specific category of offenses. Using Hamilton's terms, these are offenses committed when ``public men'' who ``violat[e] some public trust'' cause ``injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' The public trust that resides in, to use Hamilton's hoary phrase, ``public men'' is what we would call today official power. 
   What other construction can be given these words? Hamilton did not define an impeachable offense to be any offense committed by public men. He did not define an impeachable offense to be any reprehensible act committed by a bad man. Only those acts that abuse public office and so harm the public directly and politically are impeachable. 
   While I would like to take credit for this insight into Hamilton's meaning, I actually stand in a line of interpretation that stretches back to the founding era. William Rawle wrote the first distinguished commentary on the Constitution, ``A View of the Constitution of the United States of America.'' In this treatise, he came to precisely the same interpretation I have described. He said, ``The causes of impeachment can only have reference to public character and official duty. . . . In general those which may be committed equally by a private person as a public officer are not the subject of impeachment.'' 
   Joseph Story was not only a long-serving and important Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, he was a preeminent constitutional scholar and author of a treatise that remains an important source for understanding the Constitution's meaning. He too emphasized that ``it is not every offense that by the constitution is ..... impeachable.'' Which offenses did he regard to be impeachable? ``Such kinds of misdeeds ..... as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of high offices of trust.'' Justice Story tied the definition of impeachable offenses to the purpose that underlies the separation of powers--safeguarding the liberty of the people against abusive exercise of governmental power. He observed that impeachment ``is not so much designed to punish an offender as to secure the state against gross official misdemeanors.'' 
   There is no question that the Constitution sets the bar for impeachment very high--especially where the President is involved. Federalist 65 bears this out, as do numerous other commentaries. 
   But Federalist 65 also sounds a warning--again, it is a warning that has been invoked over and over again--that impeachments inevitably risk being hijacked by partisan political forces. 
   Federalist 65 worried that the ``animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or the other'' would enable partisans to find a way to interpret words such as high crimes and misdemeanors to match the outcome they otherwise wished to reach--not necessarily out of any malevolence, but simply because of the great capacity that we all have to rationalize. 
   Here the rationalization is pretty easy--the President is a disgrace to the office, I honor and revere the office of the Presidency, so there must be some way to get this man out of that office. Therefore, his actions must rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. 
   It is tempting to go down that road --but this is precisely the temptation that the Framers urged us to avoid. 
   In Federalist 65, Hamilton defended the United States Senate as the only body that could possibly hear a presidential impeachment. ``Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual accused and ..... his accusers?'' 
   Hamilton was placing the responsibility to be impartial squarely upon us--a responsibility that has become embodied in the oath we took when the trial began. 
   Charles Black, the renowned constitutional law professor from Yale, boiled down the attitude that we as Senators must adopt in order to achieve an impartiality and independence sufficient to the responsibilities of impeachment. He said we must act with a ``principled political neutrality.'' 
   That is a tough standard to meet. In the Johnson impeachment, for example, James Blaine originally voted for the impeachment of the President in the House. Years later he admitted his mistake, saying that `the sober reflection of after years has persuaded many who favored Impeachment that it was not justifiable on the charges made, and that its success would have resulted in greater injury to free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was able to inflict.'' 
   And in our contemporary situation, former President Ford and our distinguished colleague and former majority  leader, Robert Dole, have both urged us not to go down the road to impeachment, but to seek other means to express our displeasure. 
   Charles Black knew that principled political neutrality was hard to achieve, so he suggested one approach. He suggested that prior to voting, a Senator should ask:  
   Would I have answered the same question the same way if it came up with respect to a President towards whom I felt oppositely from the way I feel toward the President threatened with removal?  
   In reaching a final decision, the question I wish to pose to my colleagues is this: Can you legitimately conclude that you would vote to remove a sitting President if he were a person towards whom you felt oppositely than you do toward Bill Clinton? 
   Given the essentially anti-democratic nature of impeachment and the great dangers inherent in the too ready exercise of that power, impeachment has no place in our system of constitutional democracy except as an extreme measure--reserved for breaches of the public trust by a President who so violates his official duties, misuses his official powers or places our system of government at such risk that our constitutional government is put in immediate danger by his continuing to serve out the term to which the people of the United States elected him. 
   In my judgment, trying to assume a perspective of principled political neutrality, the case before us falls far, far short on the facts and on the law.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the resolution offered by the Majority and Minority Leaders in honor of the life and legacy of King Hussein. 
   With King Hussein's death, the United States has lost a close, steady friend in a troubled part of the world. My deepest condolences go out to the King's family and the Jordanian people. My best wishes go to King Hussein's designated heir, King Abdullah. 
   In all of my encounters with King Hussein I was impressed above all else by his optimism and determination in the cause of peace. He never gave up, and in his memory, we must now press forward on the road to peace. 
   I was also touched by his humanity and personal warmth. He was always gentle and polite, never aloof or imperious. 
   Though his life ended too soon, his legacy will survive. His rare gift of vision helped guide Jordan through many dark periods. The heroic steps he took to help promote peace and reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis will continue to bear fruit. 
   His efforts to establish the foundations of democratic government in Jordan remain a worthy example for the region, where democracy is in short supply. 
   Finally, the partnership between Jordan and the United States, cultivated so carefully by King Hussein over 46 years and nine American Administrations will continue well into the future. 
   President Clinton has asked us to demonstrate our support for Jordan in a very tangible way--by promptly approving his request for supplemental assistance to Jordan. I hope that we can act on that request quickly to show the Jordanian people that we honor the memory and great achievements of their late King, and that our friendship with their country is enduring.

    Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join BILL ROTH, my good friend and colleague from Delaware, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, in introducing legislation important to our State. 
   Small businesses are the cornerstone of our economy--in Delaware and across the rest of the country. They are key players in the record economic expansion we have enjoyed over the last seven years. They are engines of job growth and technical innovation, and they deserve not only our praise, but our support as well. 
   The Small Business Administration has many programs that can provide that support--including loan guarantee--through a national network of district offices. However, Delaware remains the only State in the Union that is without a Small Business Administration district office. The higher hurdles between Delaware small businesses and the services of the Small Business Administration reduce the value of those services to Delawareans. 
   That is why Senator ROTH and I are introducing this legislation, that will guarantee that every state--including Delaware--will have its own Small Business Administration district office. This can be accomplished without any additional expenditures under the current Small Business Administration budget. 
   A district office in Delaware will make sure that Delaware businesses will enjoy the same access to Small Business Administration programs that their counterparts in other States now have. I look forward to working with BILL ROTH, and Congressman MIKE CASTLE in the House, to make this fair and sensible proposal a success in this session of Congress.

   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Violence Against Women Act II. I am pleased to be joined by several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are co-sponsoring this legislation. My colleagues joining me today include Senators SPECTER, BOXER, MURRAY, MIKULSKI, LANDRIEU, FEINSTEIN, LINCOLN, SNOWE, LAUTENBERG, REID, REED, DODD, INOUYE, KERRY, ROBB, KENNEDY, WELLSTONE, and SCHUMER. 
   Nearly 9 years ago when I first introduced the Violence Against Women Act, it was by no means a given that this body would consider it, let alone pass it. Although it may seem hard to believe now, at that time--less than a decade ago--few thought it either appropriate or necessary for national legislation to be enacted to confront the very serious problem of domestic violence and sexual assault. 
   The road to enactment was a long one. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the early 1990's, I convened several hearings on the bill and released many reports on the problem of violence against women. Three times I convinced the Judiciary Committee to favorably report the bill to the full Senate. Twice, I had to re-introduce the bill. 
   Nearly 4 years passed from the original Violence Against Women Act's first introduction before the Senate fully considered it. But at last--in September of 1994--the Violence Against Women Act became the law of our land. And, it did so with substantial support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, clearing demonstrating what I have always known to be the case--that the fight to combat domestic violence and sexual assault is not a partisan issue, but a serious problem that affects our constituents in every one of our States and in every one of our home towns across this country. 
   But even this bipartisan support to pass the act into law did not resolve the dispute as to whether the problem of violence against women merited a national response. As many of my colleagues will recall, throughout the summer of 1995, the Congress debated whether or not we should actually fund the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Fortunately, by the fall of that year, the Congress finally reached a consensus that the Federal Government both can and should provide significant resources and leadership in a national effort to end the violence women suffer at the hands of men, many of who they live with or have children with. That 
   consensus continues to this day. 
   Let me provide just a few statistics and examples to show how successful the initiative to fight violence against women has been, but how far we still have to go: 
   On the one hand, the number of women killed by someone with whom they are in an intimate relationship--such as a current or former spouse, a cohabiting partner, or a current or former boyfriend--had decreased markedly--by 60 percent--in 1996 as compared with where it was 20 years earlier. 
   And, the total number of women victims of domestic violence is decreasing as well. In 1993, the year before the Violence Against Women Act became law, 1.1 million women reported being the victim of domestic violence or sexual assault. By 1996, the last year for which we have complete statistics, the number had fallen by 25 percent to about 840,000. This is still far, far too many, of course--even one victim is too many--but it represents an encouraging trend nonetheless that I believe we can attribute in part to the successes of this national effort. 
   However, the news is not all good. One-fourth--25 percent--of women responding to a nationwide survey in late 1995 and early 1996 said that they had been raped or physically assaulted by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or date in their lifetimes. And demonstrating that violence against women is primarily domestic partner violence, 76 percent of women who have been raped or physically assaulted since age 18 were attacked by a current or former husband, cohabiting partner, or date. These are troubling statistics. But the successes of the Violence Against Women Act are combating these trends in a variety of ways, such as: 
   Putting thousands of trained police officers on the streets to arrest abusers before they can victimize again; supporting police officers as they work to help victims; adding trained prosecutors who put these abusers where they belong--in jail--or enforce protective orders to keep them away from those they have abused; tens of thousands of women and their children have access to shelters that provide a safe haven; victims of domestic violence and sexual assault have access to a wide array of support services from counseling to legal assistance; and a national domestic violence hotline handles hundreds of thousands of calls for help. 
   Our consensus in the Congress reflects a fundamental agreement across our Nation: The time when a woman had to suffer--in silence and alone--because the criminal who is victimizing her happens to be her husband or boyfriend is on its way to becoming ancient history. 
   Today, we must build on this consensus and deliver on its promise--because for all the strides we have made, there remain far too many women and their children who are still vulnerable. The statistics I reported just now reflect that reality. Just because we have had some success does not mean 
   we can become complacent and abandon the fight against domestic violence now. And so, the legislation I am introducing today--the Violence Against Women Act II--has one simple goal: make more women and their children more safe. 
   This legislation builds on the tremendous successes of the original Violence Against Women Act in three key ways--it continues what is working; it seeks to improve what could work better; and it expands the national fight into new areas where the need is clear. 
   There are many other ideas and proposals in addition to those contained in this bill that deserve serious consideration before the full Senate debates this legislation. And, I am sure there are ways to refine and improve this bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make this bill the best it can be. There are many Senators who are deeply committed to combating violence against women, and many of them have joined me today, for which I am grateful. I encourage all of my colleagues to  review this legislation, offer their insights and lend their names as co-sponsors and leaders in the fight against domestic violence. I believe they will find that it offers comprehensive, sensible, workable, and cost-effective responses to combating violence against women. 
   Before I describe some highlights of this legislation, let me first emphasize what I believe to be the key, core element of the violence against women II. That central factor is a simple one--the money. We need to ensure that there continues to be dollars for cops, courts, prosecutors, judges, shelters, and all the elements which are working. Keeping the money flowing to where it works requires one simple yet crucial step--extending the violent crime reduction trust fund to 2002. The trust fund is due to expire in 2000. This is perhaps the most significant provision in the act I introduce today, and without it we will fail in the future to replicate our past successes in combating violence against women. 
   Beyond this fundamental step--and I cannot overemphasize the importance of the trust fund--there are four key policy areas addressed by the Violence Against Women Act II: strengthening law enforcement's tools; improving services for the victims of violence; reducing violence against children; and enhancing and supporting training and education efforts to enlist many more professionals in our shared fight. 
   On the law enforcement front, the bill introduced today starts with needed improvements to promote inter-state and inter-jurisdictional enforcement of ``stay-away,'' or protection, orders. This is also known as giving ``full faith and credit'' to valid protection orders from any jurisdiction where they were issued. It often happens that the cops in one State may not know that there is a valid protection order issued by another jurisdiction. It is not their fault--it is often a matter of training to recognize valid orders or the means of communicating and sharing information across state lines. This is a mobile society, and victims of domestic violence often find they must flee the place they live and where they previously 
   obtained a protection order so that they can keep themselves and their children safe. For these situations, we propose today a few simple fixes: Permitting state and local cops to use their ``pro-arrest'' grants for this kind of information sharing; encouraging states to enter into the cooperative agreements necessary to help interstate enforcement; and calling on the Justice Department to help develop new protocols and disseminate the ``best practices'' of State and local cops. 
   These are all simple and common sense solutions, but very necessary nevertheless. This bill will help these fixes become reality. 
   Other initiatives in this bill are to: Enhance and expand the resources available for courts to handle domestic violence and sexual assault cases; target the ``date-rape'' drug with the maximum federal penalties; continue funding for police, prosecutors, law enforcement efforts in rural communities, and for anti-stalking initiatives; and extend the support of local police ``pro-arrest'' efforts. 
   Of course, a comprehensive effort to reduce violence against women and lessen the harm it causes must do more than just arrest, convict and imprison abusers--we must also help the victims of violence. This legislation proposes to assist these crime victims in three fundamental ways: Providing a means for immediate protections from their abusers, such as through access to shelters; easier access to the courts and to the legal assistance necessary to keep their abusers away from them; and removing the ``catch-22s'' that sometimes literally compel women to stay with their abusers--such as discriminatory insurance policies that could force a mother to choose between turning in the man who is beating her or keeping health insurance for her children. Another ``catch-22'' affects immigrant women who are sometimes faced with a similar insidious ``choice.'' In 1994, we worked out provisions so battered immigrant women--whose ability to stay in the country was dependent on their husbands--would not have to choose between staying in this country and continuing to be beaten, or leaving their abusers, but in doing so have to also leave our country (perhaps even without their children). This bill fixes aspects of this problem that leave an abused woman with such a horrible, unfair and immoral choice. 
   Those are this bill's three general policy goals. Let me outline more specifically just how our legislation proposes to boost the protections for the victims of violence. 
   First and foremost, we must build on our successful effort to provide more shelter space for battered women and 
   their children. There have been significant efforts already to fund shelters for women who are victims of domestic violence and their children. However, the unmet need for shelter remains significant. For example, data from six states, which together have about 16 percent of the nation's population had to turn away more than 45,000 battered women who were seeking shelter because they simply did not have the space. Extrapolating these figures to the entire nation suggests that about 300,000 battered women and their children are turned away from shelters every year. 
   Current appropriations for shelter space stands at about $89 million. This legislation boosts this amount to $500 million over the the next three years. The additional money will help close the ``shelter-gap'' and bring us closer to the day when all battered women will have a safe, secure haven when they need it most. 
   We must also provide women with the Assistance necessary so that they can get access to help from our justice system. This bill does so in some clear and common sense ways, such as: Re-authorizing the expiring program to provide about $1 million per year for victim and witness counselors in court; continuing and expanding the highly successful national domestic violence hotline at a cost of about $4 million a year); and developing a coordinated approach to connecting victims of domestic abuse with trained, volunteer attorneys who can provide critical legal assistant. 
   To them at this very vulnerable time in their lives. I urge my colleagues to support--and even build upon--our efforts to put an end these real problems. 
   A third area where this legislation seeks action is on reducing violence against children. As my colleagues know, households where a woman is beaten are much more likely to also be home to child abuse and neglect. Moreover, we know that children who witness violence are much more likely to repeat the cycle when they are adults. 
   Here, our legislation proposes to continue two longstanding programs by providing: Resources to serve runaway and homeless youth who are victims of sexual abuse; and resources for court-appointed special advocates and special child abuse training for court personnel through the victims of child abuse act (originally cosponsored by Senator THURMOND and myself in 1990.) 
   The remaining area targeted by the Violence Against Women Act--two includes several efforts to help train and educate those already on the front-lines of the battle against violence against women. 
   Over the past few years, I have worked with several corporations who have begun their own workplace initiatives--everything from 24-hour assistance hotlines for their employees, training to help managers better recognize domestic violence, and even comprehensive employee assistant efforts. 
   Helping other companies start or improve--on their own initiative--such anti-violence efforts is why this legislation includes a national workplace clearinghouse on violence against women. The clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and help circulate best practices to companies interested in combating violence against women. 
   Another problem in the field involves the complex nature of criminal investigations into sexual assault cases. To assist the cops in the field who conduct these investigations, this legislation calls on the Attorney General to evaluate and recommend standards of training and practice of forensic examinations following sexual assaults. 
   Finally, this legislation continues the authorization for rape prevention and education programs. These programs provide public awareness and education efforts to teach young women how to protect themselves from rape and attack. 
   I have just offered the most general outline of the contents of the Violence Against Women Act II. I introduced  this legislation in the last session of Congress. My colleagues and I worked diligently and productively on it last year and made substantial progress. This year, I am determined that we will complete the work we started last year and pass the Violence Against Women Act II. 
   I urge my colleagues to review this legislation carefully. This is not just a bipartisan effort--it is a non-partisan effort in which I hope every one of my colleagues will join me. I am confident they will find this bill a comprehensive and practical response that will help us meet a goal I believe is shared by every member of this Senate--making more women and more children more safe now and in the future.
