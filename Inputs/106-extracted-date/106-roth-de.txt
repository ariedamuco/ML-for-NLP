   Mr. ROTH. The senior Senator from Illinois is correct and I thank him for his kind words. He is correct with regard to the purpose and intended effect of this section. My understanding is that the antidumping duty order covering these entries has recently been revoked. I also understand that the domestic industry association that was the complainant in the dumping proceedings is aware of this legislation and does not object.

   Mr. ROTH. We should note for the record that during the drafting of this legislation, a few words were inadvertently left out, with the unintended consequence of the language being not as clear as we would like for Customs' interpretation. It was our intent with this legislation that re-liquidation should occur within 90 days of enactment. This was the intent of the Congress when it reviewed and passed this section.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this bill passed by the Senate satisfies the United States' WTO obligations and ensures that U.S. companies will compete on a level playing field in the global marketplace. 
   By enacting this legislation, we will avoid a needless trade dispute, protect the American economy, and satisfy our international obligations to our trading partners. This bill also represents a continuation of this Senate's outstanding record of accomplishment in promoting free trade. This legislation is the third significant piece of trade legislation passed by the Senate this year. I believe you would have to search long and hard to find a better record of trade legislation. 
   I don't believe it is necessary to go through the extended history of the dispute between the United States and the European Union that gave rise to the need for the bill before us. The bill represents a good faith attempt to comply with the WTO's ruling that the current FSC provisions constitute an illegal export subsidy. This bill withdraws the current FSC provisions and, in their place, makes fundamental adjustments to the Internal Revenue Code that incorporate territorial features akin to those of several European tax systems. The bill not only addresses the specific concerns raised by the WTO, it also takes into account the comments received from the EU in the course of consultations over the last eight months. 
   I want to stress the need to pass this bill. Failure to do so could result in the imposition of retaliatory duties against American exports to the European Union. Under the WTO rules, the EU will have the right to retaliate against U.S. exports as of today unless this legislation is passed. A failure to enact this legislation would prove costly for the American worker, the American farmer, and for American business. 
   So it is with a great sense of satisfaction that we pass this bill today. I compliment the Senate on its farsighted vote for passage of this legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to address the comprehensive tax and Medicare conference report that is pending before the Senate. We have worked long and hard on this package, but the result is certainly worth the effort. If our objective is to provide legislation that promotes an environment conducive to jobs, opportunity and growth--security for our families and retirees--and greater access to quality health care, then this is a package worthy of praise. 
   The numerous provisions in this legislation are too many to address in a single floor statement, and they certainly cover a lot of important initiatives. But they have a central theme: strengthening individuals and famiies--increasing prosperity, building security in retirement, promoting access to health care, improving quality of life, and assisting small businesses and farmers. 
   This legislation offers over 50 provisions to strengthen IRAs and pension plans. With broad bipartisan support, it increases IRA contributions from $2,000 to $5,000, and allows a $1,500 IRA catch-up contribution for those age 50 and above. The increase in the amount an individual is allowed to put away will enable IRA participants to earn a full $1 million more for retirement, if they save the maximum amount each year and begin their program at age 25. 
   This is tremendous empowerment, Mr. President, but it is only the beginning of what this legislation will do. It also allows individuals to increase contribution limits in 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans from $10,500 to $15,000 a year. And it allows employees over the age of 50 to make additional $5,000 contributions to these plans. 
   This is especially important for women, many of whom take time off from work to raise children. Now, when they return, they can make critical catch-up payments to strengthen their retirement savings. And for those individuals who change jobs, this legislation provides easier transfers to be made between IRAs and employer plans, and it reduces the complexity of plan administration. 
   One of the most innovative new tools provided in this legislation is the creation of the Roth 401(k). Like the Roth IRA, the Roth 401(k) will allow employees to make after-tax contributions to accounts where distributions will be tax free at retirement. This allows investment income to grow faster, as it is taxed only once--when it is earned. Interest build-up and withdrawal--like the Roth IRA--remain free from taxation. 
   To increase access to quality health care, this legislation includes major refinements to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. These are in addition to $27 billion worth of refinements enacted last year, as part of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This legislation offers improved benefits for Medicare seniors, expanding preventative benefits, lowering out-of-pocket outpatient costs, and covering several new exams, screening and therapies. 
   Going even further, this legislation provides improved access to Medigap coverage and protects access to important drugs. It lowers out-of-pocket hospital costs, strengthens rural, teaching, and critical access hospitals, and protects funding for home health services. It also increases access to care for nursing home patients. In the area of health care, alone, this legislation provides more than $30 billion in additional funding over the next five years. 
   Retired Americans will also be happy to note that this legislation fixes a math mistake made in computing the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for last year. The increase should have been 2.5% instead of the 2.4% that was actually awarded. The correction we've included in this bill means seniors will be receiving more than $5 billion in additional payments over the next ten years. 
   For children, we take an important step to strengthen the State Children's Health Insurance Program by establishing policies for the retention and redistribution of unspent SCHIP funds. We also include measures to begin to protect the financial integrity of the Medicaid program. For individuals and families, we provide an above-the-line deduction for payment of medical insurance premiums for those who do not participate in an employer-sponsored medical plan. 
   We also provide an above-the-line deduction for long-term care insurance, and we allow individuals who incur long-term care expenses providing for relatives an extra tax deduction. 
   To help our family farmers and small businesses, this legislation offers a 100% deduction for payment of medical insurance for self-employed individuals. It creates FFARM accounts--tax-deferred savings accounts for farmers and fishermen, allowing a deduction of up to 20% of the income deposited into a custodial account. 
   Going even further to provide tax relief for small businesses, this legislation extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. It allows small businesses to use cash accounting methods without limitation, and clarifies and extends a number of expansion provisions and business deductions, including the business meal deduction. And these are only a few of many other provisions to support America's small businesses, the engine behind the historic economic expansion our nation enjoys. 
   Again, increasing opportunity and improving the quality of life is what this legislation is all about. For this reason, we have also included an important provision to help AMTRAK  build important infrastructure, to improve services, and help answer critical transportation needs throughout the country. There are some areas, Mr. President, where congestion from auto and air traffic are running at maximum levels. The answer is a modernized and efficient rail service--one that includes high-speed trains, not only to move passengers along the Eastern corridor, but all across America. 
   As a New York Times editorial correctly observed: ``Eighteen of the 20 most congested airports nationwide are in cities on designated high-speed rail corridors. The time has come for Congress and transportation officials to promote high-speed rail service as a means alleviating air traffic congestion.'' 
   Strengthening AMTRAK will not only help ease car and air congestion, but it will also help revitalize inner cities, encouraging downtown redevelopment. It will also promote jobs in construction, engineering, manufacturing, and service industries. 
   Finally, Mr. President, to strengthen our urban areas and promote greater opportunity for individuals and families in our cities, this legislation creates 40 new ``renewal communities'' and gives those poor areas a number of tax incentives to assist them in building up their economic base. Among other things, these communities--located in urban and rural areas--would get a zero percent capital gains rate to attract much needed investments. This bill also provides incentives to invest in low income areas around the country and to clean up brownfields anywhere in the U.S. This community renewal package also contains long awaited increases in the low income housing tax credit and the private activity bond volume cap. Both of these caps have not been adjusted since 1986 and have lost over 40 percent of their original value. This package also contains a number of measures to help school renovation and construction. 
   Each of the provisions in this legislation will go far toward promoting an environment of opportunity and growth--security for our families and retirees--greater access to quality health care, and an improved quality of life. 
   Mr. President, as we consider this conference report on legislation to provide tax relief and to protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, there is a lot of talk about the irregular process by which the legislation was created. No one is more unhappy than I that regular order was not adhered to. I have long labored in trying to reach a bipartisan consensus on the many important matters that comes before the Finance Committee. 
   However, I do not believe it useful for me to dwell on the causes of irregular order. Suffice it to say that cooperation must come from both sides. When it doesn't, when Senators instead invoke their rights at every turn, bipartisanship suffers. 
   As to the President's veto threat, it should be remembered that our early Presidents believed that the veto was available only to check the Congress from going beyond its constitutional authority. Later Presidents judged legislation on the whole of its merits: does the bill do more harm than good? I find it hard to find in his letter any mention of the harm he sees in this legislation. Rather, he says that this legislation is different from what he proposed, and therefore, he has ``no choice but to veto it.'' I find this assertion somewhat remarkable. 
   The Congress and the Presidency are comprised of 536 individuals. In fashioning legislation as far-reaching as this, no one can expect perfection from his own point of view. When I read the President's list of disappointments, I did not find it any longer than mine. And my reaction is generally shared by my colleagues. We are all pleased by some items. We are all disappointed by some other items, or by their omission. 
   That is because, Mr. President, this legislation is bipartisan in its content. Republican Members may be displeased that we included school construction bonds or dropped the FUTA tax reduction. Democrats may be displeased that we included a tax break for employees to buy their own health insurance or that we dropped the low-income savers tax credit. But where there are over a hundred provisions, it is not possible to write a bill the way each of us might wish. 
   It was clearly our intention to put together a package that would be signed into law. It was my desire that Senator MOYNIHAN be present during House-Senate negotiations, but the House majority objected. So, instead, I kept Senator MOYNIHAN informed, sought his counsel, and advocated his cause. 
   I think he did fairly well. He was successful in garnering increased funding for graduate medical education, increased funding for hospitals, increased DSH payments in both Medicare and Medicaid, and--this is very important--a special transition rule for New York with respect to the Medicaid upper payment level issue. On the tax side, he successfully obtained the AMTRAK provision to build a train station in New York City. And, as I recall, he was also an advocate of section 809 and 815 insurance provisions that have been included in the conference report. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN also asked, as did others, for the inclusion of long-term health care provisions and inclusion of a school-construction bond proposal. These were incorporated in a modified form. Perhaps not a total victory, but a substantial one nevertheless. 
   This progress was not accomplished easily. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has been steadfastly opposed to the creation and expansion of tax credits. Thus he fought the inclusion of several tax credit proposals, including those for AMTRAK and for school construction. 
   He was able to block several of them but not these two supported by the Senator from New York. And because these provisions were included, the chairman of the Ways and Means opposes this conference report. 
   Some Members have taken to the floor to try to create a picture that a few of us got in a room and wrote a bill entirely our way. But the fact is that some in the room lost and some outside the room won. And that is because, as a group, we had a paramount objective of constructing a balanced bill that would be signed into law. 
   I recall my own effort to remove the application of the nondiscrimination clause from the catch-up provision of the retirement security title. Everyone in the room agreed with my position. But the bill is not written that way. My amendment was dropped out of deference to the wishes of a Democrat, Congressman BEN CARDIN, who had worked on this legislation in the House. 
   We tried to write a balanced bill that would be signed into law. 
   In each of the past four weeks, there was some reason to believe that Congress was about to finish its work for the year. So in drafting this bill, we had to act quickly. I have given a great deal of thought to the process employed. I do not believe that if we had had bipartisan meetings with votes on the particular items, the text of the bill would be any different. What was lost in the process followed was any bipartisan appreciation of why the text is what it is. That is unfortunate. 
   At this stage, all I can ask is that you look at the text and decide if this is a good bill. You owe it to your constituents to do that. Do you want to provide Social Security recipients with the increased COLA they deserve? Do you want to protect American businesses from European Union retaliation against our exports? Do you want to update our tax laws to provide for greater retirement security? Do you want to provide tax incentives for impoverished communities? Do you want to provide more money for hospitals, hospices, home health, and nursing homes? Do you want to increase the minimum wage? 
   Or do you want to deny all the benefits of this legislation to your constituents because of the procedure by which the text was born? 
   This bill does not contain everything I'd like to see. It's not perfect. But it's a good bill, one that will help a great many Americans. It will help individuals and families prepare for greater security in retirement. It will help seniors receive improved Medicare coverage and a higher cost-of-living adjustment in their Social Security checks. 
   It will help small businesses and family farmers. It will improve education and ease traffic congestion. It will improve inner cities and help our hospitals. These are good objectives. They are objectives shared on both sides of the aisle.  
   And I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for this legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Senator, I share the Senator's concern. Last year, the Congress was concerned about how cancer hospitals would fare under the new Medicare outpatient prospective payment system. Cancer hospitals face many unique costs and the advent of exciting new treatments caused many to question the wisdom of applying the new outpatient prospective payment system to these facilities. To this end, the Finance Committee proposed and the Congress enacted provisions to protect these important facilities. 
   In brief, this provision created a permanent ``hold harmless'' for cancer hospitals. We instructed the Medicare program to pay cancer centers the same proportion of the facility's cost covered in 1996. In addition, we instructed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to make interim payments to these facilities consistent with this hold harmless.

   Mr. ROTH. I investigated this issue with the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, to ensure that they are not proceeding in a way that disadvantages these facilities and protects access to important cancer services. It is my understanding that the Medicare fiscal intermediaries are keeping the interim payments to these facilities artificially low in order to avoid the risk of overpayments. 
   While I think it is appropriate to make interim payments to facilities as accurately as possible, paying these facilities as low as 80-85 percent of what HCFA estimates final costs to be seems too low. If in fact these reductions are lower than previous rates of reduction when a system transition has been implemented, then I strongly urge HCFA to immediately review their proposal to make upward adjustments in the payment rates. Also, I urge the Administration to give special attention to the expeditious handling of the initial cost reports from cancer hospitals as they are submitted over the next few months in order to determine what appropriate payment levels need to be.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I applaud the passage of H.R. 4868. This bill includes a critically important provision that I first introduced on June 9, 1999, that bans the importation of products made with dog or cat fur. An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. We want this trade in dog and cats pelts to stop at our borders, and hopefully save millions of animals from this cruel practice. I have worked very hard to see this bill come to fruition, and I urge the President to sign it into law. 
   We are also helping companies across the United States to reduce their costs on vital inputs used in manufacturing a wide variety of products. Among these are provisions that help reduce the costs of potentially life-saving medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS. 
   I am particularly proud that this bill will have an immediate and positive impact on my home state of Delaware. There are provisions in this bill that reduce duties on imports used by Delaware companies to manufacture final products. 
   There are also restrictions on cigarette imports included in this legislation that will help ensure that cigarettes entering our market will fully comply with all health and labeling requirements. It will also ensure that Delaware receives its full share of payments under the tobacco settlement agreement, which will likely mean millions of additional dollars to my State and others.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave concerns regarding a provision relating to our trade remedy laws that is a part of the agriculture appropriations conference report that is before us today. My concerns regarding this measure relate both to the way this provision found its way into this conference report, as well as to its substance. 
   With regard to procedure, I am troubled, to say the least, that a significant modification of our trade laws is being made with no consideration or deliberation by the committees of jurisdiction. I would have hoped that the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee would have considered the importance of allowing the committee of jurisdiction--the Committee on Finance--to review this provision before deciding to adopt this measure in conference. After all, this amendment represents a dramatic change in the function and purpose of our trade laws. 
   Currently, our trade laws are designed to address any dumping or subsidized sales into our market by imposing an offsetting duty on imports. With the enactment of this procedure, however, not only will the domestic producer enjoy the benefit of having a surcharge applied to the sales of its foreign competitor, but they will also get a significant cash payment courtesy of the U.S. treasury. This is not an insignificant amount. According to the U.S. Customs Service, over $200 million of dumping and countervailing duties were assessed on imports last year. 
   What this will likely do is to encourage the filing of cases in circumstances that would not otherwise merit it. After all, the cash payment will not be made to the whole domestic industry. Instead, only those who supported the filing of the antidumping petition will be paid. Differentiating between different parts of a domestic industry in this way is unprecedented in our trade policy and completely unwarranted. 
   Now I understand that the money under this proposal is supposed to be funneled to research and development, and other legitimate purposes. But money is fungible, and I fear that we will only be encouraging litigiousness. 
   Who will benefit from this proposal? It is certainly not our consumers, who will pay significantly higher prices as a result, and who will likely have to suffer from an even greater number of cases being filed. 
   Our farmers and our other export industries will not benefit. After all, what will now happen with the enactment of this measure is that we will likely be obliged to pay in some future negotiation, such as market access on agriculture, to preserve what will undoubtedly be described as a private right of action to garner industry-specific government subsidies. 
   Ironically, the industries that traditionally rely on the dumping and countervailing duty laws will also likely get little benefit from this proposal. While I understand the frustration of some of those who have suffered from foreign dumping and subsidization, this measure, ironically, will do nothing to eliminate unfair trade practices or to ameliorate the conditions that allow these unfair trade practices to persist. We will only have undercut our own efforts to impose greater disciplines on European agricultural subsidies, Japanese support for its steel industry, or Korean support for their automobile industry. This is manifestly bad trade policy wholly apart from the serious technical deficiencies of the proposal. 
   And what will we say once our trading partners decide to follow our lead and adopt this same scheme in their trade remedy laws? Will we complain? Or will we sit quietly as our farmers and manufacturers begin to face yet another hurdle in their efforts to sell in foreign markets.  
   Mr. President, this is an ill-considered proposal that not only damages our broader trade policy interests, but it also up-ends the committee structure. I am a strong supporter of our trade remedy laws, but this proposal distorts our laws in a way that serves no constructive purpose. This is unfortunate and unnecessary, and I regret that the Agriculture Subcommittee chose to take this action.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, over the past several months, the Finance Committee has been focusing its oversight attention on an urgent problem in the Medicaid program related to the use of upper payment limits to exploit federal Medicaid spending. The Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, had assured me that it would solve the problem. It has not. 
   Instead, last week HCFA released a notice of proposed rulemaking that sanctions the de facto abuse of this vitally important program--a program that provides health care coverage to 40 million low-income pregnant women, children, individuals with disabilities, and senior citizens. This Administration has failed to live up to its responsibility to protect the financial integrity of the Medicaid program. Accordingly, I am introducing legislation today to do the right thing and stop the draining of potentially tens of billions of dollars from this program for our most vulnerable citizens. 
   The problem confronting the program is a complicated one. Through the inappropriate use of aggregated upper payment limits, some states have been using the Medicaid program inappropriately, including for purposes such as filling in holes in state budgets. This has turned a program intended to provide health insurance coverage to vulnerable populations into a bank account for state projects having nothing to do with health care. 
   In fact, as I examine the current situation I am vividly reminded of the Medicaid spending scandals we confronted 10 years ago when disproportionate share hospital program dollars were used to build roads, bridges and highways. Let me be very clear--this cannot be permitted to continue without endangering the program. 
   The use of this complicated accounting mechanism may seem dry and technical--but let me assure you that the consequences are enormous. If unchecked, both the General Accounting Office and the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services agree that we face a situation that fundamentally undermines the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program and circumvents the traditional partnership of financial responsibility shared between the federal and state governments. 
   I have been advised that what states are doing through upper payment limits is technically not illegal. The states are taking advantage of a loophole in HCFA regulations. It is time to close that loophole fully. 
   We must act because nearly 40 million of the neediest Americans rely on Medicaid for needed health care services. It is nothing short of a safety net. The program must not be undermined and weakened by clever consultants and state budgeters. What looks like loopholes to some are holes in Medicaid safety net for 40 million Americans. 
   Several months ago, I began working with the Administration to respond to this scandal. We must stop it in its tracks--while of course at the same time working thoughtfully and carefully with those states that have become dependent on the revenues generated through the use of upper payment limits to help them transition to  a more sustainable payment relationship between the state and federal government. 
   Finally, last week, after repeated delays, this Administration released its notice of proposed rulemaking--in a form much weaker than it originally intended when I first started working with HCFA on this problem last spring. The proposed regulation is inadequate. Instead of stopping a burgeoning Medicaid spending scandal, the proposed regulation looks the other way and tolerates the abuse of the program. 
   The proposed regulation permits facilities to be reimbursed for providing services at a rate one and a half times that Medicare would have paid for a given service. Then states are free to pocket the difference between the payment level and the often much lower Medicaid payment rates through intergovernmental transfers. Not only does the regulation allow those who are exploiting the program to continue to do so, it also invites all others to come in and help themselves. The regulation permits the scam to continue while only modestly attempting to contain its magnitude. 
   Simply containing wasteful spending is not sufficient. The American taxpayer who pays the bills should not stand for it, nor should the beneficiaries who depend on the program. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, whose advocacy on social policy issues is well-known, agrees that the scam must be shut down or the long-term health of the program will be jeopardized. 
   Not only does the proposed regulation fail to protect the financial integrity of the Medicaid program, it also has a very low probability of ever being implemented. There is virtually no chance this Administration will be able to finalize the proposed regulation before it leaves office in January. Until the regulation is finalized, nothing changes. No abuser state has to modify its behavior one bit, and more and more states will be under pressure to take advantage of the windfall their neighbor states are enjoying. If anything, the White House action may spur greater abuse in the Medicaid program. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that truly solving the problem will save taxpayers $127 billion over the next decade. the stakes are high and we owe it to the 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries to protect the program so it remains strong and viable for the years to come. 
   Accordingly, today I am introducing legislation that does what HCFA should have done but failed to do. My bill does not sanction abuse--it stops it. It closes the loophole, and treats non-state governmental facilities the same way state facilities are already treated. For those states with upper payment limits approved by HCFA already in place, it gives them two years to fully transition into compliance with the law. But no longer will schemes to exploit federal funding be tolerated. Even if HCFA is willing to look the other way, I am not. We must think about the long-term interests of the program and act now to stop the abuse. We should save the safety net for those that depend on it and save $127 billion over the next decade for he American taxpayer at the same time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join Senator MOYNIHAN and my other colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee in introducing the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Improvements Act of 2000. This is important, bipartisan legislation intended to address needed health care funding and other improvements in these programs that are so important to millions of Americans. Every year on the Finance Committee we maintain watchful oversight of these critical programs to make sure that beneficiary access to services is maintained, and that payments and benefits are adjusted to meet beneficiaries' needs. This bill would add about $28 billion in funds to these programs over the next five years. Following are some of the highlights of this legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed legislation that will dramatically improve the lives of lower-income women faced with a terrifying diagnosis of breast or cervical cancer. 
   Ten years ago, Congress created the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, through the Centers for Disease Control, to help lower-income women receive the early detection services that are the best protection against breast and cervical cancer. This important program has served more than a million women in subsequent years. However, the screening program does not include a treatment component. Instead, women who receive a cancer diagnosis must rely on informal networks of donated care. 
   Last year, Senator John Chafee introduced S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, to make it easier for women facing breast and cervical cancer to receive necessary treatment--and I think each and every one of us shares that important goal.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am, along with 14 cosponsors from the Finance Committee, introducing a Community Renewal tax reduction bill that will help all America benefit from today's economic boom. 
   As you know, the House bill embodies an agreement between the House and the Administration. Personally, I think that it would be wrong for the Senate to be silent in this process. It is important for this body to at least have a voice in crafting this legislation. 
   While I would have preferred that this legislation to have been reported from the Finance Committee, I believe my bill represents the Committee's will. It is largely composed of the Chairman's mark and amendments submitted by the Committee's members. Every Member of the Finance Committee had input into this bill. In the regular course of Finance Committee business, we would have reported this bill out of the Committee with an overwhelming vote in support. And the fact that 15 members on both sides of the aisle have joined me as original cosponsors, I believe, attests to the Finance Committee's approval of this legislation. 
   It goes without saying that America's communities are important. I believe that there are many ways in which we can extend help to them. I also feel that any time we can work together with the Administration to cut taxes we must try and see it to fruition. 
   While I listened to the concerns of every senator--both on and off the Finance committee--who approached me with a provision in which they were interested, I did not incorporate them all. I did not because I could not without the cost of the bill growing out of control. It is important that we not forget communities that may not have received as much as others from America's economic boom. However, it is also important that we consider the size of this bill in the context of other tax relief priorities that remain. These other priorities are marriage tax relief, retirement security, education, estate tax relief, small business tax relief, and other items. Community renewal tax relief must fit within the overall framework of the tax relief agenda. 
   This Finance Committee bill is fair and it is in line with the revenue loss of the package, proposed by Senators SANTORUM, ABRAHAM, and LIEBERMAN, which was considered earlier this year in the Senate. In designing this bill, members of the Finance Committee decided not to turn this bill into a grab bag of special interest provisions. 
   This Finance Committee bill includes a variety of proposals that will further the bill's goals of community renewal--rationalizing and simplifying what was and, was proposed to be, a hodge-podge of often conflicting provisions. It includes an immediate--let me emphasize immediate--increase in the volume caps for low-income housing tax credits and private activity bonds. It also addresses many, many important problems left out of the House and Administration proposal. Among other things, this package contains an energy and conservation component, a farm relief component, an Individual Development Account proposal, an extension of the adoption credit and the enhanced deduction for computer donations, a program to develop high speed rail around the country, and a broadband Internet incentive that will make sure that no one gets left on the wrong side of the digital divide. 
   One provision that I particularly want to talk about is the tax credit for renovating historic homes. This was one of Senator John Chafee's signature items and I am pleased to include it in the Finance Committee bill, not only because I support it, but as a tribute to our good friend. We all know that if he were here, he would have fought hard for this tax incentive. 
   In fact, Senator LINCOLN CHAFEE came to see me earlier this year. LINCOLN told that in his dad's last speech, John talked about the importance of the tax credit and said that it was something he wanted to get done before he left the Senate. Unfortunately, he is not with us today, but hopefully we can complete this unfinished business for him. 
   This is a fair package and a generous package. I believe it is one that this Senate should feel comfortable embracing. I hope each of you who has not done so, will do so.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, with passage of the legislative branch appropriations conference report, the Senate will successfully roll back one of the most regressive taxes in history and given Americans everywhere a much-deserved break. 
   For some time, now, I have pushed to repeal the telephone excise tax, a tax that is placed on individuals and families, regardless of income or circumstances. 
   Quite simply, if you owned a phone, you paid the tax, and along with its regressive nature, the tax was lamentable because it stood as one more example of how antiquated, unfair, counterproductive government policies not only outlive their original design, but become almost impossible to abolish. 
   The telephone excise tax was first imposed in 1898, more than 102 years ago. Its purpose was to fund the Spanish-American War, to provide for those who, like Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders, needed the wherewithal to defend U.S. interests. 
   At the time it was imposed, it came as something of a luxury tax--a tax on the wealthy, as few Americans owned telephones. 
   Roosevelt rode up San Juan Hill. The war came to an end. But Washington couldn't resist holding on to the revenue. From time to time, the tax was repealed, but it always seemed to get reinstated--rising as high as 25 percent at one point--and placing an unfair burden on millions. 
   Today, however, we shall successfully eliminate the telephone excise tax, and this--in my mind--is cause for celebration. Studies show that individuals and families with income less than $10,000 spend almost 10 percent of their income on telephone bills. Individuals and families earning $50,000 spend 2 percent of their income for telephone service. Because of what we have done here today, these families--and all families--will benefit. 
   I'm proud of this action, grateful to those who supported repealing this excise tax. What we have done is not only in the interest of Americans everywhere, but it is a clear demonstration that we are willing and able to appropriately address the need to reduce the excessive tax burden that has been placed on the back of America's middle class. 
   My sincere hope is that this is the beginning of a long and successful trend. 
   On another issue, I am concerned that the legislative branch appropriations conference report--while it contains good news for taxpayers--while it contains good news for taxpayers--does not meet the full funding needs of the Internal Revenue Service. As you know, 2 years ago in a major bipartisan initiative, Congress successfully passed the largest IRS reform and restructuring effort in history. That law has been effective in protecting taxpayers and giving the IRS the direction necessary to re-engineer its business practices, upgrade its computer systems, and provide taxpayers with better service. 
   But in order to most effectively carry out Congress' mandate, and to fulfill its mission to collect and protect the Federal revenue, the IRS needs adequate funding. 
   This appropriations conference report, unfortunately, provides hundreds of millions of dollars less than what the agency needs. And the absence of proper funding will cut directly into the improved conditions that Congress desires. Unless additional funding is provided, the Service may be unable to effectively perform its audit and collection functions. Without adequate funding, service functions will diminish. 
   There will be a loss of telephone and walk-in service for taxpayers, a decrease in the level of toll-free service, and it will become more difficult for taxpayers to receive assistance. 
   We must provide additional funds to the IRS in other appropriate bills before this Congress adjourns. Only by doing this can we ensure that the IRS has the resources it needs to meet the standards of service and accountability that Congress has required. 
   Along with eight members of the Senate Finance Committee, I have signed a letter to members of the Appropriations Committee asking that funding be restored. And I intend to work with my colleagues toward this end. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we have had an excellent debate over PNTR, touching on many aspects of our complex relationship with China. 
   It was, indeed, important we had such an exhaustive discussion because the vote we are about to cast on PNTR will be a defining moment in the history of this Chamber and in the history of our country. 
   That is partly because passage of PNTR will create vast new opportunities for our workers, our farmers, and businesses. But it is also because PNTR will serve America's broader national interest in meeting what is likely to be our single greatest foreign policy challenge in the coming decades--managing our relations with a rising China. 
   China's accession to the WTO has been the subject of intense negotiations for the past 14 years. The market access package the U.S. Trade Representative reached with Beijing represents, in my judgment, a remarkable achievement. From the point of view of every sector of the American economy, and from the perspective of every U.S. enterprise, no matter how big or small, the agreement holds the promise of new markets and future sales. 
   For the citizens of my own State of Delaware--from poultry farmers to auto workers to those in our chemical and services businesses--gaining access to the world's largest country and fastest-growing market, which is what PNTR permits, offers extraordinary new opportunities. 
   Passage of PNTR is in our economic interest. I hope our debate has made that clear. But I hope my colleagues and the American people have come to understand why PNTR is also in our national interest. 
   To gain entry to the WTO, China has been compelled to move its economy to a rules-based system and to end most forms of state control within roughly 5 years. Indeed, in a number of sectors of its economy, China will soon be more open to U.S. products and services than some of our developed-country trading partners in Asia and Europe. 
   The results of China implementing its WTO obligations will be revolutionary. But contrary to what occurred in 1949, China will be transforming itself by adopting a fully-realized market economy, thereby returning individual property rights and economic freedom to the people of China. 
   Why has China accepted such a capitalist revolution? As Long Yongtu, China's top WTO negotiator and Vice Minister of China's trade ministry, said earlier this year, what is ``most significant at present [is that] WTO entry will speed China's reform and opening up. Reform is the only outlet for China.'' 
   In other words, China has no choice. Its state-directed policies do not work; free markets and capitalism do. 
   Mr. Long went on to say:  
   China's WTO entry would let enterprises make their own business decisions and pursue benefits according to contracts and market principles. Liaison between enterprises and government will only hurt enterprises. Contracts kowtowing to government, though they look rosy on the surface, usually lead to failure. After joining the WTO, the government will be pressed to respect market principles and give up the approval economy.  
   I agree with those who say that the rise of China presents the United States with potentially our biggest foreign policy challenge. But I also believe it presents us with enormous opportunities. The single most important step the Senate can take to allow the United States to respond to that challenge adequately and seize those opportunities is to pass PNTR. 
   We must, and we will, continue to press Beijing on the range of issues where our interests and values diverge, from human rights to proliferation to China's aggressive stance on territorial disputes. 
   Yet a China fully immersed in the global trade regime, subject to all the rules and sanctions applicable to WTO members, is far likelier to live under the rule of law and to act in ways that comply with global norms. Indeed, the WTO is exactly the sort of multilateral institution that can act as a reinforcing mechanism to make China's interests more compatible with ours. 
   As that happens, and as China's economic success increasingly comes to depend on stable and peaceful relations with its trading partners, Beijing will be more apt to play a constructive regional and global role. 
   Finally, if Asia and much of the rest of the world are any guide, China's economic liberalization will accelerate its path toward greater political freedom. In East Asia alone, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand have amply demonstrated how economic freedom can stimulate democratic evolution. 
   Ultimately, China's participation in the WTO means the Chinese people will be given the chance to shape their own destiny. As Ren Wanding, the brave leader of China's Democracy Wall Movement said recently, ``Before the sky was black. Now there is light ..... [China's WTO accession] can be a new beginning.'' 
   Mr. President, when we pass PNTR, that new beginning will be for the American people just as surely as it will be for the people of China. 
   Colleagues, let us begin anew by joining together to pass PNTR overwhelmingly.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I only want to echo what my friend and distinguished ranking member has said about Debbie. We have accomplished a lot in the area of trade in recent years, and so much of the credit should go to the staff who have worked so hard and so long. Top among those is Debbie Lamb, who has been available not only to her side, but has been most helpful to the majority as well. Sometimes I think people don't recognize the cooperation that often exists between Members of the two parties. But I think what Debbie has done shows that bipartisanship is still alive. We would not be here celebrating today's vote if not for her splendid contribution.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in keeping with the words of my distinguished colleague about Debbie, I want to say a few words of thanks to all those who worked so hard on this bill. 
   Of course, first, I have to thank my dear friend, our venerable colleague, and always gracious ranking member of the Finance Committee, PAT MOYNIHAN. It would never have been possible to be here today with the kind of vote I think we are going to enjoy if it had not been for PAT's leadership, for his knowledge and background, and his ability to bring people together. I thank him for his outstanding contributions. 
   I also thank Senators GRASSLEY, THOMAS, HAGEL, ROBERTS, and ROD GRAMS for helping manage the floor. We were on this legislation something like 11 days. There were times when PAT and I were called from the floor for other duties. It was most helpful to have these other individual colleagues helping manage the floor. 
   Again, I thank all of Senator MOYNIHAN's committee staff who are just as gracious as the Senator for whom they work. We have already talked about Debbie Lamb. But David Podoff--I want to express my warm thanks to you for bringing your expertise to bear on this legislative process. I agree with Senator MOYNIHAN. This is probably the most important piece of legislation that will be adopted this year, if not this decade. But again, it could not have happened without people such as Dave. 
   I would also like to thank Linda Menghetti, and Timothy Hogan, as well as Therese Lee, who I think was such a help as a member of the Senator's personal staff. 
   Finally, let me thank my own staff. I would like to claim that I have the best staff on the Hill. I certainly have one of the best, if not the very best.

Dan is really one of our great experts on Asia, and on international politics in general. I owe him so much for his help during these last 2 weeks. Thank you all for a job well done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today ends an historic debate on permanent normal trade relations with China. The vote we just cast was certainly the most important of this year and likely the most consequential of the past decade. 
   We have had a vigorous debate on PNTR as well as the full range of issues my colleagues have raised through amendment. 
   Because of PNTR's significance, however, I opposed all amendments to PNTR regardless of merit. And many of the amendments did have merit. Indeed, I would have supported some of them under other circumstances. 
   In the case of PNTR, however, a vote for any amendment would have forced a conference with the House and additional votes in both the House and Senate on a conference report. Had we chosen that route, we would likely have run out of time before we could have passed PNTR in this Congress. 
   And had we failed to pass PNTR this year, the only certain effect would have been to punish our workers, farmers, and businesses by placing them at a huge competitive disadvantage to their fiercest foreign competitors in gaining access to China's burgeoning market. 
   That is because PNTR does not determine whether China enters the World Trade Organization. China will enter the WTO regardless of what Congress had done on PNTR; and China's entry will definitely take place this year according to Michael Moore, the Director-General of the WTO. 
   What PNTR does is allow American firms equal access to China's market when China joins the WTO. 
   Let us remember that in joining the WTO, China has committed itself to abandoning central control and throwing its market wide open to the United States an all the other WTO members, all within roughly five years. Let me note here that for our part, the U.S. market will not be opened further to China; our market is already open to the Chinese. 
   In keeping with its obligations as a member of the WTO, China will have to extend permanently and unconditionally its greatly lowered tariffs and its expansively opened market to every other member of the WTO. In other words, China will have to maintain PNTR with all member economies of the WTO. There is only one exception to this rule: when another WTO member chooses not to extend permanent normal trade relations to China, China need not extend PNTR to that country. 
   Of course, there is only one member of the WTO that even considered denying China PNTR--the United States. In part, that's because there has been a belief that in denying the Chinese PNTR we would somehow force them to change their behavior in any number of areas, from human rights to Taiwan to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   But would denying China PNTR actually have changed Chinese behavior? Frankly, there is little logic to this argument. After all, the only certain result of denying China PNTR is that we would have deprived U.S. farmers, workers and businesses access to China's lowered tariffs and more open market--access that every other member of the WTO will enjoy. 
   How is it that putting Americans at a competitive disadvantage to the French, the Germans, the Japanese and the Canadians would have compelled Beijing to act in ways the United States would prefer? 
   I submit that in denying PNTR--and thereby undermining American economic access to China--we actually would have lost leverage over China rather than gain it. Only by engaging China economically, by permitting Americans to work within China and thereby pressuring her from the inside to restructure her institutions and advance the rule of law, do we stand the best chance of making Beijing more cooperative. 
   That's why most of China's human rights dissidents have supported China's entry into the WTO and PNTR. As Wang Dan, a leader of the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, said, China's entry into the WTO ``will be beneficial for the long-term future of China because China thus will be required to abide by the rules and regulations of the international community.'' 
   Meanwhile, the Taiwanese, the people most threatened by China, also 
   support China's WTO accession and PNTR. Taiwan's current and previous Presidents have both publicly affirmed their support for the United States fully normalizing trade relations with China. And as President Clinton stated in a letter he sent in response to an inquiry I made last week, the U.S. will make sure that Taiwan gains entry to the WTO just as soon as China does. 
   On the question of U.S. national security, the Americans most knowledgeable about the matter, including Presidents Ford, Bush and Carter, as well as virtually every living former Secretary of State and Defense, National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees that PNTR will advance American interests. They recognize, as General Colin Powell put it, that if Congress rejects PNTR, the result will be ``to make [China] more isolated, truculent and more aggressive .....'' 
   The vote over PNTR was thus about more than just economics. It was also about America's response to China's emergence as a leading power, a phenomenon which I believe presents us with potentially our most serious foreign policy challenge. But it also presents us with enormous opportunities. We can only respond to that challenge adequately and seize those opportunities through a sensible overall China policy. The clear objective of that policy should be to encourage China's constructive and responsible behavior and discourage its aggressiveness and irresponsibility. 
   I believe our China policy must have five central elements, and PNTR forms the core of the first--that of expanding our economic relationship with Beijing. We should seek such an expanded relationship because a China integrated into the global economy is more likely to behave in ways compatible with American interests and international norms. Thus, we should encourage China's development and participate in its economic growth by supporting China's accession to the World Trade Organization and by passing PNTR, as we have done. 
   The more China is integrated into the international economy, the more subject Beijing is to the harsh realities of the marketplace. Should China choose a path toward blatant aggression and destabilizing domestic repression, foreign investment will dry up and firms will move to other countries where the risks are lower and the returns are higher. 
   Moreover, we have a better opportunity to influence China to act in ways we prefer when we enmesh it in the sort of economic relationships fostered by granting China PNTR. 
   In addition, economic growth nurtured by participation in the global economy tends to lead to greater demands for democratic reform. Other Asian countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, have amply demonstrated the political evolution that accompanies economic development. By encouraging trade with China, we are also encouraging a process that is likely to lead to the sort of political liberalization that is in America's interest. 
   The second element of any coherent China policy must include preparedness to deal with China if its participation in world affairs proves disruptive. Strengthening our current array of bilateral security ties in Asia is thus essential. Those ties include not only the full security alliances we have with Japan, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia, but also the productive security arrangements we maintain with Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, New Zealand and other Asia Pacific nations. 
   Closer cooperation on security and diplomatic initiatives with nations in the Asia Pacific that share our interests on China can serve to prod Beijing to accept the moderating influence of global economic integration. It also provides a hedge in the event Beijing instead chooses an aggressive path.  
   Third, we must enforce current law regarding Chinese actions and be willing to challenge China on issues of concern. That is why we should continue to work to improve China's human rights policies and convince Beijing to abandon its repugnant use of forced abortions and grotesque practice of harvesting organs. We can pursue these ends, in part, by ensuring the success of the Levin-Bereuter Commission on human rights created by H.R. 4444, further supporting Radio Free Asia and condemning China at the annual human rights conference in Geneva and at other international fora. 
   We should respond to China when it persecutes Christians, Muslims and those of other faiths by using the authority granted by the International Religious Freedom Act. 
   We should continue to support Taiwan under the terms of the Taiwan 
   Relations Act. The TRA affirms that any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means would, ``constitute a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and be of grave concern to the United States.'' The TRA also commits the United States to making available to Taiwan such defense articles and services in such quantities as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability. 
   We should push China to negotiate with the Dalai Lama regarding Tibet, supporting the Dalai Lama's call for ``Cultural autonomy'' within the Chinese system. And we should support the actions of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues within the State Department, a position created as a result of Congressional pressure in 1997. 
   We should investigate credible allegations that Chinese goods have been produced by prison labor and enforce section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which bars imports of prison-made goods into the United States. 
   We should work with the International Labor Organization to make sure that China lives up to its acceptance of the ILO's Declaration of Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work, which among other things, affords the people of signatory countries the right to organize and bargain collectively. 
   We should work to counter Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery through strict enforcement of the Arms Export Control Act, Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, the Export Administration Act of 1979, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. 
   And we should use the WTO's robust dispute settlement system to ensure that China meets its obligations to open its markets and abide by the rules of international trade. 
   The fourth element of a coherent China policy is the continuation of high-level, regular dialogue with Beijing. Mistrust is bound to grow when we don't meet, particularly when the list of critical bilateral, regional and global issues requiring discussion is so long. Keep in mind that even in the darkest days of the Cold War, we held a consistent series of summit talks with Soviets. 
   Finally, we must nurture aspects of the relationship where we share interests and can cooperate. China has the potential to play a key role in settling the serious threat posed by North Korea to the South, as well as to the 37,000 American troops we have on the ground there. I cannot imagine the Chinese playing a constructive role on any matter of mutual concern--from controlling transnational crime and narcotics trafficking to protecting the environment--if we only threaten and sanction them. 
   In sum, to meet the challenge and reap the opportunities of a rising China, we must encourage economic relations with Beijing based on the China's accession to the WTO and passage of PNTR, strengthen security and diplomatic ties with our friends in the rest of the Asian Pacific, enforce current law regarding Chinese actions and be willing to confront China when necessary, continue high-level dialogue, and cooperate with China on matters of mutual concern. 
   In addition, the Congress should not shy away from criticizing Chinese actions that run counter to internationally-recognized norms or American interests. For my part, I will do everything in my power as Chairman of the Finance Committee to see that China not only lives up to its WTO obligations, but also begins the process of internal change that is essential if Beijing is to meet those obligations. 
   PNTR is not a panacea, and there will be many bumps on the road in relations between the United States and China. But PNTR is a key component of a coherent strategy for addressing the complex set of issues associated with the rise of China. That is why I am pleased PNTR passed overwhelmingly and with bipartisan support.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my distinguished colleague. The 10-K reports filed annually with the SEC are designed to inform investors about the operating conditions of publicly-held corporations offering their securities for sale on American exchanges. The 10-K reports are expressly designed to inform investors about the prospects of companies turning to U.S. securities markets and form a bulwark against misrepresentations that might mislead or defraud U.S. investors. They are, in fact, one of the bulwarks that make American capital markets function precisely because of their focus on information that is relevant to a publicly-held company's predictions of its economic conditions. 
   The information that the amendment of my friend would require U.S. publicly-held companies to provide at some additional cost is largely irrelevant. For example, what difference does it make to the potential purchaser of IBM's stock precisely how many foreign employees it has and where they are employed? Would a single error in IBM's 10-K report regarding the number of employees in Botswana affect the investor's decision to hold IBM stock? How would it benefit the U.S. investor to know the precise dollar volume of U.S. Steel's exports and imports of manufactured products listed by product and importing country? Would the misstatement of U.S. Steel's imports of semi-finished steel products on its 10-K report actually mislead investors as to the economic condition of U.S. steel or allow the investor to better evaluate U.S. steel's economic prospects relative to other issuers of securities on American exchanges? 
   Furthermore, SEC rules already require IBM or U.S. Steel to provide that information when relevant to the investor--in other words, where such information would affect the bottom line. My point is that my friend's amendment would not materially advance the interests of U.S. investors, but would add a potentially costly new reporting requirement on U.S. issuers. 
   More fundamentally, to the extent that my friend's amendment succeeds and we are unable to pass PNTR as a result, the damage done to the economic prospects of American publicly-held companies and to the interests of U.S. investors vastly outweighs any hypothetical benefit to investors that would accrue from collecting this information on an annual basis. In my view, the number that U.S. investors are most likely to be interested in is the $13 billion in new U.S. exports that are likely to flow from the ground-breaking agreement negotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky. That is the number that is likely to affect the bottom line in which American investors are interested. Furthermore, to the extent my friend wants to collect the date to illustrate that American companies are investing abroad simply to export back to the United States, that information is likely already to be reflected in the investment and import data that the U.S. Commerce Department already collects. 
   But, it is also worth questioning what those numbers are likely to reveal if we do pass PNTR and China does join the WTO. I have no doubt that what they will show is an increase in U.S. exports to China and, to the extent that we see an increase in imports from China, that those imports come at the expense of other foreign companies exporting to the United States. The International Trade Commission's report on China's accession reflects that fact. Now, it is important to remember that the ITC's report on the quantitative impact of China's accession was restricted to the effects of tariff changes under the bilateral market access agreement with China. It did not even purport to address the quantitative effects of China's removal of non-tariff barriers on trade in manufactured goods or agricultural products, much less the dramatic opening of China's services markets. 
   Nonetheless, what the ITC found was that the accession package would lead to an overall improvement in the U.S. balance of trade and, where China did export more to the United States, those gains would come at the expense of other foreign exporters. Given that we already know the affect of China's accession, is there any real reason to collect the date required by my friend's amendment? And, if we are debating the economic impact of China's accession to the WTO, would there be any reason to collect this date with respect to every country in which an American company either buys components or sells its wares? The answer is no. The amendment serves no practical purpose, particularly in the context of this debate. Therefore, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
   I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator HOLLINGS' amendment. This amendment would authorize the President to initiate negotiations with the Chinese to eliminate the trade deficit in advanced technological products if the balance of trade does not shift to surplus in these products. To be frank, I am not sure why this amendment is being offered to the China PNTR legislation. 
   After all, by passing PNTR, we will increase our access dramatically to the Chinese market once that country enters the WTO. The commitments that China has made as a part of its WTO accession negotiations with regard to high technology products are truly significant. For example, China has committed to eliminate quotas on information technology products at the date of its accession to the WTO and to eliminate tariffs for these products by January 1, 2005. Moreover, China has agreed to open its telecommunications and internet to United States investments and services. 
   In addition, U.S. high technology firms will gain the right to import into China, and to engage in distribution services, including wholesaling, retailing, transporting, and repairing. This will allow our businesses to export to China from here at home, and to have their own distribution networks in China. Without these commitments, U.S. companies would be forced to set up factories there to sell products through Chinese partners. 
   There is nothing about the grant of PNTR that will alter China's access to our market. To the contrary, China has specifically agreed to allow us to put in special safeguard mechanisms aimed at addressing disruptive market surges from China. We will also be maintaining special methodologies under our unfair trade laws that will help domestic industries in antidumping cases. 
   Ironically, this amendment is not aimed at eliminating any trade barriers or unfair trade practices. It simply dictates that if the balance of trade in certain products is not in surplus, then the President has to use his authority to work with the Chinese to intervene in the market to achieve a certain outcome. I'm not sure how my colleague from South Carolina would envision this happening. Would the Chinese government begin to void contracts that were freely entered into by U.S. importers, until the balance of trade moves into surplus? Would our government have to do this? I don't know what the answer is to that question and, frankly, I would hope that we never have to find out. 
   As my colleagues well know, I have opposed all amendments that have been offered to PNTR. I have done so because of my concern about how amendments would affect the chances of passage of this legislation. I want to repeat my concerns now. A vote for this amendment will do nothing to increase opportunities for our workers and farmers. Indeed, it will have the opposite effect. As such, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator HOLLINGS' amendment. 
   As my colleagues well know, I have opposed all amendments because of the impact that they could have on passage of PNTR. I want to restate that concern now. Any amendment that is adopted could doom PNTR and end our ability to gain access to the Chinese market once that country joins the WTO. 
   Let's not forget, we are not voting on whether China will enter the WTO. China will get in, regardless of what occurs in the Senate with regard to this legislation. What we are voting on is whether we will give our workers and farmers the same access to the Chinese market as every other WTO member will get once China accedes. The decision before us is that stark and that simple. 
   That is why I support PNTR so strongly, and that is why I have opposed all amendments, including some that I thought had great merit. 
   That is also why virtually every major agricultural organization has supported PNTR and supported my opposition to all amendments.

   Mr. ROTH. Just let me point out, these organizations know, as I do, that passage of PNTR is vital. It is vital to our farmers and our agriculture sector. These include the National Chicken Council and the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, both of which represent farmers from my home State of Delaware. 
   But it also includes national organizations and companies such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Grange, Cargill, Farmland Industries, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and many others. 
   Importantly, this list also includes groups that this amendment is ostensibly intended to help, including the National Corn Growers Association, the National Oilseed Processors Association, the American Soybean Association, the U.S. Rice Producers Group, the U.S. Wheat Associate, and the Wheat Export Trade Education Commission. 
   This is a long list, but it is worth emphasizing for all my colleagues to realize how much is at stake and how much will be lost if this or any other amendment were to be adopted. 
   After all, China is already our eighth largest market for agricultural exports. In fiscal year 1999, U.S. farm exports to China were about $1 billion, with an addition $1.3 billion of exports going to Hong Kong. 
   While China is already a huge agricultural export market, the potential for the future is even greater with WTO accession. China has agreed to slash tariffs for virtually every agricultural product, and to establish very high tariff rate quotas for key products, including those covered by my colleague's amendment. 
   As importantly, China has agreed to abide by the terms of the WTO SPS Agreement, which requires that animal, plant, and human health import requirements be based on science and risk assessment. 
   It would be particularly ironic if PNTR were to fail because of the amendment before us now. This amendment, at best, is unnecessary. After all, the President is authorized to negotiate with any country about any issue at any time. 
   Such negotiations would be entirely appropriate and necessary if there were concerns about market access or unfair trade practices that needed to be addressed. But this amendment would urge the President to work with the Chinese to intervene in the agriculture market to achieve a certain balance of trade. 
   It is because we have rejected these types of statist economic policies that our economy is as strong as it is today. Going back down the road of having the Government meddle unnecessarily in the market is simply not the answer. 
   In the end this amendment would do nothing to enhance our access to the Chinese market for our farmers. It would, in fact, threaten the potential gains that will become available to us with the passage of PNTR. 
   That is why I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it. There is too much at stake to do otherwise. 
   Mr. President, I am ready to yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend. The amendment is not only irrelevant to the underlying bill normalizing trade with China, it would unnecessarily limit the support Congress has directed Ex-Im and OPIC to provide to U.S. exporters worldwide. 
   First, and most importantly, I want to remind my colleagues that the point of this bill is to ensure that American workers, American farmers, and American businesses reap the benefits of an agreement that it took 3 Presidents of both parties 13 years to squeeze out of the Chinese. Those benefits would be forfeit if this amendment were to pass and thereby hinder our ability to see H.R. 4444 enacted into law. 
   Thus, the amendment would not only limit the actual assistance that Congress directed Ex-Im and OPIC to provide our exporters, the amendment could have the effect of denying them real export opportunities that are likely to equal $13 billion annually. 
   Second, the bill ignores the realities of how our exporters do business--pursue markets abroad. Generally, exporting does require you to invest abroad in some form even if only in the form of a representative office, and the available economic analysis suggests that American investment abroad enhances our exports. 
   The so-called ``benchmark studies'' of the Emergency Committee for American Trade or ECAT have amply detailed that effect. This past year, as part of the Finance Committee's review of U.S. trade policy, we heard from the Cornell professor who completed the study for ECAT. His testimony was compelling, he found that U.S. investment abroad increased U.S. exports and, pointedly, did not find any substance to the argument that trade represented a highway for run-away American plants, as some claim. 
   The obvious reason for that phenomena is that our market is already open with very few exceptions. If American firms were interested in moving production to China simply to export back to the United States, they could already have done so for many years. One thing this lengthy debate has made clear is that our market has remained open to the Chinese, while the Chinese market, until the agreement of this past November goes into effect, remains largely closed to U.S. exporters. Firms that simply wanted an export platform to the United States could have been exporting to the U.S. for the past 20 years. 
   In fact, what passage of PNTR promises is that U.S. companies will no longer have to move to China simply to produce for the Chinese market. Under the November agreement, our exporters can produce in the United States, export to China, and for the first time sell directly to the Chinese consumer without the interference of some state-owned trading company. In other words, passage of PNTR is the best way to halt any alleged erosion of our manufacturing base because you can make the goods here and sell them in China. 
   Third, this amendment would have a chilling effect on normal business practices that yield export sales. The amendment does not, for example, define what it means by a production facility or what constitutes ``moving'' such a facility to the People's Republic of China. 
   Thus, for example, would the Ex-Im Bank be required to deny any support to a U.S. exporter if it closed any facility in the United States or even reduced production in such a facility while it opened a sales office in China? Would OPIC be required to oppose any form of risk insurance for a U.S. company establishing a facility in China manufacturing goods for the Chinese market if the company had closed or merely reduced production in a U.S. facility manufacturing a completely different product? 
   Those are just a few of the complications that would arise for the Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and most importantly for American exporters for whom Congress created those programs if this amendment were to pass. 
   Congress certainly did not intend that the Ex-Im Bank and OPIC be hamstrung in providing support to our exporters. To the contrary, the explicit intent of Congress in creating those programs was to enhance our exporters competitiveness, not to hobble it. 
   I oppose this amendment for all of the foregoing reasons and ask my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hollings amendment. What this amendment would do is to urge the President to negotiate with the Chinese whenever there is a deficit in advanced technology products, even when there are no allegations of unfair trade practices. It is unclear what the result of these negotiations would be. Will the President urge the Chinese to prevent U.S. companies from transacting business in China until the balance of trade in these products moves into surplus? Or will the President raise barriers to imports into our own market, until the desired balance is achieved? 
   Whatever the intended result, the price to our farmers and workers would be too high if this amendment were adopted. Let's not forget what is at stake here. With China joining the WTO, the passage of PNTR will enhance dramatically the access of American products--including high technology products--to the Chinese market. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy. 
   The amendment is unnecessary because the President already has the authority to negotiate with any country about any issue at any time. The proposal is misguided because it seems to urge the President to take actions to eliminate a deficit in certain products, even if the balance of trade is not the result of any market barriers or unfair trade practices. What does this mean as a practical matter? Will the President urge the Chinese to void existing contracts until the balance of trade is in surplus? We just don't know. In the end, this type of intervention in the market is unwise and, ultimately, counter to our own interests. 
   I would also note that many of the agriculture groups that this amendment is intended to help support my decision to oppose all amendments. This includes groups representing rice, corn, wheat, and soybean farmers. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator BYRD's amendment regarding safeguards. 
   I do so even though I share my colleague's concern regarding the President's utter disregard for statutory deadlines in our trade remedy laws. The President's failure to issue timely decisions in recent section 201 cases was simply unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the President's failure to meet the deadline set for modifying the retaliation list in the bananas dispute at the WTO. This pattern of utter disregard for statutory deadlines simply must stop. 
   With that said, I must still oppose this amendment for both substantive and procedural reasons. 
   With regard to substance, it is vitally important for the Finance Committee to be given the opportunity to consider this proposal before it is adopted into law. As I noted yesterday, there are serious flaws in this amendment that could make it unworkable in certain circumstances. It would be reckless to adopt such a significant change to our trade laws without adequate review, particularly given the flaws that are already apparent in what my good friend has proposed. 
   I am also concerned that we are isolating the Chinese for differential treatment through this proposal. The agreement may not be inconsistent with the U.S.-China bilateral agreement, but it does create a procedure that differs sharply from our other trade remedy programs. 
   I must also oppose the amendment because of the potential impact that this amendment will have on the passage of PNTR. In my view, a vote for any amendment, including this one, is a vote to kill PNTR. 
   Mr. President, such a result would be devastating for our workers and farmers. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against my good friend's amendment. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this proposal offered by my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire. I must do so because its passage will endanger H.R. 4444, not because of the sentiments expressed in the proposal. 
   As the State Department Human Rights Report of 1999 states, in recent years there have been credible reports that organs from executed prisoners in China were removed, sold, and transplanted. Chinese officials have even confirmed that executed prisoners are among the source of organs for transplant. 
   Of course, they maintain that they get the consent of prisoners or their relatives before organs are removed. 
   Needless to say, China's organ harvesting practices are as gruesome as they are indefensible. But ending trade with China is unlikely to force the Chinese to change their behavior in this area. Indeed, by opening China to trade and to global standards of economic behavior we may well prod China to abandon its practices regarding organ harvesting. 
   Let us remember as well that H.R. 4444 establishes a congressional-executive commission on China which I believe holds promise for pressuring China to curb its human rights abuses, including the grotesque practice of harvesting organs. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, I must urge my colleagues to vote against this proposal. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I spoke at length about my opposition to the Thompson amendment on Monday. But I want to briefly reiterate that I believe this amendment, while well-intentioned, is seriously flawed. In particular, this legislation relies on unilateral sanctions that are too widely drawn and too loosely conceived to prove effective in countering proliferation. In a global economy, shutting off  Chinese and Russian access to American goods, agricultural and capital markets will not change Chinese or Russian behavior. Indeed, such actions would isolate the United States, not China, giving our competitors an open road to the world's biggest nation and fastest-growing market. 
   And make no mistake about it: though there have been changes to the bill to reduce the impact on farmers, virtually every member of the farming community--from the Alabama Farmers Federation to the National Chicken Council--has said in a letter that they are absolutely against the Thompson amendment. Moreover, for the first time, U.S. securities markets will be used as a sanctioning tool. That's why Alan Greenspan opposes this legislation. 
   The unilateral sanctions in this amendment are also indiscriminate in their application and could be applied to some of our closest allies, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France. Surely such actions will make future multilateral cooperation--which is absolutely essential to solving proliferation problems--far more difficult. Another problem with this amendment is that even though the President is theoretically able to waive sanctions, Congress gains the power to overturn the President's waiver through a procedure exactly the same as the counterproductive one we currently use in annually renewing normal trade relations with China. 
   In addition, the evidentiary standard used to trigger sanctions, one of ``credible information,'' is too low. Surely, critical national security actions should be based on a higher standard, especially when they are could very well be applied to our closest allies. It also appears that the Thompson amendment could have a disastrous effect on our Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--better known as the Nunn-Lugar Program--with Russia and Russian entities. 
   Section 4 of the Thompson amendment contains language that would ban Nunn-Lugar assistance to any Russian entity identified in the report required by the amendment of the President. And so this amendment could actually have the perverse effect of decreasing our ability to stem proliferation problems in Russia. The Thompson amendment also raises serious constitutional concerns. For example, Congress' disapproval of the President's determination could result in severe sanctions against persons for actions that were perfectly legal when taken. The ex post facto effect raises serious due process questions. The standard of proof, which could result in sanctions against individual U.S. citizens based on suspicions, rather than proof, raises separate due process concerns. The congressional disapproval procedures raise separation of powers problems. In reversing the President's determinations regarding sanctions, Congress will, in effect, implicitly be second-guessing the exercise of the President's prosecutorial discretion. 
   Proliferation is a matter of vital national interest. I applaud my friend from Tennessee for raising this issue, and I hope he will continue his work in this critical area next year, when I hope we can come to agreement on a measure that will gain the support of an overwhelming majority of this Chamber. But I must urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing the Thompson amendment. 
   Mr. President, I move to table the Thompson amendment No. 4132, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. China's record on family planning and its use of forced abortion is indefensible. The country's policy violates the most fundamental human rights. That is why the United States does not contribute funds directly or indirectly to China's family planning programs. 
   My good friend and distinguished colleague from North Carolina is to be commended for bringing the matter of Chinese forced abortions to our attention. I do not oppose his amendment on its merits. I only oppose it as an amendment to H.R. 4444. 
   As I said, if PNTR is amended, a conference and another round of votes on H.R. 4444 will be necessary, likely destroying any chance for PNTR. Therefore, I must ask that my colleagues join me in voting against this amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's amendment. 
   The amendment is designed to force the Secretary of Commerce to impose so-called ``voluntary codes of conduct'' on American businesses operating in China. The fact is, if the proposed codes were truly voluntary, there would be no need to compel the Secretary of Commerce to pressure U.S. businesses into adopting such codes. 
   More importantly, American businesses already do operate under codes of conduct. The most important code of conduct is, of course, U.S. law. 
   Another code of conduct American companies are bound to follow is local law, which American companies are bound to operate under when selling abroad. 
   In addition, U.S. companies also follow their own internal codes of conduct. There has been a revolution in corporate thinking over the last decade about compliance issues and corporate business practices. American business has applied the philosophy of ``best practices'' that began in the manufacturing sector, but now has also been used as a risk management tool. 
   In other words, adopting an internal--and truly voluntary--internal code of conduct has become a way of minimizing the risk, both legal and financial, that flows from some part of a company operating in a manner that is at odds with the law or corporate ethical standards. 
   Bluntly, there is a reason that corporations do this and it is not altruism. The greatest force ensuring the adoption of these internal codes of conduct is the capital markets. Poor corporate behavior, even if it does not violate the law, has an immediate impact on share prices in today's capital markets. 
   As a consequence, American businesses take their environmental and employment standards with them when they operate overseas. 
   I have with me a copy of a report prepared by the Business Roundtable that details precisely what American companies are doing in China in the way of ``best practices'' in terms of the environment and employment and other social concerns. 
   The way those companies operate is one of the primary reasons that so many Chinese workers are leaving state-owned enterprises to look for work with American companies in China whenever they can find the opportunity. Their wages, benefits and working conditions are almost invariably higher than any other workplace they can find. 
   My point is that there is no need to force American companies to adopt so-called voluntary codes of conduct with respect to their operations in China. They are already providing opportunities in China that confirm that there is a race to the top, not a race to the bottom, when American firms operate overseas. 
   Given the potential beneficial impact that our firms can have in direct contacts with employees, other businesses in China and directly with consumers under the WTO agreement, I would think we would want to do everything we could to ensure that American exporters were free to operate in China, rather than compelling the Secretary of Commerce to dictate to American companies on exactly how they should conduct their operations in China. 
   The reason I say that and the reason I oppose this amendment and support PNTR is that each American company hiring a Chinese employee is sowing the seeds of political pluralism at the same time. That is precisely how we can best foster both economic and peaceful political reform in China. 
   For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the Executive Summary contained in the Business Roundtable report to which I referred.

Taiwan is our eighth largest trading partner--isn't that correct? It would be ironic if her status did not change. She is qualified. I think all the work has been completed for her to become a member.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feingold amendment. 
   This amendment would change the mandate of the Levin-Bereuter Commission created by H.R. 4444 by mandating that it make recommendations to the Congress on legislative actions. Such recommendations would have to be introduced in each body, be referred to the Foreign Relations Committee and the International Relations Committee, and be considered by those committees and the Congress under rules similar to ``fast track.'' 
   I oppose this amendment for many reasons. As a jurisdictional matter, I oppose a change in the rules of the Senate that would refer a revenue measure to a committee other than the Finance Committee, as this amendment would do if the Commission recommended a change in the trade status of China, and I urge all Finance Committee members to support me. 
   Second, I see no need to compel a recommendation out of the Commission. As outlined in the mandate of the Commission, if they choose, they may make a recommendation to the Congress on legislative action. Compelling the Commission to do so strikes me as misguided. 
   Third, I see no need to fast track a recommendation by the Commission. The Congress can consider any recommendation by the Commission under the regular order, just as we are considering PNTR. 
   Finally, as I have outlined with every amendment, I believe the adoption of this amendment would unnecessarily risk slowing the underlying bill down. Therefore, I view a vote for this amendment as a vote to kill PNTR.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's amendment. I do not intend to address the merits of his proposal as a matter of U.S. labor law. Rather, my point is a far simpler one. 
   The current business of this body is a bill to normalize our trade relationship with China. This amendment simply does not belong on H.R. 4444 and has nothing to do with China's trade status under our law. 
   But, the price of adopting the amendment could be very high for every working man and woman in the United States. The reason is that the amendment could result in delay or defeat of PNTR and the grant of PNTR is the one step we absolutely must take to ensure that American workers, together with American farmers and American businesses, reap the benefits of China's market access commitments under the WTO. 
   What we would be sacrificing is, according to independent economic analysis, $13 billion in additional U.S. export sales annually. Expanding our export sales, as has been reiterated a number of times already in this debate, creates new jobs. And I point out, jobs in U.S. export sectors pay 15 percent more and provide 32 percent more in benefits than average. 
   What that means in practical terms is that the passage of PNTR and the exports we expect to expand under the WTO agreement with the Chinese provide real, tangible benefits to workers in American society. 
   I ask, as a consequence, that my colleagues join me in opposing the proposed amendment. 
   I ask the Senator from Minnesota, are you ready to yield back time?

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment would unilaterally impose conditions on the normalization of our trade relations with China that would backfire by effectively barring access of U.S. companies to the Chinese markets on terms at least as good as other WTO members. The amendment would also eliminate the positive force that American companies can play in the Chinese market by potentially leading to the delay in PNTR and cutting off the benefit of China's market access commitment for U.S. firms. 
   The amendment would have the perverse effect of narrowing the private sector in China in which some limited organizing is permitted. The point of this bill is to level the playing field between the United States and China, all of which would be forfeited if this amendment passes and becomes law. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am opposed to the use of forced prison labor in the manufacture of goods for sale in international markets. And, I firmly believe that any allegation, whether with respect to China or any other nation, regarding the use of prison labor ought to be vigorously investigated under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which bars imports of prison-made goods into the United States. 
   That said, I nonetheless rise in opposition to the proposed amendment. I do so for three reasons. 
   First, the amendment is unnecessary. Under section 307 of the 1930 act, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Customs already have ample authority to investigate allegations that Chinese enterprises are using prison labor. No new authority is needed, and no new certification is necessary. 
   Second, there is nothing about China's accession to the WTO or the passage of PNTR that limits in any way the ability of the United States to investigate allegations of the use of prison labor in the manufacture of goods destined for the U.S. market and to bar imports of such goods if the allegations prove true. 
   The WTO contains a provision that expressly permits the United States, as well as other WTO members, to bar entry of goods made with prison labor from their markets. Just to be entirely clear about what the WTO allows, let me quote from the relevant title of the WTO agreement. It states that:  
   nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures ..... relating to the products of prison labor.  
   In other words, we will retain the leverage we need following China's accession to the WTO to encourage China's compliance with its international commitments in respect of prison labor, particularly the 1994 bilateral agreement it signed with the United States. 
   Third, the House bill before us, H.R. 4444, already addresses the issue of prison labor and does so more constructively. The bill creates an executive branch task force to assist the U.S. Customs Service in the effective enforcement of our laws barring imports of goods made with prison labor. 
   As I said at the outset of my remarks, I join those who have been very critical of the Chinese Government for its failure to be more cooperative--on a more consistent basis--in rooting out and ending these practices. But, the proposed amendment would not advance our argument with the Chinese; it would, instead, prove counterproductive, by killing the chances of the passage of PNTR. 
   In light of that fact, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. 
   Again, let me reiterate, it is my deep concern that any amendment would kill this legislation, would kill PNTR. For that reason, I oppose the amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am as concerned about China's repression of its citizens as anyone in this Chamber. But I believe that in passing PNTR, Congress will actually take its most important step by far in fostering democracy and improving human rights in China. 
   That's because by enacting H.R. 4444, we will permit Americans to fully participate in China's economic development, thereby opening China to freer flows of goods, services, and information. Ultimately, that opening will change China's economy from one based on central planning to one based on free markets and capitalism. Moreover, H.R. 4444 will create a special human rights commission that will expose, and suggest remedies for, China's abusive human rights practices. 
   The forces unleashed by American and other foreign participation in China's market opening will help sow the seeds of democracy and human rights. 
   As Ren Wanding, the brave leader of the 1978 Democracy Wall Movement said recently, ``A free and private economy forms the base for a democratic system. So [the WTO] will make China's government programs and legal system evolve toward democracy.'' 
   We should remember that in East Asia, the flowering of democracy in such former authoritarian countries as South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand did not occur until economic growth in each had produced a substantial middle class. 
   American trade and investment, which will be fostered by PNTR, will help create just such a middle class in China, a group who will wield influence, and whose interests will inevitably diverge from the interests of the Communist Party. 
   But American companies will do more than simply assist in the development of a middle class. These firms will also bring with them business practices which coincide with traits best suited to democracies. 
   As Michael A. Santoro, a professor at Rutgers University who has studied the impact of foreign corporations on human rights conditions and democratization in China for over a decade, said in testimony before the Finance Committee, ``When Chinese workers learn the lessons of the free market they are also learning an important lesson about human rights and democracy.'' 
   Unlike workers in state-owned enterprises whose advancement often depends on fealty to the Communist Party, workers in American firms advance based on merit. 
   Such workers, who acquire wealth, status, and power through their own hard work instead of connections to the Communist Party are far less likely to respect the party or its functionaries. And make no mistake, today's best and the brightest in China all want to work for foreign businesses rather than in stifling state-owned enterprises, let alone for the government itself. Moreover, American firms are almost uniformly considered the most desirable because of the opportunities they offer. 
   Now, to compete in the global market place, foreign firms doing business in China must permit free flows of information. And such flows of information, of course, are the lifeblood of democratic government. 
   Professor Santoro stated the case well before the Finance Committee: ``In the same way that information sharing is essential to good decision-making and operational effectiveness in a corporation, free speech is essential to good decision-making in a democracy. It is hard to imagine that ideas about the importance of information flow can be confined to corporate life. Inevitably, those who work in foreign corporations and have gotten used to the free flow of economic information will wonder why their government restricts the flow of political information.'' 
   In addition to introducing ideas about information flow within their organizations, foreign corporations are at the leading edge in terms of pressing the Chinese government toward greater legal reform and regulatory transparency. Indeed, if China is to realize the full benefits of trade with the rest of the world and comply with its WTO obligations, it has no other choice than to institute the rule of law. 
   In fact, China is readying itself for this transformation by engaging, among others, Temple University in providing training in the development of China's 
   business law system with a special emphasis on WTO compliance. Temple Law School has been asked by senior officials of the Chinese government to educate more judges and government officials and to establish a business law center. 
   This endeavor will enable American and Chinese legal scholars to do joint research on issues related to business law and WTO compliance in China. It will also enable American legal scholars, attorneys, judges and government  officials to meet with their Chinese counterparts on a regular, organized basis to provide input into proposed or needed legislation and enforcement in an emerging Chinese legal system that will regulate aspects of a market economy. 
   Mr. President, foreign firms, in a very real sense, constitute the vanguard of social change in the PRC. As Professor Santoro said, ``Ultimately these social changes will pose a formidable challenge to China's government, as profound contradictions emerge between the Communist Party's authoritarian rule and China's increasingly free economy and society being created by private enterprise and the free market.'' 
   Meanwhile, the United States and other countries must continue to press China on its human rights abuses. Such public condemnation complements the special changes that will accelerate with China's accession to the WTO. 
   That's why the Congressional-Executive Commission on human rights in China that is created by H.R. 4444 is so important and potentially so effective. Among the tasks of that commission will be monitoring China's compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Specifically, the Commission will monitor: the right of Chinese citizens to engage in free expression without fear of prior restraint; the right to peaceful assembly without restriction; religious freedom, including the right to worship free of interference by the government; the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose a residence within China and the right to leave from and return to China; the right of a criminal defendant to a fair trail and to proper legal assistance; the right to freedom from torture and other forms of cruel or unusual punishment; protection of internationally-recognized worker rights; freedom from incarceration for political opposition to the government or for advocating human rights; freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile; the right to fair and public hearings by an independent tribunal for the determination of a citizen's rights and obligations; and free choice of employment. 
   In addition, the Commission will compile and maintain lists of persons believed to be persecuted by the Government of China for pursuing their rights. It will monitor the development of the rule of law, including the development of institutions of democratic governance. 
   And the Commission will give special emphasis to Tibet by cooperating with the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues in the Department of State. 
   Finally, the Commission will submit to Congress and to the President an annual report of its findings including, as appropriate, recommentdations for legislative and/or executive action. 
   Given the breadth of the Commission's work and the impact of foreign firms in China, it should come as no surprise that so many of China's most prominent dissidents and human rights advocates support the United States providng permanent normalized trade relations to China. 
   Wang Juntao who was arrested after June 4, 1989, and was sentenced in 1991 to thirteen years in prison as one of the ``black hands'' behind the Tiananmen demonstrations provided the Finance Committee with the following statement, and I quote, ``. . . if one needs to choose between whether or not China should be admitted [to the WTO], I prefer to choose `Yes' . . . In an international environment, independent forces will be more competitive than the state-owned enterprises. Such independent forces will eventually push China toward democracy . . . An overemphasis on economic sanctions will contribute to the growth of nationalism and anti-westernism in China. This will limit both the influence of the U.S. as well as that of the democracy movement in China.'' 
   Wang Dan, who was one of the principal organizers of the 1989 democracy movement; and who during the crackdown that followed, was listed as number one on the Chinese government's black-list of student counter-revolutionaries provided the Finance Committee with a similar statement. ``I support China's entry into the WTO,'' he said, because ``I feel this this will be beneficial for the long-term future of China because China will thus be required to abide by rules and regulations of the international community.'' 
   Martin Lee, the brave and outspoken leader of the pro-democracy Democratic Party of Hong Kong, which yesterday took the largest share of seats in Hong Kong's elections, said that the ``participation of China in WTO would not only have economic and political benefits, but would also bolster those in China who understand that the country must embrace the rule of law.......'' 
   Mr. President, it was when China was most isolated in the 1950s through the early 1970s that the Chinese people suffered the most severe depredations. The so-called Great leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution led to tens of millions dying from starvation and untold millions more suffering social dislocation and the worst forms of human rights abuses. 
   Mr. President, at a very minimum, China's opening to the world through its accession to the WTO will make a repeat of atrocities on such an unthinkably vast scale far, far less likely. 
   But I am convinced, Mr. President, that in passing PNTR we will do more. I believe that in passing PNTR we will have taken our most important step in advancing human rights and democratic values in China. 
   I'd like to close with another quote from Ren Wanding, the leader of China's Democracy Wall Movement. Here's what he said: ``Before the sky was black. Now there is light . . . [China's WTO accession] can be a new beginning.'' 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. 
   I yield back all the time on both sides.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my good friend. 
   I do so with some reluctance because I am actually quite supportive of taking whatever action necessary to ensure that the President takes seriously the deadlines set forth in our trade remedy statutes. 
   In fact, I would like to take a few minutes now to express my mounting concern about the White House's actions--or should I say, inaction?--in administering our trade laws. Frankly, I am very unhappy about the President's failure to issue decisions in sensitive trade matters by the deadlines set forth in the statutes. 
   There are many examples. The most notable may be two recent section 201 cases, the first involving lamb meat and the second relating to steel wire rod. 
   Both these decisions languished somewhere at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue for weeks--in direct violation of the law--before the President finally issued his decision. We are seeing the same thing now in the context of the President's decision on modifying the retaliation list in the bananas dispute. 
   I may agree or disagree with whatever decision the President ultimately chooses to make in each of these cases. But the credibility of the trade laws rests on the process being handled with a great deal more respect and seriousness than it has been thus far. 
   With that said, I must still oppose this amendment. 
   As a practical matter, there are many instances in which the process established in the proposal will simply be unworkable. For example, it is not unusual for the ITC to be divided on its recommendation of relief in a particular case. Because the Commission often speaks with many voices, it is unclear which of the Commissioner's recommendations would take effect under my colleague's amendment. 
   This problem may be remedied easily, but it clearly underscores the importance of allowing my committee the time to consider the proposal of Senator BYRD to ensure that we have considered its full implications. At least some of the problems that will arise if this amendment were to become law are already apparent to me, so I must oppose this amendment for the time being. 
   I am also concerned that we are isolating the Chinese for differential treatment in how a trade remedy is applied. 
   While this provision may not be inconsistent with the United States-China bilateral agreement, applying different rule to China in how we administer our trade laws could well  jeopardize our ability to secure the benefits of the uderlying trade agreement. 
   I must also oppose the amendment for the reasons that I have stated many times during these deliberations, and that is because of the potential impact that amendments will have on the passage of this legislation. In my view, a vote for any amendment, including this one, is a vote to kill PNTR. 
   The stakes are too high for our workers and farmers to allow this legislation to die. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment of my good friend. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my good friend from West Virginia. I do so because of my concern about the impact that amendments could have on this legislation, but also because of substantive concerns I have about his proposal. 
   Before I address the merits of his amendment, I wanted to take a few minutes to respond to the comments he made last week regarding the manner in which this legislation is being considered. 
   He very colorfully described this legislation as a ``greased pig'' and protested that the Senate had not had adequate time to consider its merits. 
   I am sorry that he feels this way, because with all the time I've spent on this legislation and with all the time I've waited for PNTR to be brought to the floor, I can say that this is no greased pig. 
   This legislation has been given a full and adequate hearing. The Finance Committee, which I chair, held three hearings on PNTR this year alone. At these hearings we heard from a full range of witnesses, pro and con, who discussed the significance of this agreement, not just from the perspective of trade, but also from the perspectives of foreign policy, human rights, religious freedom, labor rights, and others. 
   We have also benefited from the careful reviews by the Congressional Research Service, the International Trade Commission and the General Accounting Office, which has a team of analysts who have been following the China negotiations closely for several years now. 
   My committee also held an open markup, where the committee approved PNTR all but unanimously, by a vote of 19 to 1. My committee also considered the House-passed legislation in executive session, where my colleagues agreed with me and the distinguished ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, that we should support the legislation as passed. 
   Those actions, together with the hearings on PNTR that have been conducted by the Foreign Relations Committee, the Commerce Committee, and others hardly constitute rushed consideration of this important legislation. 
   Let us not forget that this legislation has been on the floor for consideration by the full Senate for 6 days, and will likely be here for another week. During this time we have been in regular order, and have welcomed all amendments. I would be hard pressed to think of another piece of recent legislation that has received more time and scrutiny that this has. 
   All of us who support PNTR understand well that amending this bill will threaten its passage. Our opponents, I think, understand this even better. 
   In the end, it is an exercise of our prerogatives to vote against amendments, given the threat they pose to the legislation. It is entirely appropriate for us to do so. 
   After all, there is nothing that can be added or subtracted from the legislation that will enhance our access to the Chinese market. There is also nothing that can be added or subtracted that will strengthen the unequivocal support contained in this legislation for human rights, labor rights, and the rule of law. 
   With that said, let me take a few minutes to discuss my colleague's amendment regarding subsidies. Although I unequivocally share Senator BYRD's views regarding the importance of compliance and regarding the significance of China's subsidies commitments, I must still oppose his proposal. I do so, not just because of my already stated concern about amendments, but also because of the substance of this amendment, which, in my view, is both redundant and flawed. 
   I would point my good friend to section 1106 of the Trade Act of 1988. The provision already conditions the President's extension of PNTR to China on a finding that China's state-owned enterprises are not disruptive to our trading interests. While I know that my colleague's amendment is crafted somewhat differently, the fundamental purpose of his amendment is already contained in section 1106. As such, it is redundant, and not necessary. 
   Moreover, this amendment overlooks the fact that we already have a specific time table for China to come into compliance with its commitments in this area--and that is the date of accession. 
   The amendment directs that China identify every entity receiving state support, yet the key feature of WTO disciplines is that they apply to the subsidy programs themselves. The Chinese have already agreed to end all prohibited subsidies, which is far more important that asking for a detailed company-by-company accounting of who gets what prior to China's entry into the WTO. Such an accounting, ironically, would delay accession, undermining the goal of achieving the subsidy disciplines in the first place. 
   All this is not to say that I, as chairman of the Finance Committee, believe that China's integration into the WTO system will be without complications. Setbacks and conflicts are inevitable. Anyone who thinks otherwise misunderstands the magnitude of the task that lays ahead for the Chinese. 
   That is why H.R. 4444 already directs USTR to provide a detailed annual report on China's compliance with its WTO commitments. That is also why the legislation authorizes the funds necessary to allow USTR, the Department of Commerce and other agencies to have the personnel necessary to monitor China's compliance and to take whatever actions necessary to enforce our rights.  
   The WTO process also takes full account of the imperative of monitoring China's compliance. That is why the WTO will establish a transitional review mechanism, through which WTO members will conduct regular reviews of all aspects of China's compliance. These reviews will be conducted as a matter of course and will avoid the need to resort to dispute settlement each time a conflict arises. 
   The Chinese have already agreed to such a review, though the specifics are still being worked out. That is why H.R. 4444 contains an unequivocal statement of Congress's support for such a review. I will take this opportunity to restate to both the administration and to the Chinese that it is imperative that the PRC be subjected to as rigorous a review as possible. This is essential not just for the United States, but also for the viability of the WTO. 
   In the end, I say to my good friend from West Virginia that we share a common objective, to end and I emphasize end--China's prohibited subsidies. At best, however, this amendment simply delays that goal. 
   None of the benefits of China's compliance will become available to us unless we pass PNTR. As I have said many times, any amendment added to this bill will likely kill this legislation, and kill the benefits of China's WTO commitments for our farmers and our workers. That is why I must oppose the amendment of my good friend.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment of my distinguished colleagues from Tennessee and New Jersey. While my friends have in good faith tried to address a critical issue--the serious national security threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery--I believe the approach they take in this legislation is flawed. 
   I say this as a former chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee--the committee with jurisdiction over nuclear export policy. Indeed, it was during my tenure in that position that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty came up for extension. I spent a good deal of my time in 1995 working to build congressional support for the NPT's permanent and unconditional extension. 
   Without the backing of Congress, the U.S. would not have been able to exercise the strong leadership essential to overcoming opposition from an assortment of countries. Fortunately, on May 11, 1995, the more than 170 countries party to the NPT agreed to extend the treaty without condition or qualification. 
   That was a proud day for me and a truly historic day in our ongoing efforts to make ours a safer and more peaceful world. The amendment before us today reflects similar admirable intentions. 
   However, there is a gap in this legislation between intention and result. In particular, this legislation relies on sanctions that are too widely drawn and too loosely conceived to prove effective in countering proliferation. 
   In addition, this amendment will harm our workers and businesses, our key alliances, and the multilateral non-proliferation regime that is essential to stemming proliferation in a global economy. 
   Finally, I believe this legislation will significantly compromise our ability to address the two most important foreign policy challenges this country faces--China's rise and Russia's potential slide into instability. 
   I will discuss each of these problems in turn, beginning with sanctions. 
   This amendment uses as its principal tool unilateral sanctions. Indeed, this amendment represents the single largest expansion in our reliance on unilateral sanctions since the end of the cold war. 
   And if there is one thing Congress should recognize after so many attempts at using such methods to force other countries to change their behavior, it is that, as Brent Scowcroft put it:  
   ..... the record of U.S. unilateral sanctions is one of unblemished failure.  
   In a global economy, shutting off Chinese and Russian access to American goods and capital markets will not change Chinese or Russian behavior.  Indeed, as Frank Carlucci noted in a letter he recently sent me, such actions  
   ..... would likely isolate the United States, not China, giving our European and Asian competitors an open field in providing goods, services and financing to the most populous nation in the world.  
   The fact is that telling China or Russia to buy machinery, aircraft and agricultural products from our competitors in Europe, Canada and Japan, instead of from the United States, does not provide us any leverage. That is because American workers and companies will be punished rather than Chinese or Russian proliferators. 
   Moreover, for the first time, U.S. securities markets will be used as a sanctioning tool. This is a particularly troubling aspect of this amendment because our capital markets have played such an enormously important role in fueling America's record-breaking economic expansion, and the strength of our capital markets is based on a degree of predictability and political certainty that this amendment would undermine. 
   That is one of the reasons why Alan Greenspan opposes this legislation. 
   But there are other reasons he took this position. Let me quote what he said in testifying before the Senate Banking Committee a couple of months ago. I will do so at some length because I think his views--especially when expressed in such strong and unusually unambiguous terms--are worth heeding:  
   In addition to questioning the value of this amendment, there's a very serious question as to whether it will produce indeed what is suggested it will produce. 
   First let me just say that the remarkable evolution of the American financial system, especially in recent years, had undoubtedly been a major factor in the extraordinary economy we've experienced, and it's the openness and the lack of political pressures within the system which has made it such an effective component of our economy and indeed has drawn foreigners generally to the American markets for financing as being the most efficient place where they can, in many cases, raise funds. 
   But it is a mistake to believe that the rest of the world is without similar resources. Indeed, there's huge dollar markets all over the world to lend dollars. 
   Because of the arbitrage that exists on a very sophisticated level throughout the world, the interest rates and the availability of funds are not materially different abroad than here. We do have certain advantages, certain techniques, which probably give us a competitive advantage, but they are relatively minor. 
   But most importantly, to the extent that we block foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system. 
   But far more important is I'm not even sure how such a law could be effectively implemented because there is a huge amount of transfer of funds around the world. 
   For example, if we were to block China or anybody else from borrowing in the United States, they could very readily borrow in London and be financed by American investors. Or, if not in London, if London were financed by American investors, London could be financed, for example, by Paris investors, and we finance the Paris investors. 
   In other words, there are all sorts of mechanisms that are involved here. So the presumption that somehow we block the capability of China or anybody else borrowing in essentially identical terms abroad as here in my judgment is a mistake. 
   So a most fundamental concern about this particular amendment is it doesn't have any capacity of which I'm aware to work. And by being put in effect, the only thing that strikes me is a reasonable expectation that it would harm us more than it would harm others.  
   The sanctions in this amendment are not only unilateral and uniquely encompass our securities markets; they are also indiscriminate in their application. Sanctions in the amendment would apply to ``persons'' defined as ``any individual, or partnership, business association, society, trust, organization, or any other group created or organized under the laws of a country; and any government entity.'' 
   The problem with mandatory sanctions is that they force a rigid response, one as likely to exacerbate a problem as solve it. At a minimum, they do not permit the discretion necessary to determine whether or not the sanctions provide the best approach to achieving the non-proliferation goals we all share. 
   Let us not forget that the mandatory sanctions of the Glenn amendment did not deter India or Pakistan from testing nuclear weapons. Those sanctions, however, did have an impact. Unfortunately, the impact was a negative one, causing harm to our farmers grievous enough for Congress to provide relief by passing the Brownback amendment. 
   Now even though the President is theoretically able to waive sanctions, Congress gains the power to overturn the President's decision through a procedure similar to and as cumbersome, disruptive and counterproductive to American interests as, the one we currently use in annually renewing normal trade relations with China. 
   For example, the amendment provides fast-track procedures for automatic consideration of joint resolutions, automatic referral of joint resolutions to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House International Relations Committee, automatic discharge from committee, and privileged status on the floor of both the House and Senate for the resolutions. 
   In other words, this amendment provides for procedures virtually identical to those specified in the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which has forced Congress to engage in it annual--and notably sterile--debates on China's trade status. 
   PNTR would end this counterproductive process, unless of course this amendment were to pass. If it did, annual votes would resume on sanctions, and not only on China, but also on Russia, North Korea, and undoubtedly other countries as well. 
   In fact, the amendment defines a ``covered country'' to include any country that was previously listed in the Director of Central Intelligence's Section 721 report and identified as a ``source or supply of dual-use and other technology,'' unless that country has not been identified by the DCI for 5 consecutive years. 
   In 1997, the section 721 report listed some of our closest allies, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France, as targets of acquisition for WMD programs. 
   The amendment thus could force us to sanction some of our closest allies, including those who work most closely with us in the fight against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   I cannot believe that sanctioning allies who have actively worked with the United States to enforce international nonproliferation agreements will help us in furthering mutual nonproliferation efforts. Surely such actions will make future multilateral cooperation--which is absolutely essential to solving proliferation problems--far more difficult. 
   In fact, that point was made by the Ambassadors of Sweden and France and the Charg&#233; of the European Commission in a joint letter they sent me. Here is a part of what they said:  
   We would like to emphasize the member states of the EU are strictly adhering to and enforcing the provisions of the multilateral export control regimes (Nuclear Suppliers' Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Australia Group, Wassenar Arrangement) and are parties to all the relevant Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Treaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention. The EU works closely with the US in stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We have worked jointly to strengthen the non-proliferation regimes and to address specific cases. 
   Against this background, we are concerned that [the Thompson amendment] could potentially be used to threaten EU entities with US sanctions. These EU entities are fully subject to EU member states' controls in compliance with all non-proliferation and export control regimes. We are also highly concerned by attempts to broaden the scope of export controls beyond those agreed at the multilateral level. 
   Let us reiterate that the EU and its Member States fully share the United States' determination to effectively combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as we express it in the Joint Statement on Non-Proliferation, which was issued at the May 1998 US-EU Summit.......However, we urge you to clearly target these pieces of legislation and thus to avoid the surely unintended consequence of undermining US-EU cooperation on non-proliferation matters. 
   We would also like to remind you that any legislation of this type undermines the credibility of multilateral efforts in the field of non-proliferation.  
   This last point the Europeans make--about how this legislation may undermine multilateral nonproliferation efforts is one shared by American proliferation experts such as Frank Carlucci. As he said in his letter to me:  
   The important and serious issue of Chinese arms transfers requires a concerted and effective multilateral--  
   I emphasize the word ``multilat- eral''--  
   response, not the imposition of unilateral sanctions which would have no effect on the  sources of the transfers. The United States must provide leadership to the international community on this issue, not isolate itself from our allies by pursuing a course of action that no other nation will follow.  
   Just as troubling as the sanctions themselves are the evidentiary standards used to trigger the sanctions. The measure of proof for violation of U.S. nonproliferation and export control policies, and thus the threshold for invoking sanctions contemplated by this amendment, is one of ``credible information.'' When this term has been used in the past, it has been defined as ``information which produces a firm suspicion, but by itself, may not be sufficient to persuade a reasonable person with confidence'' that the sanctionable activity took place. 
   Surely, critical national security actions should be based on a higher standard, especially when they are being applied to our closest allies. 
   There is one other aspect of this amendment that concerns me. Indeed, it is the one I find most troubling of all. This amendment will severely constrain the next administration in developing the sort of coherent, consistent, and comprehensive policies toward China and Russia that the United States has so sorely lacked for 8 years. 
   As important as curbing Chinese and Russian proliferation activities is, we must deal with the whole broad range of challenges these two countries present to U.S. interests. 
   In the case of China, for example, we have an interest in peacefully resolving the cross-straits issue as well as the potentially incendiary problems afflicting the Korean Peninsula, South Asia, and the South China Sea. We have an interest in encouraging China's transition to capitalism and the attendant political reform I believe that transition will help foster. And we have an interest in continuing to press China to provide its citizens basic human rights and religious freedoms. 
   In the case of Russia, we have an interest in fostering the evolution of true democracy, capitalism, and the rule of law; in curbing corruption and in resolving the deadly conflict in Chechnya and the continuing instability in the Balkans. 
   Given these and other critical foreign policy challenges posed by China's rise and Russia's potential slide into instability, we will not hold our policies hostage to individual issues, as important as those issues may be. 
   Stemming proliferation by China, Russia, and other countries will only be possible if we get our overall policies toward those countries right. Let me read something from a report on China put out recently by the Carnegie Non-Proliferation Project which I think is instructive. Here is what it says:  
   Encouraging Chinese acceptance of global non-proliferation norms has been a long-term process, concurrent with the larger effort to normalize relations with China ..... During the years of isolation from the West, China's posture rhetorically favored nuclear weapons proliferation, particularly in the Third World, as a rallying point for anti-imperialism. Through the 1970s, China's policy was not to oppose nuclear proliferation, which it still saw as limiting U.S. and Soviet power. After China began to open to the West in the 1970s, its rhetorical position gradually shifted to one of opposing nuclear proliferation, explicitly so after 1983. 
   China's nuclear and arms trade practices did not, however, conform to international non-proliferation regime standards, and major efforts over two decades were required to persuade China to bring its nuclear trade practices into closer alignment with the policies of the other nuclear supplier states. [Yet] there is still a gap that needs to be closed ..... 
   China is still on a learning curve, and endemic problems of a political, cultural and organizational nature exist in China's decision-making apparatus ..... Thus, continued vigilance and diplomatic interchange with China will certainly be necessary on nuclear matters. 
   The missile, chemical and biological areas will also require diligent attention. Up to 1994, China made progress on MTCR requirements. But it is still not clear that its professed restraint applies, as the MTCR requires, to missile components and technology--nor, indeed, that the restraint applies to more than complete `ground-to-ground' missiles. Compliance in this area, which is not defined by treaty, is harder to nail down with standards that China can accept politically--and also entails more scope for ambiguities. The chemical area is defined by treaty, provides for declarations, and lists restricted items, but it covers a very large industrial domain.  
   In short, Mr. President, stemming proliferation by China--or by Russia, for that matter--is a complicated matter that cuts across our broader bilateral relationship. 
   To achieve the goals we all share of ending proliferation, sustained examination, discussion and debate by the Congress and the next Administration is essential. And negotiation and diplomatic interchange with the Chinese and the Russians must not be constrained by unilateral sanctions, as frustrating as those negotiations have been and will continue to be. 
   Proliferation is a matter of vital national interest. In voting against this amendment, I will vote against its flaws but not its intent. In fact, I applaud my friend from Tennessee for raising this issue, and I hope he will continue his work in this critical area next year, when we will have the time to examine the issue thoroughly, and I hope come to agreement on a measure that will gain the support of an overwhelming majority of this Chamber. 
   Only then can we send the Chinese and other proliferators the right message about the urgency with which we view stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, the Senate proceed to a vote on amendment No. 4117, with time tomorrow morning before 10 o'clock equally divided in the usual form for closing remarks.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN, and myself have been here for several hours for the purpose of making progress on the consideration of the permanent normal trade relations with China. We both agreed that this is the most important vote we will face this year. In fact, it may be the most important vote we have had this decade. But I am deeply concerned that we are not having any of our colleagues making themselves available to come down to bring up the amendments that they say they want to offer. 
   Time is running out. This is the third day we have been on this bill. I thought we made some very good progress yesterday. We considered a number of amendments. But it is absolutely critically important that we continue to make that kind of progress today and next week. 
   I point out that the regular order of business is that if there are no amendments we ought to proceed to the vote on the legislation itself. 
   I want every Senator to have the opportunity to offer any amendments they may care to offer because there is no question about the importance of this legislation. But we cannot wait indefinitely. I ask my friends on both sides--on the Republican side and on the Democratic side--who have amendments that they want to offer on this critically important piece of legislation to please come down now. Time is running out. 
   Would the Senator from New York not agree with that?

   For farmers, take poultry. It is critically important to the economy of my State. China is the second largest importer of poultry and has offered to cut the tariff in half. This makes a tremendous opportunity.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss why permanent normal trade relations with China are of such critical importance to the United States. 
   One of the most remarkable strengths of the economy has been its ability to deliver a rising standard of  living and the creation of high-paying jobs. Trade plays a very critical role in achieving both goals. In that respect, normalizing our trade relations with China represents a positive step forward for American business, American farmers, American workers, and American consumers. 
   Just let me speak very briefly about security because we will discuss that in greater detail at a later time. Moving ahead with trading relations with China will help promote the rule of law and the acceptance of the way we do business in the international market. This will help strengthen the hands of those who are most interested in promoting the rule of law. Security-wise, if we reject PNTR, there is no question but what we play into the hands of the militants, the Communists, who want no change, the Communists who oppose promoting a market economy. 
   So I just want to say, as we discuss the economics of this agreement, that it is also critically important from the standpoint of strengthening those who want to bring China into the international community. What international trade does is let us focus on what we do best. 
   Our exports are an indicator of where we have a strong comparative advantage because we are more efficient in producing those goods than we are at producing others. Those industries where we are most efficient represent our economic future. Over the past 20 years, trade as a percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product has increased by more than 50 percent. Exports of goods and services this past year was close to $1 trillion. It is no surprise that the export sectors of our economy have grown faster than the economy as a whole. Nor is it any surprise that export-based jobs pay on average of 15 percent more than the prevailing wage. According to recent reports by Standard & Poor's economic consulting arm, DRI, the benefits are 32.5 percent higher overall than with jobs in nonexport industries. 
   Those figures reflect the fact that an increase in our exports translate into new opportunities for workers and industries with a greater number of higher paying jobs. 
   Since 1992, the strong U.S. economy has created more than 11 million jobs, of which 1.5 million--or more than 10 percent--have been high-wage export-related jobs. 
   The significance of PNTR to that overall picture is obvious. According to estimates by Goldman, Sachs, normalizing our trade relations with China and opening China's market through the WTO will result in an increase in our exports of $13 billion annually; thus China's accession to the WTO will enhance the economic prospects for U.S. export-led industries, and employment opportunities for U.S. workers in higher paying export-related jobs. 
   Exports, however, are only half of the trade picture and only half of the story of normalizing our trade relations with 
   China. We benefit from imports as well. Being able to trade for goods that we are relatively less efficient in producing means that investments in our own economy are channeled to more productive use. That enhances our ability to maintain higher than expected economic growth. 
   Imports also enhance the competitiveness of American firms regardless of whether they participate in international markets. The ability to buy at the lowest price and for the highest quality component allows American firms to deliver their goods and services to both U.S. markets and markets overseas at competitive prices. 
   International trade also has a broader microeconomic benefit of keeping inflation low. International competition yields more efficient producers who are under constant pressure to deliver goods and services at the lowest price possible. The United States benefits from increases in productivity that allow us to make more from less from the competition, and that yields lower prices for goods and services across the board. 
   To the extent that international competition helps keep inflation in check, it also allows the Fed to keep interest rates low. There is no doubt that keeping interest rates low not only helps consumers when buying a home or a car but deepens the pool of low-cost capital available to American firms to invest in productive enterprises. 
   Normalizing our trade relations with China is not a panacea, but it will have a positive impact on the economy by reducing the uncertainty and risk that our producers and farmers currently face in gaining accession to the Chinese markets and ensuring continued competition with its benefits for American companies and American consumers. 
   In other words, a vote in support of PNTR is a vote for a stronger economic future here in the United States. 
   I ask my distinguished colleague from New York, because I think it is important that the American people basically understand what this legislation does and does not do--I don't think people understand this legislation will not determine whether or not China will become a member of WTO. Isn't that correct?

   Mr. ROTH. Absolutely. One of the things that bothered me is that the United States, under three Presidents, has negotiated for something like 13 years on this agreement. The fact is, some very major concessions are made that benefit agriculture, that benefit industry, and benefit the workers. 
   The Senator was saying they are going to become a member of WTO. That means those concessions they made in negotiations with our USTR will become available to the other members of WTO but not ourselves if we don't grant them permanent normal trade relations; isn't that correct?

   Mr. ROTH. Let me say to the distinguished Senator, I had a very similar experience. Back in the 1970s when Carter became President, he was kind enough to invite me to go with a delegation he was sending to China. 
   The Senator's description of China in those days is right on the mark. It was truly a Communist country; everything we saw, ate, where we stayed, was controlled by the Government. One could not read anything unless it was published by the Communist Party. It was unbelievable depression. 
   I saw those same portraits. I was dumbfounded to see this portrait of Lenin and Stalin. It was 20 years before I went back. The difference is unbelievable. The Chinese will talk to you; they are not afraid; they don't just say the party line.

   Mr. ROTH. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and I would answer his question, indeed we have. 
   In May of this year, Senator BIDEN and I wrote to the Chairman of the energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, indicating that the response of the Corps of Engineers to the list of concerns raised by the State of Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control regarding necessary permitting, environmental studies, and environmental protection has been entirely inadequate. In our letter, we indicated that this project must not proceed until environmental information and permitting concerns raised by Delaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control are satisfactorily addressed by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   As a strong supporter of the Coastal Zone Management Plan, I am concerned about the potential environmental impacts of the proposed channel deepening. I strongly urge the Corps to continue negotiating in good faith with the State of Delaware to resolve outstanding informational and permitting issues through a legally enforceable agreement that will safeguard Delaware's natural resources. If an agreement cannot be reached through good faith negotiations, then the State of Delaware should pursue this matter in court.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's amendment regarding clean energy. I have to confess to my good friend and colleague that I do so reluctantly because I know of no one who is more experienced in the procedures of this august body or who is better equipped to lead an argument in which he believes so strongly. 
   I have to say that much of what he wants to accomplish I not only sympathize with but think it is critically important that we address those problems at some future time. 
   First, let me repeat what I stated at the beginning of the week. Any amendments that are added to this legislation would indeed force us into conference on this bill. We are in agreement on that. But given the limits of time, it would be uncertain whether we would have the time to take up and adopt a conference report. 
   Many of us on both sides of the aisle--my distinguished ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, as well as myself--strongly believe that this legislation on PNTR is the most important piece of legislation we will consider this year, if not this decade. 
   I know the ordinary process is to have conferences and go back and forth, but it seems to me one of the remarkable aspects of this Congress, and the Senate in particular, is the flexibility in the means of which we can progress on a legislative endeavor. 
   Those of us who believe it is of utmost importance that we open China's doors to American exports and products believe strongly that the best way to accomplish it, under current circumstances, is to try to keep a clean bill. 
   Let me point out for the public at large, particularly in the Senate--perhaps less so in the House--there are many opportunities to raise this type of question. We have a rule of nongermaneness. To me, always one of the great advantages, I say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, of being a Senator, even a freshman Senator, is you can raise significant legislation and have the opportunity to debate it on the floor, which is not always true of the House of Representatives.  
   But the point I am trying to make is that those of us who support this legislation--I would include the administration--there is a broad consensus among many of us that it is critically important that we move ahead with permanent normal trade relations, and that if we begin down the road of amendments, it could very likely prevent effective action being taken on this piece of legislation. 
   I point out that if we fail to act this year, China will still become a member of the WTO. We are disadvantaging our people, our companies, our workers, our farmers by not providing them the advantage of the significant concessions that Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated with her Chinese counterparts. 
   I would say, those who oppose the bill, of course, are more likely to be willing to take these risks than those of us who believe it is of such critical importance to our country. 
   So given the limits of time, it seems to me it would be uncertain whether we would have the time to take up and adopt a conference report. As such, it seems to me, a vote in favor of an amendment on this bill is a vote to kill it. It is really that simple. That is why I must oppose it. 
   It is ironic that by threatening passage of PNTR, this legislation could have the opposite effect to what was intended. After all, PNTR is essential to giving our companies, our farmers, and our service providers meaningful access to the Chinese market. This, obviously, includes the companies and service providers that are more than ready to sell China environmentally sound products and services, including those that my colleague seeks to promote through this amendment. 
   I strongly agree on the seriousness of the environmental problems in China. I think the distinguished Senator from West Virginia mentioned there are certain cities that, if you have ever visited, really illustrate the magnitude of the problem and understand the importance of improvement being made environmentally. 
   But whether or not we will be in a position to supply our technology, to provide our equipment and services, will depend on how effective we will be on moving ahead with granting PNTR in response to the upcoming accession of China to WTO. 
   Once China becomes a member of the WTO, we will be in a far superior position to provide the kind of assistance that will protect our interests, but that will happen only if we pass this legislation. Passage of PNTR will improve our ability to encourage China to begin to take the measures that are essential if we are going to address the problems of global warming and all the other serious environmental problems. 
   Indeed, I have to emphasize that, in my judgment, nothing will promote exports of these types of goods and services more than PNTR. This is not just because of the market access commitments the Chinese have made. WTO accession will also bring China under the disciplines of the TRIPS agreement, which is the WTO agreement on intellectual property rights. As my distinguished colleague knows, nothing is more critically important, and protected with greater care, than know-how, technology. The United States is a leader, the world leader in developing the most progressive technology, whether it is environmental technology or technology in other areas. And by passing PNTR, we help protect our technology. We gain a system by which we can enforce our rights; through a dispute settlement process that is part of the WTO. As a matter of fact, the Chinese have even agreed to some stricter provisions in protecting our intellectual property rights, which is important, I know, to both of us. 
   We should also not lose sight of the fact that the countries with the best environmental practices are those with the greatest level of economic development. China's WTO accession is the key element for ensuring economic growth in China and bringing them along the path of economic development. It is only with that economic development that we will be able to see long-term and sustainable progress towards environmental protection. 
   Frankly, this is as true in China as it is in any other developing country. It simply is a fact that poor countries cannot afford the types of environmental protections that the wealthier countries enjoy. As much as we may wish this were not the case, it is a fact we cannot ignore. That is why we should not do anything that would threaten PNTR's passage. 
   There are, in my judgment, many important reasons for supporting PNTR, but one of them is that it, together with WTO accession, will be essential an element of creating the conditions in China for improved environmental protection. 
   Again, I am very sympathetic to the objectives and goals of the Byrd amendment, but I also feel compelled to make it clear to all my colleagues that a vote in favor of this amendment is a vote to kill PNTR. For that reason, I must oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it. 
   Let me reiterate that China will become a member of the WTO regardless of the decision of Congress on PNTR. The legislation before us is not about that. What is at issue is whether we want to say yes to China's offer to open its door to our goods. 
   Let me also add that I was very much interested in hearing the comments of Senator LARRY CRAIG of Idaho, discussing on this floor his experience in a visit with the Chinese leadership. In that discussion, he pointed out that not only was the President very open about his support for the concessions that had been made in the negotiations with the United States, but he was looking forward to even greater opening of the Chinese market. 
   Again, I think it is important for everyone to understand that China has access to the American market. This legislation in no way affects that. What is important, this legislation opens up China's market to the United States of goods, products, technology. For that reason, it is critically important that we proceed and act affirmatively on giving permanent normal trade relations. 
   Once we do that, we are taking a giant step forward in permitting the kind of exchanges of environmental technology, of science, of equipment, of supplies that will help China address its serious environmental problem. I appreciate the concern of Senator BYRD about this environmental issue, but the best way, in my judgment, to begin solving and addressing that problem is by making sure China has permanent normal trade relations.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may utilize. 
   I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, and I disagree with my colleague that supporters of normalizing trade have no merit to their argument. The economic benefits of China's accession are unassailable. 
   According to independent economic analysis, China's market access commitments will mean an additional $13 billion in U.S. exports annually. Our current exports to China are $14 billion a year, which means the deal so ably negotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky will effectively double annual U.S. exports to China. 
   Doubling our exports to China holds benefits for every sector of the U.S. economy from agriculture to manufacturing to services. It also provides significant benefits for American workers. 
   The one step that we must take to ensure that American farmers, American workers, and American businesses reap the benefits of an agreement that three Presidents took 13 years to squeeze out of the Chinese. That step is to normalize our trade relations with China. 
   What that means in practical terms is an end to the unproductive annual review of China's trade status. That is what H.R. 4444 does--it eliminates the annual review that has provided no leverage over Chinese behavior. 
   My distinguished colleague's amendment would gut the House bill by once again requiring this unproductive annual review of China's trade status. The amendment would deny the benefits of China's WTO accession to our farmers, to our workers, and to our businesses. 
   Why is that? It is because the annual vote on China's trade status would violate our own obligations under the WTO, as was so effectively pointed out by the Senator from Montana, and allow the Chinese to deny our exporters access to their markets. That access would go, instead, to our European, Japanese, and other competitors. 
   My colleague from South Carolina has said that the Japanese know how to run their trade policy. Let me say that if we deny the benefits of this deal to our exporters, we will have given the Japanese a trade policy gift that I am certain they would never have guessed we would have been foolish enough to forego. 
   And, for what? How will denying our exports to China give us any leverage over Chinese behavior? Why would we suppose that cutting off our exports to China would do anything to influence  China's policies, whether on Taiwan, on weapons proliferation, on human rights, or on labor rights? 
   No. What we get in return for foregoing the benefits of this deal is the prospect of returning to the same unproductive annual debate we hold on China's trade status. It should be obvious to all, based on the arguments we have heard today about Chinese behavior, that the annual debate simply has not worked. It is time to take a different approach. 
   The bottom line is that we have precious little to lose in ending the annual renewal process and much, much to gain by enacting PNTR. 
   That is why I oppose the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague and urge this body to oppose it as well. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, for the past two years, the Finance Committee has been working on comprehensive Medicare reform--reform intended both to modernize the Medicare benefit package, which would include the creation of an outpatient prescription drug benefit, and to protect the long-term solvency of the program. The Committee has held 15 hearings on many different aspects of Medicare reform. We have listened to testimony from scores of witnesses. 
   And we appreciate how important, but also how complex an undertaking Medicare reform is, as what we do will affect 40 million Americans who rely on the program. 
   Working closely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this July I introduced an ambitious Medicare plan that took the best ideas from Republicans and Democrats--a plan that would achieve the modern reforms we all seek. I am committed to adding a comprehensive prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, coupled with other major reforms that are badly needed. 
   The plan that I have been working on includes not only comprehensive drug coverage added to the basic Medicare benefit package, but improvements to hospital and other benefits, low-income beneficiary protections, access to medical technologies, private sector drug benefit management, improvements to Medicare's long-term solvency and a strengthened Medicare+Choice Program. 
   I have been working for several months to refine my bill and to get the finalized estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that are necessary to advance any major piece of legislation in the Congress. These steps are also essential to make sure that the program is kept affordable for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. I intend shortly to share the latest information with my colleagues on the Finance Committee. 
   It is my intention to continue to work aggressively with my colleagues on the Finance Committee--as well as with all members of this body--to build on my initiative introduced in July and to move ahead with successful bipartisan reform. I appreciate the strong interest and support our agenda for reform is receiving from both sides of the aisle. 
   However, there are real reasons why we don't yet have agreement on Medicare. Program reform efforts are enormously complex. In no small part because Medicare is such an important part of our social fabric. We must work through extraordinarily diverse views on the proper role of government, how best to achieve affordability for beneficiaries and taxpayers--all while ensuring stability and continuity in the program. 
   In view of the fact that at this time there is no clear consensus on comprehensive reform, and that even if there were, such reform would take two or three years to implement, I am today introducing legislation that will help us see that low-income beneficiaries are not denied prescription drug coverage while we continue to move forward with long-term reform. 
   I call this legislation the Medicare Temporary Drug Assistance Act, and it actually includes two versions--one that meets current budget guidelines and will only require a simple majority for passage, and a second version that is larger, covers more beneficiaries, but exceeds budget guidelines and will thus require a sixty-vote majority. 
   I call this initiative the Medicare Temporary Drug Assistance Act, because that's exactly what it is. This effort is not to be mistaken with the lasting, comprehensive Medicare reform that we will continue to aggressively pursue--a reform effort that will build on our more comprehensive plan offered in July. What this temporary legislation offers is an assurance to low-income seniors that they will be able to receive the help they need while Congress completes the larger task of overhauling the Medicare program. 
   It's an assurance that their immediate needs will not be put on hold as we deliberate and debate the complex intricacies of long-term Medicare reform. 
   In testimony before our committee, the AARP repeatedly reminded us how  important it is that we proceed carefully with long-term reform. AARP also told our Committee that a program aiding low-income beneficiaries could be achieved in a shorter time frame. I agree with their assessment and support the goal of providing immediate help to low-income beneficiaries. 
   And this is what my legislation will do--it allows us to continue the intricate work of long-term reform without forcing Americans to dilute their prescription dosages or to choose between prescription drugs and food. 
   It is my hope--as I believe there is sufficient bipartisan consensus on the subject of prescription drug coverage--that we can come together to pass this legislation. Like I've said, the first version of this bill requires only a simple majority. It has been designed to fit within current budget restrictions. 
   Having my preference, Mr. President, I would like to see us pass the broader version that will require sixty votes, as it will offer more extensive coverage. But either way, these bills--once enacted--will implement a temporary, state-based, program to provide low-income Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage outside the Medicare program. 
   Now, Mr. President, let me clear up a couple of misunderstandings that appear to surround this. First of all, I have heard concerns raised that this legislation depends on the appropriations process for funding. This is wrong; they do not. Just like the State Children Health Insurance Program, funding is mandatory under the Social Security Act. 
   Second, I know that some have tried to attach a welfare stigma to the new program. Let me be clear: prescription drug coverage is not welfare, it is common sense. Frankly, I am surprised that there are those who would imply otherwise, because for years, we have worked to de-stigmatize important programs such as Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   The legislation I'm introducing is modeled on the State Children's Health Insurance Program--a solution designed to extend drug coverage to lower-income Medicare beneficiaries--beneficiaries with incomes below 150 percent of the poverty, and those with the highest out-of-pocket drug costs. If we have sufficient support to pass the more generous measure, we can cover beneficiaries up to 175 percent of the poverty level. 
   State participation in the new program would be optional, as it is under SCHIP. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 22 states have passed some type of pharmacy assistance law. Senior Pharmacy Assistance Programs currently are in place in 16 states, and another five states have passed laws to create such programs. Many of these states will likely opt to immediately participate in the new program--receiving federal funds to allow them to quickly expand their programs to provide drug benefits to even more Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Eligible beneficiaries living in states that choose not to participate in the new program would receive coverage through a fall-back option administered by the Health Care Financing Administration. HCFA would contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to provide these beneficiaries with a drug benefit comparable to that offered to all Federal employees through the Blue Cross Standard Option plan. 
   Under either scenario, beneficiaries will receive immediate assistance. They will not have to wait, they will not have to wonder, and most importantly they will not have to worry about what happens in Washington. 
   Again, Mr. President, this effort is not to be mistaken with the lasting, comprehensive Medicare reform that we must continue to pursue. It is best seen as a bridge--a bridge that will provide a low-income Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drugs--a bridge that the Washington Post acknowledged just today would be of material value to lower-income individuals while we continue our work on long-term, bipartisan reform. 
   I will continue to work in the Finance Committee toward long-term Medicare reform--reform which will include a comprehensive outpatient prescription drug benefit. If we can't pass such a package this year, we will resume our efforts on the first day of the next session, and we will not stop until we get the job done. But low-income Medicare beneficiaries should not have to wait for comprehensive reform to be enacted in order to receive prescription drug benefits. 
   This legislation will provide prescription drug coverage and peace of mind while Congress continues to work on the larger reform package. Passing it will certainly not obviate the need, nor diminish the pressing objective that we will have to achieve Medicare reform. There is no argument on either side of the aisle that long-term reform is not necessary. But in the interim, we should also take this step. 
   Then when we get the long-term reform initiative passed--when comprehensive reform is enacted--this interim step will automatically be repealed. In that way, it will not replace or compete with reform. But it will provide valuable protection for many. Full enactment of this legislation will ensure that 82 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries will have prescription drug coverage, through the new program and through other sources of coverage. If Congress votes for increased coverage, 85 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries would have prescription drug coverage. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me on this important issue. Our many successes in advancing the Medicare program these last three years have been achieved through cooperation from both sides of the aisle. We have seen what we can do when we move forward on those issues where we have a consensus. Now, let's join together to take this step, as well. Let's implement a principle on which I believe we all agree--helping our neediest Medicare beneficiaries pay for their prescription drugs. Toward achieving this important objective, there is no legitimate reason to delay.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his usual courtesy. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the motion to proceed to H.R. 4444 and to pass this legislation without amendment. Our vote on normalizing trade relations with China will mark the most significant vote we take in this Congress. Indeed, it will be one of the most important votes we will take during our time in the Senate. 
   At the outset, I want to be clear--because of PNTR's significance and because we have so little time left before the 106th Congress adjourns, I will oppose all amendments to PNTR, regardless of their merit. 
   The House bill takes the one essential step that we must take to ensure that American workers, American farmers and American businesses reap the benefits of China's market access commitments. 
   There is nothing that we can add to this bill that will improve upon its guarantee that our exporters benefit from the agreement it took three Presidents of both parties 13 years to negotiate with the Chinese. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in adopting this approach because the risks of going to conference on this bill, in this political season, are too great. Bluntly, a vote to amend is a vote to kill this bill and, with it, any chance that U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses will benefit from China's accession to the WTO. 
   The significance of this vote is due both to the economic benefits that will flow from opening China's market to our exports and the broader impact that normalizing our trade will have on our relationship with China. I want to address each of those points in turn. 
   Let me clarify, first, what this debate is about. The vote on PNTR is not a vote about whether China will get into the World Trade Organization, as some have said. I assure you that China will get into the WTO whether we vote to normalize our trade relations with China or not. 
   What this vote is about, as I indicated at the outset, is whether American manufacturers, farmers, service providers, and workers will get the benefits of a deal that American negotiators under three Presidents of both parties fought for 13 years to achieve. Or, will we simply concede the benefits of that deal to their European and Japanese competitors for the Chinese market? 
   As I explained just prior to the August recess, my reason for supporting this legislation is first and foremost because of the benefits that normalizing trade with China will offer my constituents back home in Delaware. 
   China is already an important market for firms, farmers, and workers located in my state. Delaware's exports to China in many product categories nearly doubled between 1993 and 1998. Delaware's trade with China now exceeds $70 million.  
   What China's accession to the WTO means to Delaware is a dramatic further opening of China's markets to goods and services that are critical to Delaware's economy. China, for example, is already the second leading market for American poultry products worldwide. 
   Poultry producers in Delaware and elsewhere have built that market in the face of both quotas and high tariffs. China's accession to the WTO will mean that the tariffs Delaware poultry producers face will be cut in half, from 20 to 10 percent, and quotas that now limit their access to the Chinese market will be eliminated. 
   Normalizing our trade relations with China will also make a huge difference to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries which make up a significant share of my state's manufacturing base. 
   In the chemical sector alone, China has agreed to eliminate quotas on chemical products by 2002 and will cut its tariffs on American chemical exports by more than one-half. 
   Delaware is also home to two automobile manufacturing plants, one Chrysler and one Saturn. Once in the WTO, China will be obliged to cut tariffs on automobiles by up to 70 percent and on auto parts by more than one-half. 
   The agreement also ensures that U.S. automobile manufacturers will be able to sell directly to consumers in China and finance those sales directly as our auto companies do here in the United States. 
   What holds true for Delaware holds true for the country as a whole. Independent economic analysis by Goldman Sachs suggests that the package may mean an increase of as much as $13 billion annually in U.S. exports to China. That's right--$13 billion annually. 
   What that figure reflects is that China's accession to the WTO will benefit every sector of the U.S. economy from agriculture to manufacturing to services. 
   Agriculture tariffs will be cut by more than half on priority products life beef, pork, and poultry. China will also eliminate many of the barriers to sales of bulk commodities such as wheat, corn, and rice. 
   Industrial tariffs would be slashed across the board by more than one-half--from an average rate of 24 percent to 9 percent. Equally important, American exporters will be able to sell directly to Chinese consumers and avoid the restrictions imposed on their sales by the state-owned enterprises they must currently use to distribute their products in China. 
   The deal will create broad new access for Americans services like telecommunications, banking and insurance. In particular, I want to stress that China not only agreed to open its market to new ventures in the banking and insurance areas but agreed to grandfather the existing hard-won market access that American financial service firms have already achieved. I expect those obligations to be met fully by the Chinese. 
   The agreement also provides unprecedented safeguards to American manufacturers here at home. The agreement reached this past November permits the United States to invoke a country-specific safeguard against imports from China that may disrupt our markets. In addition, the agreement allows the United States to apply special rules regarding unfair pricing practices by Chinese firms for 15 years after the agreement goes into force. 
   The agreement even addresses a concern that has been raised by many concerned with the efforts of China to convert U.S. technology to military uses. The WTO agreement specifically obliges China to end the practice of demanding that American firms cough up their manufacturing technology as a condition of exporting to or investing in the Chinese market. 
   Significantly, the agreement and China's accession to the WTO gives the United States rights against Chinese trade practices that we do not currently enjoy. It also ensures that the United States has a forum in which it will benefit from the support of the rest of China's WTO trading partners should disputes over China's obligations arise. 
   In the Finance Committee we devoted many hours to consultations with the President and his representatives as the negotiations proceeded. 
   We devoted an equal number of hours to a review of the agreement finally reached this past November. I believe I can speak for my colleagues on the committee in saying that there was overwhelming support for the agreement so ably negotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky. 
   That support is warranted not only by the terms of the agreement but by the testimony we heard and the support expressed from a broad and diverse spectrum of U.S. interests. 
   The agreement was supported not only by U.S. businesses, American farmers, and groups representing virtually every sector of the U.S. economy. The agreement garnered the support of Presidents from Gerald Ford to George Bush, former Secretaries of State and Treasury, and an impressive array of national security specialists from Richard Perle to General Colin Powell all of whom underscored the importance of China's accession to the WTO and normalizing our trade relations with China as good not only in economic terms but in strategic terms as well. 
   The testimony before the Finance Committee left little doubt that China's reemergence as a world power presents challenges to the world community and to U.S. interests. But, the testimony before the committee was unequivocal on one point--that our interests are best served by drawing China into that community of nations, rather than isolating China from that community through restrictions on trade. 
   General Powell said it best in his public statement on PNTR, indicating that--  
   *.*.*.from every standpoint--from the strategic standpoint, from the standpoint of our national interests, from the standpoint of our trading and economic interests--it serves all of our purposes to grant permanent normal trading relations to China.  
   Opponents of this legislation have often tried to downplay the importance of normalizing our trade relations with China. They argued that we are entitled to the benefit of the WTO agreement based on our bilateral trade arrangements with China dating back to 1979. They argue that we will suffer no competitive disadvantage if we fail to take the steps necessary on our end to comply with our own WTO obligations. 
   I want to lay that argument to rest. That argument was contradicted by Ambassador Barshefsky, by our own legal counsel, and by every trade expert consulted by the Finance Committee. 
   However, just to make sure, my distinguished colleague and the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN and I, together with the chairman and ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, specifically put that question to the General Accounting Office. 
   The GAO has had a team following the WTO negotiations with the Chinese closely for several years. We asked them for their assessment of the terms of the agreement and whether we could rely on our 1979 agreement to obtain the benefits of China's accession to the WTO. 
   The GAO, in testimony before the committee and in a report it released prior to House passage of PNTR, concluded that the 1979 bilateral arrangement would not guarantee the rights three Presidents of both parties spent 13 years negotiating with the Chinese. 
   According to the GAO, the essential step in obtaining the benefits of China's accession to the WTO was the passage of PNTR. Indeed, the GAO emphasized that failure to approve PNTR would ``put U.S. business interests at a considerable competitive disadvantage'' in the Chinese market. 
   In other words, the single step we must take to obtain the benefits of the Chinese agreement to open their markets is the passage of H.R. 4444. 
   In light of that fact, let me turn briefly to an explanation of the legislation before us. The bill authorizes the President to normalize our trade relations with China when China has completed the WTO accession process provided that the terms of China's accession are equivalent to those negotiated this past November. 
   That action will assure that American firms, farmers, and workers will receive the benefit of the bargain Ambassador Barshefsky struck with China. 
   But, the House bill does considerably more to ensure that we get the benefit of our bargain and more to address  many of the concerns that opponents of this legislation have raised regarding China's human rights practices and more to encourage the development of political pluralism in China. 
   On the trade front, the House bill provides for the aggressive monitoring of China's compliance with its WTO obligations and the enforcement of U.S. rights under the WTO agreement. 
   The bill would offer particular help to small- and medium-size businesses, and to workers, in making use of the remedies available under U.S. law to address any violations of U.S. WTO rights or to address any unfair Chinese trade practices. 
   In addition, the House bill implements the special safeguard mechanism that was a part of the November agreement. In effect, the bill provides the counterpart in domestic law to the provisions of the bilateral agreement that offer import-sensitive industries in the United States protection in any dramatic surge in imports from China that disrupt U.S. markets. 
   The bill also addresses a concern that I am sure all of us share with respect to Taiwan's economic future. Taiwan has applied for admission to the World Trade Organization and its accession process is essentially complete. 
   The House bill expresses the sense of Congress that the WTO should approve Taiwan's accession to the WTO at the same time that it approves China's. As a matter of WTO rules, there is no need to debate Taiwan's designation or its relationship to China. The WTO rules permit the accession of Taiwan regardless of its designation. 
   China has long provided assurances that it would not stand in the way of Taiwan's accession at the same time China itself enters the WTO, and I expect China to live up to those assurances, just as the House bill makes clear. 
   Apart from securing the trade benefits of China's accession to the WTO, the House bill represents an important step forward on the issues of human rights, internationally-agreed labor standards, and religious freedom. 
   In an innovative approach, the bill would create a commission made up of members of both the Congress and the executive branch, modeled on the successful domestic counterpart to the Helsinki Commission on human rights, to monitor Chinese practices in those areas, as well as the development of the rule of law and democracy. 
   One of the significant advantages of the approach adopted by the House bill is that it ensures a constructive, ongoing review of China's practices throughout the year, rather than what has become an unproductive once-a-year effort tied to a congressional vote. 
   More fundamentally, the commission will ensure that the United States' concerns and our message to the Chinese leadership regarding Chinese human rights practices is undiluted by a debate over whether to renew China's trade status. 
   There are some who have suggested that the bill should have gone farther. They suggest that the bill should have empowered the proposed commission to address national security concerns as well. 
   Those concerns, however, have been mooted by the recent action taken by the Senate in the context of the Defense authorization bill. I congratulate my distinguished colleagues, Senators WARNER, LEVIN, and BYRD, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the committee's ranking member, and one of the most senior members of that panel, for proposing the creation of a separate commission to look at precisely those issues of national security and the link between those issues and our expanding trade relationship with China. 
   In sum, the House bill preserves what we in the Finance Committee sought to do in the bill we reported out, which was to ensure that American firms, farmers, and workers gain the benefits of the agreement reached this past November, and take additional steps to secure those trade benefits and offers a new approach to addressing U.S. concerns regarding human rights practices in China. 
   I believe that H.R. 4444 not only merits our support, but that it strikes a careful and appropriate balance of the interests we have in our broader relationship with China. 
   For that reason, I intend not only to support the legislation as drafted, but, as I said at the outset, I will oppose any amendment to the House bill no matter how meritorious the amendment might be standing on its own. 
   That brings me to my final point. There are a number of my colleagues that see this vote as an opportunity to link other issues to our trading relationship with China. 
   I am certain that we will have the opportunity to debate amendments on everything from the release of political prisoners to China's implementation of a one-child policy to its recurring threats against Taiwan to issuers of weapons proliferation. I respect my colleagues' point of view and recognize that these are serious issues that should remain a part of the broader dialog with China on our bilateral relations. 
   What I fundamentally disagree with is the approach of linking progress in those areas to our trade with China. 
   I do so for three reasons. First, the approach of linking progress to our trading relations with China has proved to be a failure. We have tried the approach of linking progress in other areas, such as human rights, to trade and it simply has not worked. It is time to try a different approach. 
   Second, the threat of economic sanctions would only work if the target country believes that there is something fundamental at risk. Here, I want us to think through the logic of voting ``no'' on PNTR. The net effect of a ``no'' vote on PNTR would be to cut off U.S. exports to China. 
   China already has access to our market. We do not enjoy reciprocal access to China's market. That is what the WTO agreement provides. In voting ``no'' on PNTR, we would only be voting to deny ourselves the benefits of the WTO agreement to American firms, farmers, and workers. 
   Denying ourselves the benefit of the WTO agreement is simply no threat to the Chinese. They will simply obtain the goods, services, and technology they want from other WTO members. 
   In other words, even if you accepted the logic of economic sanctions, voting ``no'' on PNTR does not serve the objective of modifying China's behavior or the views of its leadership. 
   Finally, there are some who decry the pursuit of profit when issues of human rights and human freedoms are at stake. While I share their concerns for human rights conditions in China, I feel compelled to say that they are wrong and their criticisms are misplaced. 
   In the end, human freedom is indivisible. It is not neatly divided between political freedom and economic freedom, as some suggest. Economic freedom is freedom, pure and unadulterated. The reason is that, absent economic freedom, no person has the wherewithal to defend their political rights. 
   What that means in practical terms in the context of modern China is that we should do whatever we can to empower the Chinese people to pursue their own course toward freedom. 
   One essential step toward that goal is to ensure that the Chinese people are free to pursue their own economic destiny free from the heavy hand of the state. That is because the roots of political pluralism lie in economic interests that differ from those of the Chinese Communist Government and those of the Chinese leadership. 
   The noted Chinese human rights activist Fu Sheni, active in defense of Chinese human rights and political freedoms since the 1979 Democracy Wall Movement, has made this point more eloquently than I can. 
   In a public statement on PNTR, Fu emphasized that:  
   The annual argument over NTR renewal exerts no genuine pressure on the Chinese Communists and performs absolutely no role in compelling them to improve the human rights situation. ..... [I]mprovement of the human rights situation and advancement of democracy in China must mainly depend on the greatness of the Chinese people, in the process of economic modernization, gradually creating the popular citizen consciousness and democratic conscience and struggling for them. It will not be achieved through the action of the U.S. Congress in debating Normal Trade Relations. .....  
   Fu's point was echoed by the China Democracy Party, founded 2 years ago, in its public statement on PNTR. In declaring its support for China's accession to the WTO and for the normalization of our trade relations with China, the Democracy Party stated:  
   We believe the closer the economic relationship between the United States and  China, the more chances to politically influence China, the more chances to monitor human rights, and the more effective the United States to push China to launch political reforms.  
   The Democracy Party's statement went on to say that the Communist leadership's power in China is ``planted in state ownership.'' A vote for PNTR is a vote to end the Communist leadership's monopoly on power within Chinese society. A vote against PNTR would condemn the Chinese people to work for the state-owned enterprises that are the Communist leadership's most effective means of political control. 
   That is why, beyond the economic benefits for my home state of Delaware and for our nation as a whole, I support normalizing our trade relations with China. It is a vote for freedom and that is where I will cast my lot every time. 
   I thank my colleagues and urge their support for the motion to proceed and for passage of this essential legislation. 
   Once again, I thank my distinguished colleague from North Carolina.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for starting the process of consideration of this historic legislation and I look forward to the debate in September. At that point, I intend to outline precisely how normalizing our trade relations with China is the single most significant step we can take in promoting the broad range of interests,  from national security to human rights, that the United States has in its relationship with China and Asia as a whole. For today, however, I do not intend debate abstractions. Instead, I am going to start where I always do when I am considering legislation. And, that is the simple question of whether normalizing trade with China is good for my constituents back home in Delaware. Delaware's exports to China in many product categories nearly doubled between 1993 and 1998. Delaware's trade with China now exceeds $70 million. The agreement reached with China as part of its accession to the WTO would mean dramatically lower tariffs on products critical to Delaware's economy. 
   The economy of southern Delaware, for example, depends on poultry. China is already the second leading market for American poultry products worldwide. Poultry producers in Delaware and elsewhere have built that market in the face of both quotas and high tariffs. Under the agreement with China, those quotas will now be eliminated and the tariffs will be cut in half, from 20 to 10 percent. In Delaware, chemicals and pharmaceuticals make up a significant share of my State's manufacturing base. In the chemical sector, China has agreed to eliminate quotas on chemical products by 2002 and will cut its tariffs on American chemical exports by more than one-half. Furthermore, there is not a day that I come to work that I do not remember that Delaware is also home to two automobile manufacturing plants, one Chrysler and one General Motors. In fact, I am told that Delaware has more auto workers per capita than any other State, including Michigan. As many of the auto workers in my State remember, I led the fight to ensure Chrysler's survival. And I remain one of the strongest supporters of the Chrysler and General Motors communities in Delaware. 
   Under the agreement with China, China has agreed to cut tariffs on automobiles by up to 70 percent and on auto parts by more than one-half. The agreement also ensures the ability of our automobile companies to sell direct to consumers, rather than through some state-owned marketing office, and the ability to finance those sales directly as they do here in the United States. I want to give each of you a website address where you can see the powerful positive effect this agreement will have on your state and on your constituents as well. You can find it at 
    www.chinapntr.gov. 
   Beyond that, I want to emphasize two final points. The first thing I want every member of the Senate to understand is that China is going to become a member of the World Trade Organization whether we pass this bill or not. What this vote is about is whether American farmers, American businesses, and American workers--real working men and women back home in each of our states--will receive the benefits of an agreement that three Presidents from both parties have pursued with incredible dedication for 13 years. Or, will we reject this bill and see those benefits go instead to our European and Japanese competitors? Under the bilateral agreement reached this past November, China has agreed to open its markets farther than many of our other WTO trading partners even in the developed world. Indeed, to a remarkable extent, China seems willing to go farther faster on agricultural subsidies and services than even Japan and some of our European trading partners. And, the United States is likely to be the primary beneficiary of China's historic agreement to open its markets. Voting no on this motion means that American farmers, its manufacturers and its workers will suffer the consequences and face a dimmer economic future as a result. 
   The second point I want to make in closing has to do with the bill that came to us from the House. We have reviewed the bill in the Finance Committee and I want to emphasize my unequivocal support for the House bill. It preserves precisely what the Finance Committee hoped to do--which is ensure that American farmers, manufacturers, and service providers would gain access to the Chinese market under the terms negotiated this past November. Beyond that, the House bill strikes a reasonable balance in terms of Congress' ongoing scrutiny of China's record on human rights and labor standards. Indeed, in my view, the commission created by the House bill for those purposes offers more to our advocacy of human rights in China than any vote under the Jackson-Vanik amendment ever did or ever would. What that means is that, because benefits of normalizing our trade relations with China, and because there is now so little time left before the 106th Congress adjourns, I will intend to oppose all amendments to the bill. Thirteen members of the Finance Committee have joined me in that pledge and I know many others that have expressed the same view to the majority and minority leaders. With that, let me close by simply urging my colleagues to support the motion to proceed, and final passage when we return in September. Let's engage in the serious debate the bill deserves and let's take action as soon as possible to secure the benefits of the agreement for our farmers, manufacturers, and workers.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume debate on the conference report to accompany the marriage penalty reconciliation bill. There will be 30 minutes for closing remarks, with a vote to occur on adoption of the conference report at approximately 9:30 a.m. As previously announced, this will be the only vote today. Following the disposition of the marriage penalty conference report, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill. Amendments are expected and Senators are encouraged to come to the floor to offer their amendments. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, the provisions in this bill will help 45 million families, and that is substantially every family in the U.S. Some of my colleagues have argued that almost half of those families do not deserve any tax relief. I reject that. I reject it because in my home state of Delaware it would mean leaving over 30,000 families that contributed to our ever-growing budget surplus out of family tax relief. They contributed to the surplus and they should benefit from the surplus. 
   Today's bill amounts to less than 5 percent of the total budget surplus over the next 5 years. That is less than a nickel on the dollar of our total budget surplus. It amounts to just 9 percent of the total non-Social Security surplus over the next 5 years. That is less than a dime on the dollar of the non-Social Security surplus. A nickel and a dime--by any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax relief is fiscally responsible. Those who dispute  that are themselves seeking to ``nickel-and-dime'' America's families out of tax relief. 
   I ask those who oppose this family tax relief: just how big will America's budget surplus have to get before America's families deserve to receive some of their tax dollars back? If not now, when? If just 5 percent of the budget surplus and just 9 percent of the tax overpayment is too big a refund, how little should it be? How long do they have to wait? How hard do they have to work? How large an overpayment do they have to make? 
   This bill is fair. We have addressed the three largest sources of marriage tax penalties in the tax code--the standard deduction, the rate brackets, and the earned income credit. We have done so in a way that does not create any new penalties--any new disincentives in the tax code. We have ensured that a family with one stay-at-home parent is not treated worse for tax purposes than a family where both parents work outside the home. This is an important principle because these are important families. 
   Finally, we have made this tax relief immediate for the current year. That means when a couple files their tax return next April, they will be able to see and feel the results of our work. As a result, I believe that we should call this bill the ASAP tax relief bill for America's taxpayers--tax relief for America's families now. 
   Despite the red flags thrown up by those who want to stand in the way of marriage tax relief, this bill actually makes the tax code more progressive. As a result, families with incomes under $100,000 will receive a proportionally larger tax cut. 
   There is no honest way people can claim that this bill is tilted towards the rich. I believe that the real complaint of those who oppose this bill is not that it is tilted towards the rich--because it is not--but because it is tilted away from Washington. 
   While I would rather have seen the 28 percent bracket doubling included in the bill, its absence does do one thing. Its absence removes any excuse for the President not to sign this bill. If President Clinton does not sign this bill, then there is only one explanation. No matter how much the amount of surplus, no matter how much the size of the tax overpayment, no matter how high the overall tax burden, and no matter how much families deserve tax relief, it is all less important to him than the fact that Washington wants the money more. 
   Mr. President, the time for excuses has passed, the time for family tax relief has come. Yet some in the White House still disagree. Yesterday I received a letter from Treasury Secretary Summers in which he tried to raise two new excuses that are as transparent as they are late. 
   First, he tried to over-estimate the cost of the tax relief passed by Congress this year. Despite his exaggerated figures, when Congress sends this bill to the President it, along with the other bills we have passed, comprise just $120 billion worth of tax relief over the next 5 years. 
   Second, there is only one bill before us today and there will be only one bill when it arrives on his desk: family tax relief. When we look at this bill, we need to look at its actual provisions--not some concocted estimate of what another Congress and another President will do. Congress' official estimator scores this bill at under $90 billion for both five and ten years. That is the accurate figure and that is the appropriate measure of the tax relief before us today. 
   Despite what the President's advisers may wish, the issue is whether he will or won't grant America's families the tax relief they have earned. Let's approve the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 and let's divorce the marriage tax penalty from the tax code once and for all. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, let me say this vote on the marriage penalty represents a great victory for working Americans. I think we can all take great satisfaction that, for the typical American, it will mean something like $1,300 to $1,500 in a tax cut. 
   I thank my friends and colleagues who supported this legislation. I think it is only fair, it is only right. I believe this has, indeed, been a great week for the working people of America. 
   Mr. President, it has been a busy two weeks for the Members of the Senate Finance Committee and our staff. I would like to take a moment to thank the staff who worked on this conference report and also H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. 
   With respect to both bills, I thank John Duncan, my Administrative Assistant. On the Majority Staff, I thank Frank Polk, our Staff Director and Chief Counsel, J.T. Young, our Deputy Staff Director, and members of the tax staff, including Mark Prater, Brig Pari, Bill Sweetnam, Jeff Kupfer, Ed McClellan, and our newest tax counsel, Elizabeth Paris. I thank our Finance Committee press team of Ginny Flynn and Tara Bradshaw. I note that Connie Foster, Amber Williams, and Myrtle Agent also provided valuable assistance to the tax team. 
   I thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished ranking Democratic member of the Finance Committee, Senator PAT MOYNIHAN and his able staff. I refer to David Podoff, Russ Sullivan, Stan Fendley, Cary Pugh, Jerry Pannullo, Mitchell Kent, John Sparrow, and Lee Holtzman. 
   Republican Leadership staff also deserve thanks for helping to bring these bills together. I refer to Dave Hoppe, Sharon Soderstrom, Keith Hennessey, and Ginger Gregory of Senator LOTT's office and Hazen Marshall, Lee Morris, and Eric Ueland of Senator NICKLES' office. 
   Chuck Marr and Anita Horn of Senator DASCHLE's and Senator REID's staff also worked hard on this legislation. 
   The Budget Committee staff also deserve praise. I refer to Bill Hoagland, Beth Felder, and Cheri Reidy. I also thank Marty Morris and Bruce King of the minority staff. 
   None of this legislation would have been possible without the valuable work of the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, including Lindy Paull, Rick Grafmeyer, and the rest of the Joint Tax team. 
   A special thanks also is due to Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, and Janell Bentz from Senate Legislative Counsel. 
   With respect to the marriage tax relief legislation, I also thank Senators KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, SAM BROWNBACK, and JOHN ASHCROFT and their staffs, including Jim Hyland, Karen Knutson, and Brian Waidmann. 
   On the death tax repeal bill, a special note of thanks to Tim Glazewski of Senator JON KYL's staff.

   Mr. ROTH. Madam President, tomorrow this Senate will approve the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000. This is a great victory for the American family--all of America's families. It is not one that has been won for America's families, as much as it has been earned by America's families. 
   This bill is the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax overpayment by American taxpayers. It is fair, it is responsible, it is the right thing to do for American families. And it is long overdue that they receive it. 
   The provisions in this bill will help 45 million families. That is substantially every family in the U.S. Some of my colleagues have argued that almost half of those families--21 million families located in every state in this country--do not deserve any tax relief. I reject that. I reject it because in my home state of Delaware it would mean leaving over 30,000 families that contributed to our ever-growing budget surplus out of family tax relief. 
   Why should the family in which one spouse stays home to raise the children and keep the house not receive a tax break? Does that spouse not work? Do you imagine that spouse doesn't work just because she or he does not get paid? Does that family not count? They do in Delaware, they do in this country, and they do in this bill. 
   All of these American families have contributed to the record surplus that we have in Washington. They deserve to get some of it back. I believed that three months ago when I first unveiled this package. And I believe it even more so now in light of estimates recently released by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Today's bill amounts to less than 5 percent of the total budget surplus over the next 5 years. That is less than a nickel on the dollar of our total budget surplus. It amounts to just 9 percent of the total non-Social Security surplus over the next five years. That is less than a dime on the dollar of the non-Social Security surplus. A nickel and a dime. By any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax relief is fiscally responsible. Those who dispute that are themselves seeking to ``nickel-and-dime'' America's families out of tax relief. 
   I would ask those who oppose this family tax relief: just how big will America's budget surplus have to get before America's families deserve to receive some of their tax dollars back? If not now, when? If just 5 percent of the budget surplus and just 9 percent of the tax overpayment is too big a refund, how little should it be? How long do they have to wait? How hard do they have to work? How large an overpayment do they have to make? How large a budget surplus do we need to have? 
   This bill is fair. We have addressed the three largest sources of marriage tax penalties in the tax code--the standard deduction, the rate brackets, and the earned income credit. And we have done so in a way that does not create any new penalties--any new disincentives in the tax code. We have ensured that a family with one stay-at-home parent is not treated worse for tax purposes than a family where both parents work outside the home. This is an important principle because these are important families. 
   Let's take a look at what all these families will receive 
   under our bill--and just as importantly, let's look at when they will get it. First, our bill increases the standard deduction for married couples filing a joint return to twice the deduction for singles. 
   This benefit, which would reduce a couple's taxable income by $1,450, is effective for this taxable year. That's right--for the year 2000. That means when a couple files their tax returns this coming April, they will be able to see and feel the results of our work. This provision will benefit about 25 million taxpayers. As a result, I believe that we should call this bill the ASAP tax relief bill for America's taxpayers--tax relief for America's families now. 
   Now, I know that those who search for excuses to oppose tax relief will question the immediacy of this tax cut. Before they do, I would remind those people: it was not a problem for them to raise taxes retroactively seven years ago. And of course, when you are raising taxes retroactively, it is a big problem because people have already made their financial commitments. In contrast, giving people an immediate tax cut is only a problem if you object to letting people keep their money. 
   Second, our bill increases the 15 percent rate bracket for married couples so that it is twice the size of the corresponding rate bracket for singles. While we phase in this doubling, we begin the increase immediately. Taxpayers will receive a portion of the benefit as soon as possible--as soon as they file their year 2000 tax returns. And they will see the entire benefit--a total of over $1,100 per family--in the year 2004. This provision will help about 21 million taxpayers. 
   Third, our bill helps married couples who are receiving the earned income credit. We increase the beginning and ending points of the credit's income phase-out for these couples by $2,000. Just like the other provisions in the bill, we deliver this relief immediately--for the tax year 2000. The hard working families who receive the EIC will see the benefit as soon as they file their year 2000 tax returns. This provision helps almost four million families, including an expansion of the EIC to one million families who were previously ineligible for the credit because of their combined income. 
   Finally, our bill ensures that families will continue to receive their family tax credits. Congress has delivered a variety of tax credits to American families--credits like the child credit, the HOPE credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, the dependent care credit, and the adoption credit. This bill extends a temporary provision that carves out these credits from the ever-reaching grasp of the alternative minimum tax. Millions of families will also see this benefit. For them, this tax relief won't be an empty promise. 
   In any House-Senate conference, both sides are forced to make compromises. This one was no exception. I would like to have included the doubling of the 28 percent bracket as we did in the Senate and as 61 Senators supported. I think that these families deserve their full tax break as well. Even the Democratic alternative offered in the Senate accounted for these families by not completely phasing-out their relief until $150,000. I fought 
   hard, but our colleagues in the House did not agree and they refused to budge. I also would have liked to keep our earned income credit provision at $2,500. Once again, the House disagreed. But this is still a good bill and it still delivers the tax relief families have earned and deserve. 
   Despite the red flags thrown up by those who want to stand in the way of marriage tax relief, this bill actually makes the tax code more progressive. Families with incomes under $100,000 receive a tax cut under our bill that is proportionally higher than the amount of taxes they currently pay. In other words, their tax burden will fall. 
   Let's look at a few examples prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation. First, let's take a married couple with two children earning $30,000. When this bill is fully effective, that couple would see a reduction in its taxes of over 143 percent. On the other hand, a two-child couple earning $100,000 would see its taxes drop by 11 percent, and a couple earning $200,000 would see its taxes drop by less than 4 percent. 
   This same dynamic holds true for a couple with no children. Under our bill, a couple earning $20,000 would see its taxes reduced by 28 percent; a couple earning $75,000 would have its taxes reduced by 16 percent, and a couple earning $100,000 would have its taxes reduced by 9.5 percent. 
   There is no honest way people can claim that this bill is tilted towards the rich. I believe that the real complaint of those who oppose this bill is not that it is tilted towards the rich--because it is not--but because it is tilted away from Washington. As a result, some of America's tax overpayment will flow back to America's families. 
   And while I would rather have seen the 28 percent bracket doubling included in the bill, its absence does do one thing. Its absence removes any excuse for the President not to sign this bill. If President Clinton does not sign this bill, then there is only one explanation. No matter how much the amount of surplus, no matter how much the size of the tax overpayment,  no matter how high the overall tax burden, and no matter how much families deserve tax relief, it is all less important than the fact that Washington wants the money more. They are saying to America: those in the White House need your money more than the people in your house do. 
   With the passage of this bill, Congress has met every test that the President has set for tax relief. He wanted it to go to deserving people. Who could be more deserving than America's families? He wanted it to be fiscally responsible. What could be more fiscally responsible than using just a nickel on America's budget surplus dollar and a dime on its tax overpayment? He wanted it to be one provision and not part of a large package. How could it be smaller than the single proposal of family tax relief included here? 
   Every test, no matter how illusory, has been met. With this bill, President Clinton has run out of excuses for not giving American families tax relief. No more if's, and's, or buts. No more excuses. No more obstacles and no more conditions, this Senate will go on record tomorrow: Family tax relief now. 
   Madam President, the time for excuses has passed, the time for family tax relief has come. While President Clinton has been focused on international affairs, families across America have been waiting for us to make good on our promise. For President Clinton to make good on his promise. They have been patient. They are waiting for us to return some of this record surplus to them. 
   There is no reason, none whatsoever, that this bill, the ASAP tax relief bill for America's family taxpayers, should not be immediately signed. Let's approve the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 and let's divorce the marriage tax penalty from the tax code once and for all.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the passing of Tom Maloney. 
   Tom was the former mayor of Wilmington--Delaware's largest city. 
   I am deeply saddened by the death of my friend, Tom. I talked to Tom just last week. During his long battle with cancer, his spirit remained unbroken. To the very end, Tom was full of life and bullish on the future. 
   Tom was a loving husband and father, as well as a committed public servant. His care and concern for the residents of his city of Wilmington, and for the people of Delaware, were unmatched. As mayor, Tom led the effort to bring more people, more jobs, and more development to Wilmington. In many ways, Tom was the originator of the downtown renaissance that continues today. 
   Tom was my opponent in the 1976 race for the U.S. Senate. He was a worthy adversary, but an even better friend. In that unique Delaware tradition of Return Day, Tom and I ``buried the hatchet'' and forged a friendship that flourished for the next 25 years. Tom and I continued to work together on projects and issues important to Wilmington and to all Delawareans. The people of the First State owe Tom Maloney a debt of thanks for all he has done. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Linda, and the rest of the Maloney family.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, evidently the proponent of the amendment does not believe any marriage tax relief is in order. 
   Let me say that I find this position to be incredible. The Federal Government is taking a record level of the economy in revenue over 20 percent. The Federal take has not been this high since World War II. 
   Income taxes have doubled since the Clinton administration came to office. Clearly, it is the taxpayers--especially America's hard-working families--who have caused the surplus. 
   This bill returns less than 3 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to virtually every married couple in the country. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that marriage tax relief is an appropriate use of the non-Social Security surplus. We differ on how the relief is delivered. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject Senator HOLLINGS' amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we are poised to approve the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000. This is a great victory for the American family--all America's families. It is not one that has been won, as much as it has been earned.

   All of these American families have contributed to the record surplus that we have in Washington. They deserve to get some of it back. I believed that  three months ago when I first unveiled this package. And I believe it even more so today with the new numbers released by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Today's bill amounts to just 3 percent of the total budget surplus over the next five years. It amounts to just 8 percent of the total non-Social Security surplus over the next five years. That is less than a dime on the dollar of American's tax overpayment. By any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax relief is fiscally responsible. 
   I would ask those who oppose this family tax relief: Just how big will America's budget surplus have to get before America's families deserve to receive some of their tax dollars back? If not now, when? if 8 percent of just the overpayment is too big a refund, how little should it be? How long do they have to wait? How hard do they have to work? How large an overpayment do they have to make? 
   This bill is fair. We have addressed the three largest sources of marriage tax penalties in the tax code--the standard deduction, the rate brackets, and the earned income credit.

   Despite the red flags thrown up by those who want to stand in the way of marriage tax relief, this bill actually makes the tax code more progressive. Families with incomes under $100,000 pay less than 50 percent of the total federal taxes; yet under our bill, these same families receive substantially more than 50 percent of the benefits. 
   I do not understand how people can claim that this bill is tilted towards the rich. I believe that the real complaint of those who oppose this bill is not that it is tilted towards the rich--because it is not--but because it is tilted away from Washington. As a result, some of America's tax overpayment will flow back to America's families. 
   Mr. President, it is time for us to act. Families across America are waiting for us to make good on our promise. They are waiting for us to return some of this record surplus to them.

   I ask unanimous consent that the Lott amendment be included in the original waiver that I raised. 
   Specifically, the new motion is to waive all points of order under the budget process arising from the earned-income credit component in this pending tax--the amendment by Senator MOYNIHAN, the amendment offered by Senator LOTT, the House companion bill, any amendment between the Houses, and any conference reports thereon.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator FEINGOLD's motion to commit to the Finance Committee will not accomplish its stated purpose of Social Security and Medicare reform. The bill before the Senate is limited under the budget resolution to tax cuts. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I can tell you we are actively pursuing a real bipartisan Medicare reform package. Our efforts are not a political stunt, like this motion. On Social Security reform, everyone believes that it is a worthy goal but not one where there is currently a bipartisan consensus. I urge my colleagues to reject Senator FEINGOLD's motion.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Finance Committee complied with the Byrd rule by terminating or sunsetting the tax cuts in the bill generally on December 31, 2004. I note the Finance Committee Democratic alternative contained a similar sunset provision. The case before us that benefits a simple, broad-based tax policy change that reduces some of the tax burden placed on married couples, outweighs the implications of the Byrd rule. 
   Frankly, I think there are few more compelling cases for waiving the Byrd rule. Clearly, though, we differ on how to deliver it. Every Senator should place an importance on permanent marriage tax relief. I urge my colleagues to strike a blow for permanent marriage tax relief and support my motion to waive the Byrd rule.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment is the same one we considered in the Finance Committee. Supporters of this amendment claim it is preferable because it is more targeted, that it only benefits certain married families, and that it provides more comprehensive marriage penalty relief. 
   I do not shy away from the fact that our bill benefits virtually every American family. I welcome it. The Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that our bill will help over 45 million families. They also tell us the Democratic alternative will assist only 24 million. 
   Our bill also addresses the marriage penalty without creating a new penalty--a so-called homemaker penalty. With our approach, all married couples with the same income will be treated alike. This cannot be said of the alternative. 
   Finally, the Democratic alternative includes that income cap. If we are serious about addressing the inequity of this tax, we should not make this an issue of rich versus poor. Our bill is fair, it is comprehensive, and it is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to oppose this Democratic substitute.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the increase in the rate brackets of the underlying bill. As my colleagues may know, in dollar terms, the greatest source of marriage penalty for American families is the rate brackets. Under current law, for instance, the 15 percent rate bracket ends for singles at $26,250; it ends for couples at $43,850. Our bill has remedied that unfairness by phasing in a doubling of the married couples' rate bracket so that it ends at twice the ending point of the single's bracket. 
   While I agree that a further increase in the standard deduction is a good idea, I do not believe we should do it at the expense of the increase in the rate brackets. Accordingly, I must oppose this amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the FamilyCare initiative prematurely doubles the size and scope of the new State Children's Health Insurance Program. S-CHIP has been enrolling children for less than 3 years--and it has not reached its goals in terms of covering eligible children. Let us make sure the S-CHIP model works before we expand it so dramatically. 
   In fact, Mr. President, it is worth noting that if the states want to extend coverage to parents, they may do so now under Medicaid waivers, or even under S-CHIP, if that coverage is ``cost-effective''. 
   In addition to program concerns, FamilyCare raises a fundamental question. Should parenthood be the driving factor in terms of eligibility for health insurance coverage? FamilyCare rewards parenthood and disadvantages working poor individuals who decide to postpone having families until they are better able to afford to raise a child. 
   Finally, this new initiative is extremely costly. We are talking about creating a new program with a cost of $50 billion over ten years--all without holding hearings on the bill and without any discussion of priorities. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Kennedy amendment is neither germane nor relevant to the reconciliation bill, it is in violation of 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is an amendment that undermines, not advances, progress on two important issues. Its only effect will be to stop tax cuts for families while not advancing by a day Medicare reform that should include a prescription drug benefit. If anything, it slows down Medicare reform by politicizing the issue. 
   Prescription drugs should not be pitted against family tax cuts. We can and should be for both. The budget surplus allows for both. The budget passed by Congress allows for both and both are necessary policies, but they must first each be correctly thought through. 
   Now is the time to pass marriage tax relief, an issue on which we have been working for years. Now is the time to be working together on Medicare reform, as we are in the Finance Committee. Working together we can succeed on both policies. Seeking division we will fail on each. Notwithstanding any policy objections, the pending amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia is not germane to the underlying bill and would, therefore, result in a section 305(b)(2) point of order under the Budget Act. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, while I am sympathetic to the goals of the Santorum amendment and I strongly support some of its provisions, I must vote against it at this time. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator is 251 pages long and has 12 titles. It includes new tax incentives and new authorization programs. Some of the incentives are new starters that have never been considered before. While the amendment is based on an agreement that has been announced by the Speaker's Office and the White House, that specific agreement has not been finalized, introduced, or considered by the House of Representatives. 
   A few weeks ago, Senator SANTORUM introduced a slightly smaller version of  his amendment as a bill. That bill, S. 2779, was referred to the Finance Committee. Our Committee has held no hearings on the bill and we have not marked it up. The Joint Committee on Taxation has not had a chance to offer its comments on the full package or formally to tell us how much it costs. The Administration has not provided us with its views. Since the bill was introduced, my staff has been contacted by a variety of groups asking for technical changes to make the tax incentives operate better. 
   My colleagues know that I am a strong supporter of some of the provisions in the amendment. Increases in the low income housing credit cap and the private activity bond volume cap are long overdue. Tax credits for individual development accounts are a new and promising concept that I included in last year's tax bill. Nevertheless, I believe that the proper course is for the Finance Committee to take the time to review and evaluate all the provisions of this amendment. Accordingly, I will vote against it at this time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we will start with opening statements by myself and the Democratic manager. Subsequent to that, we will open it up to amendments. 
   Mr. President, a little more than 3 months ago, I stood in this chamber to introduce the Marriage Tax Relief Act of 2000. At that time, I described that bill ``as the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax overpayment by America's families.'' That is as it should be because families are the centerpiece of American society. 
   Three months ago, I urged my colleagues to support the Marriage Tax Relief Act because it ``delivered savings to virtually every married couple in America--and it did so within the context of fiscal discipline and preserving the Social Security surplus.'' And that too, is as it should be, because if we act irresponsibly we are not giving relief to America's families, but grief to America's children. 
   In the three months since I last spoke on this topic, we have discovered that American families' tax overpayment is even larger and our relief even more appropriate than we had imagined then. 
   Despite the enormous benefits that the Marriage Tax Relief Act of 2000 would have brought to American families, we could never get the other side to agree to a procedure that would limit debate to relevant amendments. The Majority Leader's offer to limit debate to marriage tax issues was rejected and cloture votes failed. The Senate moved on to other business. 
   But even as the Senate took up other important issues, we remained committed to delivering tax relief to America's families. We knew that the American people would not be satisfied with us shrugging our shoulders and saying that we tried. We knew that the American people would not be satisfied with us telling them that they'll have to wait for comprehensive marriage tax relief because the other side blocked our first attempt. 
   And so we are back today. We have returned with ``The Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000.'' Substantively, this bill is the same as the one that we sought to pass a few months ago. But there is one crucial difference between now and then. Today, we are proceeding under the Budget Act's reconciliation procedure. And that means that no one is going to delay us from passing this bill. We will have an up or down vote. We will see who supports the marriage tax relief in our bill. And we will see who thinks that American families are not entitled to this relief. 
   Before I describe the specifics of our bill, I want to talk about how we got here. Our tax system has chosen to use the family as the unit for taxation. Unlike some other countries--where all individuals are taxed separately--here in the United States, we look to the household. In doing so, our tax system has tried to balance three disparate goals--progressivity, equal treatment of married couples, and marriage neutrality. And, I will remind my colleagues, it is impossible to achieve all three principles at the same time. 
   The principle of progressivity holds that taxpayers with higher incomes should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The principle of equal treatment holds that two married couples with the same amount of income should pay the same level of tax. And the 
   principle of marriage neutrality holds that a couple's income tax bill should not depend on their marital status. The tax code should neither provide an incentive nor a disincentive for two people to get married. 
   Our policy response differs depending on how we balance these different principles. For instance, if we want to ensure that when two singles get married their total tax bill will not rise--but we do not mind if two married couples with the same overall income level are treated differently, then we arrive at one result. However, if we want to make sure that two singles who marry do not face increased taxes--and we want to make sure that two married couples with the same income level are treated evenly--then we arrive at a different result. 
   Last year, the Senate position in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 only embraced the first policy result. We focused on what people refer to as the marriage tax penalty--in other words, the difference between what two spouses would pay in taxes if they were single versus what they would pay in taxes if they were married. In developing the specific provision, we took aim only at one particular definition of a marriage tax relief penalty. We developed a system whereby a married couple would have an option. The couple could continue to file a joint return using the existing schedule of married filing jointly. Or the couple could choose to file a joint return using the separate schedules for single taxpayers. It was straightforward, and it was universal--we did not try to impose arbitrary income limits to cut off the relief. 
   As I said last year, the separate filing option had a lot of good things about it. Most importantly, I liked the way that the plan basically eliminated the marriage penalty for all taxpayers who suffered from it. 
   It delivered relief to those in the lowest brackets as well as to those in the highest brackets. 
   However we should also remember that last year's approach was part of a larger package of tax relief. We should all remember this point: America's families were going to receive relief from other provisions in that bill. Last year's marriage penalty provision was part of a comprehensive tax bill directed towards American families. Other pieces of the bill--the cuts in the 15 percent rate bracket, the expansion of the child care credit--provided additional benefits to American families. So, the separate filing option should not be viewed in a vacuum; instead, it must be seen as part of a comprehensive tax relief package. In any event, as we all know, none of the pieces of last year's tax cut package--neither the marriage penalty relief nor anything else--made it into law. Because President Clinton vetoed that bill, America's families have been denied the tax relief that they deserve. 
   This year I felt that we should take a different approach to marriage tax relief. As the Chairman of the Finance Committee, I am responsible for developing tax policy in a fair and rational manner. I am also responsible for working with members of my committee and of the full Senate. 
   After listening to my colleagues' views on marriage tax relief, I came to the conclusion that the best approach this time is to build on the foundation that Congress 
   has already approved. Last year, in the conference report of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999, Congress adopted three components of marriage penalty relief. These included an expansion of the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly; a widening of the tax brackets; and an increase in the income phase-outs for the earned income credit. A different part of that bill addressed the minimum tax issue. Earlier this year, the House passed a marriage penalty tax bill that included the first three components. 
   And so the Finance Committee bill, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000, uses these same building blocks. This is important--not just for purposes of building and maintaining consensus--but for policy reasons as well. 
   You see, if we target relief only at the families that suffer a marriage penalty, we begin to violate another of the three principles that I described earlier. Since 1948, our tax system has adhered to the principle of treating all married couples with the same amount of income equally. In other words, each household that earns $80,000--regardless of the breakdown of that income--would pay the same amount of tax. It does not matter whether one spouse earns all $80,000 while the other spouse works at home taking care of the children; and it does not matter whether both spouses work outside the home and earn $40,000 each. Each household with the same amount of income is treated the same for tax purposes. 
   As we studied how best to solve the marriage penalty--to ensure that the tax code does not provide a disincentive to get married--we realized that it was extremely important to stick to this principle of equal treatment. In solving one penalty, we don't want to  be creating a new penalty--a new disincentive for America's families. We did not think that the tax code should deliver a new, so-called ``homemaker penalty''--where a family with only one wage earner is treated worse than a family where both spouses work. This is what would happen if we used a separate filing option. Many people have argued that tax policy should not discourage one parent from staying at home and raising the family. It is a laudable goal and one that I strongly support. 
   Retention of the equal treatment principle is especially important in a tax bill such as the one we have before us. Unlike last year's tax bill, this one does not include rate cuts or enhanced family tax credits. All America's taxpaying families have contributed to the tax overpayment in Washington today. All these families, therefore, deserve to receive some of the benefits that we are seeking to return to the American people. We should not pick out some married couples over others. 
   We should not be picking winners and losers from America's families in some Washington game of musical chairs. And that is what we would do if we left out those families where one spouse works maintaining a home and a family. Under the proposal offered by Democrats in the Finance Committee, over 17 million homemaker families would be left out of tax relief. In my state of Delaware, over 30,000 homemaker families would be left standing at the altar by the Democrats proposal. 
   Now let me take a few minutes and describe the provisions of our bill. First, we enlarge the standard deduction for married couples. Under current law, for the year 2000, the standard deduction for a single taxpayer is $4,400. The standard deduction for a married couple filing a joint return is $7,350. That means that for couples who use a standard deduction--and those are generally low and middle income couples--they are losing $1,450 in extra deductions each year. At a 28-percent tax rate, that lost deduction translates into an extra tax liability of $406 each and every year. 
   The Finance Committee bill increases the standard deduction for married couples so that it is twice the size of the standard deduction for singles, and we do that immediately, in 2001. When fully effective, this provision provides tax relief to approximately 25 million couples filing joint returns, including more than 6 million returns filed by senior citizens. 
   Increasing the standard deduction also has the added benefit of simplifying the Tax Code. Approximately 3 million couples who currently itemize their deductions will realize the simplification benefits of using the standard deduction. 
   Second, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 addresses the cause of the greatest dollar amount of the marriage tax penalty--the structure of the rate brackets. Under current law, the 15-percent rate bracket for single filers ends at taxable income of $26,250. The 15-percent rate bracket for married couples filing jointly ends with taxable income of $43,850, which one can see is less than twice the single rate bracket. In practical terms, that means that when two individuals who each earn taxable income of $30,000 get married and file a joint tax return, $8,650 of their income is taxed at the 28-percent rate rather than at the 15-percent rate that the income would have been subject to if they had remained single. The extra tax liability for that couple each year comes out to $1,125. 
   The Finance Committee bill remedies that fundamental unfairness. The bill adjusts the end point of the 15-percent rate bracket for married couples so that it is twice the sum of the end point of the bracket for single filers. Recognizing that the rate structure hurts all married couples, the bill also adjusts the end points of the 28-percent rate bracket as well. 
   When fully effective, this provision will provide tax relief to approximately 21 million couples filing joint returns, including more than 4 million returns filed by senior citizens. 
   Third, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 addresses the biggest source of the marriage tax penalty for low income, working families--the earned income credit. This complicated credit is determined by using a schedule for the number of qualifying children, and then multiplying the credit rate by the taxpayer's earned income up to a certain amount. The credit is phased out above certain income levels. What that means is that two people who are each receiving the earned income credit as singles may lose all or some of their credit when they get married. 
   In order to address that problem, the Finance Committee bill increases the beginning and ending 
   points of the income levels of the phaseout of the credit for married couples filing a joint return. For a couple with two or more qualifying children, this could mean as much as $526 in extra credit. This provision would also expand the number of married couples who would be eligible for the credit. It will help almost 4 million families. 
   Fourth, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 tries to make sure that families can continue to receive the family tax credits that Congress has enacted over the past several years. Each year, an increasing number of American families are finding that their family tax credits--such as the child credit and the Hope Scholarship education credit--are being cut back or eliminated because of the alternative minimum tax. Last year, Congress made a small downpayment on this problem, temporarily carving out these family tax credits from the minimum tax calculations. This year, we are building on that bipartisan approach, by permanently extending the preservation of the family tax credits. 
   Because of this provision, millions of taxpayers will no longer face the burden of making minimum tax calculations for the purpose of determining the family tax credits they need. 
   Finally, the committee included a provision to ensure that we complied with the Budget Act. Because we were not allowed to decrease revenues outside of the period covered by the budget resolution--which is 5 years--the bill sunsets all of the provisions in the bill after 2004. It goes without saying that I do not think it is good policy to sunset these tax benefits. They should be permanent and I expect that they will be permanent when this bill is signed into law. Accordingly, I will propose an amendment to strike the sunset. I expect all of my colleagues to join with me in supporting that amendment. 
   How much does this marriage tax penalty relief help? It helps a lot. Over 45 million families will get marriage tax relief under this legislation. In my State of Delaware, over 100,000 families will benefit. Every family earning over $10,000 per year will see their tax bill fall at least 1 percent--except those at high income levels. The key to this legislation is that it helps the middle class. Sixty percent of this bill's tax relief goes to those families making $100,000 or less. 
   Who are these people? They are two married civil engineers, or a pharmacist who is married to a school teacher. They are the policeman and his wife who runs a small gift shop in Dover. They are the firefighter who is married to a social worker, or a librarian who is married to an accountant. These are the families who will benefit. 
   They will benefit even more, as you examine the impact this tax relief will have over time. Consider the effect if these tax savings were put away for their children's education and retirement. If a couple with two children making just $30,000 took their tax savings from this bill and put it into an education savings account like the one recently passed by the Senate, they would have $40,000 for those children's college education. 
   Based on the stock market's historical rate of return, that is $40,000 if they did not set aside another penny. If the family was that of two elementary school teachers with two children and earning average salaries of $70,000 combined, they would have $65,000 after 18 years. 
   If those two married school teachers then started to put their tax savings from this bill into a Roth IRA after 18 years, this same couple would have $224,100 when they retired 27 years later. 
   By transforming these tax savings into personal savings, we see that these real tax savings translate into real opportunities for these families. 
   And consider the effect on the economy. According to an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, in 2004 this marriage tax penalty relief legislation will  result in additional jobs. It will increase the personal savings rate by three-tenths of 1 percent, which in turn will lower interest rates. According to estimates done by the economists at the Heritage Foundation, the favorable economic impact of the tax relief would increase overall disposable income by $45 billion in 2004. That means that the average family of four would see an additional $670 in income--just from the positive economic impact. So not only do married families gain, not only do their children gain, but the entire country gains. They gain more jobs, better jobs, and higher wages because of this marriage tax relief legislation. 
   The marriage tax relief legislation I bring to the floor today amounts to just 3 percent of the total budget surplus over the next 5 years. It amounts to just 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus over the next 5 years. It amounts to just 42 percent of the new spending provided for in this year's budget over the next 5 years. Finally, it amounts to just one third of the tax cut that has been allotted to the Finance Committee for tax cuts over the next 5 years in this year's budget. By any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax penalty relief is fiscally responsible. 
   This bill does all these things for America's working families while preserving every cent of Social Security's surplus. These tax cuts do not have to pit America's families against America's seniors, nor does it extend a tax cut in a fiscally irresponsible manner. These tax cuts fit in this year's budget, along with the other Republican priorities that we have already passed for education, health care, and small businesses. Our priorities add up to what's good for America, and our numbers add up to what is fiscally responsible. 
   It is time we stopped playing the politics of division. We do not have to pit one type of family against another type of family or families against seniors to do what is right. It is time we divorce the marriage penalty from the Tax Code once and for all. For too long Washington has been an unclaimed dependent in millions of America's families. I urge all my colleagues to support the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, the earned income credit, or EIC, is an important antipoverty tool. It gives an incentive for families to help themselves. It provides low-income workers with a tax credit, thereby increasing their real wages. It gives poor and middle-class families an extra incentive to help themselves. While the program is by no means perfect, it has been one of the more effective Government programs in pushing families above the poverty line. 
   The structure of the EIC is the largest source of the marriage penalty for low-income families. Our bill addresses this inequity by increasing the beginning and ending income phaseout levels of the credit for married couples by $2,500. Our proposal goes to families, just as the original EIC program was intended to do. 
   Mr. President, I move to raise a point of order against section 4, from page 5, line 12, through page 7, line 3, of the bill, that it violates section 313 of the Budget Act. 
   Mr. President, I furthermore move to waive all points of order under the budget process arising from the earned-income credit component in the Senate bill, the Moynihan substitute, the House companion bill, and any conference report thereon. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROTH. This alternative amendment would allow married couples the option to file as two singles on their joint return. It is the same amendment that Senator MOYNIHAN offered in the Finance Committee a few weeks ago. It is a concept I have endorsed in the past, primarily because it has the capability to deliver complete marriage penalty relief to all taxpayers, both at the low end and at the high end. It was a principled approach to ending the marriage penalty in our Tax Code. 
   But the amendment the Senator offers today cuts away from that principled approach. Today's amendment imposes arbitrary income limits on the marriage penalty relief and begins to phase out the benefits at $100,000 of income, and then completely shuts them off at $150,000 per couple. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 1999, there were about 7.5 million joint returns with an adjusted gross income greater than $100,000. And 56 percent of that group, or 4.2 million couples, suffered from a marriage penalty. The total amount of marriage penalty suffered by those couples is almost $12 billion, which is more than one-third of all the marriage penalties caused by our Tax Code. 
   The average marriage penalty faced by each one of these families is about $2,800. Yet despite these significant marriage penalties encountered by these couples--and they claim that this is a targeted tax bill to eliminate the marriage tax--this substitute amendment turns its back on those taxpayers. The amendment tells these  folks they make too much money and should not receive complete relief. 
   A few weeks ago, during the Finance Committee markup on the marriage penalty, and the subsequent procedural debate on the 
   Senate floor, the Democratic alternative was a separate filing regime with no income limits. Now the substitute amendment has arbitrary income limits. 
   What has happened in the last 3 months? The surplus estimates have outgrown even the rosiest expectations. We continue to see the accumulation of tremendous on-budget surpluses. We have continued to see more and more evidence of America's tax overpayment. Especially in this environment, I cannot see any rationale for creating some arbitrary income level. Yet that is precisely what this amendment does. It seems to me that we are going in the wrong direction. This is just not right. 
   Over the past few years, all of us--both Democrats and Republicans--have talked at length about the fundamental unfairness of the marriage penalty in the Tax Code. But if we really believe it is a policy that needs to be changed--I believe that it does--then we should change it for all Americans. I do not see how we can justify solving the marriage tax penalty for some but letting it remain for others at an arbitrary income level. This does not have to be--and should not be--an issue of the rich versus the poor. 
   While I do not agree with this amendment, I do want to commend my colleague for recognizing American families deserve substantial tax relief. Over 5 years, this alternative costs the same as the marriage tax relief reconciliation bill of 2000--a total of $55 billion. It is nice to see many Members have recognized that we should return the income tax overpayment to families across the country. This amendment takes what could be a good framework and destroys it with income limits. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the substitute amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have a statement to make on behalf of the leader. I recall what my colleague said about today. I hope we can move as expeditiously as possible. It is not necessary that on each of these amendments we take the full time. Obviously, there should be full debate, but I hope, since we have 20 amendments, we can move, as I say, with dispatch. 
   Today the Senate will begin debate on the Death Tax Elimination Act. By previous consent, the Senate will proceed to the final votes on the Department of Defense authorization bill at approximately 9:30 a.m. Following the disposition of the DOD authorization bill, the Senate will resume the death tax legislation with amendments to be offered and voted on throughout the day. 
   As previously announced, the Senate will complete action on the death tax bill and the reconciliation legislation prior to adjournment this week. Therefore, Senators should be prepared for a late Friday session and a Saturday session if necessary. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Senate Democrats have proposed an amendment as an alternative proposal to H.R. 8 known as the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. 
   In their alternative, my colleagues across the aisle continue to rely upon the concept of a ``unified credit'' against the death tax. Their $1 million unified credit does not equal H.R. 8's $1 million exemption. The math behind the Democratic alternative forces the families of the deceased to continue to pay the very high tax rate of 41 percent for even one dollar over their $1 million unified credit. 
   Now compare that to the reasonable 18 percent tax rate for the first dollar over our proposed $1 million exemption. H.R. 8's use of an exemption versus the Democratic alternative's use of a credit literally cuts the remaining tax rate in half or modest estates. In short, the Democratic alternative still has a ``cliff effect.'' If the total fair market value, based on the Internal Revenue's opinion as to the estate's highest and best use, happens to exceed the Democratic credit, then the family is immediately exposed to death tax rates 41 to 60 percent. 
   The Democratic alternative fails to take advantage of the lower estate tax rates currently provided in the tax code. Their increase in the unified credit to $1 million forces American families to still pay death taxes ranging from 41 to 60 percent. 
   While H.R. 8's use of the exemption would allow American families the benefit of the lower tax rates beginning at 18 percent until such time as all of the death taxes are eliminated. 
   I think through all of the debates, most if not all of my colleagues in the Senate would agree that the influences of a strong economy have created $1 million estates in American families who have never had to face these types of overwhelming tax burdens. Dozens of American cities continue to report that the average sales price for a single family home has climbed to more than $250,000. Their average homes are worth a quarter of a million dollars, by the time you add life insurance for husband and wife, 401(k)s and IRAs to the fair market value of their homes many American families could be facing the previously unknown burden of death tax. 
   Even though the Democratic alternative goes on to eventually increase the unified credit to $2 million by the year 2009, American families' life insurance, 401(k)s, IRAs, and other lifetime savings are exposed to death taxes beginning at 49 to 60 percent for every dollar above the credit. 
   In vast contrast, those same families would be shielded from all death taxes after 2009, under our proposed Death Tax Elimination Act, H.R. 8. 
   Additionally, the Democratic alternative attempts to target its proposed relief to family farms and small businesses by raising the family farm and small business deduction from $1.3 million per decedent 
   to $2 million per decedent in the year 2001. Beginning in 2006 through 2009 the deduction would  then be increased through a series of steps to $4 million per decedent. 
   First of all, I am concerned that under the Democratic alternative, only those estates with over 50 percent of the estate in small businesses would qualify for relief. Upon the detailed review of the 50 percent requirement it becomes obvious that their alternative has several complicated adjustments, which includes all gifts made to the spouse within 10 years of death. This fact alone makes this approach very limited. 
   In addition to the 50 percent requirement, the Democratic alternative requires that for ten years beyond the date of death, small business families shall have an additional estate tax imposed if the family must dispose of any portion of the family owned business interest for such reasons as bankruptcy or foreclosure. The additional tax is a portion of what would have been owed without the small business exemption and the accrued interest from the date of death. 
   Second, I am also concerned about the complexity of this approach. The Democratic alternative would require the use of business appraisals and also the preparing and filing of extensive paperwork for up to 10 years beyond death. 
   After a couple of years of this targeted modest relief having been in effect, I have heard about how it is working. Based on what family farmers and small business folks are telling me in Delaware, I have some misgivings about whether this approach is taking care of most or all of the cases. 
   Since this complex provision was originally passed in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, 902 estates have elected the current $1.3 million deduction available under the code. Our experience in the area of estate tax provisions leads us to believe that if the Internal Revenue Service challenges as many of the estate valuations as they do under similar provision then only about one-third of the estates that could elect under this provision would benefit under the Democratic alternative. 
   There are other significant differences between H.R. 8 and the Democratic alternative. H.R. 8 has painstakingly attempted to address multiple concerns in the rules under the generation skipping transfer tax provisions, in a sincere effort to make those rules less burdensome and less complex. Those technical rules, if violated by accident or otherwise generate an additional tax for violating the restriction against generation skipping transfers, by levying 55 percent tax over and above the 41 to 60 percent death tax already due and owing on the total value of the estate. The Democratic alternative does not address the much needed technical changes to general skipping transfer taxes. 
   Additionally, H.R. 8 has expanded the geographical limitations to qualified conservation easements. This is in recognition of the opportunity to further ease existing pressures to develop or sell environmentally significant land when families must raise funds to pay death taxes. 
   The Democratic alternative has not even considered this important issue nor has it attempted to advance the preservation of such land. 
   Now the Democratic leadership has repeatedly complained as to the expense associated with the Death Tax 
   Elimination Act of 2000. But their own alternative is expecting a revenue loss of $64 billion over 10 years, roughly 60 percent of the revenue loss of H.R. 8. This is a $64 billion revenue loss that does not even protect those American families with simple homes, savings, insurance, qualified plans, and investments that do not include a farm or a business. 
   H.R. 8 repeals the whole estate and gift tax regime in 2010. But, because there are billions of dollars of assets previously untaxed, if the heirs sell any portion of the estate, capital gains taxes are then due and owing. Taxes are then paid at the right time, when the heirs convert the asset to cash. The tax is not collected on an arbitrary and traumatic event such as death. Nor is tax collected on an arbitrary valuation based on paper equity that has never been realized. 
   Moderately sized estates would be safeguarded from this capital gains tax exposure. The step up in basis is retained for all estates in an amount of up to $1.3 million per estate. In addition, transfers to a surviving spouse would receive an additional step up in the amount of $3 million. So a family could cumulatively receive a step up in basis of $5.6 million at the death of both husband and wife. This effectively protects moderately sized estates from both death tax and capital gain tax exposure. 
   The House passed the bill on a bipartisan basis with 65 Democrats voting in favor of repeal of the estate and gift taxes. Now is the Senate's opportunity to pass this bill on a bipartisan basis and send it to the President. It is my understanding this will be the only chance this year that we will have to pass this bill and repeal estate and gift taxes. If we fail, the bill dies. If we come together and vote in favor of the House bill--estate tax repeal that the Congress passed last year--it will go directly to the President for his signature. 
   This should not be a partisan issue. 
   Unfortunately, the White House has indicated its opposition to repeal of estate and gift taxes and has promised to veto this bill. With roughly $2 trillion of estimated non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years, I believe the approximately $105 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes to be well within reason--it is only about 5 percent of the projected non-Social Security surplus. 
   Taxpayers are taxed on their earnings during their lives at least once. Our Nation has been built on the notion that anyone who works hard has the opportunity to succeed and create wealth. The estate and gift taxes are a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated. It is the right thing to do. 
   It has been said that there are only two certainties: death and taxes. The two are bad enough, but leave it to the Federal Government to find a way to make them worse by adding them together. This is probably the worst example of adding insult to injury ever devised. Yet Washington perpetuates over and over again on hard working families who have already paid taxes every day they have worked. 
   The Democratic alternative fails to address the needs of the American people. Therefore I urge my colleagues to support the majority leader and vote for H.R. 8. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the amendment before us has a fundamental deficiency. It is built on the Democratic alternative to the House tax repeal bill. In other words, this amendment strikes the House death tax repeal and replaces it with the Democratic alternative which was just rejected by a rollcall vote a few minutes ago. 
   Let me reemphasize once again that the Democratic alternative fails to correct the fatal flaws of the family-owned business deduction. According to well-known members of the American Bar Association, those fatal flaws make it virtually impossible to qualify for the tax deduction. 
   What I am saying is that those of you who voted against the Democratic alternative should vote against this amendment because this amendment, once again, seeks to substitute the Democratic alternative. 
   The amendment also contains some interesting ideas on education. But they should be looked at in the context of our other education incentives. One proposal, for instance, is that we allow a tax deduction for higher education costs. If a taxpayer takes that deduction, then he or she will not be allowed to take the lifetime learning credit at the same time. Families are already confused and troubled by the complexity of these educational incentives. So adding a new one with a different tax would further confuse the situation. 
   Again, we are anxious to move on to a vote. I emphasize to those on my side that this amendment would substitute the Democratic alternative for the repeal of death taxes in substitution of the House repeal. 
   I urge everyone to vote against this amendment. 
   I yield my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today would repeal the telephone excise tax. My amendment is the same as the bill that was recently approved by the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis. 
   The phone tax repeal bill that Senator BREAUX and I introduced earlier this year now has 43 cosponsors--members on both sides of the aisle. The House of Representatives has already voted to repeal the tax by a vote of 420 to 2. 
   Mr. President, all of us who support repeal have recognized that the telephone excise tax is outdated, unfair, and complex for both consumers to understand and for the collectors to administer. It cannot be justified on any tax policy grounds. 
   The federal government has had the American consumer on ``hold'' for too long when it comes to this tax. The telephone excise tax has been around for over 102 years. In fact, it was first imposed in 1898--just 22 years after the telephone itself was invented. 
   This tax on talking--as it is known--currently stands at 3 percent. Today, about 94 percent of all American families have telephone service. 
   That means that virtually every family in the United States must tack an additional 3 percent on their monthly phone bill. The Federal tax applies to local phone service; it applies to long distance service; and it even applies in some cases to the extra amounts paid for State and local taxes. It is estimated that this tax costs the American public more than $5 billion per year. 
   The telephone excise tax is a classic story of a tax that has been severed from its original justifications, but lives on solely to collect money. 
   This tax is a pure money grab by the Federal Government--it does not pass any of the traditional criteria used for evaluating tax policy. First, this phone tax is outmoded. Once upon a time, it could have been argued that telephone service was a luxury item and that only the rich would be affected. As we all know, there is nothing further from the truth today. 
   Second, the Federal phone tax is unfair. Because this tax is a flat 3 percent, it applies disproportionately to low and middle income people. For example, studies show that an American family making less than $50,000 per year spends at least 2 percent of its income on telephone service. These families also pay almost 60 percent of the total communications excise tax in the U.S. Families with incomes of under $20,000 earn less than 9 percent of the total income in the U.S.; yet they shoulder almost one-quarter of the total communications tax burden. A family earning less than $10,000 per year spends over 9 percent of its income on telephone service. Imposing a tax on those families for a service that is a necessity in a modern society is simply not fair. 
   Third, the Federal phone tax is complex. Once upon a time, phone service was simple--there was one company who provided it. It was an easy tax to administer. Now, however, phone service is intertwined with data services and Internet access, and it brings about a whole new set of complexities. For instance, a common way to provide high speed Internet 
   access is through a digital subscriber line. This DSL line allows a user to have simultaneous access to the Internet and to telephone communications. How should it be taxed? Should the tax be apportioned? Should the whole line be tax free? And what will we do when cable, wireless, and satellite companies provide voice and data communications over the same system? The burdensome complexity of today will only become more difficult tomorrow. 
   As these questions are answered, we run the risk of distorting the market by favoring certain technologies. There are already numerous exceptions and carve-outs to the phone tax. For instance, private communications services are exempt from the tax. That allows large, sophisticated companies to establish communications networks and avoid paying any Federal phone tax. It goes without saying that American families do not have that same option. 
   With new technology, we also may exacerbate the inequities of the tax and contribute to the digital divide. For example, consider two families that decide it's time to connect their homes to the Internet. The first family installs another phone line for regular Internet access. The second family decides to buy a more expensive, dedicated high speed line for Internet access. The first family definitely gets hit with the phone tax, while the second family may end up paying no tax at all on their connection. I can't see any policy rationale for that result. 
   It is time to end the Federal phone tax. For too long while America has been listening to a dial tone, Washington has been hearing a dollar tone. This tax is outmoded. It has been here since Alexander Graham Bell himself was alive. It is unfair. We are today taxing a poor family with a tax that was originally meant for a luxury item. It is complex. Only a communications engineer can today understand the myriad taxes levied on a common phone bill and only the Federal Government has the wherewithal to keep track of who and what will be taxed. It is time we hung up the phone tax once and for all. 
   Ninety-three million households and 23 million business service companies are waiting for us to act. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its repeal. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which addresses a very important topic for many Americans--retirement savings. 
   Many Americans, especially Boomers, increasingly worry: Will I have enough to live on when I retire? According to recent studies, one third of Americans are not confident that they will have enough to live on in their retirement years, and for others that optimism about retirement income may not be well founded. 
   Savings--whether through employer retirement plans or as personal savings--are necessary for a comfortable retirement. 
   Overall savings by Americans are at an all time low. The U.S. Department of Commerce stated that Americans' personal savings rate for the first half of 1999 fell below zero. 
   I believe, and many economists agree, that increasing tax incentives for savings will result in more savings. 
   The amendment I offer provides many tax incentives which will result in greater savings. Let me outline just a few of them. 
   The maximum contribution limit for IRAs both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs is $2,000. This limit, which has been in place since 1982, has never been indexed for inflation. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, If the IRA limit were indexed for inflation it would be over $5,000. 
   This amendment increases the contribution limit for all IRAs (both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs) to $5,000 per year and under that amount for inflation. 
   It is important to remember that people at all income levels make IRA contributions. 
   An estimated 26 percent of American households now own a traditional IRA. In 1993 (the most recent year for which comprehensive aggregate data is available) 52 percent of all IRA owners earned less than $50,000. 
   We know that people at all income levels are limited by the $2,000 cap on contributions. For example, IRS statistics show that the average contribution level in 1993 for people with less than $20,000 in income was $1,500. 
   Lower income people clearly want to make contributions of more than the $2,000 limit. 
   This amendment also increases other benefit limitations. Currently, the maximum pre-tax contribution to a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) annuity is $10,000. 
   In addition, the maximum contribution to a 457(b) plan, a plan for employees of government and tax exempt organizations is $8,000. 
   Finally, the maximum contribution to a simple plan, a simplified defined contribution plan available only to small employers, is $6,000. 
   This amendment increases limits for 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans to $15,000 and for simple plans to $10,000. 
   This does not mean that business executives can automatically take advantage of these higher contribution limits; lower income employees must benefit in order for the executive to benefit. 
   Consequently, business owners and high paid employees cannot benefit with this new higher contribution limits unless the amount of savings that low paid people make--either on their  own or with the help of the employer--increases. 
   This amendment adds a new type of employer savings plan. 
   We heard testimony before the Finance Committee that the first year of the Roth IRA was a success. And we have all seen the television and print ads touting the benefits of the Roth IRA. The opportunity for tax-free investment returns has clearly caught the fancy of the American people. 
   In less than five months after the Roth IRA became available, approximately 3 percent of American households owned a Roth IRA. 
   In addition, the survey found that the typical Roth IRA owner was 37 years old, significantly younger than the traditional IRA owner who is about 50 years old, and that 30 percent of Roth IRA owners indicated that the Roth IRA was the first IRA they had ever owned. 
   This amendment intends to harness the power of the Roth IRA and give it to participants in 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans. 
   We will give companies the opportunity to give participants in 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans the ability to contribute to these plans on an after-tax basis, with the earnings on such contributions being tax-free when distributed, like the Roth IRA. 
   This amendment will also provide an additional savings opportunity to those individuals who are close to retirement. 
   We all know that there can be other pressing financial needs earlier in life--school loans, home loans, taking time off to raise the kids--which limit the amount that we may have available to save for retirement. 
   The closer that we get to retirement, the more we want to put away for those years when we are not working. 
   However, the current law limitations on how much may be contributed to tax qualified savings vehicles may restrict people's ability to save at this time in their lives. 
   This amendment will give those who are near retirement--age 50--the opportunity to contribute an additional amount in excess of the annual limits equal to an additional 50% of the annual limit. 
   Catch-up contributions will be allowed in 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, 457(b) plans and IRAs. 
   For IRAs, this will mean that someone age 50 could contribute $7,500 each year rather than $5,000. 
   Never before have Americans had better opportunities to provide for a comfortable retirement--with a strong economy together with increasing opportunities for saving and investment. 
   The result of this amendment will be more personal savings to assist people in providing for a comfortable retirement. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, providing for America's long-term care needs is an important priority. An important way to help Americans provide for their long-term care needs is by providing various tax incentives. 
   We have already addressed many of these long-term care tax incentives in other tax bills the Senate has voted on. More recently, the Senate approved the various tax incentives for long-term care insurance and provided for an additional tax exemption for those who are caring for their parents who have long-term care needs. 
   Last year, the Senate approved a bill which would have provided tax incentives for long-term care insurance. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill. When we added these tax provisions to the managed care bill, my friends on the other side opposed these incentives. 
   I think it is fair to say the Senate has shown its concern towards helping Americans provide for long-term care. However, I must oppose this legislation for it contains a basic defect. It is built on the Democratic alternative to the House death tax repeal bill. In other words, it strikes the House death tax repeal and replaces it with the Democratic alternative. 
   For this reason, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD. I do so because the commission created by this legislation is, in my view, flawed. That is why I tried to work with my good friend from West Virginia to address the concerns that I am raising. Unfortunately, we were unable to come to an  agreement. For the following reasons, I must oppose this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   First, let me say that if my colleague's intent is to establish a commission to provide sound advice to Congress regarding our broader relationship with China and its effect on our national security, then there are ways to create a meaningful mechanism for doing just that. One, for example, would have been to build the Senator's concerns into the quadrennial defense review required under previous versions of the National Defense Authorization Act. By giving the responsibility to a standing body like the National Defense Panel that already conducts the quadrennial defense review, we would have saved the taxpayers' money, while getting the benefit of the unchallenged expertise of many of the foremost authorities on our national security and on military matters. And, we would have put the report in Congress' hands by next spring. 
   Instead, my colleague has adopted an approach I have not seen in my years in the Senate. He wants to take the commissioners, staff and clerical personnel of a commission constructed for very different purposes and employ it to look at our security relationship with China. That commission--the Trade Deficit Review Commission--is staffed with commissioners and staff appointed due to their expertise in economic policy. Frankly, this is simply the wrong group to undertake a serious review of the impact on our national security of our relationship with China. And, there is absolutely no benefit in terms of accelerating the progress toward a final report when compared to giving the responsibility to the National Defense Panel. 
   I must say that I do not understand my friend's interest in perpetuating the life of the Trade Deficit Review Commission for this task. The Trade Deficit Review Commission is already overdue in providing us its report on the trade deficit. My expectation when we created that commission was that we would have had its work product by now. Instead, my colleague recently supported a three-month extension so the Trade Deficit Review Commission could complete its now amply-delayed report. In my view, we should let the Trade Deficit Commission complete its existing work, rather than burdening it with new responsibilities, even if only administrative in nature, before it has completed its primary task. 
   Second, I am concerned that the way the issues as stated in my friend's bill could be read to imply that the United States already considers China an enemy and a threat to our national security. China clearly is an emerging force in the international arena. In many ways, China's emergence could be beneficial to the United States. There are, nonetheless, concerns, which I share, regarding the PRC's behavior on security-related matters. Those issues bear careful scrutiny. 
   Having said that, it should also be clear that the shape and direction of the relationship between our countries is evolving and remains to be shaped. What that suggests is the need for a thoughtful, comprehensive and, most importantly, balanced review of the security implications of our bilateral relationship with China. That is, in fact, what I suggested to my colleague we should do. 
   Third, I offered my friend my thoughts on the technical changes needed to make the commission's job clear. I worry, however, that, as it stands now, the commission's duties will be extremely difficult for any commissioner to decipher. For example, the proposed commission is supposed to examine the ``portion of trade in goods and services that the People's Republic of China dedicates to military systems or systems of a dual nature that could be used for military purposes.'' The problem is no country dedicates its trade to military systems. That is simply not a meaningful concept. I am not even sure what a ``system of a dual nature'' is? It is, furthermore, literally impossible for a country to dedicate a portion of a trade surplus to its military budget because a trade surplus is not cash in hand, as the proposal implies. 
   Similarly, the proposal simply misunderstands the nature of the World Trade Organization and particularly Article XXI if it asks for recommendations as to how China's participation there would harm us or whether Article XXI should be more frequently invoked. What the WTO provides is a forum in which to negotiate the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers. What do we have to fear from China lowering its trade barriers in national security terms? As to Article XXI, that provision is invoked when we do something to China in trade terms, not when China does something to us. 
   That leads me to my final point. What the statement of the proposed commission's duties makes clear, and what I object to most strongly to, is its premise. There are many issues that I could conceive of addressing in a serious, comprehensive and balanced review of our security relationship with China. Issues related to regional stability and weapons proliferation to name just two. But, what this amendment suggests is that our commercial engagement with China somehow threatens our national security interests--that in some way, the fact that we buy toys and appliances from the Chinese, and the fact that they buy agricultural products and heavy equipment from us endangers the American people. That is simply not the case. 
   Nor is there anything about China's upcoming accession to the World Trade Organization that makes such a review any more relevant. After all, China has committed to open its market to our goods and services to gain entry to the WTO. China's accession to the WTO does nothing to reduce our security. If anything, it reduces a point of friction in our relationship with China in a way that is only positive. 
   Under the circumstances, I cannot support the creation of a permanent commission with an uncertain mission that would not reach many of the fundamental issues that should be addressed in our relationship with China. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment as well.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000, which overwhelmingly passed in the House by a vote of 279-136. I point out that it was a bipartisan vote. It included 65 Democrats. So this legislation that we are about to proceed to has significant bipartisan support. 
   This is an historic opportunity to repeal the onerous estate and gift taxes which currently have rates as high as 60 percent. In an age of surpluses where taxpayers are, indeed, paying too much, it is time to repeal the estate and gift taxes. Families who toil all their lives to build a business and diligently save and invest should not be penalized for their hard work when they die. Their assets were already taxed at least once--and it is unconscionable that their estates are taxed again at rates as high as 60 percent on the value of their assets at the time of their death. 
   This bill would address this problem. 
   I point out, we have held hearings on estate taxes in the Finance Committee as of the last Congress. It is the Finance Committee that is the committee of jurisdiction. 
   I also point out, this bill is substantially similar to the estate tax provisions in the tax bill that was vetoed by  the President last year. Some may ask why this House bill did not come through the Finance Committee. The reason is that the bill holds to the estate tax provisions the House and Senate agreed to last year. Since the Finance Committee has already debated and approved these provisions and we have negotiated these provisions with the House, I saw no need to delay the bill in the committee and perhaps kill the chance of repealing the tax. 
   Now, I would like to briefly go through the bill before us. I point out, there are really two time periods to which the bill applies. In the first period, generally from 2001 to 2009, estate tax relief is provided on several fronts. In the second period, beginning in 2010, the entire estate and gift tax regime is repealed. 
   During the first part, from 2001 to 2009, the estate and gift tax rates are reduced on both the high end and low end. On the low end, currently, there is a unified credit that applies to the first $675,000 of an estate. That amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million in 2006. 
   While current law provides some relief for the smallest estates, for modest estates, those above the credit amount, a high tax rate applies. For example, now a decedent's estate of $750,000 faces a tax rate of 37 percent on each dollar over the credit amount. Keep in mind that is where the rate starts. For larger estates, the rates can be as high as 60 percent. 
   For the lower end estates, the bill converts the unified credit to an exemption. What this means is that estates right above the unified credit amount will face tax rates starting at 18 percent rather than 37 percent. In other words, for modest size estates, this bill cuts the tax rate in half. 
   For the larger estates, some now facing marginal rates as high as 60 percent, the bill includes a phased in rate cut. The rates are reduced from the current regime, with its highest rate of 60 percent, down to a top rate of 40.5 percent for the highest end estates. Please keep in mind that the base of the tax is property, not income, and the rate is still above the highest income tax rate of 39.6 percent. 
   Prior to full repeal in 2010, the bill would also expand the estate tax rules for conservation easements to encourage conservation. In addition, the bill provides simplification measures for the generation skipping transfer tax. 
   In 2010, the whole estate and gift tax regime is repealed. At the same time, a carryover basis regime is put in place instead of the current law step up in basis. This means that all taxable estates--and I emphasize we are only talking about taxable estates--that now enjoy a step up in basis will be subject to a carryover basis. Carryover basis simply means that the beneficiary of the estate's property receives the same basis as the decedent. For example, if a decedent purchased a farm for $100,000, and the farm was worth $2 million at death, the tax basis in the hands of the heirs would be $100,000. The step in basis is retained for all transfers in an amount up to $1.3 million per estate. In addition, transfers to a surviving spouse receive an additional step up of $3 million. 
   As I have already pointed out, the House passed the bill on a bipartisan basis with 65 Democrats voting in favor of repeal of the estate and gift taxes. 
   Now is the Senate's opportunity to pass this bill on a bipartisan basis and send it to the President. It is my understanding this will be the only chance this year that we will have to pass this bill and repeal estate and gift taxes. If we fail, the bill dies. If we come together and vote in favor of the house bill--estate tax repeal that the Congress passed last year--it will go directly to the President for his signature. 
   Our family-owned businesses and farms must not be denied this relief. This should not be a partisan issue. 
   Unfortunately, the White House has indicated its opposition to repeal of estate and gift taxes and has promised to veto this bill. With roughly $2 trillion of estimated non-social security surpluses over the next 10 years, I believe the approximately $105 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes to be well within reason--it is only about 5 percent of the projected budget surplus. Other than being a money grab--estate and gift taxes do not serve any legitimate purpose. 
   Taxpayers are taxed on their earnings during their lives at least once. Our Nation has been built on the notion that anyone who works hard has the opportunity to succeed and create wealth. The estate and gift taxes are a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the majority leader's motion to proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000, which overwhelmingly passed in the House by a vote of 279-136. As I pointed out before, that vote of 279 included 65 Democrats. So it was, indeed, a bipartisan vote in support of this legislation. 
   Before going into the details of the legislation, I'd like to talk about the rationale for this bill and the debate around it. 
   Some ask why are we concerned about the death tax. Only 2 percent of estates pay the tax. Many of those taxpayers have the resources to minimize the tax. Even if they have to pay the tax at rates approaching 60 percent, the balance of the estate is available for the beneficiaries. The other 98 percent of estates need not worry about it. Those in this position also argue that the revenue raised by the estate tax is better spent on Federal programs than kept by the children. 
   I guess it all depends on your perspective. The opponents of death tax repeal look at an estate as a thing, such as money or property, detached from the person that created it. From their view, it is a valuable resource for an ever-expanding Federal Government. 
   There is another view. If you look behind the statistics and revenue figures, you will see an estate as something that represents a lifetime of actions by the individuals and families. Every day a person makes decisions to sacrifice, work harder, and save. And every day these hardworking families are taxed on what they earn. Over a lifetime, this daily dedication adds up. It is natural that the families who created the wealth, by a lifetime of working hard and paying taxes, would want the benefit of their work to go to their families. That is, to stay within the family rather than be broken up and sent to Washington. 
   I take this latter view. Coming from a small state, like Delaware, I meet a lot of small business people and farmers. Everybody knows how hard these folks work, and if they are successful, they are in the position to pass along a family business or farm to their families. The death tax is a serious obstacle to these family farmers and small business people. Not only is a major portion of their hard work taken by the Federal Government, and spent here in Washington, DC, but the need for cash to pay the tax often ends up causing a sale of the farm or small business. 
   It is this fundamental unfairness, with particular grief inflicted on family farms and small business at the worst possible time, that, I believe, has resulted in bipartisan support for repealing the death tax. Nine Senate Democrats and 65 House Democrats, better than 20% of the Democratic caucuses of each body, support repeal of the death tax. 
   You're going to hear that family farmers and small businesses are already protected from the current death tax. Thanks to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we, on this side of the aisle, won a hard fought concession for estate and gift tax relief. Under that legislation, a family farm or small business couple can shield up to $2.6 million, on a phased in basis, from the death tax. Since that legislation became law, however, I have heard that the provision is technically and practically difficult for family farmers and small businesses to use. It seems that the better and simpler approach is to rid our family farmers and small businesses of the burden of this tax. 
   I'd like to turn to the bill before us. 
   The bill is substantially similar to the estate tax provisions in the tax bill that was vetoed by the President last year. Some may ask why this House bill did not come through the Finance Committee. The reason is that the bill holds to the estate tax provisions the House and Senate agreed to last year. Since the Finance Committee has already debated and approved these provisions and we have negotiated these provisions with the House, I saw no need to process the bill in the committee. 
   There are really two time periods to which the bill applies. In the first period, generally from 2001 to 2009, estate tax relief is provided on several fronts. In the second period, beginning in 2010, the whole estate and gift tax regime is repealed. 
   During the first part, from 2001 to 2010, the estate and gift tax rates are reduced on both the high end and low end. On the low end, currently, there is a unified credit that applies to the first $675,000 of an estate. That amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million in 2006. 
   While current law provides some relief for the smallest estates, for modest estates, those above the credit amount, a high tax rate applies. For example, now a decedent's estate of $750,000 faces a tax rate of 37 percent on each dollar over the credit amount. Keep in mind that's where the rate starts. For larger estates, the rates can be as high as 60 percent. 
   For the lower-end estates, the bill converts the unified credit to an exemption. What this means is that estates right above the unified credit amount, will face tax rates starting at 18 percent rather than 37 percent. In other words for modest size estates, this bill cuts the tax rate in half. 
   For the larger estates, some now facing marginal rates as high as 60 percent, the bill includes a phased in rate cut. The rates are reduced from the current regime, with its highest rate of 60 percent, down to a top rate of 40.5 percent for the highest end estates. Keep in mind that the base of the tax is property, not income, and the rate is still above the highest income tax rate of 39.6 percent. 
   Prior to full repeal in 2010, the bill would also expand the estate tax rules for conservation easements to encourage conservation. In addition, the bill provides some simplification measures for the generation skipping transfer tax. 
   In 2010, the whole estate and gift tax regime is repealed. At the same time, a carryover basis regime is put in place instead of the current law step up in basis. This means that all taxable estates--again, I want to emphasize the words ``taxable estates''--that now enjoy a step up in basis will be subject to carryover basis. Carryover basis simply means that the beneficiary of the estate's property receives the same basis as the decedent. For example, if a decedent purchased a farm for $100,000 and the farm was worth $2,000,000 at death, the tax basis in the hands of the heirs would be $100,000. The step in basis is retained for all estates in an amount of up to $1.3 million per estate. In addition, transfers to a surviving spouse would receive an additional step up in the amount of $3 million. 
   The House passed the bill on a bipartisan basis with 65 Democrats voting in favor of repeal of the estate and gift taxes. Now is the Senate's opportunity to pass this bill on a bipartisan basis and send it to the President. It is my understanding this will be the only chance this year that we will have to pass this bill and repeal estate and gift taxes. If we fail, the bill dies. If we  come together and vote in favor of the House bill--estate tax repeal that the Congress passed last year--it will go directly to the President for his signature. 
   Our family owned businesses and farms must not be denied this relief. This should not be a partisan issue. 
   Unfortunately, the White House has indicated its opposition to repeal of estate and gift taxes and has promised to veto this bill. With roughly $2 trillion of estimated non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years, I believe the approximately $105 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes to be well within reason--it is only about 5 percent of the projected budget surplus. 
   Other than being a money grab--estate and gift taxes do not serve any legitimate purpose. They certainly don't keep people from dying. 
   Taxpayers are taxed on their earnings during their lives at least once. Our nation has been built on the notion that anyone who works hard has the opportunity to succeed and create wealth. The estate and gift taxes are a disincentive to succeed and should be eliminated. It is the right thing to do, and it is the right thing to do now. 
   It has been said that there are only two certainties: death and taxes. The two are bad enough, but leave it to the Federal Government to find a way to make them worse by adding them together. This is probably the worst example of adding insult to injury ever devised. Yet Washington perpetuates over and over again on hard working families who have already paid taxes every day they have worked. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed to this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I believe in full disclosure of who is funding political campaigns. The public has a right to know who is paying for the political advertisements and direct mail that they see. While I think this bill may not go far enough in requiring disclosure of these groups, it is a first step and that is why I support H.R. 4762. 
   H.R. 4762 requires disclosure for political organizations which are tax exempt under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. 527 organizations which directly advocate the election or defeat  of a particular candidate for federal office are subject to federal election campaign law disclosure obligations. However, 527 organizations that do not directly advocate for the election or defeat of a particular candidate are not subject to these federal election campaign laws and are not obligated to disclose the names of their contributors nor how they send the contributions they receive. This bill correctly adds disclosure requirements to these 527 organizations so that the activities performed and identity of contributors to these previously undisclosed will be available for public scrutiny, much like those 527 organizations that have to disclose under the federal election laws. 
   I am also glad that this bill follows the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the House of Representatives. If the revenue measure did not originate in the House, then any member could subject the bill to a ``blue slip,'' thereby voiding the entire bill, not just the part of the bill that is a revenue measure. I opposed an amendment similar to this bill a few weeks ago when it was offered as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill because adoption of that amendment would have subjected the Defense Authorization bill to such a ``blue slip'' challenge. Since we are taking up a House-originated revenue measure, I do not have the concerns which forced me to vote against the previous amendment. 
   However, I do have some concerns with this bill. First, this bill is a tax measure and tax measures should first be addressed by this committee of jurisdiction, the Finance Committee. This we have not done. In fact, the Fiance Committee was scheduled to have a hearing on July 12, 2000 to review this and other similar legislation dealing with disclosure of political activity by tax-exempt and other organizations. This hearing will not happen now and we will not be able to have the Finance Committee review how effective this legislation will be. 
   My second concern is that this bill may not do enough. By only focusing on disclosure in one type of tax-exempt organization and not on others, we leave open the use of the other type of tax-exempt organizations by those who want to hide their contributions and activity behind the cloak of anonymity that these tax-exempt organizations provide. This view is shared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
   Finally, I am concerned that this legislation requires the Internal Revenue Service to do things that it is not prepared to do with regard to disclosure. For example, under the bill reported out of the Ways and Means Committee, the IRS could partner with another agency--most likely the Federal Election Commission--to provide that the results of the 527 disclosure to the public. Unfortunately, this and other technical matters that were addressed in the Ways and Means Committee bill were not incorporated in this bill. I fear that we will have to address these technical issues in the future in order to make the disclosure provisions work to effectively provide this information to the public. 
   Because this bill is a first step and that some disclosure is better than no disclosure, I will vote for H.R. 4762.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I had originally planned to come to the floor to voice my opposition to this bill and to offer a point of order that it violates rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. I intended to do so because of two serious failings in it. 
   First, this bill cuts the program that Congress passed in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act to help States provide health insurance to low-income children and could cost up to 2 million of them their health insurance. The State Children's Health Insurance Program, known by its acronym as S-CHIP, was designed to make health insurance coverage available, at State option, to lower-income, uninsured children.  
   More than 2 million children have been enrolled in S-CHIP--children who would otherwise lack access to the health insurance coverage that helps them grow and thrive. 
   When we designed S-CHIP in 1997, States were given specific allotments to cover eligible uninsured children. We designed the program so that those allotments were to be available to individual States for a period of 3 years. This was done to ensure that allotments didn't sit unused. At the end of 3 years, unspent allotments are to be reallocated to other States that have spent their full allotments. The basic idea is to effectively direct available S-CHIP dollars to States willing and able to use them to cover uninsured kids. 
   We are now coming up upon the first opportunity to reallocate unspent S-CHIP funds. Three years have elapsed since the program was first implemented. 
   But, instead of thinking through the ramifications of reallocation, today we confront an unexpected and far more fundamental challenge to the future of the S-CHIP program. The appropriations bill before us would cut $1.9 billion in S-CHIP funds from the program, with an unenforceable promise to restore the funds in 2003--a promise which is itself subject to a Budget Act point of order. 
   This cut represents a dramatic retreat from the commitment the Federal Government extended to uninsured children, their families, and to the States in 1997. 
   S-CHIP was designed to be a stable, guaranteed source of funding to States to cover lower-income, uninsured children. If States cannot count on the federal government to stand by its commitment, there will inevitably be an erosion of State support for participation in the program and aggressive enrollment strategies. As a result, fewer children will receive health insurance coverage. 
   We have to be very clear that what we are talking about today isn't a technical accounting gimmick that simply moves funds forward. We are talking about a concrete cut in a very real program upon which millions of children depend. The consequences will be no less real. If the provision in the appropriations bill is not removed, the National Governors' Association estimates that as many as 2 million children will be denied access to health insurance coverage. 
   For that reason, the National Governors' Association strongly and unambiguously opposes the S-CHIP cut included in this appropriations bill. 
   NGA is not alone in its opposition to the appropriations cut. The community of advocates who work on behalf of children strongly opposes it as well. In fact, all Senators should have received a letter signed by over 80 groups opposing the cut, including the Children's Defense Fund, Families USA, the American Hospital Association, and the American Medical Association. In addition, the Health Insurance Association of America has also written to express its opposition to S-CHIP cuts. 
   Second, this bill cuts three welfare programs by $1.4 billion. The title XX social services block grant is cut by a whopping 65 percent--from $1.7 billion in funding to $600 million. This is just a quarter of the level we promised to Governors during welfare reform in 1996. 
   The title XX block grant was enacted in 1981, during the Reagan administration, to provide States with a flexible source of social services funding. Today, title XX funds services to almost 6 million Americans, principally children, people with disabilities, and seniors. In Delaware, we use these funds for a broad range of programs--including helping abused and neglected children and for people who are blind, and for Meals-on-Wheels. These funds go to programs without adequate sources of support and to fill the gaps for the neediest citizens. 
   These title XX funds are essential. These funds cannot be easily replaced--by States or local governments, or by private charity. 
   The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill would cut these supplemental welfare grants to States by $240 million. In the 1996 welfare reform legislation States took a big, big risk. States exchanged an open-ended Federal entitlement--that is, guaranteed dollars for each person who qualified for welfare--for a fixed block grant. 
   To provide States with some modest protection, welfare reform contained a provision to provide States with a big population increase and high poverty rates with supplemental welfare grants. The Labor-HHS bill would cut these grants and break that promise. 
   These welfare program cuts violate the fundamental deal Congress made with the Governors during welfare reform. With these cuts, Congress reneges on its word. 
   Next year Congress will begin reauthorization of welfare reform. If Congress shows that it is not a dependable partner now, how can we expect States to have confidence in us next year? 
   Altogether this bill cuts a children's health program and welfare programs by $3.3 billion. This is unquestionably a violation of sound policy. 
   In the interest of sound policy, in the interest of uninsured children, in the interest of welfare recipients, and in the interest of the States who are working with us to serve these vulnerable individuals, I had no choice but to oppose this bill. 
   I am not alone in recognizing these problems, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator HATCH, Senator KENNEDY, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator GRAHAM all joined me in a letter to our colleagues warning them against supporting this bill because of its inclusion of the provisions I oppose and have just outlined. I know that other Senators opposed them as well and I thank all of them for their support. 
   However, Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has assured me that these cuts--specifically: (1) The $1.9 billion cut to the State Children's Health Insurance Program located in section 217 on pages 53 and 54 of the bill; (2) the $1.1 billion cut to the title XX social services block grant located in title 2, page 40 of the bill; (3) the $240 million cut to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, program, located in section 216, pages 52 to 53 of the bill; and (4) the $50 million cut to the Welfare-to-Work performance bonus program, located in section 104, pages 21 to 23 of the bill--will be eliminated in their entirety in this bill when it returns from conference.

   Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the so-called Robb amendment, not because I necessarily oppose its terms but because it affects, in an adverse manner, the possibility of getting legislation on prescription drugs enacted this year. 
   Prescription drugs is a matter before the Finance Committee. It is undoubtedly the most important domestic legislation that will be considered this year. Nothing will happen if we permit this legislation to become partisan. We do not need a Democratic bill. We do not need a Republican bill. We need legislation that represents a bipartisan consensus on both sides of the aisle. 
   We have worked very hard in the committee to develop the kind of information that is essential to design a bill that will meet the needs of the American people. We have spent something like 15 days on hearings, bringing before us experts as to what we should do to, frankly, modernize our Medicare legislation. 
   The last 2 weeks have been spent in meeting with Republicans and Democrats alike on the various proposals that have been made both by Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate. 
   We just completed that process this afternoon. I am very happy to say that I think the end results of these meetings give us a good chance to develop a bill that can be supported by both Republicans and Democrats. 
   I know there are people who want to make this a partisan issue. I know there are people who want to have a Republican issue on this matter, and the same is true on the Democratic side. But I say that this matter is too important--too important to our senior citizens--to try to rush it through in a political way rather than working together. 
   During our hearings, we had representatives of the AARP and other advocate groups. The one message they gave that came through loud and clear was: Do not rush something through.  Make sure that whatever you do will meet the needs of the American people. They urged, time and again, that it is essential that we act with care. 
   Let me point out, to those who want to have a vote all of a sudden on a piece of legislation that has not been studied, that in 1987, the Congress voted for--and it was signed into law--catastrophic legislation. That was passed in 1987. In 1988, it was revoked because the legislation did not do what the people thought it would do. We must not make that mistake again. 
   It is critically important that as we move ahead, we move ahead with care and understanding. Let me say, I understand full well the importance of this legislation and want to get it done. But it does not help the process or the development of a good piece of legislation if it is handled in a partisan way. 
   This bill was only introduced 2 days ago on June 20. The text of the bill has not even been printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Are we going to act on that today without an understanding of what it includes and what it means? 
   It is estimated this legislation would cost, over 10 years, something like $200 to $300 billion.

   Mr. ROTH. In 5 years, it is estimated it would cost something like $75 billion. Under the budget resolution, we are allowed to spend $20 billion in 5 years, if we have no reform. If we have reform, our program can consume up to $40 billion. This piece of legislation would cost something like $75 billion. The last thing we need to do is move ahead on legislation that would put our Medicare program at greater risk. Its solvency is already estimated to last only until 2025. In adopting what will be admittedly an expensive new program, we want to make sure that it is fiscally sound. 
   I urge and hope my friends on both sides of the aisle will reject this legislation and give the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction, the opportunity to develop a bill that will serve the needs of our senior generation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to follow-up on what my colleague from Delaware has just mentioned. 
   First and foremost, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for accepting my amendment No. 3352, which was co-sponsored by Senator BIDEN. This amendment restores full funding ($92.5 million) for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funds for C-5 modernization programs, including the C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program. This amendment, in addition to the Committee recommendation of $95.4 million requested by the Pentagon in procurement funds for C-5 modernization programs, will allow the current C-5 Galaxy modernization programs to continue for the upcoming Fiscal Year. 
   I would like to point out the only question that we are discussing now is which C-5 Galaxies will be modernized. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for clarifying the committee's position on the C-5 High Pressure Turbine modernization. I also thank the Chairman for agreeing to consider allowing the expenditure of procurement funds for the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) on the C-5A models. 
   Just yesterday, I was at Dover Air Force Base, home to 26 C-5Bs and 10 C-5As. Each year, the community leaders, the base leadership, and the Delaware congressional delegation meet to discuss issues important to the Air Base. During a presentation by Colonel S. Taco Gilbert III, the commander of the 436th Airlift Wing at Dover, he mentioned the importance of this program for safely and efficiently operating the Galaxy. 
   The AMP will allow the C-5 to operate safely, effectively and more reliably. Features like the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and the Terrain Awareness and Warning System are important safety measures for the crews flying our C-5s. Bringing the C-5 into compliance with the Global Air Traffic Management standards will allow the C-5 to use advantageous flight paths and reduce fuel consumption and other costs. Finally, the new equipment will increase the reliability rates for the C-5 Galaxy and allow off-the-shelf replacements for hard to replace parts.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, and Senator KENNEDY, and Senator THURMOND to sponsor an amendment whose intent is to  redress a grave injustice that haunts us from the tribulations of World War II. 
   On May 25 of last year, this body held an historically important vote requesting the long-overdue, posthumous advancement of two fine World War II officers, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. The Senate voted in support of including the Kimmel-Short resolution as part of the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000, but the provision was not included in the final legislation. This year, the House of Representatives had included the exact language of the Senate amendment adopted last year, and so we are again seeking the Senate to support inclusion of this important resolution. 
   Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were the two senior commanders of U.S. forces deployed in the Pacific at the time of the disastrous surprise December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, they were unfairly and publicly charged with dereliction of duty and blamed as singularly responsible for the success of that attack. 
   Less than 6 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack, in a hastily prepared report to the President, the Roberts Commission--perhaps the most flawed and unfortunately most influential investigation of the disaster--levelled the dereliction of duty charge against Kimmel and Short--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized. 
   Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of this Commission, later disavowed its report, stating that these two officers were ``martyred'' and ``if they had been brought to trial, they would have been cleared of the charge.'' 
   Later, Admiral J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor as Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet wrote: 
   ``In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government Printing Office.'' 
   After the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a painfully enduring veneer when Admiral Kimmel and General Short were not advanced on the retired lists to their highest ranks of war-time command--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in war-time positions above his regular grade. 
   Admiral Kimmel, a two star admiral, served in four star command. General Short, a two star general, served in a three star command. Let me repeat, advancement on the on retired lists was granted to every other flag rank officer who served in World War II in a post above their grade. 
   That decision against Kimmel and Short was made despite the fact that war-time investigations had exonerated these commanders of the dereliction of duty charge and criticized 
   their higher commands for significant failings that contributed to the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than six studies and investigations conducted after the war, including one Department of Defense report completed in 1995 at Senator THURMOND's request, reconfirmed these findings. 
   Our amendment is a rewrite of Senate Joint Resolution 19, the Kimmel-Short Resolution, that I, Senator BIDEN, Senator THURMOND, Senator HELMS, Senator STEVENS, Senator COCHRAN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DOMENICI, Senator SPECTER, Senator ENZI, Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator CRAIG, Senator DURBIN, Senator JOHN KERRY, Senator KYL, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator BOB SMITH, Senator COLLINS, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator VOINOVICH, Senator DEWINE, and Senator FEINSTEIN--a total of 23 co-sponsors--introduced last April. It is the same amendment this body adopted by a rollcall vote last May. It is the same amendment accepted by the House Armed Services Committee as part of their version of the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
   The amendment calls upon the President of the United States to advance posthumously on the retirement lists Admiral Kimmel and General Short to the grades of their highest war-time commands. Its passage would communicate the Senate's recognition of the injustice done to them and call upon the President to take corrective action. 
   Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of blame that so unfairly burdens the reputations of these two officers. It is a correction consistent with our military's tradition of honor. 
   Mr. President, the investigations providing clear evidence that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame include a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, the 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional Committee, and a 1991 Army Board for the Correction of Military Records. 
   The findings of these official reports can be summarized as four principal points. 
   First, there is ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not provided vital intelligence that they needed, and that was available in Washington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and consistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   In my review of this fundamental point, I was most struck by the honor and integrity demonstrated by General George Marshall who was Army Chief of Staff at the time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   On November 27 of that year, General Short interpreted a vaguely written war warning message sent from the high command in Washington as suggesting the need to defend against sabotage. Consequently, he concentrated his aircraft away from perimeter roads to protect them, thus inadvertently increasing their vulnerability to air attack. When he reported his preparations to the General Staff in Washington, the General Staff took no steps to clarify the reality of the situation. 
   In 1946 before a Joint Congressional Committee on the Pearl Harbor disaster General Marshall testified that he was responsible for ensuring the proper disposition of General Short's forces. He acknowledged that he must have received General Short's report, which would have been his opportunity to issue a corrective message, and that he failed to do so. 
   Mr. President, General Marshall's integrity and sense of responsibility is a model for all of us. I only wish it had been able to have greater influence over the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the Department of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the flow of intelligence. The 1995 Department of Defense report stated that the handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by, among other faults, ineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up. 
   The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned reports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed only upon the Hawaiian commanders. They all underscored significant failures and shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington that contributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   The 1995 Department of Defense report put it best, stating that ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared.'' 
   This is an important quote. It shows that the Department of Defense recognizes that these two commanders should not be singled out for blame. Yet, still today on this issue, our government's words do not match its actions. Kimmel and Short remain the only two officials who have been forced to pay a price for the disaster at Pearl harbor. 
   Let me add one poignant fact about the two wartime investigations. Their conclusions--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been properly disposed according to the information available to them and that their superiors had failed to share important intelligence--were kept secret on the grounds that making them public would have been detrimental to the war effort. 
   Be that as it may, there is no longer any reason to perpetuate the cruel  myth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor. Admiral Spruance, one of our great naval commanders of World War II, shares this view. He put it this way: 
   ``I have always felt that Kimmel and Short were held responsible for Pearl Harbor in order that the American people might have no reason to lose confidence in their government in Washington. This was probably justifiable under the circumstances at that time, but it does not justify forever damning those two fine officers.'' 
   Mr. President, this is a matter of justice and fairness that goes to the core of our military tradition and our nation's sense of military honor. That, above, all should relieve us of any inhibition to doing what is right and just. 
   Mr. President, this sense of the Senate has been endorsed by countless military officers, including those who have served at the highest levels of command. These include former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and Admiral William J. Crowe, and former Chiefs of Naval Operations Admiral J.L. Holloway III, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt and Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost. 
   Moreover a number of public organizations have called for posthumous advancement of Kimmel and Short. The VFW passed a resolution calling for the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   Let me add that Senator Robert Dole, one of our most distinguished colleagues and a veteran who served heroically in World War II, has also endorsed this sense of the Senate resolution. 
   Yesterday, June 6, is a day that shall forever be remembered as a date of great sacrifice and great accomplishment for the men who took part of Operation Overload. D-Day marked the turning of the tide in the allied war effort in Europe, and led to our victory in the Second World War. 
   December 7, 1941, is also a date that will forever be remembered. That day will continue to be ``a date which will live in infamy.'' It will serve as a constant reminder that the United States must remain vigilant to outside threats and to always be prepared. 
   However, this amendment is about justice, equity, and honor. Its purpose is to redress an historic wrong, to ensure that Admiral Kimmel and General Short are treated with the dignity and honor they deserve, and to ensure that justice and fairness fully permeate the memory and the important lessons learned from the catastrophe at Pearl Harbor. 
   As we commemorate another anniversary of the success of D-Day, it is a most appropriate time to redress this injustice. After 50 years, this correction is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment offered by my colleague from Delaware, Senator JOE BIDEN, and myself. This amendment deals with the vital importance of the C-5 Galaxy to our nation's strategic airlift capability. No other aircraft has the capabilities of this proven workhorse, and as we look to prepare our military for the future we must not overlook the need to ensure the Galaxy has the parts necessary to perform safely and effectively. 
   I would like to commend the chairman and the ranking member for accepting this very important amendment, which requires the Secretary of the Air Force to report on ``the overall status of the spare and repair parts program of the Air Force for the C-5 aircraft.'' 
   The C-5 is the largest cargo transport plane in our Air Force. It is proven, and we depend on it to perform a vital role in our nation's Strategic Airlift. Currently, spare parts shortages have resulted in the grounding of nearly one quarter of the C-5 fleet. Needless to say, this is a serious problem. 
   The report required by this amendment will detail the funds currently allocated to parts for the C-5, the adequacy of those funds to meet future requirements for the C-5, the descriptions of current efforts to address short-term and long-term shortfalls in parts, an assessment of the effects of the shortfalls on C-5 readiness and reliability ratings, a description on cannibalization rates for the C-5 aircraft and man hours devoted to cannibalizations, and the effects of these shortfalls on readiness and retention. 
   I believe this report will shed light on a problem of which my colleague from Delaware and I are painfully aware. Dover Air Force Base, in my state of Delaware, is home to 36 C-5 Galaxies. At Dover, the spare parts shortage has truly hit home. 
   ``Cann Birds'', or C-5 Galaxies that have been cannibalized for their parts, is an unfortunate sight on the base. Men and women at Dover must spend long hours cannibalizing aircraft to find parts necessary for other C-5s. These long hours have led to increased frustration and lowered morale among some of the hardest working and most valuable people in our Air Force and civilian personnel. We are losing expertise in this area due to this decreased morale. 
   The lack of spare parts is not the only issue. Often, when the need for a part is recognized, there is a long lag-time between requests for parts and delivery. I hope that this amendment, by shining light on these problems and requiring the Air Force to examine the issues, will result in greater understanding of how to reach a solution.

   Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee for this grant of time. 
   I rise today to make two announcements about the proposed amendment. 
   The first announcement is that the Department of Defense authorization bill is not the proper vehicle for the issue raised by raised by this amendment. 
   The second announcement is that there will be a proper vehicle for the issue. 
   Let's explore my first point, that is, whether this defense bill is an appropriate vehicle for this amendment. 
   This amendment increases the amount of disclosure that certain tax exempt organizations that are organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code have to make if they are not subject to the disclosure requirements under the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
   To do this, the amendment will subject these tax exempt organizations to tax on the contributions they receive if they do not follow disclosure requirements similar to the disclosure requirements set out in the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
   While the objective of the amendment is increased campaign finance disclosure, the amendment is framed in the context of a Tax Code change, which is a revenue measure. 
   Under the Constitution, all revenue measures must originate in the House of Representatives. If the revenue measure did not originate in the House, then any member could subject the bill to a ``blue slip,'' thereby voiding the entire bill, not just the part of the bill that is a revenue measure. 
   Make no mistake, regardless of its merits, this amendment will kill this bill. If adopted, this amendment would mean that the Senate would be originating a piece of tax legislation. This is in direct violation of the Constitution. Rest assured, the House will not accept it and will refuse the bill when we seek to send it to them. Hence, the adoption of this amendment will kill this Defense bill just as assuredly as if we voted it down. 
   We must not lose sight of the fact that there is no higher priority than our nation's defense. This bill provides much-needed funds for it. It gives a deserved pay raise to our armed forces--allowing them to enlist and retain the all-volunteer force that stands on perpetual watch over our nation. It provides for spare parts that will keep our Armed Services in service. 
   Now, I'd like to move to my second point, provision of the proper vehicle. 
   The House has passed a tax bill that deals with taxpayer rights and disclosure of information for tax-exempt organizations. That bill, known as the ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2000,'' is in the Finance Committee. 
   The taxpayer rights legislation will be the vehicle for proposals to curtail corporate tax shelters, which both the majority and the minority staffs of the Finance Committee have been working to draft. The taxpayer rights legislation will be the appropriate vehicles for this amendment. I support increased disclosure. Section 527 needs to be amended. It is my intention to move such legislation later this year.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on May 11, eight new members were inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame. I congratulate all the honorees. They truly deserve to be recognized for their unique, individual contributions to athletics and to the state of Delaware. 
   The inductees are: Dale Farmer, former executive director of the Delaware Secondary Schools Athletic Association; Robert ``Clyde'' Farmer, a stand-out pitcher in the local fast-pitch softball leagues of the 1940s and 50s; C. Walter Kadel, who coached and taught physical education to Wilmington's children for more than three decades; Ron Luddington, a bronze medal winner in the 1960 Olympics, who now coaches future skating champions at the University of Delaware ice rink; Betty Richardson, who coached championship field hockey teams at Tower Hill High School, and won championships of her own on the golf course; G. Henry White, a star rusher on the gridiron at Cape Henlopen High School and at Colgate University; Matt Zabitka, who has covered sports in the Delaware Valley for nearly half a century; and Howard ``Tootsie'' Ferrell, a Delawarean who played with some of the greatest baseball talent of all-time in the Negro League. 
   An editorial in The News Journal newspaper called this group ``a very diverse group of honorees--one of the most varied in its history. The Sports Hall of Fame now represents all sorts of sports greats--white people, minorities, women.*.*.*.'' 
   And it is in that spirit that I want to talk about one of those inductees right now. 
   Howard ``Tootsie'' Ferrell was a pitcher in the Negro League who once barnstormed with Jackie Robinson who went on the break the color barrier, and integrate major league baseball. Ferrell got his start with the Newark Eagles in 1947. For the next two seasons, he played with the Baltimore Elite Giants. Following in the footsteps of the great Jackie Robinson,  Ferrel's contract was purchased by the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he spent 3 seasons in the Dodgers' farm system. A nagging injury cut Ferrell's baseball career short. But the real reason ``Tootsie'' Ferrell never got his chance to play in the majors was because of the prejudice that kept America's pastime segregated for so many years. 
   It may be hard for younger Americans to imagine a world where the best African-American players were not allowed to play on the same field with the best white players. The first appearance of an official color barrier in baseball came in 1868, when the National Association of Baseball Players voted to bar any club that had non-white members. Professional baseball eventually followed suit. Sadly, by the turn of 
   the century there were no black players in organized, professional baseball. 
   But exclusion from the ``white'' leagues did not stop African-Americans from playing the game of baseball. Instead, they formed teams and leagues of their own. In 1920, an African-American businessman named Rube Foster organized a collection of independent all-black ball clubs into the Negro National League. In 1923, the competing Eastern Colored League was formed. These two leagues operated successfully for years--delighting crowds, showcasing the talent of African-American athletes, and inspiring future generations of baseball players. A new Negro National League was organized in 1933, and the Negro American League was chartered four years later. These leagues thrived until the color barrier was finally shattered by Jackie Robinson. And although all-black teams continued to play for several years, integrated major league baseball eventually put the Negro Leagues out of business. 
   The history of the white major leagues has been well documented. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the Negro Leagues. While it is easy to look up how many home runs Babe Ruth hit or how many batters the great Walter Johnston struck out, the same cannot be done for Negro League greats like Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. As time goes by, there are fewer and fewer men left who played ``the other'' game of baseball before the color barrier was broken. That is why it is so important we honor men like ``Tootsie'' Ferrell. He began his baseball career in a league that was separate but unequal. He saw this ugly and unfair color barrier disappear, just as it eventually would in other aspects of American society. 
   I congratulate Howard ``Tootsie'' Ferrell for his achievement, and I commend the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame for his induction.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am going to vote for the Levin amendment to the military construction appropriations bill, which would strike the Byrd-Warner amendment concerning Kosovo. 
   As a strong supporter of NATO, I have long advocated efforts to strengthen the European pillar of the alliance. The air war in Kosovo highlighted a great technical disparity in U.S. and European capabilities, and reopened long-standing debates of burden sharing within the Alliance. 
   I fully understand and support the motivation behind the authors and supporters of this provision. While it is true the Europeans are contributing over 80 percent of the peacekeeping forces that make up K-For, they have yet to fully live up to their commitments to NATO Peacekeeping, UNMIK, and the funds that make up the civilian and military dimensions of the peace effort. 
   However, this provision undercuts our incentives to the Europeans to meet those goals because it contains a ``de facto'' withdrawal date of July 1, 2001. It signals to our allies that the United States will withdraw regardless of any improved European efforts to meet their commitments. 
   This bill will effectively constitute a decision to withdraw forces at a given date. That is not the authors' stated intent, but that is how this amendment will be viewed. That is a message that will embolden Milosevic. That is a message that we will communicate an absence of commitment to our NATO allies. 
   American General Wes Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe and the former highest ranking military officer in NATO, has warned,  
   These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut US leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our allies in NATO, undercut US leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans.  
   While I, and many others, have had concerns about how the Kosovo operation has been conducted by the current administration, the solution to these concerns are not a withdrawal, or another debate on whether or not to withdraw. The solution is to establish a definition of goals we hoe to achieve with regard to Kosovo, how we intend to accomplish our goals, and work more effectively with our European allies in achieving those goals. When our next President takes office in January,  under the Byrd-Warner provision he would be burdened not only with addressing the current administration's shortcomings in establishing a Kosovo policy, but also with a congressionally-imposed fixed date for United States withdrawal from Kosovo. 
   So for these reasons, while I support the goals of this provision, I cannot support the means used to achieve that goal and I will vote for the Levin amendment.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the conference agreement on H.R. 434, the Trade and Development Act of 2000. Senate passage of the conference agreement would mark the first significant trade legislation to pass both Houses of Congress in close to a decade, other than the implementation of trade agreements under special fast track procedures. As such, the bill represents a powerful statement regarding America's leadership on trade. 
   The conference agreement--and the House's 309-110 vote--vindicates the approach that we took in the Finance Committee and here in the Senate this past November. Our goal was to create a ``win-win'' approach to the Africa and Caribbean trade preference programs that would ensure benefits to American firms and workers as well as to our trading partners in those two regions. The conference report does just that. 
   The conference report retains those provisions of the bill that the textile industry's own analysis suggested would produce an additional $8 billion in sales of American fiber and fabric and create an additional 120,000 jobs. Those provisions--commonly known as ``807A'' and ``809''--were adopted without revision by the conferees. Those provisions require that all textile components assembled into apparel articles benefiting from those provisions must be made from U.S. fabric, unless subject to certain de minimis exceptions specified in the conference agreement. 
   Where the conference agreement broadens the benefits available to our trading partners beyond those included in the Senate-passed legislation, the provisions create discrete categories of apparel that may benefit from the use of regionally-produced fabric, and in certain limited instances, fabric from third countries used by the least developed countries in Africa. That said, where the conference agreement does expand those benefits for Africa and the Caribbean, it also creates new opportunities for U.S. interests as well. For example, the conference agreement's rules of origin expressly provide for the use of American yarn, which relies on American cotton, for regionally-made knit fabric that can be used in apparel articles destined for the U.S. markets under the benefits provided by the conference agreement. 
   The conference agreement deserves the Senate's support. The conference agreement represents an attempt to reach out and provide not just a helping hand, but an opportunity--an opportunity for millions around the world to seize their own economic destiny. 
   Africa has for too long suffered from our neglect. The continent faces daunting political, economic and social challenges. Yet, African leaders are seizing the opportunity to press for political and economic change. The same holds true in the Caribbean and Central America. The changes in the region since the original CBI legislation passed in 1983 have been dramatic. Our goal must be to support those changes. 
   The goal of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 is to meet Africa's leaders and those in the Caribbean and Central America half way. It is not a panacea for problems they face; rather, it is a small downpayment--an investment--in a partnership that I hope we can foster through our actions here. 
   This is a measure that is supported by every African and Caribbean government. It represents a commitment by leaders in both regions to a stronger economic relationship with the United States, and that street runs both ways. Our exports to the Sub-Saharan region of Africa, for example, already exceed by 20 percent our exports to all the states of the former Soviet Union combined. We furthermore run a 
   regular surplus in our trade with the Caribbean and Central America. In other words, in helping Africa and the Caribbean, we are also helping ourselves. 
   The conference agreement will also serve as an agent of positive change.. The eligibility criteria in both the Africa and CBI provisions are expressly designed to foster economic opportunity and political freedom. That includes the criterion added here in the Senate by a vote of 96-0 obliging beneficiaries of these two programs, as well as the Generalized System of Preferences, to implement their international obligations with respect to the elimination of the worst forms of child labor, such as slavery, indentured servitude, and prostitution. 
   For those who would argue that the bill creates incentives to transship third country fabric through either Africa or the Caribbean, the conference agreement has a response that was worked out in close consultation with the Customs Service and all other interested parties. To protect against customs fraud designed to gain access  to the program illegally (commonly referred to as ``transshipment''), the conference agreement contains unprecedented protections. They include requirements that the beneficiary countries, with U.S. technical assistance, develop their own effective enforcement infrastructure to combat transshipment and cooperate fully with the U.S. Customs Service in its investigation of alleged customs fraud. In addition, with respect to any individual exporter found fraudulently to have claimed the trade benefits extended under the conference agreement, the conference agreement would expel the exporter from eligibility for the program's benefits. The conference agreement would also authorize the appropriation of funds necessary to improve the U.S. Customs Service's investigation of transshipment generally, in order to contribute to the success of the program's benefits. 
   For those who have expressed their concern that the new programs will lead to a flood of new imports at a time when the U.S. industry is already under economic pressure to adjust due to agreements reached in the Uruguay Round, the conference agreement has a response as well. First, the rules of origin under the conference agreement largely reflect the approach we adopted in the Senate, one that favors the use of American fabric. That means that any increase in imports will necessarily imply an increase in sales of American textiles. Second, the conference agreement also provides a mechanism by which domestic producers of apparel articles competing with those imported under these program can obtain temporary relief from unexpected surges in particular categories that threaten serious injury to the competing domestic industry. 
   The conference agreement would add certain other provisions that I believe will strengthen the prospects for success. For example, with respect to Africa, the conference agreement encourages the negotiation of new trade-liberalizing agreements with interested Sub-Saharan Africa trading partners that would build on the foundation that the conference agreement establishes, and toward that end the conference agreement makes permanent the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs. 
   The conference agreement also includes a variety of other measures that address other aspects of the challenges facing Africa and other aspects of our economic relationship with the continent. Those include a sense of the Congress resolution regarding the need for comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries (most of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa); the targeting of U.S. technical assistance to foster the goals of the conference agreement with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa; encouraging the development of a special equity fund for fostering investment in Africa at the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation; directing the expansion of U.S. Commerce Department initiatives designed to foster the development of African markets for U.S. exports; the donation of air traffic control equipment no longer in use in the United States to eligible Sub-Saharan Africa countries; a sense of the Congress relating to efforts to combat desertification; and authorization of a study regarding potential improvements in Sub-Saharan agricultural practices. 
   With respect to the Caribbean and Central America, the conference agreement adds provisions designed to foster the success of the initiative as well. Those include encouragement to enter into negotiations with interested trading partners on trade agreements that would liberalize two-way trade further and directions to the President to organize regular meetings of the U.S. Trade Representative with trade ministers from the region to eliminate obstacles to a stronger economic relationship between the United States and our trading partners in the region. 
   The conference agreement contains a number of other trade-related provisions that are worth noting. Those includes the permanent establishment of a special representative on agricultural trade at USTR and a statement of agricultural trade negotiating objectives that we hope 
   will shape the agenda for the ongoing trade talks in the World Trade Organization on agriculture. 
   The conference agreement also provides a boost to our review of trade adjustment assistance programs to ensure that they are operating effectively. While the conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment expanding our farmers' access to TAA programs, it does highlight the need to review our current TAA programs with a view toward to ensuring that those programs do provide benefits to farmers as those programs were originally intended to do when established in 1962. That review is already under way within the Finance Committee. 
   The conference agreement would also extend permanent normal trade relations to Kyrgyzstan and Albania. Kyrgyzstan deserves special mention because it is the first of the former Soviet republics, apart from two Baltic countries, to join the World Trade Organization. It has also made considerable progress toward a market economy and political pluralism. Establishing stronger trade links with the Kyrgyz republic is designed to foster a stronger relationship on a broader front, both economically and politically. 
   I would also like to express my support for those provisions of the conference report designed to address the tariff inversion affecting the suit-making and fabric industries in this country. I have worked with a number of Senators for the past six months to forge this compromise that would address the concerns of both the domestic suit-makers, fabric-makers, and wool growers. I am particularly proud that the compromise was reached on the basis of tariff cuts that benefit all of the parties. The conference agreement resolves a difficult problem that has undermined the competitiveness of all sides of the U.S. industry and I am pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement that should foster both stronger suit-makers and stronger fabric-makers, as well as assist our sheep industry in developing new markets for its wool fiber. 
   I would also like to note my disappointment that we were unable to agree on a way to make further progress in addressing the scourge of AIDS affecting so many African countries. I worked for several months to reach a compromise with both sides of the debate regarding the supply of patented drugs to combat AIDS-related disease, but that effort went unrewarded. I would have hoped that the conference report would have gone further, particularly where we had worked on what I thought were constructive potential compromises, but I am certain that there will be other opportunities in this Congress to rejoin those discussions. 
   Any conference agreement is, by its nature a compromise. In this instance, I am convinced that the conference agreement is the stronger for it. While we did not accomplish all that I hoped, this conference agreement represents an incredible accomplishment. 
   For that, I particularly want to thank the majority leader for his commitment to this process. I want to convey my special thanks to my esteemed colleague, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN, for his leadership throughout this process, to Senator GRASSLEY, chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade, for his sustained contribution, and to the other Senate conferees. 
   I also want to applaud the efforts of our counterparts on the House side, from the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, Congressmen ARCHER and RANGEL, to the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, Congressmen CRANE and LEVIN, and to the Speaker of the House, Congressman HASTERT. They made this conference agreement a reality.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax overpayment by America's families. The Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 delivers savings to virtually every married couple in America. And it does so within the context of fiscal discipline and preserving the Social Security surplus. 
   The importance of this measure cannot be overstated. According to the most recent CBO estimates, in 1999, 43 percent of married couples--about 22 million couples--faced the marriage tax penalty. The average penalty was $1,480 per couple. This was levied on individuals who are already overburdened with expenses--the costs associated with buying homes, paying for education, raising children, and building financial security for retirement. 
   It isn't fair, Mr. President. It isn't fair that when two individuals marry their combined tax liability becomes greater than if they had remained single and continued to pay taxes at their single rate. But unfortunately, this has been the case--to one degree or another--for more than 30 years. 
   Now it's time for a change. 
   It's time to restore equity--to bring balance and fairness into the tax equation for these married couples. This, of course, is not as simple as it might appear. Our tax system has tried to balance three disparate goals--progressivity, equal treatment of married couples, and marriage neutrality. And it is impossible to achieve all three principles at the same time. 
   The principle of progressivity holds that taxpayers with higher incomes should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The principle of equal treatment of married couples holds that households with the same amount of income should pay the same level of tax. And the principle of marriage neutrality holds that a couple's income tax bill should not depend on their marital status. The tax code should neither provide an incentive nor a disincentive for two people to get married. 
   Our policy response differs depending on how we balance these different principles. For instance, if we want to ensure that when two singles get married their total tax bill will not rise--but we do not mind if two married couples with the same overall income level are treated differently, then we arrive at one result. However, if we want to make sure that two singles who marry do not face increased taxes--and we want to make sure that two married couples with the same income level are treated evenly--then we arrive at a different result. 
   Last year, the Senate position in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 embraced the first policy result. We focused on the difference between what two spouses would pay in taxes if they were single versus what they would pay in taxes if they were married. In order to fully address that problem, we developed a system whereby a married couple would have an option. The couple could continue to file a joint return using the existing schedule of married filing jointly. Or the couple could choose to file a joint return using the separate schedules for single taxpayers. It was straightforward, and it was universal--we did not try to impose arbitrary income limits to cut off the relief. 
   As I said last year, this approach had a lot of good things about it. Most importantly, I liked the way that it basically eliminated the marriage penalty for all taxpayers who suffered from it. It delivered relief to those in the lowest brackets as well as to those in the highest brackets. It also delivered relief to those who itemized their deductions as well as those who took the standard deduction. 
   Nevertheless, I did not propose, or support, the separate filing plan this year. As the Chairman of the Finance  Committee, I am responsible for developing tax policy in a rational manner. I am also responsible for working with members of my Committee and of the full Senate. 
   After listening to my colleagues' views on marriage tax relief, I came to the conclusion that the best approach at this time is to build on the foundation that Congress has already approved. Last year, in the conference report of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999, the Congress adopted three components of marriage penalty relief. These include an expansion of the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly; a widening of the tax brackets; and an increase in the income phase-outs for the earned income credit. A different part of the bill also addressed the minimum tax issue. This year, the House passed a marriage penalty tax bill that included the first three components. 
   And the Finance Committee bill, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000, has built on this foundation. Under current law, for the year 2000, the standard deduction for a single taxpayer is $4,400. The standard deduction for a married couple filing a joint return is $7,350. That means that for couples who use a standard deduction--and those are generally low and middle income couples--they are losing $1,450 in extra deductions each year. At a 28% tax rate, that lost deduction translates into an extra tax liability of $406 each and every year. 
   The Finance Committee bill increases the standard deduction for married couples so that it is twice the size of the standard deduction for singles. And we do that immediately, for the 2001 tax year. When fully effective, this provision provides tax relief to approximately 25 million couples filing joint returns, including more than 6 million returns filed by senior citizens. 
   Increasing the standard deduction also has the added benefit of simplifying the tax code. Approximately 3 million couples who currently itemize their deductions will realize the simplification benefits of using the standard deduction. 
   Second, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 addresses the cause of the greatest dollar amount of the marriage tax penalty--the structure of the rate brackets. Under current law, the 15% rate bracket for single filers ends at taxable income of $26,250. The 15% rate bracket for married couples filing jointly ends with taxable income of $43,850, which you can see is less than the sum of two times the single rate bracket. In practical terms, that means that when two individuals who each earn $30,000 get married and file a joint tax return, $8,650 of their income is taxed at the 28% rate rather than at the 15% rate that the income would have been subject to if they had remained single. The extra tax liability for that couple each year comes out to $1,125. 
   The Finance Committee bill remedies that fundamental unfairness. The bill adjusts the end point of the 15% rate bracket for married couples so that it is twice the sum of the end point of the bracket for single filers. Recognizing that the rate structure hurts married couples in the higher brackets, the bill also adjusts the end points of the 28% rate bracket as well. 
   When fully effective, and we make that happen a year earlier than the House, this provision will provide tax relief to approximately 21 million couples filing joint returns, including more than 4 million returns filed by senior citizens. 
   Third, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 addresses the biggest source of the marriage tax penalty for low income, working families--the earned income credit. This complicated credit is determined by using a schedule for the number of qualifying children, and then multiplying the credit rate by the taxpayer's earned income up to a certain amount. The credit is phased out above certain income levels. What that means is that two people who are each receiving the earned income credit as singles may lose all or some of their credit when they get married. 
   In order to address that problem, the Finance Committee bill increases the beginning and ending points of the income levels of the phase-out of the credit for married couples filing a joint return. For a couple with two or more qualifying children, this could mean as much as $526 in extra credit. This provision would also expand the number of married couples who would be eligible for the credit. It will help over one million families.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, finally, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 tries to make sure that families can continue to receive the family tax credits that Congress has enacted over the past several years. Each year, an increasing number of American families are finding that their family tax credits--such as the child credit and the Hope Scholarship education credit--are being cut back or eliminated because of the alternative minimum tax. Last year, Congress made a small down-payment on this problem, temporarily carving out these family tax credits from the minimum tax calculations. This year, we are building on that bipartisan approach, by permanently extending the preservation of the family tax credits. 
   Because of this provision, millions of taxpayers will no longer face the burden of calculating the alternative minimum tax. 
   In making the changes that I have just described--whether it is the change in the rate brackets or the change in the earned income credit--we have tried to meet an important objective. That goal, which I talked about  earlier, is to treat all married couples with the same amount of income equally. It is a principle that is ignored by using a combined return with separate schedules or by using a second earner deduction. With the Senate Finance Committee bill, we do not create a new, so-called ``homemaker penalty.'' Our bill ensures that simply because a family has only one wage earner, it is not treated any differently than a family where both spouses work. Many people have argued that tax policy should not discourage one parent from staying at home and raising the family. It is a laudable goal and one that I support. 
   How much does this marriage tax penalty relief help? It helps a lot. Over forty million families will get marriage tax relief under this legislation. In my state of Delaware, over 100,000 families will benefit. Every family earning over $10,000 per year will see their tax bill fall at least one percent--except those at high income levels. The key to this legislation is that it helps the middle class. Sixty percent of this bill's tax relief goes to those families making $100,000 or less. 
   Who are these people? They're two married civil engineers, or a pharmacist who is married to a school teacher. They're the policeman and his wife who runs a small gift shop in Dover. They are the firefighter who is married to a social worker, or a librarian who is married to an accountant. These are the families who will benefit. 
   And they will benefit even more, as you examine the impact this tax relief will have over time. Consider the effect if these tax savings were put away for their children's education and retirement. If a couple with two children making just $30,000 took their tax savings from this bill and put it into an education savings account like the one recently passed by the Senate, they would have $40,000 for those children's college education. Based on the stock market's historical rate of return, that's $40,000 if they did not set aside another penny! If the family was that of two elementary school teachers with two children and earning average salaries of $70,000 combined, they would have $65,000 after 18 years. 
   If those two married school teachers then started to put their tax savings from this bill into a ROTH IRA after 18 years, this same couple would have $224,100 when they retired 27 years later. 
   By transforming these tax savings into personal savings, we see that these real tax savings translate into real opportunities for these families. 
   And consider the effect on the economy. According to an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, when fully phased-in this marriage tax penalty relief legislation will result in 820,000 additional jobs. It will increase the personal savings rate by three-tenths of a percent, which in turn will lower interest rates. It also increase investment by $20 billion and gross domestic product by $54 billion. So not only do married families gain, not only do their children gain, but the entire country gains. 
   They gain more jobs, better jobs, and higher wages because of this marriage tax relief legislation. 
   Mr. President, the marriage tax relief legislation I bring to the floor today amounts to just five percent of the total budget surplus over the next five years. It amounts to just 17.6 percent of the non-Social Security surplus over the next five years. It amounts to just 42 percent of the new spending provided for in this year's budget over the next five years. Finally, it amounts to less than half of the tax cut that has been allotted to the Finance Committee for tax cuts over the next five years in this year's budget. By any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax penalty relief is fiscally responsible. 
   This bill does all these things for America's working families while preserving every cent of Social Security's surplus. These tax cuts do not have to pit America's families against America's seniors. Nor does it extend a tax cut in a fiscally irresponsible manner. These tax cuts fit in this year's budget, along with the other Republican priorities that we have already passed for education, health care, and small businesses. Our priorities add up to what's good for America, and our numbers add up to what's fiscally responsible. 
   It is time we divorce the marriage penalty from the tax code once and for all. I urge all my colleagues to support the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, firefighters and EMS personnel are truly our nation's first responders. When the tragic images of natural or manmade disasters flash across our TV screens, there is one image that stands alone. The American firefighter is always there to rescue the family from a burning building, always there in the wake of a natural disaster, and is always there should a terrorist strike in our nation's heartland. These scenes are played out around our country on a daily basis. And while we see these images on TV as just a part of our society today, what is not realized is the cost our first responders bear. 
   The 1.2 million men and women that serve in our nation's 32,000 fire departments do so with little fanfare, and often with little or no pay. Our nation's first responders ask very little of us, but, thankfully, they are always there when we need them. 
   That is why I have introduced the 21st Century Fire and Emergency Services Act which is a companion to the House-passed legislation. This legislation is an important step forward for the fire and EMS community. 
   Every year I hear from fire departments in Delaware who are looking to acquire state-of-the-art equipment to enhance their performance on a fire scene, or attempting to secure funding to train personnel in arson detection. I also hear from fire personnel seeking funds to create all-important fire prevention programs at local elementary schools. These are just a few examples. The point is that for all too many departments, after the general operating expenses are calculated, there is no funding for this equipment or special program. Funds raised through chicken dinners, bingo and bake sales can only go so far. 
   Back home, the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association is sending out the call for help. My legislation establishes two grant programs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The first is an $80 million competitive grant program for volunteer and paid fire and emergency services departments. With these 50/50 matching grants, I believe this legislation will give departments throughout our country an opportunity to have the thermal imaging camera or the health and wellness program needed to help them do their jobs even better. 
   Second, this bill establishes a $10 million burn research grant program through FEMA. Under this program, safety organizations, hospitals, and governmental and nongovernmental entities that are responsible for burn research, prevention, or treatment are eligible for competitive grants to continue their important work. 
   Finally, this bill recognizes the contributions of volunteer firefighters by providing $10 million to fully fund the USDA's Volunteer Fire Assistance Program. This program allows the nearly 28,000 rural fire departments nationwide to apply for cost-share grants for training, equipping and organizing their personnel. These rural fire departments represent the first line of defense for rural areas coping with fires and other emergencies. 
   Personally, I am excited about the technology that is available to first responders today, and I am committed to working to ensure that every department in Delaware and throughout the country has the tools it needs to make us all safer in our homes and communities. Let's not wait for the next disaster to hear the call.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills, each of  which would temporarily suspend the tariff collected on imports of two HIV-combating drugs, thus lowering their price for HIV-infected consumers in the United States. 
   The two drugs are DPC 961 and DPC 083. They have been selected from hundreds of candidates to have superior attributes relative to currently marketed similar drugs. As such, their combined potency, excellent resistance profile, lower protein binding, and longer plasma half life increases the probability that these drugs will successfully treat both HIV patients who have not previously had a similar treatment as well as those HIV patients who have already developed resistance to currently available agents. According to publicly available information, there is no other HIV treatment in clinical trials that is expected to be able to treat most patients with resistance to currently available agents. DPC 961 and DPC 083 are also expected to have the advantage of once daily therapy. 
   In addition, it is my expectation that the revenue impact of these measures will be determined by the Congressional Budget Office to be de minimus. There is no manufacturer of these drugs in the United States. It is my hope that these measures will win the unanimous support of my colleagues.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my amendment would simply protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling. Following in the footsteps of conservationist President Theodore Roosevelt, President Dwight Eisenhower set aside this Arctic wilderness area for all time and all generations. 
   While my amendment protects a wilderness, it also protects a legacy. It is a legacy forged of foresight and conservation that has been handed down from generation to generation. I hope we will pass this legacy on today to future generations--just as we have received it from past ones. My amendment will insure that we do. 
   This is not a partisan debate. The President I have named were both Republicans. I am joined in support of my amendment by many Democrats. Together, both parties have a stake in this wilderness area. I hope today that both parties will join hands in protecting it. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, for what I consider to be an excellent budget resolution. Over the next 5 years, the Budget Committee chairman has protected Social Security, funded our priorities such as defense and education, and provided for a $150 billion tax cut--something I look forward to crafting in the Finance Committee. 
   However, there is one point at which I respectfully disagree with my distinguished colleague's work. It is in the assumptions of allowing leasing for oil exploration and production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This budget resolution assumes that $1.2 billion would become available in fiscal year 2005 from the bids for such leases. 
   My amendment would simply remove that assumed revenue from the budget resolution and thereby protect this wilderness area. 
   My reason for offering this amendment is based on beauty, not on budgets. I do not want to see us make an irreparable mistake in one of America's remaining natural treasures. We can afford to forgo this momentary revenue, but we can't afford not to protect this Arctic Eden. 
   Mr. President, in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower had the wisdom to set aside a portion of America's Arctic for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations. His Arctic Range protected the highest peaks and glaciers of the Brooks Range, North America's two largest and most northerly alpine lakes, and nearly 200 different wildlife species, including polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, caribou and millions of migratory birds. 
   Eisenhower's Secretary of the Interior, Fred Seaton, called the new Arctic Range, ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas in North America ..... a wilderness experience not duplicated elsewhere.'' 
   The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our Earth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete spectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a vital part of our national consciousness. 
   The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness and recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and glaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich with caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, moose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, black brant, and more. Birds from the Arctic Refuge fly to or through every state in the continental U.S. In all, Mr. President, about 200 species use the coastal plain. 
   Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is good that man can come only as a visitor. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of those places. These are pristine lands that belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the lands that belong to our future. 
   In essence what I am asking my colleagues to support is an environmental stewardship that protects our important wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and judiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its long-term needs. 
   Considering the many reasons why protecting this area is so important, I came across the words of the great Western writer, Wallace Stegner. Referring to the land we seek to protect, he wrote that it is ``the most splendid part of the American habitat; it is also the most fragile.'' We cannot enter this land ``carrying habits that [are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely excessive.'' 
   An industrial zone and wilderness cannot occupy the same space. The  simple fact is that no matter how well done, oil exploration and development would have significant and lasting impacts on this environment. 
   In closing, I want to remind my colleagues that when the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was formally created under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, it was to conserve fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity. Oil development on the coastal plain of the refuge is prohibited without the enactment of legislation authorizing development. 
   I urge my colleagues, to support my amendment and reject the budget resolution's assumptions on oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Let us reconfirm to protect today what can never be regained tomorrow if we make the wrong decision now. 
   I hope that we can forever protect the coastal plain from development. It is certainly premature at this time to assume revenue from oil development there. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to read from the letter of the League of Conservation Voters, which is the bipartisan political voice of the national environmental community. They write:  
   The League of Conservation Voters urges you to protect the biological heart of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by supporting an amendment offered by Senator Roth to the 2001 Budget Resolution that opposes opening the Refuge to oil drilling. Currently the budget resolution assumes revenues from drilling in the Refuge.  
   It goes on to say:  
   Protecting the wilderness values of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the top priorities of the national environmental community.  
   How true that is. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge contains our Nation's greatest wilderness. No conservation area in America contains as much vast wild land free of industrialization. It is the essence of our country's wilderness areas. 
   Consider three or four points. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the only conservation area that protects a complete spectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems in North America. The Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge is the only wild stretch of coast on Alaska's North Slope that is off limits to oil and gas exploration and development. 
   President Dwight Eisenhower was the first to set aside the original Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1960 for the purpose of protecting the wilderness, the wildlife, and recreational values. 
   While many refuges in America have been set aside to protect wildlife populations and habitat, the Arctic Refuge is the only refuge in which wilderness was recognized as a purpose for establishment, the controversial 1002 area proposed for oil development as a part of the original Arctic range. 
   I could go on. It is critically important that we protect this valuable refuge for future generations. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Roth amendment. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. I rise today in support of the amendment of the Senator from Texas. 
   Getting married is not cheap. According to Bride's magazine, a couple getting married today can expect to spend $20,000 for the big event--reception, flowers, food, dress, band, and cake. Throw in another $4,000 for the honeymoon, and the sticker shock is complete. But it is not over. Just when the newlyweds thought their debts were paid off, tax time arrives and they are faced with a new bill--the marriage tax penalty. 
   Last week, the Senate Finance Committee approved legislation that will provide relief from this bliss-busting tax. 
   Our legislation would provide $248 billion in relief to America's families by eliminating the marriage penalty in the standard deduction; providing broad based relief by widening the 15- and 28-percent tax brackets; expanding the earned income credit to more lower income working families and ensuring that families can take the tax credits for which they qualify by permanently eliminating any cutbacks of the credits because of the minimum tax. 
   Even after the honeymoon's over and paid for, today's newlyweds are going to find their married life perpetually filled with financial challenges. That $20,000 wedding is going to look cheap compared to saving for a down payment on a house, saving for a college education and saving for retirement. Letting families keep more of what they earn by lowering their taxes will make each of these financial challenges easier to face and, in the process, hopefully help make that wedded bliss last a little longer.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of Ion Ratiu of Romania who passed away on the 16th of January. 
   I had the honor of developing a close friendship with Ion. He was an outstanding politician, a very successful businessman, a philanthropist and, above all, a freedom fighter and a leader devoted to deepening relations between Romania and the United States. 
   Born in Romania at the end of World War II, Ion Ratiu spent a good part of his life in the United Kingdom and the United States. Here in Washington he developed many friendships and many of us have benefited from the warm hospitality of his Georgetown home. 
   Those of us who had the pleasure of his friendship can only have been impressed by the tremendous personal energy he directed against the dictatorship that dominated his homeland until the Velvet Revolutions of 1989. Ion was himself an incarnation of many elements of democracy's powerful arsenal. He was a journalist reporting on Romania's tragedy. He was a protector and rescuer of its dissidents. He was the founder of the ``Free Romania Movement.'' He was the unyielding proponent of human rights in Romania. 
   In addition to tearing down Communism and building democracy in Romania, Ion Ratiu was also one who contributed to the foundation of deeper ties and links between Romania and the West, particularly the United States. 
   In London he led the British-Romanian Association for 20 years, and with his wife and sons established the Romanian Cultural Center. Here in Washington, Ion endowed the Ion Ratiu Chair at Georgetown University, a lighthouse for Romanian-American relations. 
   After the Romanian Revolution, Ion Ratiu was elected a member of national Parliament in Bucharest. He even was a strong contender for the Romanian presidency. Ion benefited from the respect of all his colleagues in the Romanian Parliament. He was appreciated for his commitment to democracy and unyielding efforts to earn for his country membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It was no surprise for me that Ion, a member of the opposition, led his parliament's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. 
   The Romanian nation is mourning and so are Ion Ratiu's friends in the United States and the United Kingdom.  We will remember his for the warm enthusiasm and gentle manners he brought to every event. We will miss his soft and unique sense of humor. 
   And, we will always be grateful to him for keeping the torch of liberty, democracy, and freedom alive and vibrant. Ion always stayed true to his principles and beliefs and to his love for Romania. 
   Ion Ratiu is truly one of the heroes of not only Romania, but also the relationship between Romania and the United States.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today--along with Senator BREAUX and others--to introduce a bill to repeal the telephone excise tax. It is a tax that is outdated, unfair, and complex for both consumers to understand and for the collectors to administer. It cannot be justified on any tax policy grounds. 
   The federal government has had the American consumer on ``hold'' for too long when it comes to this tax. The telephone excise tax has been around for over 102 years. In fact, it was first imposed in 1898--just 22 years after the telephone itself was invented. So quickly was it imposed that it almost seems that Uncle Sam was there to collect it before Alexander Graham Bell could put down the receiver from the first call. In fact, the tax is so old that Bell himself would have paid it! 
   This tax on talking--as it is known--currently stands at 3%. Today, about 94% of all American families have telephone service. That means that virtually every family in the United States must tack an additional 3% on to their monthly phone bill. The federal tax applies to local phone service; it applies to long distance service; and it even applies in some cases to the extra amounts paid for state and local taxes. It is estimated that this tax costs the American public more than $5 billion per year. 
   The telephone excise tax is a classic story of a tax that has been severed from its original justifications, but lives on solely to collect money. 
   In truth, the federal phone tax has had more legislative lives than a cat. When the tax was originally imposed, Teddy Roosevelt was leading the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill. At that time, it was billed as a luxury tax, as only a small portion of the American public even had telephones. The tax was repealed in the early 20th century but then was reinstated at the beginning of World War I. It was repealed and reinstated a few more times until 1941, when it was made permanent to raise money for World War II. In the mid-60s, Congress scheduled the elimination of the phone tax, which had reached levels of 10 and 25 percent. But once again, the demands of war intervened, as the elimination of the tax was delayed to help pay for Vietnam. In 1973, the phone tax began to phase-out, but one year before it was about to be eliminated, it rose up yet again--this time justified by the rationale of deficit reduction--and has remained with us ever since. 
   This tax is a pure money grab by the federal government--it does not pass any of the traditional criteria used for evaluating tax policy. First, this phone tax is outmoded. Once upon a time, it could have been argued that telephone service was a luxury item and that only the rich would be affected. As we all know, there is nothing further from the truth today. 
   Second, the federal phone tax is unfair. Because this tax is a flat 3%, it applies disproportionately to low and middle income people. For example, studies show that an American family making less than $50,000 per year spends at least 2% of its income on telephone service. A family earning less than $10,000 per year spends over 9% of its income on telephone service. Imposing a tax on those families for a  service that is 
   a necessity in a modern society is simply not fair. 
   Third, the federal phone tax is complex. Once upon a time, phone service was simple--there was one company who provided it. It was an easy tax to administer. Now, however, phone service is intertwined with data services and Internet access, and it brings about a whole new set of complexities. For instance, a common way to provide high speed Internet access is through a digital subscriber line. This DSL line allows a user to have simultaneous access to the Internet and to telephone communications. How should it be taxed? Should the tax be apportioned? Should the whole line be tax free? And what will we do when cable, wireless, and satellite companies provide voice and data communications over the same system? The burdensome complexity of today will only become more difficult tomorrow. 
   As these questions are answered, we run the risk of distorting the market by favoring certain technologies. There are already numerous exceptions and carve-outs to the phone tax. For instance, private communications services are exempt from the tax. That allows large, sophisticated companies to establish communications networks and avoid paying any federal phone tax. It goes without saying that American families do not have that same option. 
   With new technology, we also may exacerbate the inequities of the tax and contribute to the digital divide. For example, consider two families that decide it's time to connect their homes to the Internet. The first family installs another phone line for regular Internet access. The second family decides to buy a more expensive, dedicated high speed line for Internet access. The first family definitely gets hit with the phone tax, while the second family may end up paying no tax at all on their connection. I can't see any policy rationale for that result. 
   Speaking of complexity, let me ask if anyone has taken a look at their most recent phone bill. It is a labyrinth of taxes and fees piled one on top of another. We may not be able to figure out what all the fees are for; but we do know that they add a big chunk to our phone bill. According to a recent study, the mean tax rate across the country on telecommunications is slightly over 18%. That is about a 6% rise in the last 10 years. In my little state of Delaware, the average tax rate on telecommunications now stands at 12%. I can't control the state and local taxes that have been imposed, but I can do my part with respect to the federal taxes. I seek to remove this burden from the citizens of my state--and all Americans across the country. 
   The technological changes in America have increased productivity and revolutionized our economy. As members of Congress, we need to make sure that our tax policies do not stifle that economic expansion. We should not adhere to policies that are a relic from a different time. In 1987, even before the deregulation of the telecommunications market, the Treasury Department concluded that there were ``no strong arguments in favor of the communications excise tax.'' 
   In today's economy, the arguments for repeal are even stronger. Earlier this year, the National Governors Association issued a report concluding that ``policymakers need to create a telecommunications tax structure that more accurately reflects the new economic realities of the market and to ensure that current state tax policy does not inhibit growth in the telecommunications industry.'' Moreover, the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, which Congress established to study the issue of Internet taxation, appears to have reached near unanimous agreement that the phone excise tax should be repealed. 
   Mr. President, it is time to end the federal phone tax. For too long while America has been listening to a dial tone, Washington has been hearing a dollar tone. This tax is outmoded. It has been here since Alexander Graham Bell himself was alive. It is unfair. We are today taxing a poor family with a tax that was originally meant for luxury items. And it is complex. Only a communications engineer can today understand the myriad of taxes levied on a common phone bill and only the federal government has the wherewithal to keep track of who and what will be taxed. Mr. President, it is time we hung up the phone tax once and for all. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its repeal.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator MOYNIHAN to introduce legislation that will make normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China permanent when China accedes to the World Trade Organization. The legislation I am introducing is the same as that sent up by the administration. It is a clean bill, and I believe we should keep it that way. 
   Last year, the Chinese made a series of bold commitments to United States negotiators to open their market in return for WTO accession. In sector after  sector--and by a date certain--the Chinese have pledged to open their markets to foreign goods, investment and services. These openings represent an unparalleled opportunity for U.S. farmers, manufacturers, and service providers to expand their exports into a rapidly growing market. 
   Those commitments will help move the Chinese economy toward a rules-based system and end many forms of state control. In essence, China has conceded that its future depends on the replacement of its communist-style economy with an open, market-oriented system based on the rule of law. Indeed, in a number of sectors, economically backward China will be more open to American exports than some of our developed-country trading partners in Asia and Europe. 
   What must the United States give away in terms of access to our market in return for China's pledge to enact these sweeping reforms? The answer is as striking as it is simple: absolutely nothing. The cost of our access to China's market is simply to comply with our own WTO obligations. Indeed, for the United States to reap the benefits of China's open markets once it joins the WTO, the only act necessary is passage of this legislation. This legislation will thus end the annual normal trade relations renewal process required by the Jackson-Vanik provisions in current trade law. 
   Some believe we must retain the annual renewal process because it gives us leverage in checking China's conduct on a number of fronts. But the annual debate on renewing normal trade relations has not been a very effective means of achieving any of the goals we all share with respect to China: peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question; enhanced human rights, religious freedom and stronger worker rights for the Chinese people or curbing China's irresponsible behavior on security matters. But the active involvement of United States firms in China can only help open that society and reinforce the changes already under way in China toward free markets and a rules-based society. 
   The enormous benefits of enacting permanent normal trade relations, on the other hand, are clear. Just as clear is the huge cost of failing to do so. In passing PNTR, American workers, farmers and exporters will gain access to market-opening concessions the Chinese made to our negotiators after 13 long years of hard negotiations. 
   If we fail to pass PNTR, then every member economy of the World Trade Organization will gain such access except the United States. Our European, Japanese and Asian competitors could not hope for a more lucrative gift, and all at the expense of our farmers and workers. 
   Here is what Leonard Woodcock, many years the President of the United Auto Workers, had to say in support of PNTR 2 weeks ago:  
   American labor has a tremendous interest in China's trading on fair terms with the U.S. The agreement we signed with China this past November marks the largest single step ever taken toward achieving that goal. The agreement expands American jobs. And while China already enjoys WTO-based access to our economy, this agreement will open China's economy to unprecedented levels of American exports, many of which are high-quality goods produced by high-paying jobs.  
   With that sentiment I most strongly agree. 
   What about the rights of Chinese workers themselves? On this point I agree with Mr. Woodcock, as well. To be sure, nothing in the U.S.-China trade agreement requires that free trade unions be formed in China. Yet the WTO does not require this of any of its 136-member countries, and the WTO is the wrong instrument to use to achieve that goal. We should, instead, be asking a more important question: Are Chinese workers better off with this agreement? The answer is a resounding yes. 
   With so little to lose in ending the annual renewal process and so much to gain by enacting PNTR, I would hope this body will pass this legislation overwhelmingly.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first let me thank and congratulate my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from New York, for his leadership throughout the years on this most important domestic program, Social Security. There is no program of greater importance and interest to the American people than Social Security. The distinguished Senator, Mr. MOYNIHAN, as I said, throughout his career has played a critical role in the development, the preserving, and the strengthening of this important program. I thank him and congratulate him. 
   As Senator MOYNIHAN pointed out, the Senate is now turning to the vote to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, an important step in preparing Social Security for the 21st century. This repeal is good for seniors, it is good for America, and it is good government. As we have heard, the Social Security earnings limit was enacted 65 years ago to encourage older persons to retire during the Great Depression. But today, with Americans living longer, and the tightest labor market in 30 years, this rule is not only outdated, but it harms both our senior citizens and the economy. 
   Repealing the earnings limit will help improve the retirement security of seniors by giving them the choice to work longer and to save more. Abolishing the earnings limit will allow us to protect the Nation's economic gains of the past 17 years by encouraging our Nation's most experienced workers to continue working, not only for today but into the future. 
   Finally, repealing the earnings limit is just plain good government. It will save the Social Security Administration money and reduce very common, frustrating mistakes in calculating benefits. So let me say, I urge each Senator to support this bill. 
   I am happy to yield the remaining time to the distinguished assistant leader of the majority.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today is a great day for millions of seniors, for their families, and for their employers. The Senate will vote shortly to repeal a provision in the Social Security law that discourages seniors from working, the so-called earnings limit. Repealing this earnings limit is an important step in preparing Social Security for the 21st century. 
   Social Security is a marvelous program. Now and in the future, both for today's seniors and for our children, Social Security is the foundation of a secure retirement for most Americans. Social Security has lifted millions from poverty and is especially important to women. But the Social Security earnings limit discourages seniors from working. Seniors can have their benefits reduced by as much as one-third as long as they work. As a result, many seniors choose to cut back their hours or stop working altogether. 
   The fact is, the earnings limit is a part of a bygone era. It is the product of the Great Depression, a time when folks believed that an individual should retire completely and make room for others to work. It is antiquated and antiproductive. 
   Although Congress has made the earnings limit less onerous over the years, it has worked only too well. In the early 1950s, almost 50 percent of men over age 65 were working. Today,  it is only 17 percent. These numbers are even lower for women. But in the new economy we realize the importance of men and women remaining productive participants in our workforce. In the new economy, we appreciate skill and experience. 
   Abolishing the earnings limit is not only good for seniors, it is good for America. It is good employment and economic policy. It is also good government. It will improve public service by the Social Security Administration. 
   Repealing the earnings limit will help strengthen the retirement security of Americans by giving seniors a choice of working longer and saving more. 
   As Americans live longer, work will likely be more and more important to the financial security of seniors, again, especially for women. Also, seniors who work may be better able to voluntarily delay their Social Security benefits. As a result, they will receive a larger check when they do elect benefits, in effect, by banking those benefits. 
   Repealing the earnings limit is good employment and economic policy. We live in a world of great new potential and exciting changes. The Internet--the communications revolution--is creating huge new opportunities. Breakthroughs in biotechnology promise longer and healthier lives. 
   Among all this change, however, there is one constant: Our success as a nation depends on the hard work and talent of our people. Today, we understand economic growth is a function of the number of workers and the productivity of each worker. As a nation, we benefit from more workers, not fewer. 
   According to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, we are beginning to suffer from a serious worker shortage that threatens our economic expansion. In just 5 years--in 2005--when baby boomers reach retirement age, we will need more older Americans working just to maintain the Nation's labor force. 
   We do not need disincentives that discourage some of our Nation's most experienced workers from working. Abolishing the earnings limit will allow us to protect the Nation's economic gains of the past 17 years. It will not only help to raise the standard of living for many of our seniors but help keep the strongest economic growth in our lifetime on track. This is a win-win situation. 
   Repealing the earnings limit has one other very important value: Improving public service by the Social Security Administration. Administering the earnings limit is complex; it is difficult. It costs something close to $100 million per year and is the culprit in the vast majority of Social Security benefit payment errors. These payment errors are a huge source of frustration to seniors. With this legislation, we will now be avoiding that. 
   Let me also note that there are no long-term costs associated with this bill. No senior receives any greater amounts of benefits. Rather, we simply provide seniors with greater choice over when they receive these benefits. 
   I am very proud of what the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate itself has been able to accomplish over the past 5 years. We have balanced the budget and have begun to pay down the public debt. We have strengthened Medicare and expanded health care, especially for children and people with disabilities. We have provided new educational opportunities. We have fixed a broken welfare system. We have cut taxes. We have reformed the IRS. We have protected the Social Security trust fund. 
   With the passage today of the Social Security earnings limit repeal, we will add one more significant accomplishment to this list. Without question, there is still much to do on Social Security reform. But this legislation is a clear and vivid demonstration that we can work together in a bipartisan way to achieve lasting and valuable changes in Social Security. 
   In closing, let me note that the President has asked for a clean bill, one without extraneous amendments. With the exception of the managers' amendment, which fixes a technical problem with the House bill, we intend to provide that. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, to sweep away the earnings limit--a relic of the Depression--and to move Social Security into the 21st century.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I begin by recognizing the important contributions of Senator KERREY, both to the Finance Committee and to the Senate. In particular, he is a unique and important voice in the national debate on Social Security and Medicare reform. He has taken thoughtful but not always popular positions on how these programs should be reshaped, both to better serve our Nation's seniors and to ensure that these programs can be sustained. 
   Indeed, much of the current debate over Social Security reform dates to 1993, when Senator KERREY conceived and then later chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. On the Finance Committee, his energy and expertise are highly regarded by his colleagues. 
   Having said that, I must oppose this amendment. I understand why Senator KERREY has offered it. And on a more appropriate bill, I might support it. Certainly, as a nation, we need to rethink carefully what we mean by retirement. However, I believe instead we should act to move this legislation to the President as quickly as possible. That means no other amendments other than the managers' amendment, which fixes a technical problem of the House bill. 
   I have received a letter from Chairman ARCHER and Congressman RANGEL saying that any other extraneous amendments will require a conference. Needless to say, other issues might be raised in the conference. 
   Mr. President, I trust my friend from Nebraska will understand why I oppose this amendment. I hope he will accept my pledge to continue to work with him on these important issues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment to S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act. 
   First, my amendment makes this legislation a true tax cut bill for education. My amendment removes all the bill's tax increases. We should not be taxing away with one hand what we return with another in a time of Federal budget surplus. Americans should not be taxed again to pay for a national priority. 
   Second, my amendment makes permanent the increase from $500 to $2,000 in the annual contribution amount for a kindergarten-to-college education IRA. Without these permanent increases in contribution limits and spending flexibility, both would end after the year 2003. My amendment removes that sunset because I believe that we should not be sunsetting our Nation's future, which is the education of our children. 
   Education IRAs are extremely important. Not only does the increase to $2,000 I propose make these accounts more attractive to families who want to use them, but to institutions who want to offer them. And even more important than these additional incentives to adults is the one they give to children. As experts have testified, there is something special about knowing that money is being put away for your future education. It is an incentive to excellence for both today and tomorrow. 
   Third, my amendment fixes a trap for the unwary. Currently, a student who takes money from an education IRA is not able to use the HOPE or Lifetime Learning Credit--even if they are for different education expenses. That is wrong, and it is downright deceptive to families who need both. My amendment allows parents to use both and to use both permanently. 
   Finally, my amendment makes the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance permanent--both undergraduate and graduate. Something as important and necessary as continuing education should not be wrapped up in the uncertainty of frequently needed legislative action. 
   Why is the permanency of my amendment's provisions so important? Because they would allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually toward their child's education--from the day of birth to the first day of college. 
   Even that may not seem like a lot but, like a train, it may start slowly but it is very powerful. It will gain speed. It is a savings express to college. 
   By putting their child on the savings express, after 18 years when that child is ready to go to college, the parents will have over $65,000. And that just assumes a 6-percent rate of interest--the rate on a government security. Of course, other investments could yield even more. Parents would have at least $65,000 toward their child's education. Twenty-nine thousand dollars of that would be solely due to the power of compounding interest. And every cent of that $29,000 would be tax-free--it would go straight into education. 
   Maybe that still does not seem like a lot to some folks, but it sure seems like a lot to parents who are struggling today to insure college for their children tomorrow. 
   The national average annual cost of college--tuition, room, and fees--is roughly $10,000 per year or $40,000 for the cost of college education. 
   My amendment before us today will cover this. It will give parents and students peace of mind and a piece of the American dream. 
   My amendment is a powerful incentive to save. It is an engine. It is the engine that can pull a long train of savings--and dreams. 
   Like the ``Little Engine that Could,'' my amendment makes this legislation the ``Education Savings Plan that Will.'' Parents and children getting on this savings train, will get off at college to a better future. 
   America has waited for this education savings plan for three long years. This legislation brings it home today. My amendment makes sure it stays there for families--not just for today, but for tomorrow and all the days that follow. It is time that the President got on board. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in a bipartisan effort to make education affordable for America's families. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida has offered an amendment he claims will offset the cost of this bill by keeping in place its current tax increases. It will not and what's more it should not, even if it did. 
   Senator GRAHAM claims this education savings bill must be paid for. Let me say the bill is already paid for. It has been paid for by a surplus in income tax revenues from America's families. 
   According to the Senate Budget Committee, federal revenues, not counting a cent of Social Security's surplus, will be $1.9 trillion higher over the next ten years than this year's level of federal spending. That means a $1.9 trillion overpayment by America's income taxpayers. Are we saying that despite a $1.9 trillion overpayment that we cannot afford to let families keep less than one percent of it for their children's education? 
   Second, leaving these tax increases in this bill will still not pay for it fully. They are simply tax increases then--not offsets. 
   Finally, when Senate Democrats offered their tax relief package last July, it amounted to $290 billion over ten years. None of this was offset. Why now, when the issue is education and the tax relief is just a fraction of the amount that Senate Democrats supported last year, must we now raise taxes to pay for it? This is simply inconsistent. 
   Perhaps an even better question is: Why must we raise taxes to constitute this offset? Why could those wishing to pay for this, not find the small amount of money necessary from a $1.8 trillion budget? To pay for this from Washington's budget rather than the American taxpayer's? 
   I am sympathetic to the argument of fiscal responsibility. However at a time of substantial tax overpayment, why should it be so hard to allow families to keep some of their own tax overpayment for their children's education? 
   If we cannot say that when the federal government is running federal surpluses worth, according to our Budget Committee, almost $2 trillion over the next ten years; and we are seeking to return less than half a percent for education, when can we ever have a reason to cut taxes? 
   The federal tax burden as a percentage of 
   the economy is the largest that it has been since World War II. The federal income tax burden as a percentage of the economy is the largest in history. Those are not my estimates but the President's. Once again I ask: if we cannot cut taxes when they are at historically high levels, when can we cut them? 
   The tax overpayment is huge, the tax burden is historically high, and the cost of this education provision is small, if we cannot cut taxes now and for education--when and for what can we ever cut them? 
   Sadly, I cannot help but believe that there are some Senators who must think that we can never cut taxes. That taxpayers' money is always better spent in Washington than by the people who earned it. I am one Senator who does not believe this is true. 
   I intend to vote against this amendment to raise taxes. Furthermore, I intend to bring more legislation to the floor that will cut taxes--not raise them. 
   I believe that this education legislation is precisely what America's income tax surplus should be used for: America's families. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me and reject the Graham amendment and keep my proposed permanent tax relief for education.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is somewhat fascinating to me that this week and today we are being accused of spending too much on education; that we cannot afford to dedicate something close to one-half of 1 percent to assure our American families the kind of education they need these days. Yet a few days ago, the legislation was belittled for not spending enough. We can't have it both ways. 
   What I think is particularly important to understand is that No. 1, no matter is more important to the American family or to this Nation than a well-educated citizenry. 
   I believe what is remarkable about this legislation as modified by my amendment is it takes a very little amount to accomplish so much. 
   The continuing education of Americans is obviously critically important because of the continuing technological revolution we are enjoying. The new generation is going to be facing the need to continue their education to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future. 
   I find it very puzzling when we recognize--and the administration, as well, recognizes--that over the next 10 years we will have nearly a $2 trillion surplus, and we cannot take a very small part of that to help assure American families of all backgrounds the opportunity to be well-educated citizens. 
   I urge my friends and my colleagues to vote against the Graham amendment, the Senator for whom I have the highest respect. 
   I think this is something for which we should use the surplus. I think there is nothing more important than American education.  
   Let me point out once more that American families are paying higher taxes than any time since the end of World War II. Close to 20 or 21 percent of gross domestic product is going to Federal taxes. It is my solid belief that it is important we return part of that to the American family. One of the most important reasons for returning it is to assure they have the resources and are able to send their children not only to the schools of their choice but to college and graduate education as well. 
   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the second-degree amendment and to support my amendment which would make permanent many of the benefits contained in this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to address one provision in the managers' amendment that has been adopted. 
   The provision to which I am referring deals with the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board to allocate authority to Federal Home Loan Banks to guarantee school construction bonds. The provision contemplates legislation that ``expressly'' authorizes the Federal Housing Finance Board to allocate such authority to the Federal Home Loan Banks. No inference should be drawn from this provision with respect to the Federal Housing Finance Board's current authority. 
   I note that the general counsel of the Board has issued a legal opinion arguing that the Board has the implicit legal authority to allocate authority to Federal Home Loan Banks to guarantee school construction bonds.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I'd like to focus on the issue of school construction. All of us, Democrats and Republicans, recognize the need for well constructed and well-maintained school facilities. Nobody wants an inadequate learning environment for our children. 
   Senator ROBB has offered an amendment on school construction. His amendment, as I understand it, basically contains the administration's school construction package. I opposed this package last year, and I continue to do so today. 
   Before I even talk about Senator ROBB'S amendment, I want to make a point that is often lost in this discussion. The Federal Government already provides a significant subsidy for school construction. Under current law, states and localities can issue debt that is exempt from federal taxation. This benefit allows them to finance school construction by issuing long-term bonds at a much lower cost than they otherwise could. The interest subsidy saves school districts money and allows them to stretch their resources to meet their needs. 
   Now let me comment on the substance of Senator ROBB'S amendment. Among other things, it creates a new type of bond--called a ``qualified school modernization bond'' and authorizes the issuance of up to $23.6 billion of these bonds. Unlike regular tax-exempt bonds, for which the holder receives tax-exempt interest payments, holders of these new qualified school modernization bonds would receive a federal tax credit, in an amount to be set by the Treasury Department. 
   This program involves a dramatic increase in federal bureaucracy, while at the same time striking at the heart of local control of education--which is the hallmark of our nationwide educational system. 
   In order to qualify for these bonds, a state or local school district would need to secure the approval of the Department of Education. In giving its OK, the Department of Education is supposed to consider whether a comprehensive survey of the district's renovation and construction needs had been completed, and how the state or locality would respond to the construction needs. In other words, federal officials in Washington would be micromanaging a local school district's renovation plans--in effect, second guessing the decision of state and local officials. 
   It just does not make sense for the Department of Education to get involved at this level. President Clinton himself stated in 1994 that ``the construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local governments financed primarily by local taxpayers.'' In that respect at least, I agree with the President. 
   While I am on the subject of local control, I want to point out that state and local governments have, in fact, responded to the need for school construction and renovation. On March 3, 1999, the Finance Committee had a  hearing where we evaluated the appropriate federal role in school construction. At that time, Dr. Dennis Zimmerman of the Congressional Research Service explained that since the early 1990's, the approval rates for school bond issues and for total school construction dollars has increased substantially. From 1991 until 1998, 
   the approval rate for new issues went from less than 50 percent to almost 67 percent. During those same years, the approval rates for new construction dollars went from about 48 percent to over 82 percent. 
   Additionally, the inflation adjusted annual growth rate of school bond volume--measured in dollars--during the last 20 years is 7.7 percent. This compares to an annual school age population growth rate of only 0.2 percent and an annual increase of 4.1 percent in state/local receipts. With respect to bond volume, in the first 6 months of 1996, voters approved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of more than $4 billion over the first 6 months of 1995. 
   The bottom line is that many states and localities are doing their homework, passing bonds, building and renovating schools, and enjoying favorable treatment under the existing Tax Code. They are stepping up and meeting the challenge--and they are doing so without a massive intrusion by the Federal Government. One of the witnesses at our hearing, Bill Manning, the president of a large school district in my little State of Delaware, told us that if we really wanted to improve education at the local level, we should diminish the federal role, rather than increase it. 
   The package of school construction measures in the Finance Committee bill would retain state and local control, and would also work within the existing tax-exempt bond framework. The latter point is important because our purpose here is to provide state and local governments with incentives that they can use, and not concepts that are untested and uncertain. 
   For instance, 2 years ago, Congress enacted a tax credit bond program for school construction. Called qualified zone academy bonds (``QZABs''), the law provided for an authorization of $400 million in 1998 and $400 million in 1999. According to the Bond Market Association, however, few QZAB transactions have taken place. 
   Mr. President, in the extenders tax legislation last fall, we did extend the QZAB program through 2001. One of the reasons for this extension was to evaluate how this pilot program is performing. My point here is simply that setting up a big program with a high authorization does not always translate into a successful policy result. We need to look at how the program will play out in the real world--whether the rhetoric will translate into results. We need to look at how the program will play out in the real world. 
   The proposals in the Finance Committee bill provide local school districts with the flexibility they need to address the needs of their constituents. On this point, does anyone really believe Washington, DC, bureaucrats really understand local school construction needs better than the local school board? 
   How do we accomplish the objective of enhancing the financing of school construction 
   activities, while maintaining local control, in this bill? 
   The answer is several important school construction measures. 
   The first proposal is directed at innovative financing for school districts. It expands the tax exempt bond rules for public/private partnerships set up for the construction, renovation, or restoration of public school facilities in these districts. In general, it allows states to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per state resident. Each state would receive a minimum allocation of at least $5 million of these tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to 600 million per year in new tax exempt bonds would be issued for these innovative school construction projects. 
   This proposal is important because it retains state and local flexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the states and it does not force the Federal Government to micromanage school construction. 
   The proposal also is important because it promotes the use of public/private partnerships. Many high-growth school districts may be too poor or too overwhelmed to take on a school construction project themselves. With these bonds, those districts can partner with a private entity--and still enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing. 
   Mr. President, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That provision is designated to simplify the issuance of bonds for school construction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on investment unrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated to the Federal Government. However, there is an exception--generally referred to as the small issuer exception--which allows governments to issue to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for government that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds during the year. 
   The provision in the Finance Committee bill increase the smaller issuer exemption to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the bonds are issued to finance public schools. This measure will assist localities in meeting school construction needs by simplifying their use of tax-exempt financing. At the same time, it will not create incentives to issue such debt earlier or in larger amounts than is necessary. It is a type of targeted provision that makes sense. 
   Mr. President, I also want to make sure that my colleagues realize that the Robb Amendment strikes the language in the bill relating to K-12 withdrawals from education savings accounts. This flexibility--the ability to use a family's savings for any of the family's education expenses--is a central component of this bill. 
   Removing it sends the wrong message to American families and does nothing to help them meet the increasing need of education. 
   For these reasons, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that we have already considered and rejected the President's school construction proposal in the past. In 1998, in connection with an education tax bill, Senator Moseley-Braun offered the President's package, and it was defeated by a vote of 56-42. Last year, my distinguished colleague, Senator ROBB, offered this school construction plan, and it was defeated 55-45. 
   We all agree on the need for well-built and well-maintained schools. There is no one in this body who wants our children to learn in a substandard learning environment. But the evidence shows the States are stepping up and meeting the challenge of providing schools for their students. We should not create a new Federal program that injects the Federal bureaucracy into additional State and local controls. For these reasons, I oppose the amendment, and I move to table it.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I intend to offer a substitute amendment to S. 1134 later today. The underlying bill was reported out of the Finance Committee almost 1 year ago, in May 1999. My substitute amendment makes some important and necessary policy changes that were not done before--because of budget constraints 1 year ago. My amendment also updates the bill to account for the passage of time. 
   When the committee originally considered this education bill, we were operating under last year's budget scenario. Since that time, the surplus numbers have increased dramatically. In today's economic environment, I believe that it is appropriate to use the surplus to provide education tax incentives for American families. Through their hard work, the American people created these favorable economic conditions and the resulting budget surplus. They should be entitled to take some of that surplus back. 
   We should not have to raise taxes to offset these much needed education tax incentives. My amendment makes this legislation a true tax cut relief bill for education. With a growing Federal surplus created by their tax dollars, Americans should not be taxed again to pay for a national priority. 
   Accordingly, my substitute amendment strikes all of the revenue raisers in S. 1134. The cost of my amendment is but a small percentage of the projected budget surplus over the next 10 years. 
   Now let me explain some of the substantive changes that I make in the  substitute amendment. First, the underlying bill increases the maximum contribution amount for an Education IRA from $500 per year to $2,000 per year. The underlying bill also allows contributions to an Education IRA to be used for kindergarten through high school education expenses. These are both important and needed changes. But the underlying bill sunsets both of those benefits after the year 2003. That is not good policy. Accordingly, my bill removes the sunset--it makes permanent both the increase in the contribution limit and the flexibility in the use of the accounts. 
   Planning and saving for college should take place as early as possible. To help families make those important decisions, they need to know how much money they can put away and for what it can be used. Having provisions that sunset--and thus need to be renewed by Congress--takes away from that certainty. We need to make saving for college easier and more certain--not complex and uncertain. 
   I can easily see why a family would not want to take their hard earned savings and put them in a program where the terms could change in a few years. My amendment helps to solve that problem. We should not sunset our future--the education of our children. 
   Education IRAs are extremely important for a few reasons. First, they help families afford the escalating costs of higher education. The increase to $2,000 will make these accounts more attractive to families who want to use them and to institutions who want to offer them. Second, the existence of an education IRA gives an additional push to a student to attend college. Last month, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the rising cost of college tuition. One of the witnesses was Dr. Caroline M. Hoxby, an associate professor of economics at Harvard University. 
   Commenting on the behavioral incentives of an Education IRA, Dr. Hoxby noted that for an eighth grader, there is 
   something different about knowing that there is money being put away for your college education and that you will lose it and the opportunity to go to college if you do not continue to do well. It makes sense that a child who is aware that there is a fund being built up for his or her future education would think longer and harder about going to college. 
   My amendment also fixes a trap for the unwary. Under current law, a student who takes a distribution from an Education IRA is not able to use the HOPE or Lifetime Learning Credit--even if different education expenses are allocated for the different tax benefits. Again, this is not right. We are providing these education tax incentives to families because they need them. We should not hold them out there--making people believe that they are available--and then take them away. Because of revenue constraints, the original Finance Committee bill fixed this coordination only for a few years. My amendment makes the coordination permanent, and makes sure that families continue to receive the full benefits from all these tax benefits. 
   My amendment also makes the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance permanent. In last year's Extenders bill, Congress extended the current tax-free treatment for a few years. That was the right move, but it did not go far enough. First, something as important and necessary as continuing education should not be wrapped up in the uncertainty of extenders legislation. Workers and companies need to plan ahead, and they need to know how these educational expenses will be treated under the Tax Code. Second, we should reinstitute the exclusion for graduate education expenses. Especially in today's dynamic economy--which is marked by high technology and innovation--it is important that workers have access to graduate education. My amendment recognizes that fact, and so it makes permanent tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance for both undergraduate and graduate level courses. 
   Finally, my amendment updates the Finance Committee bill by changing the effective dates of the provisions. They would all be effective beginning in the year 2001. I should also note that my amendment takes into account the Senate's adoption of the Collins amendment yesterday--and so will include that amendment as well as any others that have been adopted. 
   Why are the permanent provisions in my amendment so important? Some Senators have tried to rationalize their opposition to this bill by claiming that it would not do enough to advance education. My amendment guarantees that this is simply not true. 
   My amendment would allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually toward their child's education--from the day of birth to the first day of college. 
   That is just $5.48 a day or $38.46 a week. That may not seem like a lot but, like a train, it may start slowly but it is very powerful. It will gain speed. It is a savings express to college. 
   By putting their child on the savings express, after 18 years when that child is ready to go to college, the parents will have $65,200, and that just assumes a 6 percent rate of interest--the rate on a Government security. Of course, other investments could yield even more, but a U.S. Government security is the safest in the world. 
   So parents would have at least $65,200 toward their child's education. $29,000 of that would be solely due to the power of compounding interest. And every cent of that $29,000 would be tax-free--it would go straight into education. 
   Maybe that still does not seem like a lot to some folks, but it sure seems like a lot to parents who are struggling today to insure college for their children tomorrow. 
   The average annual cost of college--tuition, room, and fees--in 1997-1998, was $9,536. At the University of Delaware, it is $9,984 for this school year. So the national average total cost is roughly $10,000 per year or $40,000 for the cost of a college education. 
   My amendment before us today will cover this. It will give parents and students peace of mind. 
   My amendment is a powerful incentive to save. It is an engine. It is the engine that can pull a long train of savings--and dreams. 
   Like the Little Engine that Could, my amendment makes this legislation the Education Savings Plan that Will. Parents and children getting on this savings train, will get off at college to a better future. 
   I am amazed that some people are trying to overlook the train and just see the caboose. 
   I promise you the American people are not. America has waited for this college savings plan for 3 years. This legislation brings it home today. It is time the President got on board. 
   The measures in this bill are an important step forward. My amendment will not only take us another step forward but keep us on a permanent track to prosperity. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in a bipartisan effort to make education affordable for American families. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed by the WTO appellate body's decision on the FSC. The panelists completely ignored economic reality. The FSC is not an export subsidy. It is a remedy for the competitive disadvantage our firms face in the marketplace due to the tax practices of other WTO members, particularly the members of the European Union. 
   That said, the real problem here is not the appellate body's decision, but the underlying WTO rules. That, and the perverse decision by the European Commission, over the objection of many of its own firms and member countries, to reopen this trade dispute 20 years after we had reached a satisfactory settlement of these issues. 
   Other WTO members, particularly in the European Union, employ a territorial-based tax system that does not tax foreign source income, including income from exports. That system affords a competitive advantage to firms operating in those jurisdictions that the U.S. tax system, based on worldwide reporting of income, does not. The WTO rules currently permit the use of territorial based tax systems, despite the competitive benefits they confer on products exported from those countries. That is what the FSC and the DISC before it were designed to offset. 
   I want to be absolutely clear about my view on this. While I fully expect we will live up to our obligations, no resolution of this issue can leave our firms, our farmers, and the American worker at a permanent competitive disadvantage in the marketplace. 
   Indeed, I thought we had put this issue to rest with our European counterparts 20 years ago. But, they saw fit to abrogate the agreement we had reached to resolve our prior dispute over the trade effects of their tax system and our attempts to redress those effects. That agreement included the understanding that, in the future, we would take our differences over tax policy to fora that were specifically designed for that purpose, and not the GATT or the WTO. 
   The reason for that understanding was simple. The GATT and the WTO are essentially agreements to reduce trade barriers and avoid other discriminatory trade practices. Nothing in those rules was intended to force a member country to choose between competing tax systems. Yet, that is the net effect of the current ruling. 
   The Europeans' action raises a far broader point about the conduct of their trade policy. The decision to abrogate our 20-year-old agreement and bring the FSC case, by all accounts, was not made at the behest of the EU member countries. Nor was it made at the insistence of EU firms complaining that the FSC somehow put them at a commercial disadvantage. That is because European firms understand that they already benefit from the territorial-based tax systems and the FSC was simply a way of providing equivalent treatment under our system of taxation. In fact, a number of those European-based firms have U.S. subsidiaries that take advantage of the FSC as well. 
   The decision to bring the FSC case was made at the European Commission without consideration either for its political impact here or for its impact on the trading system. In that sense, the decision to bring the FSC case fits with the Commission's attitude on our disputes on bananas and beef and on other WTO disputes. The Commission seems to have forgotten that the European Union member countries are, along with the United States, among the principal beneficiaries of the WTO system and that the Commission bears the responsibility to shore the system up, rather than engaging in tactics designed to weaken it. 
   Both the Commission's decision to flout the WTO rules in the beef and bananas disputes and the reckless decision to bring the FSC case are deeply inconsistent with that responsibility. This case was brought, not for any European constituency, but for the Commission's own petty political interest in balancing its losses before the WTO with a few wins, regardless of the larger consequences for the trading system. 
   This issue must be made a top priority in discussions at the upcoming G-8 summit. President Clinton must make the political point to his European counterparts that they, not the Commission, are responsible for setting the course of the European Union's trade policy and that this issue needs to be resolved in terms that ensure a level-playing field for American workers, farmers, and firms. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I am committed to making that happen.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we have failed to obtain a unanimous consent agreement to limit amendments with respect to S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act. I hope that we will move towards passage of this very significant bill. The importance of giving American families the resources and means they need to educate their children must be above politics. 
   I will soon take a few minutes to walk through the various provisions of the bill. But before I get into the specifics, let me remind my colleagues that all of the concepts in this bill should be very familiar. 
   This bill is an A+ for American education. Its concepts should be familiar because we have already endorsed them. The base provisions in the bill--which include the increase in the maximum allowable contribution to an education IRA, the use of the IRA for elementary and secondary school expenses for public and private schools, the tax-free treatment of State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, and the extension of tax-free treatment for employer-provided educational assistance--all received bipartisan support from the Finance Committee in the Senate as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
   Despite this Senate support, these provisions were dropped from the bill during conference negotiations. Because of opposition from the administration, these particular elements failed to be included in the final version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
   In addition, these proposals were included in legislation sent to the President in 1998. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that legislation. 
   These bipartisan proposals were included in the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, which passed last year. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that legislation, as well. 
   But we must not lose heart. The cause of affordable education is too important. I hope this time we can succeed for the American people. 
   We are here today to show our commitment to affordable education and to enact what this body determines makes good sense for American families. 
   It is important to note that this tax bill is not designed to answer all the education-related issues that face this country. Many issues are too varied and complicated to be addressed by the Federal Government. They need to be solved at the State and local level--by schools, by teachers, and by parents working together.  
   Instead, this bill is designed to build on the innovative concepts that have been introduced in the last few years. Our goal is to fix the Tax Code so that it provides the necessary incentives to help American families help their children. These are much needed tools. 
   From 1992 through 1998, tuition at a 4-year college increased by 234 percent. During that period, the average student loan increased by 367 percent. In contrast, median household income rose only 82 percent during that period and the Consumer Price Index rose only 74 percent. 
   Our students, our families, need these resources to help them meet the costs and realize the opportunities of a quality education. I hope my colleagues continue to recognize just how important they remain. The American people are counting on us. 
   Let me take a few minutes to describe the various provisions of the bill, to provide an overview, and to highlight some reasons these measures are so important. 
   As I already mentioned, the bill increases the maximum education IRA contribution from $500 to $2,000. That increase is important on two levels. First, with the well-documented increase in education costs, it is essential that we provide American families with the resources to meet these costs. 
   I have long argued that it is essential to change the savings habits of the American people. There are few things more important than the education of their children. Not only will saving in this way increase our investment capital, it will increase Americans' education capital as well. Anything that thwarts either of these objectives is shortsighted. 
   By using the Tax Code to encourage individual responsibility for paying for educational expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the education IRA will result in greater opportunities for individuals to save for their children's education. 
   Besides being too low to give parents the necessary resources to pay for the cost of education, the current $500 limit fails from another practical perspective. As we all know, any banker or broker who provides an IRA account faces assorted administrative costs for each account. To ensure they can adequately cover their administrative costs, most brokers or banks impose a minimum account balance, and in many cases the maximum balance has been set well higher than $500. That reality of the marketplace has the effect of limiting the availability of the educational IRA to American families. 
   Another reality is that confronted by a $500 limit. Many mutual fund companies find it is not worth their while to spend money on marketing the educational IRA. It is a fact of life that regardless of what we say or do in Congress, many families only know about the benefits of an educational IRA through the marketing efforts of their local mutual fund companies and banks. These businesses have been very successful in marketing IRAs with the higher contribution limit. If we want to maximize the involvement of American families in education IRAs, we need to ensure that the accounts make economic sense from the perspective of the companies offering them. 
   The next major change this bill makes to education IRAs is that it allows withdrawals for education expenses for elementary and secondary schools and for both private and public schools. 
   As we recognized last year, it is a fundamental principle that a parent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about his or her child's education, to decide basic questions such as how the child shall be educated and where the child should attend school. 
   In 1997, for example, when Congress passed a variety of provisions targeted to higher education, we made no distinction between private and public schools. 
   We did not say, for instance, that an education IRA or a HOPE scholarship would only be available if a student attended public school. We did not say that a student who attended the University of Maryland would receive a tax benefit but a student who attended George Washington University would receive nothing. 
   This bill recognizes that, just as for higher education, we should not 
   establish a priority system where some elementary and secondary schools are favored over others. We should not forget that it is the taxpayer who funds the educational IRA, that it is the parent who puts his or her hard-earned money into the education IRA. 
   It seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the parent should be able to choose how to spend that money and the parent should be able to choose where to send their children to school. 
   Moreover, parents with students in elementary and secondary school need our help to cope with the costs. It is simply not true that only rich kids attend private elementary or secondary schools. For instance, recent data from the National Catholic Education Association indicate that almost 70 percent of the families with children in Catholic schools have income below $35,000, and almost 90 percent of those families have incomes below $50,000. Why should those children not have access to these accounts? 
   Another provision in this bill makes State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans tax free, not simply tax deferred. This is a significant distinction because it allows students to withdraw the savings that accumulate in their prepaid tuition accounts without paying any tax at all. That means more money for children's education. It also means parents have the incentive to put money away today, and their children have the full benefit of that money without any tax tomorrow. 
   As I have already mentioned, at least 43 States have prepaid tuition plans in effect. This means most Members of the Senate have parents and students back home who either benefit from the plan right now or will benefit from the plan soon. I am pleased to see my home State of Delaware has already acted in this area. 
   Delaware parents can now save for college on a tax-deferred basis. But if this bill becomes law, these Delaware families will be able to save for a child's college education on a tax-free basis. 
   The prepaid provision also covers networks of private college plans. This will enable still more parents and more students to save for college. 
   The Finance Committee bill also extends tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance for graduates and undergraduates through June 30, 2004. 
   This particular program is a time-tested and widely used benefit for working families. Over 1 million workers across America receive tax-free employer-provided education. This allows them to stay on the cutting edge of their careers. It benefits not only them individually but their employers and, of course, the economy as a whole. With the constant innovation and advancing technology of our society, it is vitally important that we continue this program. 
   The Finance Committee hearings demonstrated the crushing debt burden faced by students coming out of college. I can tell you about this debt burden from Delaware families. I am sure I am not alone. To this end, the Finance Committee restores the student loan interest deduction in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This bill goes another step further and simplifies and expands the deduction for more students. 
   The Finance Committee does even more than address the cost of attending school. In response to concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, the Finance Committee agreed on some measures to provide relief in the area of school construction. 
   The first provision is directed at innovative financing for school districts. It expands the tax-exempt bond rules for public-private partnerships set up for the construction, renovation, or restoration of public school facilities in these districts. In general, it allows States to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per State resident. Each State would be guaranteed a minimum allocation of at least $5 million of these tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to $600 million per year in new tax-exempt bonds would be issued for these innovative school construction projects. 
   This provision is important because it retains State and local flexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the States. It does not force the Federal Government to micromanage school construction. 
   The provision is also important because it promotes the use of public-private partnerships. Many high growth school districts may be too poor or too  overwhelmed to take on a school construction project itself. But with these bonds, these districts can partner with a private entity and still enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing. 
   It is worth noting that there already is a significant Federal subsidy for school construction. Under current law, States and localities can issue debt that is exempt from Federal taxation. This benefit allows them to finance school construction by issuing long-term bonds at a lower cost than they otherwise could. 
   Moreover, the evidence shows that States and localities are taking advantage of this benefit. In the first 6 months of 1996, voters have approved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of more than $4 billion over the first 6 months of 1995. The bottom line is that many States and localities are doing their homework, passing bonds, building and renovating schools, and enjoying favorable treatment under the existing Tax Code. They are doing all this without significant 
   Federal involvement. 
   I do not have to remind colleagues that school construction has always been the province of State and local governments. President Clinton himself stated in 1994 that the construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State and local governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers. In that respect, I agree with the President. 
   Well, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That provision is designed to simplify the issue of bonds for school construction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on investment unrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated to the Federal Government. However, there is an exception, generally referred to as the small issuer exception, which allows governments to issue up to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for governments that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds during the year. 
   The provision in the Finance Committee bill increases the small issuer exception to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the bonds are issued to finance public schools. This measure will assist localities in meeting school construction needs by simplifying their use of tax-exempt financing. At the same time, it will not create incentives to issue such debt earlier or in larger amounts than is necessary. That is a type of targeted provision that I believe makes good sense. 
   Finally, as we all know, the Tax Code is too complex. As chairman of the Finance Committee, simplification of the Tax Code is one of my top priorities. This Finance Committee bill provides for coordination between education IRAs, prepaid tuition plans, the HOPE scholarship, and lifetime learning credits. This provision will mean that parents will not lose the benefit of the HOPE scholarship and lifetime learning credits when they use an education IRA or a prepaid tuition plan. 
   It is clear that the Finance Committee bill contains numerous important provisions for the American family. 
   As I have already said, many of these measures are ones the Senate passed last year. Anyone--students or parents--who is on the front line dealing with the cost of a quality education must have been disappointed in 1997, in 1998, and in 1999 when the President failed to agree to give any student or parent all the tools they needed. 
   American families understand the need for these measures. American families have now been waiting for several years. Let us not disappoint them any further. Let's not keep them waiting any longer. Let's move forward. Let's pass the Finance Committee bill now. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to point out that what we have before us is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. As I said in my opening remarks, this bill does not answer all problems of education. I am not one to try to base what I do on what a particular poll shows today or tomorrow. I am trying to help satisfy some of the pressing educational problems facing America. 
   When I go home to my little State of Delaware, a matter of real concern to families, whether their children are teenagers, in secondary or in grammar school, is how the family can afford to send their children to quality colleges. This is a key problem facing the typical American family. Make no mistake about it. I defy any one of you to go home and talk to parents, talk to your neighbors who have children. Time and again they will tell you how difficult it is to have the funds necessary to pay for college education. 
   So I do not apologize for bringing this kind of legislation before us. This is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. I might say, we have had this legislation reported out since last May. I am pleased and delighted we are having the chance to debate and vote on it. Yes, it does not settle the problems of teachers' training, the size of classes, or many of the other matters mentioned by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts. I do not deny those are important problems, but they are matters within the jurisdiction of other committees. What I seek to do today is to bring to the Senate legislation that will be most helpful to the typical American family, meeting part of that great American dream of sending their children on to higher education. 
   We have purposely tried to devise the kind of program that takes advantage of the miracle of compound interest. The question is not how much it costs the Government. The question is how much does this legislation help the typical American family? We all know the miracle of compound interest. If families will start when their children are small, saving in educational IRAs, up to $2,000, this will provide significant resources, tremendous amounts of money to help them send their children to school. 
   Yes, this legislation does not answer all problems of education, nor was it intended to. That is not within the jurisdiction of my committee. But I do say it does seek and will address some of the most important problems facing the American family. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is the Senate's responsibility to assure that only our Nation's most exceptional legal minds dispense justice during lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. This definition precisely describes Delaware's Thomas Ambro, whom we have just confirmed to serve as a Federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   I have followed Tom's legal career from the time he served on my Washington staff while attending Georgetown University Law School. Following a clerkship with Delaware Supreme Court Justice Daniel Herrmann, Tom distinguished himself as a corporate law attorney with the law firm of Richards, Layton and Finger in Wilmington, Delaware. 
   I have no doubt that Thomas Ambro's national reputation as a corporate bankruptcy attorney will soon be supplanted by a reputation as one of our wisest Federal judges. Congratulations to Tom on this significant day.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senators MURRAY, BINGAMAN, EDWARDS, CRAPO, DODD, THOMAS, and FEINSTEIN to submit a concurrent resolution stating the sense of Congress that China immediately release Rabiya Kadeer, her secretary and her son. On August 11, 1999 Ms. Kadeer was arrested on her way to a meeting with a group of Congressional staff visiting China under the auspices of a U.S. Information Agency program. Later, two of the sons and her secretary were detained as well. 
   One son has since been sentenced to 2 years at hard labor and her secretary, 3 years. And we have received credible reports that in the aftermath of the  Chinese New Year's celebrations, she herself faces imminent trial and sentencing. 
   The crimes she is accused of committing remain unclear, despite letters from a number of us on Capitol Hill, and despite a series of requests to Chinese officials stretching back to August. Our attempts at quiet diplomacy, perhaps unsurprisingly, have failed. And so, with her trial and sentencing about to take place, it is vital that we try a different tack. That is why I am offering this resolution. 
   Ms. Kadeer is a prominent member of an ethnic minority group in China called Uighurs. These people are Turkic-speaking Moslems, and they form the largest ethnic group in China's northwestern-most province. 
   A few years back, Ms. Kadeer was lauded by the PRC for her promotion of business enterprises among women and for contributing to the economic and social development of her province. To honor her efforts, she was named by authorities to the China People's Political Consultative Congress and as a delegate to the United Nations World Conference on Women held in Beijing. 
   But Ms. Kadeer began to fall out of favor with officials in Beijing after her husband emigrated to the United States in 1997 and became a commentator for Voice of America. Soon thereafter, her passport was seized and the assets of an organization she founded to improve opportunities for Moslem businesswomen were frozen. Then, in 1998, Ms. Kadeer lost her position in the Consultative Congress. 
   Perhaps that is why five of Ms. Kadeer's children, three sisters and a brother are now living in the United States, in addition to her husband. And perhaps that is why Ms. Kadeer has expressed a desire to move to the United States herself. 
   That desire, for the moment, has been quashed. Last summer, as she was on her way to the hotel where the Congressional staff delegation was waiting to meet her, Kadeer was arrested. The arrest is troubling enough, but the fact that it took place as she was attempting to have a simple conversation with staffers who work for the United States Congress, I believe, requires that we take a firm stand. 
   Let's not forget that the PRC signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1998. Among other things, that Covenant requires signatories to guarantee their citizens the right to liberty and freedom of movement; the right to presumption of innocence until guilt is proven; freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; freedom of opinion and expression; and freedom of assembly and association. It also forbids torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, and arbitrary arrest and detention. 
   In signing that Covenant on behalf of the PRC, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations said, and I quote, ``To realize human rights is the aspiration of all humanity. It is also a goal that the Chinese Government has long been striving for. We believe that the universality of human rights should be respected *.*.*.'' 
   Well, I don't think China has respected the human rights of Rabiya Kadeer, her son or her secretary. That's why this resolution calls on China to release them and give them the chance to move to the United States, if they wish. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and move for its earliest possible passage as Ms. Kadeer's fate will soon be determined by a country that offers her little or no chance of a fair trial.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased with the progress we have made in two very important areas on issues that will affect the lives of Americans everywhere. This legislation--the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999--will go a long way toward improving the quality of life for millions of Americans with disabilities. At the same time, important provisions within this legislation--provisions that extend important tax and trade relief provisions--will bring meaningful relief and increased opportunities to individuals and families. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act will help Americans with disabilities live richer, more productive lives. Its core purpose is to assist disabled individuals in returning to work. It removes the real risk many people with disabilities face of losing their health insurance, and it provides new ways of helping them find and keep meaningful employment. 
   Is there any question how important this is? 
   Millions of Americans with disabilities are waiting for the vote. They are waiting to be freed from a disability system that stifles initiative and thwarts productivity rather than rewarding them--a system that tells individuals with disabilities that if they leave their homes and try to find productive employment they will lose their access to health insurance. The current system isn't right, Mr. President. It isn't productive. And it certainly is not ennobling. 
   Under current law, if a person with a disability wants to return to work--even taking a job with modest earnings--he or she will jeopardize access to insurance coverage through the Medicaid and Medicare programs. And as many individuals with disabilities have difficulties securing private sector insurance coverage, losing access to Medicaid or Medicare is not an option. In fact, it's a tragic consequence for many people with medical conditions that demand ongoing treatment. As a result, the only recourse these individuals have is to forego the opportunity to work--to build and grow professionally and personally--and to stay at home. 
   No one, Mr. President, should be forced to choose between health care and employment. Robbing an individual of the opportunity to work becomes a double tragedy in the life of someone who is living with a disability. It's been said that work is the process by which dreams become realities. It is the process by which idle visions become dynamic achievements. Work spells the difference in the life of a man or woman. It stretches minds, utilizes skills and lifts us from mediocrity. 
   No one should have to choose between health care and work, and passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act will make that choice unnecessary. By acting on this legislation today, the Senate will offer new promise to millions of Americans with disabilities. This legislation will help promote their independence and personal growth. It will help restore confidence and meaning in their lives--and greater security in the lives of their families. 
   But this legislation is not about big government. We do not tell the states what they must do. There are no mandates. And we do not tell individuals with disabilities what they must do. We create options. We create choices. And choice is the essence of independence, isn't it? 
   The unemployment rate among working-age adults with severe disabilities is nearly 75 percent. What a tragic consequence of errant public policy that discourages those who can and want to work from attaining their desires. It's my firm belief that this 
   number will come down--it will come down dramatically as we pass this law allowing them to return to the workplace. My belief is based in part on the fact that over 300 groups of disability advocates, health care providers, and insurers endorse this change and are anxiously waiting for us to act. 
   These groups and individuals are not the only Americans watching what we do here today. Along with them, are countless other who are looking to this legislation to extend important tax and trade relief provisions that are included in the work incentives bill. 
   These provisions are ``must do'' business. Like appropriations, extenders are provisions that we have an obligation to address before we conclude this session. They are necessary fixes to our Tax Code, and will go a long way toward helping families and creating greater economic opportunity in our communities. 
   Among the important provisions contained in these extenders is one that excludes nonrefundable tax credits from the alternative minimum tax (``AMT''). This change alone will insure that middle-income families receive the benefits of the $500 per child tax credit, the HOPE Scholarship credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, the adoption credit, and the dependent care tax credit. In this legislation, such relief is extended through December 31, 2002. 
   Another important provision in this legislation extends and expands the tax credit for production of energy from wind and closed loop biomass. This important alternative energy provision expired on June 30, 1999. In this legislation, the tax credit is expanded to cover poultry litter-based biomass, and it is extended through December 31, 2001. For my home State of Delaware and many other poultry producing regions, this provision provides an important option for the disposition of poultry litter in a way that will be beneficial and productive. 
   Other important expiring tax provisions included in this legislation are a 5-year extension and enhancement of the research and development tax credit and the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance. I can't overstate how important the R&D credit is to the high-tech community and many other important leading American economic sectors. The extension offered in this legislation will give businesses the certainty they need and will result in more and higher paid jobs for American workers. And as far as employer-provided educational assistance, I've made it clear that my goal is to make this provision permanent and expand it to graduate education. I know this is an important goal for Senator MOYNIHAN as well. Over one million workers will benefit from this extension, and under this legislation, the provision is extended through the end of 2001 for undergraduate education. 
   But, Mr. President, important extenders do not stop here. This legislation will also extend incentives designed to help Americans move from welfare to work through the end of 2001. These incentives include the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare to work tax credit. 
   Other extenders include the active finance exception to Subpart F--a provision that puts our banks, insurance, and securities firms on equal footing with their foreign competitors in overseas markets--and five other important tax provisions that are scheduled to expire. These provisions, which are extended through the end of 2001, include the ``brownfields'' expansing treatment of environmental cleanup costs. In addition, the school repair and renovation costs of some school districts are met by an extension of the qualified zone academy bond program. 
   But the provisions included in this legislation are not limited to tax relief. We also include some important trade issues. For example, we extend the Generalized System of Preferences, as well as Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. Both of these trade provisions are extended through the end of 2001. Beyond these, there are several revenue raising provisions that we've included. Most of these, I am pleased to report, close loopholes in the Tax Code raising some $3 billion in return. 
   When all is said and done with this legislation, Mr. President, I am pleased that the tax relief in this bill amounts to a net tax of $15.8 billion over 5 years and $18.4 billion over 10.  
   There's no question that what have before us is a dynamic piece of legislation. From providing hope and opportunity to Americans with disabilities to extending and expanding important tax provisions for individuals and families, this is a comprehensive package. It has been carefully constructed, debated, and addressed in conference. It include that efforts of many of our colleagues and countless hours of staff work. 
   I want to thank several Senators who have worked closely with me over the past year to bring the work incentives bill to the floor--Senators MOYNIHAN, JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, and BUNNING. Passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act has been one of my top health care priorities during this Congress. It would have been impossible without close, productive, bipartisan cooperation. Likewise, the effort we've made to address the important tax and trade extenders. Without the work and cooperation of my distinguished friend and the Finance Committee's Ranking Democratic Member, Senator MOYNIHAN, we wouldn't be here today with a conference agreement. 
   In closing, let me also mention that there are two provisions in this bill outside the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, one dealing with the organ donor and the other dealing with a NOAA procurement matter. I ask my colleagues to join us in seeing that all of these important provisions are passed into law.

   In particular, let me thank Jon Resnick, Edwin Park, and David Podoff. And I would like to thank a former member of the Moynihan staff, Kristen Testa, who was there at the very beginning of this bill's legislative life and without whom there would not have been a Work Incentives Improvement Act. 
   I would also like to thank Pat Morrissey, Leah Menzies, and Lu Zeph of Senator JEFFORDS' office, and Connie Garner on Senator KENNEDY's staff. They have been tireless in their efforts on behalf of this legislation. Jennifer Baxendell and Alec Vachon from my staff worked tirelessly on this legislation and deserve special commendation. 
   Since this bill's inception, our staffs have worked together closely and well. I would like to thank you all for your dedication and hard work throughout all the many ups and downs this bill has faced. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to thank the dedicated professionals who worked so diligently to complete this year's tax legislation. First of all, I would like to thank my Finance team--Frank Polk, Joan Woodward, Mark Prater, Brig Pari, Tom Roesser, Bill Sweetnam, Jeff Kupfer, Ed McClellan, Ginny Flynn, Tara Bradshaw, Connie Foster and Myrtle Agent. I would also like to thank John Duncan and Bill Nixon from my personal staff for their commitment to seeing this process through to its successful completion. 
    I would also like to thank the members of Senator MOYNIHAN'S Finance staff who have helped make this a bipartisan effort--David Podoff, Russ Sullivan, Stan Fendley, Anita Horn, and Mitchell Kent. 
   It is also important to recognize the professionals of the Joint Committee on Taxation. In particular, I would like to thank Lindy Paull, Bernie Schmitt, Rick Grafmeyer, Carolyn Smith, Cecily Rock, Mary Schmitt, Greg Bailey, Tom Barthold, Ben Hartley, David Hering, Harold Hirsch, Laurie Matthews, Sam Olchyk, Oren Penn, Todd Simmens, Paul Schmidt, Mel Schwarz, and Barry Wold. 
   I would also like to thank Jim Fransen and Mark Mathiesen of the Senate's Legislative Counsel office who have the thankless job of turning tax policy into statute. 
   Finally, I would like to thank the Treasury's Office of Tax Policy. In particular, Linda Robertson, Jon Talisman and Joe Mikrut deserve special recognition for their help in this important legislation. 
   On this occasion I would also like to thank the staff who worked so hard on the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP reform provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations Act. They have worked incredibly long hours, with real dedication, to develop the strong, consensus product before the Senate today. In particular, let me thank Kathy Means, Teresa Houser, Mike  O'Grady, Jennifer Baxendell, and Alec Phillips on the Majority staff. 
   I would also like to thank Senator MOYNIHAN's staff for their cooperation and input. Let me thank Chuck Konigsberg, Liz Fowler, Edwin Park, Jon Resnick, Faye Drummond, Kyle Kinner, Dustin May, Julianne Fisher, Jewel Harper, and Doug Steiger. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I intend to support the consolidated appropriations package. This large legislative package--the result of hard work by many on both sides of the aisle--provides funding for a number of programs which are important and affect people in a direct way. This bill includes funding for programs under the D.C. Appropriations bill, the Interior Appropriations bill, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, and the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations bill. 
   In addition, incorporated in the legislation are other important measures, including the Satellite Competition and Consumer Protection Act, provisions important for dairy farmers in my State, the State Department Authorization bill, and our Medicare refinement plan. As with any product this large and with as many compromises which were necessary to move the process forward, there will be provisions with which one will disagree. 
   While this is certainly a substantial legislative undertaking, I would point out that nearly all of the matters contained in this package have previously been debated in full by the Senate and passed by wide margins. 
   Mr. President, I would like to highlight some provisions contained in this legislation for which I have advocated. This legislation will continue the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. 
   Earlier this month, my distinguished colleague on the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN, and I, stressed the importance of this program for our American workers during the debate on the Africa Trade bill. The Africa Trade bill passed by the Senate extended the authority for the TAA program which lapsed in June of this year. As time did not permit us to resolve our differences with the House on the trade package, we needed to insure that the benefits to workers displaced from their jobs as a result of trade activity be continued. I am very pleased that this provision is included in this package. 
   The package also includes the Satellite Copyright, Competition, and Consumer Protection Act. My State has over 30,000 households which depend on satellite dishes for their television programming and I have long advocated a modernization of the laws affecting satellite television programming. I am also pleased that an agreement was reached to have the Senate consider legislation which will facilitate satellite local to local service in small and rural markets, as this will be important to bring local programming to my constituents. 
   I have joined with my colleague from Delaware, JOE BIDEN, in sponsoring legislation to continue the important programs he has championed--the COPS program and the Violence Against Women Act. This measure provides funding for these programs. Also contained in the package is funding for the State Side program under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I had joined with our late colleague, Senator Chafee, in sponsoring legislation to provide these funds for the first time in several years to promote open space and recreation opportunities at the discretion of our State governments. 
   The package maintains the commitment we made with the passage of the Balanced Budget Act in 1997 to prioritize education. Since the passage of the 1997 bill, we have followed through with substantial increases in funding for our important education programs and have done so in a manner which promotes flexibility. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to discuss the Finance Committee's Medicare, Medicaid, & SCHIP Refinement Act of 1999, H.R. 3426. 
   A little more than two years ago Congress passed and the President signed into law the historic Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This important legislation has been instrumental in making possible the budget surpluses we are beginning to see materialize. 
   However, not all of the consequences of the Balanced Budget Act have been positive, and many of them were unintended. Two years of implementation allowed us to identify some areas, particularly related to Medicare provider reimbursement, that needed to be revisited. 
   The Finance Committee carefully monitored the impact of the Balanced Budget Act on various categories of health care providers. In fact, this year the Committee held a number of hearings on Medicare and Medicaid matters. 
   Throughout the course of these hearings, providers presented us with compelling testimony about significant fiscal and patient care-related problems that have resulted, unintentionally, from decisions the Congress made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.  
   Mr. President, let me be clear that we should be proud of the program improvements and the corresponding savings achieved through the Balanced Budget Act. We had no intention of fundamentally undoing that work. 
   However, there were problems that needed to be addressed to make sure we pay providers appropriately to meet the real health care needs of Medicare beneficiaries. At passage, the 1997 BBA reduced Medicare and Medicaid spending by nearly $120 billion. This package restores $27 billion over 10 years to address unintended consequences of the original law. 
   New provisions in this bill restore some $17 billion in funding over 10 years. Accordingly, in October, the Committee marked up and overwhelmingly passed a package of payment adjustments to fine tune the policies enacted through the Balanced Budget Act. This package was developed in a bipartisan manner with the close cooperation of Senator MOYNIHAN and his staff. 
   For the past several days, we have been working to reconcile this Finance Committee package with a similar bill passed by the House of Representatives last Friday. 
   The bill before us today represents an excellent compromise between the House and Senate bills, with input from the Administration. 
   The payment adjustments included in the House-Senate compromise package will benefit Medicare beneficiaries by improving payment to all sectors of the health care market place--including hospitals, physicians' offices, nursing facilities, community health centers, and home health care agencies, among many others. In addition, the package includes other technical adjustments to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   The provisions included in the package are consistent with a few basic goals I have tried to work toward from the beginning of this process. First, I felt that the overriding purpose of this package should be to address the most significant problems resulting from BBA policies. 
   In my view, larger Medicare reform continues to be an important objective. However, even the White House ultimately agreed this was neither the moment nor the legislative vehicle by which to pursue that goal. 
   The Senate Finance Committee will continue in its efforts to develop a bipartisan consensus on broader Medicare reform when we resume our work in January. That will be the time and place to consider lasting and far-reaching Medicare reforms. 
   Second, we sought to keep payment adjustments focused on areas in which we face demonstrated problems resulting from the Balanced Budget Act. Furthermore, we tired to make short-term adjustments in payment practices without revisiting the underlying policies set forth in the BBA. 
   Finally, it was particularly important to me not to let this become a partisan process. These are not partisan issues and I have tried to resist any effort to make them so. I am hopeful that this compromise can be supported by all Senators. 
   The provisions included in the package reflect the priorities of Senators on and off the Finance Committee. In addition, like all of you I have consulted extensively with my own constituents in Delaware, as well as with national health care and beneficiary organizations. They are strongly supportive. 
   Mr. President, the provisions included in this conference agreement make some significant contributions to protecting the care provided to seniors in nursing homes. We provide increased funding for medically complex patients and for rehabilitation services in nursing, homes, and we help these facilities' transition to the new payment systems required under the Balanced Budget Act. The Agreement also includes something I consider to be of vital importance to Medicare beneficiaries; we put a moratorium on the arbitrary annual dollar cap on the amount of rehabilitation therapy services a beneficiary could access. In addition, we mitigate the impact of scheduled reductions for home health agencies, increase funding and regional payment equity for teaching hospitals, and enhance programs for rural health care facilities. 
   The Conference Agreement also includes important protections for hospitals as the new outpatient prospective payment system goes into effect next year. I am especially pleased at the steps we have taken to stabilize the Medicare+Choice program, so that beneficiaries can count on Medicare health plan choices in the future. 
   Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to solve the problems that have been interfering with the ability of the provider community to make sure our constituents receive the high quality health care they deserve, without retreating from the important policy reforms enacted in the Balanced Budget Act. I ask all of you to join me in supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill now before the Senate, the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999. 
   Before I describe this bill, let me point out that this measure is a tribute to the late Senator John Chafee. This legislation was Senator Chafee's last child welfare initiative in the Finance Committee. As members know, the well being of the nation's youth, particularly the most disadvantaged, was very important to John. 
   This legislation will provide important assistance to the nation's foster care children. Each year about 20,000 teenagers must leave foster care because they have reached the age of 18. They are then left to their own devices, to make a life for themselves, often with no one to rely on for emotional and financial support. Not surprisingly, these young people are more likely to quit school, be unemployed, have children out of wedlock, and end up on welfare or in jail. 
   With this bill, we show that this country has not forgotten these young people. As parents, we do certainly not cut off our children at 18. Indeed, children in foster care have more need than most for a helping hand if they are to succeed in adulthood. It is simply common sense and good policy to make a small investment to ensure that these young people become productive taxpaying citizens who can make contributions to society. 
   The Foster Care Independence Act doubles the money available to the States for the independent living program, from $70 million to $140 million per year. This program helps young people make the transition from foster care to self-sufficiency. The bill expands the program by providing former foster children between 18 and 21 assistance in preparing for further education, planning a career, or training for a job. These programs also offer personal support through mentors, as well as financial assistance and housing. 
   This bill encourages, but does not require, States to provide Medicaid to young adults who have left foster care. The bill also increases the amount foster children may save and still be eligible for foster care. Such savings will help prepare these young people for the day when they will be on their own. 
   Lastly, the bill includes a number of reforms that will reduce fraud in the Supplemental Security Income program. The SSI program is on GAO's list of high risk programs. 
   A childhood spent in foster care is a big enough challenge. Let us help these children find a brighter future. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in the memory of John Chafee.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously supported this concurrent resolution. As the United States prepares for the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, it is important that Congress send this message--that electronic commerce should be free of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and of multiple and discriminatory taxation. At this time, I do want to make one clarification. 
   The resolution urges a permanent international ban on tariffs on electronic commerce. It is my understanding that, in this context, this phrase really urges a permanent international ban on tariffs on electronic transmissions. Electronic transmissions is a more exact phrase, which more clearly reflects the findings of this resolution and the current negotiating position of the United States.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there are a few brief observations that would serve us well as we engage in this debate over minimum wage. Through the years, members on both sides of this issue have been able to come together successfully, to effect minimum wage increases. 
   I believe we will be able to come together again, to advance a proposal that is good for individuals, as well as for economic growth and job creation. And I believe that in this effort it would be good to have such a common sense proposal follow the model of our actions in 1996. 
   As my colleagues know, three years ago we successfully enacted the Small  Business Tax Act, which provided reasonable tax relief for businesses most affected by the costs incurred with the minimum wage increase. The current minimum wage of $5.15--which took effect on September 1, 1997--was established in that act. Minimum wage agreements prior to 1997 followed a similar pattern of consensus building. 
   This year, as we again consider raising the minimum wage, there are a number of tax issues involved. The minimum wage amendment proposed by Senator DOMENICI includes a package of tax measures that were previously approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over these matters, and as these proposal had been previously vetted within our committee, I agreed to allow them to come straight to the floor. 
   On the other hand, I am concerned with the revenue offsets included in the minimum wage amendment proposed by Senator KENNEDY. Many of these provisions are controversial proposals which have been rejected by this Congress. And we need to be very careful as we proceed considering them. 
   What is important is that we progress on this important issue--that if we are unable to agree on a compromise in this session as we are so close to adjournment, we will be able to successfully conclude this matter soon after our return next year.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's amendment. I do so do for three reasons. First, there is no evidence that the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws have failed to deliver relief to injured industries. My colleague argues that the amendment is required to address the unfair trade practices facing the steel industry. I would have preferred not to have to revisit the many points that were made in the context of the debate over the steel quota legislation this past summer. This bill is about trade and investment with Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. I prefer we keep our focus there. That said, since my colleague's amendment has raised those issues before us yet again, I think it is important to remind my colleagues about the points that were made at length in this past summer's debate. 
   You may recall that, at the time, the steel industry and the steelworkers made the point that they faced a sudden surge of increased imports of steel and were sufficiently threatened that they sought to impose direct quotas on imports of various steel products. They argued that the existing import relief laws were inadequate to the task of addressing that surge. What the debate revealed was quite a different story. In fact, while imports into the United States did surge dramatically in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, they then dropped precipitously in response to the filing of a series of antidumping measures. Imports have continued that downward trend as a result of those unfair trade actions and the suspension agreements negotiated by the Commerce Department that effectively blocked any further imports of hot and cold rolled products from Russia and other countries engaged in below cost sales into the United States market. What lessons should we draw from that  experience? One is that the existing laws work exactly as they are intended. They provide an effective and efficient means of obtaining relief from unfairly dumped or subsidized imports. Indeed, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out in an article published in the midst of the steel industry's filing of dumping actions this past year, the mere filing of an unfair trade action under existing laws has a dramatic impact on prices. The article quoted Curtiss Barnette, the chief executive of Bethlehem Steel as acknowledging that trade cases had become a ``part of the Bethlehem's ``normal business-planning process,'' and acknowledging that, even where dumping actions failed, ``You have won some interim relief and you have said you're going to protect your rights.'' 
   Nicholas Tolerico, executive vice president of Thyssen, a Detroit-based steel processing and importing unit of a German steelmaker, made the point even more emphatically. He indicated that, among importers faced with the prospect of an antidumping action, ``the response is just to stop importing.'' The same holds true for foreign exporters faced with unfair trade complaints even when they eventually win cases. 
   The article quoted the chairman of Ispat International, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world to the effect that his company had cut exports to the United States from a wire-rod mill in Trinidad and Tobago by 40 percent simply due to the risk inherent in trade litigation even though Trinidad's steelmakers eventually won the case. Why is that the case? Some statistics might help here. 
   The reason that both exporters and importers of steel halt trade the minute a trade case is filed is because of the record compiled by U.S. industry. The Department of Commerce grants relief to the petitioning industry in over 90 percent of the cases filed under the antidumping and countervailing duty laws. Due to the deference that the Court of International Trade is obliged to pay to the Commerce Department's decisions under current law, the Department's decisions are upheld over 90 percent of the time. In other words, if you are an exporter of steel facing an unfair trade action in the United States, there is a 9 in 10 chance that you will face some considerable penalty. Given that steel is a commodity product, and microeconomic theory would dictate that all such products would be priced to the margin, you, as the foreign exporter, are likely to find yourself priced out of the competitive U.S. market with even a slight dumping our countervailing duty added onto the price of your current shipments. 
   Now, let's look at it from an importer's perspective. Let's say you are in the automobile industry in the United States, or one of the other steel consuming industries that employ more than 40 persons in the United States for every person employed in the steel industry here. In fact, let's say you are the plant manager for the Dodge Durango plant in Delaware and you are operating as efficiently as you possibly can to compete with your competition in the hotly contested market for sport utility vehicles. You operate on the basis of ``just in time'' delivery to ensure that you carry as little inventory as possible. You do that, in part, to reduce the associated costs and, in part, to take advantage of any change in prices for component parts that may help you compete in your market. That, however, can make you more vulnerable to price swings in the market for component parts. Then, suddenly, the steel industry files a series of dumping actions. Do you continue to import steel when you could be faced with a dramatic increase in price if the case succeeds? No. You stop importing from the targeted country or companies in order to reduce your risk. 
   The net result is that the cases filed before the Commerce Department begin to raise prices as soon as they are filed simply because the market is responding to the fact that the Commerce Department, 9 cases out of 10, is going to impose a significant penalty at the end of the day. Now, would the result be the same if these cases were litigated before the Federal courts, as my colleague's amendment would require? I strongly doubt that. The cases are complex, the facts frequently are in dispute, and the outcome less assured because of the nature of the litigation process. 
   Those who have spent time litigating in the Federal courts tell me that they do not quote odds on cases to their clients even on sure winners due solely to the risks of litigation. Those with experience litigating before Federal courts tell me that the likely result of a shift of jurisdiction from the administrative agencies to the courts would be a more intrusive review--without the deference the courts currently pay to Commerce Department decisions. 
   The net result would be greater uncertainty as to the result in these cases, which, for the steel industry, would ultimately spell a less reliable outcome than they currently achieve before the administrative agencies. 
   In short, the dumping and countervailing duty laws appear to be working as designed and the change suggested by my colleague would simply increase the uncertainty of the outcome from the steel industry's perspective. Second, there is no evidence that shifting the burden of investigating foreign unfair trade practices to the courts would in any way enhance the prospect for prompt relief. At hearings earlier this year before the Finance Committee, those who have litigated under the ``rocket docket'' at the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission have complained about the fact that they do not get relief as promptly as they like. But, no one suggested that a shift of jurisdiction to the courts would some how improve the situation. Given the record of the courts in handling complex economic litigation in other areas, it is not clear to me that shifting the burden of the initial investigation to the courts, with any allowance at all for the normal process of discovery between private litigants, would provide a benefit to the petitioning industry in these cases. 
   While both petitioners and respondents complain about their treatment before the administrative agencies, largely due to what they consider to be the arbitrary basis for their decisions, both sides to the litigation seem to agree that the cases themselves are completed as rapidly as possible. That not only helps provide relief to the petitioning industry on as timely a basis as practical, it also has the significant benefit of deciding the issue for the rest of the players in the marketplace. What that really does is reduce the uncertainty in the market that the filing of the case creates. So the plant manager at the Dodge Durango facility in Delaware can rely on decisions in making his own assessment of who to purchase steel from for the coming production run. 
   Finally, let me say that my colleague's proposal may simply be ahead of its time. What it suggests is something akin to an antitrust remedy--in other words, litigation between private parties that reduces the Government's role in the process. I personally think that there would be real merit to examining that sort of proposal in the Finance Committee in the future. And I would welcome the opportunity to do so rather than forcing a vote on the proposal today. The reason I say that the proposal may be ahead of its time is that an antitrust remedy is relevant when the actions involved are solely those of private parties. That is not the case with most foreign unfair trade practices today. Even dumping is not solely a function of private pricing decisions by foreign producers. As long as governments continue to distort markets, whether through high import tariffs on U.S. steel exports or heavy subsidies to their own domestic producers, prices in the marketplace for products like steel will not equilibrate based solely on private actions. 
   Thus, for example, dumping is often the result of a country maintaining a closed market in which its companies can maintain a relatively high profit margin, which effectively allows those producers to cross-subsidize their exports to the United States. A private right of action does not reach that conduct. That is conduct that the United States must address at its root--which is the government-induced distortion of the market, rather than the private pricing decisions of the foreign producers. 
   What that means for the propose shift of the jurisdiction to the Federal courts proposed by my distinguished colleague's amendment is that it is premature. Neither he nor I would suggest that the steel industry's current  conditions are shaped solely by private pricing decisions. In fact, the principal problem facing the steel industry is the global overcapacity created by government protection of their home markets and subsidization of their exports to our shores. I therefore, ask my colleague to withdraw his amendment in order that the Finance Committee could take a look at the proposal and explore the ramifications of the far-sighted suggestions in greater depth. Failing that, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose my colleague's amendment. 
   I do so because this amendment will undermine the very objectives this legislation is trying to further. In essence, this amendment says that if a country has managed to do well in that desperately poor and politically unstable region, its access to our market will be cut dramatically. I can't imagine a more damaging or more ironic signal to send. 
   Let me be a little more specific about my concerns. The purpose of this legislation is to use tariff preferences to spur investment in the sub-Saharan African countries. That investment will help create economic growth and create jobs in a region that has suffered so terribly for so long. 
   My colleague's amendment, however, would tell the Africans to watch out if they start succeeding, because their access to our market will be taken. It is an ironic signal to send. 
   While the signal that it will send to the Africans is unfortunate, the signal it will send to investors is particularly damaging. 
   Let me explain. This legislation is designed to encourage increased investment in the sub-Saharan region. This amendment would undermine that objective by telling investors that they cannot count on the market access that this legislation provides over the long term. As an investor, nothing is more troubling than uncertainty. When investors cannot count on what the future will hold in terms of market access, then they will avoid the region. 
   Given the political and economic uncertainties that already exist in that region--and given the disincentives that this creates for investors--adding more uncertainty through this amendment would be particularly cruel. 
   This amendment also ignores the fact that trade among the African countries themselves is vital to their economic future and to the effectiveness of this legislation. The rules of origin in my legislation are specifically designed to encourage the Africans to enter into economic partnership amongst themselves. 
   Such partnering is particularly important among these nations because they each have different resources and capabilities. We should, therefore, encourage each of these countries to take advantage of their comparative advantage. 
   My colleague's amendment, however, would selectively exclude certain countries in that region. This, unfortunately, will undermine the process of economic integration and partnering among the African nations that is vital to sound economic development in that region. 
   This amendment seems to suggest that the economic growth of the sub-Saharan region must rely exclusively on trade with the United States. While we would all like to think that that is enough to spur growth and investment in that region, we all know that it is not. 
   For these reasons, I oppose this amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. These comments I will now make are in connection with the Wellstone amendment No. 2487. 
   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Wellstone amendment No. 2487. This amendment is very similar to one we tabled yesterday, and should be tabled today for similar reasons. 
   This amendment denies benefits until the U.S. Secretaries of Labor and State determine that the beneficiary country is enforcing internationally recognized human rights. In and of itself, this is unnecessary and duplicative. The managers substitute already contains criteria that the President must take into account in determining a beneficiary country's eligibility that includes the internationally agreed upon core labor standards. 
   I will address later in my statement the concern of the Senator from Minnesota as to the use of these criteria. 
   But this amendment goes further. It would force beneficiary countries to guarantee that the head of the national labor agency of that country, the U.S. Secretary of Labor, and an international union bureaucrat have access to all the private business information and records of all business enterprises in that country. 
   This undermines the sovereignty of these nations, and represents an intrusion on the privacy of their small businesses. The practical effect would be  that no country would ever allow an international union head to peek into the business dealings of all of their citizens. These countries simply would not choose to enjoy the trade benefits offered in this bill--and rightly so. 
   This amendment would also create an unprecedented private cause of action in U.S. courts if a U.S. citizen wants to seek compliance by those countries with the labor standards. This would invite unnecessary, wasteful litigation, and would create novel discovery activities by U.S. courts, to say the least. 
   To sum up, the provisions of this amendment would simply eviscerate the goals of this bill and is nothing more than protectionism by another name. The labor standards in the managers' substitute and the flexibility given to the President provide an appropriate means for regular dialog with the beneficiary countries on labor issues. 
   Let me be clear that the labor standards in the managers' substitute--and which are reflected in current law--are effective. As my colleague may know, CBI benefits are linked to a country's eligibility for the GSP program. If a country violates one of the requirements of the GSP program by, for example, failing to afford workers internationally recognized workers' rights, then that country will lose eligibility for both GSP and the CBI program. 
   The labor standards under the GSP program are not meaningless. In fact, 11 countries have been suspended from GSP benefits since 1985 for labor standard violations. Six countries are currently suspended. What this should tell us is that the system works, both under GSP and under my legislation for the CBI countries. 
   As evidence of the effectiveness of these criteria, I cite a June 1998 GAO report that concluded that the GSP and CBI programs have led to improvements of workers' rights in the beneficiary countries. 
   This is not the only evidence, however. In fact, the best way to tell whether the management's amendment presents an effective approach to the protection of labor standards is by asking those most affected: namely, the workers. I have with me a list of the labor unions in the Caribbean and Central America who endorse my approach on this issue. These leaders understand that the manager's amendment provides an effective way to protect workers, while at the same time spurring investment and economic growth that creates jobs.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's amendment. I do so because there is no evidence that the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws have failed to deliver relief to injured industries. Indeed, it is not clear to me that shifting the burden of the initial investigation to the courts, with any allowance at all for the normal process of discovery between private litigants, would help the petitioning industry in these cases. 
   While both petitioners and respondents complain about their treatment before the administrative agencies, largely due to what they consider to be the arbitrary basis for their decisions, both sides to the litigation seem to agree that the cases themselves are completed as rapidly as possible. They also agree that the current system provides more certainty and predictability. 
   Given that, I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the implications of shifting these cases to the Federal courts. While the system is not perfect, the fact is that petitioners have been very successful in these cases. Moreover, the system is surprisingly quick and responsive, given the complexity of these cases. Anybody who has spent years before the Federal courts in a complex commercial matter can tell you that the current system of litigation of unfair trade cases administratively is quite rapid. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to table the amendment. No such change, as proposed by this amendment, should be adopted without thorough study on the part of the appropriate committee. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this rollcall vote and future rollcalls in this series be limited to 10 minutes.

   Let me underscore and emphasize that we would not be where we are if it had not been for my good friend, Senator MOYNIHAN. His patience, his historical perspective on trade, and the key role he has played through the years were instrumental in getting this legislation through. I want to say I think it gives a clear statement to our neighbors in the Caribbean, Central America, and Africa that we are willing to invest in a long-term economic relationship--a relationship of partners and a common endeavor of expanding trade, enhancing economic growth, and improving living standards. 
   I also think, most importantly, it will send a very clear signal to our partners around the world that isolationism is dead, that liberal trade policies are still supported overwhelmingly. It signals, I believe, that the United States is prepared to engage constructively in the wider world around us and to provide the kind of leadership necessary to reach our common goals.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Delaware bankruptcy court has come to fully understand the old adage that ``the reward for a job well done is more work''. Long recognized as one of the nation's quickest, most innovative and fairest, The Delaware corporate bankruptcy court's caseload has grown to the point that at least one additional judge is necessary. I want to commend a number of my congressional colleagues for joining with me to address this situation. 
   Yesterday, Senator GRASSLEY and Representative GEKAS held a joint hearing on the need for additional bankruptcy judges. Representative MIKE CASTLE was among those who testified at this hearing, and I understand he eloquently elaborated on Delaware's status as the busiest bankruptcy venue per judge in the nation. 
   Simply put, more capable judges are needed to tend to corporate bankruptcy cases in Delaware and a select number of other states. Realizing this, Senator PAUL COVERDELL has introduced S. 1830, to provide for the appointment of additional temporary bankruptcy judges. I, along with Senator BIDEN and a number of other Senators, have cosponsored this vital proposal. 
   I commend my fellow sponsors of this legislation as well as the chairmen of the subcommittees of jurisdiction for holding yesterday's hearing. I look forward to working with them on this important matter in the future.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support for the cloture motion. The vote reflects the strong bipartisan support for the bill. 
   I also want to extend my thanks to the distinguished majority and minority leaders, who worked so hard to find the compromise that would allow the bill to move forward. 
   Due to their hard work, we have the opportunity to send a clear statement to our neighbors in the Caribbean, Central America, and Africa that we are willing to invest in a long-term economic relationship--a relationship of partners in a common endeavor of expanding trade, enhancing economic growth, and improving living standards. 
   Most importantly, this bill will also send a clear signal to our trading partners around the world who will join us shortly in Seattle for the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization. It signals that the United States is prepared to engage constructively in the wider world around us and to provide the leadership necessary to achieve our common goals. 
   Most importantly, the bill means we will fulfill our commitment to the American workers and firms that will benefit from this bill--a commitment that means $8.8 billion in new sales and an increase of 121,000 jobs over the course of the next 5 years in the U.S. textile industry alone. 
   As I have emphasized again and again in this debate, this is not a bill that is good just for our neighbors in the Caribbean and Central America or our partners in Africa. This is a bill that is good for our workers here at home as well. It is a ``win-win'' situation economically for American workers and our friends abroad. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues over these coming hours to fashion a still stronger bill that would further those goals. 
   Let me emphasize once more the strong bipartisan support reflected in the vote just taken. The motion for cloture carried by a vote of 74-23. I urge my colleagues to move as expeditiously as we can because time is limited. As we all know, the Congress is coming to the end of the current session and we want to make sure everybody has the opportunity to bring forward their amendments. It is important we do so in a fashion to expeditiously conclude action on this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Hollings amendment for two reasons. 
   First, as I have stated previously, the goal of this legislation is to encourage investments in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. The amendment would undermine that effort by requiring the difficult negotiations of side agreements which would delay the incentive the bill would create. That, I argue, is of no help to these developing countries and will not lead to any greater improvement in the labor standards provisions that are already incorporated into these programs. Virtually every study available indicates that labor standards rise with a country's level of economic development. 
   The goal of the bill is to give these countries an opportunity to tap private investment capital as a means of encouraging economic development and economic growth. That is the most certain way to ensure these countries have the ability to enforce any labor standards they choose to enact into law. 
   Frankly, the worst opponent of labor standards is the lack of economic opportunities in these countries. It is difficult to insist on safe working conditions on the job and negotiate a living wage when you have no other job opportunities. The point of this legislation is to provide those job opportunities. Creating obstacles to that goal will diminish, not enhance, the positive impact the bill would have on labor standards. 
   The second reason I oppose the amendment is that it essentially depends on economic sanctions to work. The threat is that the economic benefits of the beneficiary countries will be cut off if the countries do not comply with the terms of some agreement yet to be negotiated. That not only undercuts the investment incentive by increasing the uncertainty of a country's participation in the program; it also does little to raise labor standards. 
   What is needed is a cooperative approach bilaterally between the United States and the particular developing country and among the countries of the region as a whole. 
   The lesson of the NAFTA side agreement, in my view, is that sanction mechanisms have done little to encourage better labor practices. What has worked under the NAFTA agreement is the cooperative ventures of the three participants. What is needed in the context of both regions targeted by this bill is a stronger effort among the participants, with the support of the United States, to tackle common problems facing their strongest resource--their workforce. 
   The Senate substitute before us does not preclude those sorts of constructive efforts by the President. Indeed, the President would do well to pursue a similar model in the context of our broader relations with our African, Caribbean, and Central American neighbors. The model offered by the pending amendment would not, in my judgment, help that goal. 
   I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. At the appropriate time, I will make a motion to table the amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Hollings amendment No. 2483 and I do so for two reasons. First, as I have stated previously, the goal of this legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. The amendment undermines that effort by requiring the difficult negotiation of side agreements on both labor and the environment that delays the incentive that the bill is intended to create. This is bad for labor and environmental conditions in the beneficiary countries as well as their economies. 
   The available research suggests labor and environmental standards rise with a country's level of economic development. This is because for countries that are on the edge of famine, enforcing labor standards and protecting the environment are a luxury. The Finance Committee bill helps economically and in improving labor and environmental standards by giving these countries an opportunity to tap private investment capital as a means of encouraging economic development and economic growth. That is a most certain way to ensure that these countries have the wherewithal to pay for environmental protection. 
   The second reason I will oppose the amendment is that it essentially depends on economic sanctions to work. It threatens to cut off a series of economic benefits if the countries do not comply with the terms of some agreement yet to be negotiated. That not only undercuts the investment incentive by increasing the uncertainty of a country's participation in the program, it also does little to raise labor and environmental standards. As we have heard during the extended debate we have had on economic sanctions in the past, they do, actually, little to affect the behavior of the target country. Indeed, in the case of the intended beneficiaries of these tariff preference programs, they would have the opposite effect on labor and environmental protections by discouraging investment in economic growth. 
   What is needed, as I said earlier, is a cooperative approach, bilaterally between the United States and the particular developing country and among the countries of the regions as a whole. The experience under the NAFTA side agreement reinforces my point. The sanctions mechanisms have done little to encourage better labor and environmental practices. What has worked under the NAFTA agreement is the cooperative ventures of the three participants on both the labor and the environmental front. The NAFTA Commission on Environmental Cooperation, for example, advises all three countries on how to tackle common environmental problems. That advice has helped ensure coordination rather than conflict among the NAFTA partners over environmental issues. 
   The Senate substitute before us does not preclude these sorts of constructive efforts by the President. Indeed, the President would do well to pursue a similar model in the context of our broader relations with our African, Caribbean, and Central American neighbors. The model offered by the pending amendment would not help us towards that goal. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-roth-de-6-19991102</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose this Hollings amendment for three reasons. 
   The first reason, as I have stated previously, is that the purpose of this legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America by offering these poverty-stricken countries a measure of preferential access to our market. The amendment would undermine the effort by making eligibility explicitly dependent on the offer of reciprocal benefits to the United States equivalent to those to which the United States is entitled under NAFTA. 
   The underlying requirements of the African-CBI provisions of the Finance Committee's substitute do encourage the beneficiary countries to remove barriers to trade. The existing requirements also impose an affirmative obligation to avoid discrimination against U.S. products in the beneficiary country's trade. What the Finance Committee substitute does not require is market access equivalent to that of NAFTA, a standard that even the WTO members among these beneficiary countries could not currently satisfy. 
   The second reason I oppose the amendment is that the Finance Committee already instructs the President to begin the process of negotiating with the beneficiary country under both programs for trade agreements that would provide reciprocal market access to the United States as well as a still more solid foundation with a long-term economic relationship between the United States and its African, Caribbean, and Central American neighbors. 
   Under the Africa provisions of the bill, the President is instructed to assess the prospects for such agreement and is called on to establish a regional economic forum. That forum could prove instrumental in solving market access problems that U.S. firms may face currently as well as a forum for any eventual negotiation. 
   Under the CBI provisions of the bill, the Finance Committee sought to encourage our Caribbean-Central American trading partners to join with us in pressing for the early conclusion and implementation of the free trade agreements of the Americas. Each of the beneficiary countries of the CBI program has played an active and constructive role in those talks today. 
   In both Africa and the CBI, we are making progress in opening markets and eliminating barriers to United States trade. The fact that we do not currently enjoy precisely those benefits offered by Canada and Mexico in  the context of the NAFTA is no bar to action here. 
   Finally, the bill does encourage reciprocity where it really counts in the context of this bill. By encouraging the use of U.S. fabric and U.S. yarn in the assembly of apparel products bound for the United States, the bill establishes a solid economic partnership between industry and the United States and firms in the beneficiary country. That provides real benefits to American firms and workers in the textile industry by establishing the platform by which American textile makers can compete worldwide. That is precisely the benefit our industry most seeks in the context of our growing economic relationship with both regions. 
   In short, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to move to table the following amendments with one show 
   of seconds. The amendments are: Hollings No. 2379, Feingold No. 2428, Hollings No. 2483, and Hollings No. 2485. I further ask unanimous consent that these votes occur in a stacked sequence beginning at 3:45, with the time between now and then equally divided in the usual form; there be no other amendments in order prior to the votes; there be 4 minutes equally divided just before each vote; and the votes occur in the order in which the amendments were called up.

<DOCNO>106-roth-de-20-19991102</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator FEINGOLD's amendment which incorporates provisions of S. 1636, the HOPE for Africa Act. 
   Frankly, this legislation would be better described as the ``No Growth and No Opportunity Act.'' Even a cursory reading of the provisions reflect an intent to throttle any form of productive investment in Africa. Rather than offering the nations of sub-Saharan Africa the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty on their own terms, this bill says Africa will have to do so on our terms or not at all. 
   Let me explain why. 
   The sponsors of the bill have made two principal arguments on its behalf: First, that it would expand trade; second, that it would yield responsible investment in Africa. In fact, the bill would have the opposite effect on both counts. The bill would actually impose greater restrictions on trade with Africa than would currently be the case and would actively discourage any form of private investment. 
   For example, under the current GSP program, the rules require that products from beneficiary countries must contain 35-percent value added for the beneficiary country to qualify; and the HOPE for Africa bill would raise that to 60 percent, which would effectively end any prospects for firms in African countries that hope to enter into production-sharing arrangements for the assembly of products in Africa. 
   Current law does not impose any requirement that all employees of an enterprise be from the beneficiary country for the company's product to qualify. But the HOPE for Africa bill would dictate that 90 percent of the employees of any enterprise producing textile and apparel goods must be citizens of beneficiary countries. In other words, no legal residents or immigrants would be employed in these plants above a certain set limit. 
   How, I wonder, would the U.S. Customs Service enforce these provisions? Would U.S. Customs have to investigate and certify every plant in advance? Would Customs have to require reports on all new hires by the individual enterprise? Or would Customs have to be involved in the individual firm's hiring decisions from the start in order to be sure the firm was precisely at 90-percent employment from beneficiary countries? 
   In short, the amendment does exactly the opposite of what it purports to do. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to table the amendment. I do so for two reasons. First, as I have stated previously, the goal of this legislation is to encourage investment in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America. This amendment would undermine that effort by requiring the difficult negotiations of side agreements that would delay the incentive the bill would create. That, I argue, is of no help to these developing countries and will not lead to any great improvement in their labor standards. 
   The second reason I oppose the amendment is that it essentially depends on economic sanctions to work. Its threat is that the economic benefits of the beneficiary countries will be cut off if the countries do not comply with the terms of some agreement yet to be negotiated. That not only undercuts the investment incentive by increasing the uncertainty of a country's participation in the program, but it also does little to raise labor standards. For that reason, I urge this amendment be tabled.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and ask that it be tabled. 
   First, the Finance Committee bill already contains the specifically enhanced transshipment provisions beyond those contained in the House bill. The Finance Committee bill would suspend exporters and importers from the benefits of the program for 2 years if found to have transshipped in violation of the rule. 
   Second, the Customs Service already has extensive power to combat transshipment. Let me be clear what transshipment is. It is Customs law. Customs already has the enforcement power to address these concerns. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining votes in this series be limited to 10 minutes in length.

That is precisely the benefit our industry most seeks in the context of our growing economic relationship with both regions. 
   In short, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Support Miscellaneous Amendments of 1999. This legislation is co-sponsored by Senators MOYNIHAN, VOINOVICH, FEINSTEIN, ROBERTS, BOXER, ENZI, THOMAS, GRAMM, and KERREY. 
   This bill would provide a more appropriate penalty for States that have not met the deadline for establishing a State Disbursement Unit (SDU). The 1996 welfare reform law (P. L. 104-193) made a number of important changes to the nation's child support system, including a requirement that States establish and operate a State Disbursement Unit (SDU) to receive child support payments and distribute the money in accord with State child support distribution rules. In general, States had until October 1st of this year to establish an SDU. 
   States that have not met this deadline will lose all Federal funds for the administration of their child support enforcement programs, and also may be in jeopardy of losing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. 
   Although most States have met the deadline, for various reasons about seven States may not. This bill provides that States may apply for an alternative smaller, graduated penalty, as described in the ``Description of the Child Support Miscellaneous Amendments of 1999.'' 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-roth-de-2-19991102</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Moreover, this legislation provides that any penalty will be waived if a State establishes an SDU within six months of the original deadline, that is, by April 1, 2000. If a State misses the April 1st date but establishes an SDU within a year of the deadline, that is, by September 30, 2000, the penalty shall be limited to one percent of child support funds for the fiscal year. 
   Mr. President, in my view this alternative penalty system is more suitable for technology-related program requirements, where States may be moving towards compliance but need additional time. Indeed, the proposed legislation follows similar changes made last year in providing an alternative penalty for States that did not meet the deadline for establishing an automated statewide data system for child support. In this regard, the proposed legislation would provide for a single penalty for a State that does not meet either the automated data system or SDU requirements. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has found this legislation has no cost. 
   I urge the support of all Senators.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I rise one last time to implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the motion to invoke cloture. Frankly, it would be unconscionable to block progress on a bill that enjoys the support of at least 80 Senators from both sides of the aisle. It would be unconscionable to block progress on what the President has described as one of the most significant initiatives of his presidency. It would be unconscionable to block progress on a bill that enjoys the support of the vast majority of political, civic and religious leaders in this country and the support of each of the nations that would benefit from its passage. 
   But, most importantly, it would be unconscionable to block progress on a bill that would create 121,000 jobs in the American textile industry over the next 5 years. I have emphasized again and again in this debate that this is not a bill that is good just for our neighbors in the Caribbean and Central America or our partners in Africa. This is a bill that is good for our workers here at home! 
   Let me remind my colleagues that it is no benefit to workers in the textile industry if you raise the minimum wage when they don't have a job. It is of no use to American textile workers if you debate mergers and acquisitions in the agribusiness sector if we do not open markets for their products. It is of no use to the American textile workers if we debate, yet again, reform of campaign finance laws when they headed for the unemployment line. 
   I was not elected by my constituents in Delaware to look out for the short-term political advantage. I was not elected by my constituents in Delaware to win debating points and I have never sought the floor for that purpose. 
   I have drafted a bill here that is a benefit to workers and industry here in the United States, as well as neighbors in the Caribbean, Central America, and Africa. It is a ``win-win'' situation economically for American workers and our friends abroad. 
   The bill is also a victory for an outward looking foreign policy. It is a statement about American leadership in an age that cries out for us to lead in positive ways that ensure peace and stability around the world. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that no state in Africa or the Caribbean or Central America is politically stable if people cannot feed themselves! 
   In recent weeks, I have heard an unending cavalcade of criticism about the Senate's vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Isolationists!  That's what the opponents of this bill called those of us who thought more about our national security than we thought of our political expediency. 
   Where are those voices now? Where is the one or two voices that would argue now for an outward looking foreign policy agenda? Where are those one or two votes in favor of engagement with the world, rather than a sterile debate about senatorial privileges? 
   This is not a debate about the minority party's rights. This is a tyranny of the small minority on each side of the aisle that wants to kill this bill. We must see our way clear to a vote against partisanship. We must rise above the parochial and focus on our national interest and the world around us. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that this bill enjoys the support of one of the strongest bipartisan majorities I have seen in the Senate. The cloture vote on the motion to proceed was 90-8. 
   This is a measure that the distinguished minority leader himself initiated in 1994. This is a measure that the distinguished majority leader has fought for and made room for at a time on the legislative calendar when the hours are precious. This is a measure that the President has indicated in his State of the Union Address is at the top of his agenda. 
   This bill has the support of the strongest coalition of political, civic, and religious leaders of any measure I have seen in years. 
   That said, I want to give credit where credit is due. Those who want to kill this bill--those who have appeared so frequently on the floor of the Senate this week to talk about anything but this bill--have done a masterful job. 
   Does it strike anyone as an odd coincidence that Time magazine runs an article during the week of this debate that suggests that this bill, which would do so much for both Africa and the Caribbean and for workers in the United States, is the work of a single company? Does it strike anyone as an odd coincidence that someone named John Burgess in the Washington Post, who erroneously reported last week that Nelson Mandela opposed this legislation, regurgitates that Time magazine article in this morning's edition of the Post? 
   Those articles ignore the bipartisan push that has brought this bill to the floor of the Senate. A bipartisan push in the House of Representatives led by the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee. And, the strong bipartisan push in the Senate as well. 
   My friends, each day this week, the Ambassadors of the 47 African countries that would benefit from this bill have watched this debate from the Senate gallery. Each day this week, members of the American public have looked on as we discussed our privileges, rather than their business. They have read the misreporting of the bill in the popular press. They have seen the pleas of the President to vindicate his foreign policy initiatives in Africa and the Caribbean go unheeded as the discussion of process, rather than substance, has dragged on. 
   The real question before us is whether we can look up into the Senate gallery and look those people in the eye if we fail to move this bill. There will be a time to debate an increase in the minimum wage. There will be a time to debate consolidation in the food processing industry. 
   There will be--and there has been--ample time devoted to the issue of campaign finance reform. A vote for cloture does not preclude that debate. 
   What would it do? It would leave us with a solid bill that is good for Africa and the Caribbean and good for the United States. It would also leave us with another two days to debate the merits of this bill and offer any germane amendments that would improve the legislation before us. 
   What is wrong with that? What is wrong with sticking to the subject at hand and getting our job done? 
   I implore my colleagues to vote for cloture on this bill. I implore my colleagues to vote in favor of an open engagement with the world around us, rather than a fearful isolationism that hides behind protective walls. I implore my colleagues to support this initiative with a vote in favor of the motion before us. 
   Make your stand here. Vote for the motion. 
   Thank you. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. What kind of signal are we giving to the rest of the world? People are talking about isolationism. What does this vote represent? Does it mean we can't act effectively when the welfare of thousands of people both here and abroad is at stake? I say to my distinguished colleague and ranking member of the Finance Committee, for whom I have the greatest respect, that we will not consider this to be a dead issue.

   Mr. ROTH. We shall continue to fight and assure that the opportunity arises for this Senate to take appropriate action, to have the opportunity to vote on this important matter. I lament we have spent more than a week of debate on this bill. We are ready to deal with the subject matter of this bill and relevant amendments. The vote, to be candid, is a victory for the few who oppose the bill and a vote against the interests of American workers who would benefit from this bill. 
   I regret it, as I said before, because this vote blocks progress--progress by the House, which passed this bill with a strong bipartisan majority. This vote blocks progress by the President, and this was one of his most important initiatives. This vote blocks progress by the Senate, which I know enjoys the support of strong majorities, as I have already said, on both sides of the aisle. Most importantly, this vote blocks progress that would mean new markets. I can't emphasize that too much. It would mean new markets for the American textile industry. It creates approximately 121,000 new jobs. It would have meant roughly $8.8 billion in enhanced business for the industry. 
   I deeply regret the effort to say this is just the result of campaign contributions, or whatever. Nothing could be further from the truth. I don't know whether or not we have upstairs now the Ambassadors of the 47 countries in Africa who would have benefited. They have been here day in and day out watching the developments; they are concerned about this legislation, which held out promise and hopes for them. As I said, this legislation is critically important because it promised jobs here at home. It promised the opportunity for the textile industry to better keep competitive in the local market. But not only here, I say to my distinguished friend from New York, isn't it true it would also help develop markets abroad?

   Mr. ROTH. Senator MOYNIHAN and I will continue to fight for the benefits of this bill that extends to American workers and American industry. We will continue to resist the instincts of some who have fought to maintain protective walls and isolate America from the outside world. 
   The thing that bothers me so much is that in addition to the negative impact it has on this industry and on American workers, it sends the wrong signal just as we are on the verge of a multilateral meeting in Seattle--a historic occasion that would enable us to provide the kind of leadership that is needed if we are to continue the direction of liberal trade policy. 
   Yesterday, Senator MOYNIHAN pointed out so eloquently how liberal trade policies from way back in the 1930s have benefited this country, have benefited American workers, and, indeed, have benefited the entire world. We cannot turn our backs on this record. 
   We shall continue to fight and seek the opportunity to move forward.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN, in discussing Senate passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. 
   The bill the Senate passed today is a consensus package of extensions of expiring tax provisions, known as ``extenders.'' Working together, Senator MOYNIHAN and I produced a package that was reported out of the Finance Committee unanimously. 
   In order to get a package that could be approved by unanimous consent, we had to achieve a fair compromise. Every Member would probably differ in the way he or she would write an extenders bill. 
   Fortunately, Members of the Senate realize the importance of addressing these expiring provisions. The evidence of that importance is demonstrated by the unanimous consent agreement for passage that we entered into today. 
   The most important of the expiring provisions, as Senator MOYNIHAN noted, is the exclusion of nonrefundable tax credits from the alternative minimum taxes (``AMT''). The Finance Committee bill insures that middle income families will receive the benefits of the $500 per child tax credit, HOPE Scholarship credit, Lifetime Learning credit, adoption credit, and dependent care tax credit. This relief is extended through December 31, 2000. 
   There are other important expiring tax provisions the Finance Committee bill addresses. Included is the research and development (``R&D'') tax credit, the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance, the work opportunity tax credit, the welfare-to-work tax credit, the active finance exception to Subpart F, and the extension and modification of the tax credit for production of electricity from wind and biomass, including poultry waste. There are several other important extenders in this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I urge the House to pass its extenders bill. We will then proceed to a conference and work out the differences between the two bills. It is important that we work quickly and produce a conference agreement that addresses these important matters.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to address some of the statements made about the process unfolding, allegations that the majority leader has tied up the process. 
   The truth is, we have strong bipartisan support for this legislation. The majority leader has tried to protect the 80 or 90 Senators who support the bill to make sure we focus on the merits of the bill and not on extraneous issues that are calculated to block progress. 
   My friend and Finance Committee colleague, Senator CONRAD, indicated, for example, he wants to raise some amendments on agriculture negotiating objectives and trade adjustment assistance, and these amendments are relevant and should be debated. They could be, if our friends on both sides reach agreement to work together to table nontrade amendments. That is what we should be about. 
   Let's work together on this and begin to focus on our efforts on the bill. Let's not concede the debate to the opponents because of their procedural tactics. Let's focus on getting this bill acted upon, which is good for America as well as the CBI. 
   Time is running out. I think it is critically important that we bring about a process where we can move forward on this most critical piece of legislation. What concerns me is it is time sensitive. 
   For example, GSP has already expired. That not only works against the interests of the Third World developing countries we are trying to help, but it works against the best interests of American companies that depend on this source of supply for their material. 
   Yesterday, the distinguished ranking minority leader of the Senate Finance Committee made a very eloquent statement about the importance of trade adjustment to the workers who are dependent upon it. Let me emphasize, these are American workers--about 200,000.

   Mr. ROTH. Let me say to my distinguished friend, many years ago when the legendary Russell Long was chairman of our committee, the TAA was about to expire and no one was trying to save it. The chairman was about to rap the gavel to move on to other things. I said: Just a minute, sir. We have a commitment. 
   That is exactly what the Senator is claiming now. I am proud and pleased to say the legislation was continued. 
   It is a matter of significant concern to thousands of American workers and their families who are depending upon it. The purpose of this program, of course, is to enable these workers to be trained for new jobs, for new opportunities. We have an economy where there are, indeed, many jobs available. It behooves all to work to expedite action on this important piece of legislation. 
   The other point I want to underscore and emphasize, and it has been addressed eloquently by the distinguished Senator from New York, who brings so much historical background into this picture, if we don't act on this legislation, it is a denial of liberal trade policies of the past how many years--35 years?

   Mr. ROTH. That is absolutely correct. 
   The distinguished Senator raises a most important point, going back to the need for action being taken now. The meeting of the WTO to be held in Seattle is an extraordinarily important event. It can bring about some very significant progress for this changing 
   world where we are increasingly involved in a global economy. 
   It is incomprehensible that on this legislation, which has broad bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle, and has the support of the President of the United States, no action will be taken, thus giving the wrong signal to our friends, allies, and trading partners around the world as to our seriousness about moving ahead on trade policy. It looks as if we cannot take action. 
   Regarding fast track--and I appreciate the support Senator MOYNIHAN has given in committee--we have certainly tried to push fast track. We believed it was critically important this President, as every other President, have that authority. Unfortunately, it never happened.

Unemployment is lower than anyone would ever have predicted a few years ago. The future of this country is bright. It was only about 10 years ago everybody was predicting the United States was going down the drain and Japan was becoming No. 1. But the contrary has happened. In this period of time, we have enjoyed the liberal trade practices that began many, many years ago--what was the year?

   Isn't it ironic we are here debating whether or not we should extend these policies that have worked so well to a few countries that are in need of some support and help? It will not only work in their interests, but again it will work in our interest, as I think the Senator pointed out, starting with the growers of cotton, people who make the fabrics, the apparel, the wholesalers, the retailers, and the consumers. It seems to me it is almost unbelievable anyone would argue to the contrary, that we should not continue on this path of a liberal trade policy.

The purpose of this legislation is not only to enable the textile industry, for example, to compete better at home but also to be in a better position to compete abroad in other markets. If we do nothing, as has happened in the past, we see, for example, the Chinese exports increasing.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday, I began making some comments in answer to critics of the proposed legislation, and I want to take a few minutes to continue to answer those negative comments. 
   One of the questions that has been asked is: Won't this legislation result in the further erosion of America's manufacturing sector? 
   None of my colleagues who have risen in opposition to this bill have addressed its specifics. The reason is that, unlike the House-passed Africa bill, the Finance Committee measures are drafted in a way that ensures a benefit to the American industry as well as our African, Caribbean, and Central American trading partners. 
   I made passing reference just now to the specifics and how it would impact on the industry and the American worker. What my colleagues who oppose the bill have done is raise several general arguments against trade that I thought might still be helpful to address. 
   One of the arguments that falls in that category is the argument that trade has led to an irreversible decline in U.S. manufacturing, and that any trade measure, even this one, would simply worsen that decline. Let me take that head on. 
   America is not losing its manufacturing sector. By any measure, it is doing a lot better than some of my distinguished colleagues seem to think. There is no question that manufacturing has declined as a percentage of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing, as a portion of GDP, has declined steadily since 1960, from 27 percent of GDP to 17 percent of GDP by 1996. But does that mean the United States is losing in the international arena? The answer is no. 
   According to the International Trade Commission, all industrial countries have faced a similar percentage decrease in manufacturing as a share of GDP from about 28 percent in 1970 to about 18 percent in 1994. 
   Does the decline in manufacturing as a percentage of GDP mean that American industry is in decline and output is falling? 
   Again, the answer is no. In fact, America's industrial output expanded 62 percent for the period from 1977 through 1996. Let me repeat. The fact is, America's industrial output expanded 62 percent from 1977 through 1996, a period that critics of our trade policy think of as the worst stages of our industrial decline. 
   American manufacturing added a net figure of 4.4 million new jobs during that same period, or an increase of 31 percent in employment in the manufacturing sector. 
   These are very important statistics, I believe. It bears out what the distinguished Senator from New York was just pointing out. 
   Are we being beaten in this measure of international competition? Again, the answer is no. According to a most recent edition of the Economist, which I think is one of the best periodicals available today, American industrial production is up by 35 percent over 1990. 
   During that same period, Japanese industrial growth fell by 5 percent. What a contrast. Ours grew by 35 percent; Japan's fell by 5 percent. This was the world where our country was going to be down and Japan was going to take over. 
   Industrial output in Germany has remained a sluggish 4 percent over the same 10 years, while French and British industrial production grew by only 8 and 9 percent, respectively. 
   Is there employment available for those workers who have lost their jobs due to an increase in productivity? As Senator MOYNIHAN and I were commenting earlier, the answer is yes. We have never seen such low unemployment as this country is enjoying today. 
   The American economy currently enjoys the lowest unemployment in history and rising wages across the board, even for the unskilled who have dropped out of school rather than finishing their education.

   Mr. ROTH. As you and I have pointed out, a majority of the Senators on both sides of the aisle are supportive of this legislation. 
   I do wish some of those who are supportive would come down and give their reasons why it is so important that we move ahead with this legislation. It would be a shame if we lost this opportunity to take a step forward. Because, if I might say so, we are not only losing the opportunity to act on this legislation, which in and of itself is so important, but it helps give what I think is the mistaken message to the world that we are no longer interested in liberal trade policy, particularly in view of the fact that we will be going, hopefully, out to Seattle in a few weeks to take the next step forward in  broadening and liberalizing markets, making them more accessible to everyone, which, of course, is particularly in our interest because the United States has the lowest tariffs, the most open markets. It is important that we move ahead and begin to negotiate access to other markets.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the critics of an open and forward-looking trade policy would prefer to avoid a debate about the actual facts regarding the United States economy. Let me give you some examples. 
   According to the International Trade Commission, from 1970 to 1997, the percentage of U.S. GDP involved in international trade more than doubled--from 11 percent of GDP to 25 percent of GDP. If the opponents of this bill were right in their criticism of U.S. trade policy, the United States should be facing a precipitous economic decline. In fact, the United States' GDP roughly quadrupled over the same time period from $2 trillion to $8.2 trillion. 
   If the opponents of this bill were correct in their criticisms of our trade policy, we should have seen a dramatic rise in unemployment along with the predicted decline in output. In fact, from 1970 to 1997, the American economy produced a net increase of 33.5 million jobs. 
   To put that in context, the American economy produced more than three times the number of new jobs than the entire G-7 industrial countries combined. Rather than facing the double-digit unemployment that Germany faces, U.S. unemployment stood near 4 percent. 
   The opponents of this bill often finger our trade policy as the culprit in a decline in real wages from 1978 to 1997, because trade as a percentage of our economy doubled while real wages fell. In fact, while wages fell, the overall benefits of the entire package of compensation and benefits offered to workers actually increased by 2 percent. 
   That is not to deny that there is a growing gap between the pay of our highest paid workers and our lowest. There is little doubt that this gap has grown. 
   But, we owe it our to ask three basic questions? First, is the gap, in and of itself, a problem if everyone is better off? Second, is the gap attributable to trade as the critics complain? Third, is slowing the pace of trade liberalization, or, worse yet, the imposition of actual restraints on trade, the right policy to remedy the inequality in wages? 
   As to the first point, the growing gap in wages is not necessarily a problem if everyone is better off at the end of the day. As noted above, while wages fell at the low end, the overall package of benefits increased over the past two decades. Furthermore, real wages are once again on the rise, including at the low end. 
   But, even if wages were, in fact, stagnant, trade would help. Trade makes a broader range of higher quality goods and services available to all wage earners in the economy. In other words, trade helps ensure that even the lowest paid sectors of the economy can get higher value for their dollars than would be the case without the competition trade brings. 
   As for the second question, whether trade is the culprit in wages in equality, the answer is that trade has some impact, but not as much as the disparity in income between different levels of education. 
   Education also gives you the tools to remain flexible as the conditions of your current employment changes or as employment changes generally. That is why the economy pays a premium to those who made the sacrifices it takes to succeed in getting a high school education, a college education, and post-graduate education as well.  
   Our economy rewards academic achievement. There is no doubt about that. But, should we change that? Should we eliminate any incentive to achieve a higher education as a way of eliminating the wage gap? Few people would suggest that that is an appropriate response. 
   But, that really focuses our attention on the third question--whether slowing the process of trade liberalization or imposing trade restraints is the right answer to address the wage gap. The answer is no! 
   Imposing restraints on trade would, at best, be an indirect, inefficient, costly, fourth-best option. If the disparity in wages relates to academic achievement, trade restraints will not address the problem, much less solve it. 
   Indeed, if the problem is one of encouraging improvements in our educational system and encouraging our youth to remain in school, imposing restraints on trade is simply self-defeating. Trade restraints will do nothing to improve educational standards or improve school attendance or achievement. It will simply impose higher costs on consumers. 
   And, on whose shoulders will those higher costs fall? Those higher costs will fall disproportionately on the lowest economic sectors in our society. In other words, the burden of trade restraints will fall on precisely on those groups that the critics of trade purport to want to help because of what they perceive as an inequitable gap in wages. 
   Why is that so? The reason is that trade restraints like tariffs and quotas are hugely regressive. Our highest tariffs fall on staples such as food and clothing. 
   That is an inconvenient fact that the critics of trade would prefer not to publicize. What that means is that those workers that now receive relatively lower wages would pay the cost for any increase in trade restraints, which would exacerbate the inequality between the high and low end of the pay scale, rather than reduce it. 
   If we actually want to do something about wage inequality, we should avoid using the gap in wages from the high end to the low end as an excuse to provide protection for certain industries in this country and impose higher costs on consumers. Rather, we should be concentrating on improving our primary, secondary, and post-secondary education. 
   That is but one of the appropriate responses to the rising wage gap. But I understand the arguments that you can't take a former textile worker and retrain him to be a computer programmer. 
   That is why we should also pursue policies that will increase the amount of capital flowing within and into the United States. 
   This helps those at the bottom in two ways. If the amount of capital increases relative to labor, it will demand more labor to fully employ itself and appreciate in value. 
   It also raises the productivity of those at the bottom, making them more valuable, and they will be rewarded for such productivity accordingly. This can summed up succinctly by one question--which high-school level worker gets paid the most to dig a hole, the one who uses a spoon, a shovel, or an excavator? The answer is obvious, and the difference between the three is not education, but the capital that they employ to produce. 
   Ultimately, all economic growth is the result of risk-taking on new ideas that increase our productivity--thereby increasing our standard of living. When we lower the government barriers to risking capital, like we did in the Taxpayer Relief of 1997, which included a large cut in the capital gains tax, the creation of the Roth IRA, and cuts in the estate tax, capital becomes more abundant, fueling the real wage increases, stock market increases, and economic growth we have seen in recent years. 
   The stability of the dollar in the past two decades, as opposed to the turmoil of the 1970's, has also greatly contributed to capital formation, not only because the tax on capital is unindexed for inflation, but also because currency instability increases the risk associated with all economic activity. 
   When we lower these barriers and risks, those with capital will risk it on those without capital, but who possess a surplus of time, energy, talent, or ideas. 
   These ideas, anything from a better mousetrap to the personal computer, allow us to produce more out of less--raising living standards of all sectors of the wage base. 
   These are the most direct responses to the rising wage gap, and also the most efficient, least costly, and potentially successful answer to wage and income inequality. Calling for an end to trade liberalization will not help. Nor will opposing this bill. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, some of my esteemed colleagues argued this past week that we are losing jobs in manufacturing, particularly in textiles and apparel, because we have set the American standard of living too high through the minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, workplace safety rules, environmental standards, and social policies such as parental leave. That is the sort of broad assertion we have heard about every trade bill or trade vote that has come to the floor in the past years. 
   They argue that any trade liberalization will lead to a reduction in our own labor and environmental standards, rather than encouraging an increase in the labor and environmental standards among the beneficiary countries. That attack on this legislation is wrong for three reasons. 
   First, there is no evidence that trade has weakened our labor and environmental standards--quite the contrary. During the period from 1970 to the present day, while trade as a percentage of American GDP more than doubled from 11 to 25 percent, our labor and environmental laws were strengthened. What we have witnessed has been the exact opposite of what the trade critics would have predicted. Our labor laws continue to provide strong protection to workers, and the reach of our workplace safety laws has continued to expand. 
   The last 30 years witnessed the passage of landmark environmental legislation, enormous set-asides of wilderness areas, and significant improvements in air and water quality. We have seen sufficient progress on endangered species so that the President recently removed the bald eagle from the list of endangered species. Who would have thought of a more potent symbol of the progress we have made in the last 30 years. Have we done enough? No. There is still more we can do to encourage conservation and environmental protection. Based on the last 30 years of evidence, there is no reason to forgo the benefits of trade based on the errant assumption that trade will somehow undermine the basic fabric of our environmental law or encourage a race to the bottom. 
   What has been true in the United States has also proved true elsewhere. The truth is that economic growth and a rising standard of living is a necessary predicate for higher labor and environmental standards, and trade is essential to both goals. What the most recent studies have shown is that air and water quality improve as per capita income increases. The growth in pollution declines as incomes rise. There should be no doubt, then, that poverty is the enemy of both labor and environmental standards and that both benefit from economic growth to which trade contributes. 
   Third, there are sound reasons why higher labor and environmental standards will not lead to a race to the bottom, even in a world of expanding trade. Pollution control costs, even in the dirtiest of industries, account for less than 1 or 2 percent of total production costs. In other words, even in the dirtiest of industries, the cost of compliance with our environmental standards is not sufficient to persuade companies to invest in other countries simply to take advantage of lax environmental laws. 
   Trade critics who argue that trade will devastate the environment tend to overlook that firms generally invest in the developing world's pollution havens to gain market access, not 
   to take advantage of the lower environmental standards. In other words, the companies generally invest because their exports face tariffs averaging between 10 and 30 percent, a cost disadvantage they can only overcome through investing on the other side of that tariff wall. 
   Given those facts, we would be better off beating down high tariffs in the developing countries in order to allow the export of goods from clean factories in the United States, rather than encouraging trade restraints that lead to investment in pollution havens. 
   Equally important, our companies tend to take their existing technology and production techniques with them, even when they do invest in pollution havens abroad, in order to get around the high tariff walls. They do not do this out of altruism. They do it because it makes good, cost-effective, economic sense. 
   Our companies have found ways of producing in the United States that both allow them to comply with our environmental standards and remain globally competitive. We should be encouraging the export of those techniques of manufacturing wherever we can. But what those facts most assuredly do not mean is that trade has somehow led to a race to the bottom. In fact, trade appears to lead to a rising standard of living in environmental as well as economic terms. 
   My colleagues say we can no longer compete in textiles and apparel because our producers compete with many countries in the world with far lower standards of living. They explicitly or implicitly argue that we must impose trade restraints in order to protect these industries and the associated jobs. 
   Let me be blunt: There is no protection in protectionism. For every job we save through trade restraints, we lose many more in other sectors of the economy. As we have learned this past summer during the debate over quota legislation, saving one job in the steel industry by imposing trade restraints puts 40 jobs in the consuming and exporting industries at risk. Those who oppose this legislation do not favor the win-win outcome that the Finance Committee bill would create and the textile industry itself supports.

   Mr. ROTH. As I said, there is no protection in protectionism. For every job we save through trade restraints, we lose many more in other sectors of the economy. 
   Those who oppose this legislation do not favor the win-win outcome that the Finance Committee's bill would create and the textile industry itself supports. 
   Some of my colleagues would seem, instead, to prefer the ``lose-lose-lose'' option of imposing a regressive form of taxation on the poorest in our society, lowering employment in the textile and apparel sector, and lowering employment throughout the economy. 
   I want to reemphasize what I have been saying. It is not the chairman and it is not the ranking member of the Finance Committee that is telling you that the Senate bill would lead to higher sales and higher employment in the textile industry. No, it is the textile industry itself that is telling us the Senate bill would increase textile shipments by $8.8 billion over 5 years and increase textile-related employment by 121,000 jobs over the same period. 
   That is a win-win outcome we should support. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to the legislation. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the managers' amendment to H.R. 434. That substitute includes the Senate Finance Committee-reported bills on Africa, an expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, and the reauthorization of our trade adjustment assistance programs. 
   It is critically important that we move this legislation. Let me say a few words, in particular, about the Africa trade portion of the bill. 
   The last decade has been a period of great change in Africa. Some of these changes have been quite heartening to those of us who have been watching the countries in that continent for many years. The failed economic policies of socialism and central planning have begun to give way to market reforms, bringing economic growth and an improvement of living standards with it. There have been positive changes on the political front as well. The tragedy of apartheid has, thankfully, come to an end in South Africa. At the same time, democracy has begun to flower in South Africa and in a number of other sub-Saharan countries. 
   The picture, however, is not all positive. As we know all too well, the countries in Africa continue to suffer through more than their share of difficulties. War, disease and hunger are still very significant parts of the story of that region. Africa is a continent that is on the brink of a new and more positive future, but still has a number of significant hurdles that it must overcome. 
   For the Senate, the question is what we can do--what this great country can do--to help the African nations obtain the peace and prosperity that they have been working so hard to achieve. In other words, what can we do to help them complete the work that they have already begun. 
   The manager's amendment is clearly not a panacea; the challenges that the Africans face are too great for any single piece of legislation or any single act to cure. This legislation is, however, an important start towards building an economic partnership between the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This partnership, in my view, is a significant first step towards giving the African nations the opportunities they need to continue the progress that many of them have made over the past decade. 
   I am proud of the support that this legislation has received among the African-American community and among the Africans themselves. I say this because a few of my colleagues have suggested that the African-American community and the African nations themselves are divided in their support for the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I am standing here to say that nothing could be further from the truth. If there was any doubt, it should have been put to rest with the Roll Call ad which ran last week. The ad, appropriately, stated the following:  
   To the United States Senate, Setting the Record Straight. We endorse legislation that provides social and economic opportunity in Africa and we, the undersigned, are working together 
   to achieve this goal. Can we count on you?  
   The signatories to this Roll Call ad are a very distinguished collection of religious, civic, political and business organizations and individual leaders. I will name just a few: the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the National Council of Churches, AfriCare, the Council of National Black Churches, which represents 65,000 churches and 20,000,000 members, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
   The list of individuals signing this ad includes such notables as Bishops Donald Ming and Garnett Henning of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Mr. Martin Luther King III, Ambassador Andrew Young, former mayor David Dinkins, the Honorable Kweisi Mfume, and Mr. Robert Johnson, the head of Black Entertainment Television. I want to note that Mr. Johnson testified eloquently about the need to create new economic opportunities in Africa when he appeared before the Finance Committee last year. He, like the others listed in this ad, have spoken powerfully on the pressing importance of this legislation. 
   Let me read a quote in the ad from just one of these individuals. That individual is the very distinguished Rev. Leon Sullivan of the nearby city of Philadelphia. Rev. Sullivan is quoted in the ad as saying that:  
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act will open new markets for American products and will create additional jobs for Americans and Africans. For every $1 billion in exports to Africa, 14,000 jobs are created or sustained in the United States. Those are powerful and important words.  
   Let us not forget that this legislation is also good for Africa. That is why every single one of the 47 African nations covered under this the legislation have publicly stated their support. Let me repeat that, because it is important. Every single one of the countries covered under this legislation supports this legislation. I think it is fair to say that these countries have the judgment to decide what is in their interest. In this instance, they have spoken loudly and clearly. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is good for Africa. 
   I am proud to say that President Clinton is also a strong supporter of this legislation. He recently said, and it is quoted in the Roll Call ad, that:  
   Our administration strongly supports the African Growth and Opportunity Act which I said in my State of the Union Address we will work to pass in this session of Congress.  
   That, Mr. President, is exactly why we are here. We are here to work on a bipartisan basis to work for passage of an important piece of legislation that is good for the American people and good for Africa. 
   I was honored to have representatives of many of the groups and individuals I mentioned join me in a press conference this past week to express their support for this legislation. What these individuals and groups understand--and stated at the press conference--is that Africa has for too long been neglected in our trade policy. They also understand that the African Growth and Opportunity Act is the right legislation to begin the strengthening of our economic relationship with that continent. 
   Let me emphasize that these individuals and groups support the African Growth and Opportunity Act and not the HOPE bill. They support this bill because it is good legislation. It is the right thing to do. It is good for the American people, and it is good for the people of Africa. 
   There is, of course, much more that is part of the manager's amendment. The enhancement of the CBI program is long overdue. It is also a vital step to strengthening the economic compact begun with that region by President Reagan with the original CBI initiative. The reauthorizations of the Generalized System of Preferences and Trade Adjustment Assistance programs are also of critical importance. These measures are essential for ensuring that the benefits of the global economy are felt as broadly as possible and to ensure that workers and firms displaced by trade receive the assistance and training that they need. 
   The effort to move the bill enjoys broad bipartisan support. But, it is long overdue. The House of Representatives passed the Africa legislation by an overwhelming vote of 234-163 in July of this year. It is now time for the Senate to Act. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 434, as amended. The time to act is now.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend the distinguished Senator from Missouri for his leadership on agricultural trade issues. I congratulate him for his knowledge, for his leadership on these issues, and the effectiveness with which he deals with them. I want him to know I rise in strong support of his amendment. 
   The USTR has had an agricultural ambassador at USTR. In my judgment, it has been a most effective tool for furthering our agricultural trade interests. It is my position that making this a permanent position would be good policy, well deserved by the agricultural sector which, of course, has consistently fought for trade liberalization. 
   Again, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Missouri and say I look forward to working with him on this critical issue. 
   Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to address some of the arguments that have been raised during the debate today and earlier. They were worthy arguments that merit our attention. But I do believe the proponents of this legislation have a more than adequate response. 
   One of the questions that has been raised is, Why take this bill up now? Some of my colleagues have questioned why we are. Let me help them by putting this in context. 
   Section 134 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which passed the Congress in 1994, just 5 years ago, directed the President to develop a comprehensive trade and development policy for the countries of Africa. That provision originated with Senator DASCHLE, now the distinguished minority leader. In the statement of administrative action that accompanied the act, the President made it very clear the first measures he intended to consider in complying with that congressional mandate were measures to:  
   ..... remove impediments to U.S. trade with and investment in Africa, including enhancements in the GSP program, for the least developed countries.  
   Mr. President, I see the distinguished leader here. I am happy to yield to the distinguished leader.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, a few minutes ago I was taking the opportunity to address some of the arguments that have been raised during the debate on this bill these past several days. Some of my colleagues have questioned why we are taking this bill up now. Let me help them by putting this in context. 
   Section 134 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which passed the Congress in 1994, directed the President to develop a comprehensive trade and development policy for the countries of Africa. That provision originated with Senator DASCHLE, now the distinguished minority leader. 
   In the Statement of Administrative Action that accompanied the Act, the President made clear that the first measures he intended to consider in complying with that congressional mandate, were measures to:  
   Remove impediments to U.S. trade with and investment in Africa, including enhancements in the GSP program for least-developed countries.  
   Section 134 of the URAA recognized that, as a continent, Africa had been left behind in trade terms. New approaches were needed to integrate Africa fully into the world economy, to allow Africa to take full advantage of the world trading system, and to ensure that Africans themselves had the opportunity to guide their own economic destiny. 
   Now, 5 years after the Congress originally endorsed the idea, this legislation responds directly to that mandate. The legislation offers a down payment on a new and more constructive relationship with the African continent--one as partners with similar interests in expanding economic opportunity and raising living standards in all our countries. 
   The President has for the past 2 years indicated in his State of the Union Address his intent to press ahead with this legislation. He identified this legislation as one of his top trade and foreign policy initiatives. In his trip to Africa this past year, he committed to move the bill as part of a new initiative for Africa. 
   That led to the consideration of this legislation in the 105th Congress. The House passed its counterpart legislation in the spring of this past year, the Finance Committee reported out a bill in all respects the same as that we now have before us, but time ran out before the Senate could act on the bill. 
   This year the House once again acted, this time in June. By that point, the Finance Committee had already reported out the legislation now on the Senate floor. The Africa bill is timely--indeed, it is past time we acted on this important measure. 
   The same holds true for the CBI. A proposal for establishing parity between the preferences granted Mexico under the NAFTA and those granted the Caribbean and Central America has been before Congress in one form or another almost since the NAFTA was implemented in late 1993. 
   In the 105th Congress, there was considerable effort invested by both the Ways and Means and Finance Committees in moving counterpart bills. That work was renewed in the 106th Congress with hearings and markups before both committees. 
   The CBI title enjoys the same bipartisan support as does the Africa title. Indeed, the President's CBI bill, introduced in this session at his request, is virtually identical to the bill reported from the Finance Committee bill in both the 105th and 106th Congresses. 
   The Finance Committee bill enjoys the backing of the leadership and members on both sides of the aisle. It is, in fact, a testament to the bipartisan support for this legislation and the considerable push by the White House that we have been given time to debate this bill now. 
   It is time to reject the isolationist label, the instinct to ignore the broader world around us, and the tendency for focus exclusively inward. It is time to affirm the constructive role that the United States can play in the wider world and fulfill the leadership the world expects from the United States. It is time to act. 
   It is time to act because it is time we made good on the unfulfilled promises made to both Africa and the Caribbean.  An October, 1998, report of the International Trade Commission makes clear, Africa faces daunting economic challenges. The ITC report highlights the economic and structural problems Africa faces in attracting productive investment. 
   For all that, the ITC report also reflects the positive changes under way in Africa. The region's GDP rose by 4.8 percent from 1995 to 1997. Since 1990, the region has reached a number of agreements eliminating trade and investment barriers and harmonizing economic policies. 
   Most of the governments of the region have ``introduced economic reforms to control budget deficits, and inflation, and to stabilize currencies.'' They have liberalized ``regulations on trade and investment,'' reduced tariffs and other import charges and abolished most price controls. 
   In addition, many of the governments have begun significant programs of privatization. In fact, the governments of sub-Saharan Africa raised ``an estimated $5.8 billion from privatization, primarily through divestitures of utilities and telecommunication firms.'' 
   What this legislation tries to do is meet those governments half way. It is an effort to open our markets to their products as a way of reinforcing their own efforts to encourage productive investment and economic growth. 
   The legislation is designed to reinforce a growing, the growing interest in Africa among U.S. businesses. Direct investment by U.S. firms more than quadrupled in 1997 alone to $3.8 billion, according to the ITC. We want to encourage that positive trend. 
   Some may argue that, because this is a grant of unilateral preferences, it is one-sided--that there will be no benefits to the United States. What that ignores is the track record of the last several decades. 
   Where U.S. investment goes, U.S. trade follows. Significantly, while U.S. investment was increasing in 1996 and 1997 in sub-Saharan Africa, our exports to the region experienced a corresponding growth in capital goods, particularly exports of machinery for use in agriculture and infrastructure projects. 
   Africa represents an important opportunity to our farmers as well. While agricultural exports fell in dollar terms, largely because of the lower prices available on world markets for all commodities, Africa represents an important potential market for U.S. food exports as the continent increasingly looks offshore to meet its needs. 
   The real issue is whether or not the region will have the wherewithal to buy what it needs to offset the steady decline in per capita caloric intake that has accelerated in the last 2 to 3 years. The legislation before us would help address that problem. By opening our markets to their products, sub-Saharan African countries can earn the foreign exchange needed to purchase food on world markets, including from U.S. exporters. 
   Will that be enough? Will this legislation alone be the answer to Africa's problems? Plainly not. As Senator GRASSLEY indicated in his eloquent statement opening the debate on this bill last Thursday, this legislation is no panacea. It is instead a small, but significant step toward a new economic relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Should this legislation be supplemented by other initiatives? It should and it must if it is going to work. But, the fact that it is not the whole answer to Africa's problems or does not reflect all that the United States might do to help Africans secure their own economic destiny is no argument against action. It is time to move ahead and engage constructively with our African partners in the transition they themselves have begun. 
   The same holds true for the Caribbean and Central America. Through the original CBI program, the United States and U.S. private businesses have played a significant role in the economic progress the region has made over the past 15 years. 
   This past year, however, natural disasters eliminated much of the progress made in the Caribbean and Central America in recent years. The devastation began with the eruption of a long-dormant volcano that nearly depopulated the island of Montserrat and nearly erased its economy in the summer of 1998. 
   In September of that year, Hurricane Georges severely damaged both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. An even more devastating hurricane--Hurricane Mitch--struck Central America in late October and early November late in the hurricane season. 
   Honduras and Nicaragua were particularly hard hit, but the hurricane also did considerable damage to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Belize. Hurricane Mitch left 11,000 dead and an even greater number homeless. Much of the resulting damage was long-term--massive property damage and soil erosion, the devastation of crop lands and manufacturing sites, putting thousands out of work. The region will take years to recover. 
   Those devastating circumstances have given renewed impetus to an idea that surfaced almost immediately after the implementation of the NAFTA--the expansion of tariff preferences under the CBI to match those offered under the NAFTA to Mexico. 
   Will it work? I am confident it will because the legislation is modeled on existing production-sharing arrangements in textiles and apparel and other industries that already account for nearly half of all imports from the CBI beneficiary countries. 
   In other words, the program has a proven track record. Indeed, bilateral trade in textiles and apparel under existing production-sharing partnerships between U.S. and Caribbean or Central American firms already accounts for 36 percent of current two-way trade between the United States and the CBI region. 
   For all those reasons, the legislation merits our support.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed to H.R. 434. As I indicated on Friday, when we proceeded to the bill, I will offer a substitute to the House language that consists of the Finance Committee-reported bills on Africa, CBI, GSP renewal, and the reauthorization of our Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. 
   Each one of these measures deserves our support. What each represents in its own way is an attempt to reach out and provide not just a helping hand, but an opportunity--an opportunity for millions around the world to seize their own economic destiny. 
   Africa has for too long suffered from our neglect. The continent faces daunting political, economic, and social challenges. Yet, African leaders are seizing the opportunity to press for political and economic change. 
   The goal of the Finance Committee's Africa bill is to meet Africa's leaders half way. It is not a panacea for Africa's problems; rather, it is a small downpayment--an investment--in a partnership that I hope we can foster through our actions here. 
   The Finance Committee's CBI bill does much the same. It builds on an economic foundation begun with the passage of the original CBI in 1983, but responds as well to the efforts of Caribbean and Central American leaders to rebuild their economies in the face of incalculable devastation their countries faced this past year. The bill would afford the same basic package of enhanced trade preferences offered to Africa under the Finance Committee's bill. 
   The economic opportunities offered by the Finance Committee Africa and CBI bills extend to U.S. industry as well. According to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the Finance Committee bills would lead to an increase in their sales of $8.8 billion over 5 years and an increase in employment of 121,000 jobs. The bills are expressly designed to ensure that they are a benefit to Africa and the Caribbean, and to the United States as well. 
   The renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences would continue the longstanding policy of the United States of opening our market to create economic opportunity throughout the developing world and merits our continued support. 
   The renewal of the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs is entirely consistent with the theme of creating economic opportunity, but it is focused on  home. I have always maintained that those who benefit from trade should help those who are adversely affected. The TAA programs have lapsed and must be renewed if we are to fulfill that commitment. 
   Now, much has been made in this debate of the fact that Finance Committee bills entail a unilateral grant of preferences. The implication is that there is nothing in this for the United States. In fact, the economic growth fostered by this legislation create new markets for our goods and services, as well as help create more prosperous and stable neighbors. 
   That is an investment I will make any time. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the cloture motion and the motion to proceed to H.R. 434. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Madam President, today is a sad day for America; today is a sad day for the Senate, for Rhode Island, but especially for JOHN CHAFEE's family. 
   Senator CHAFEE was, indeed, a remarkable man and a good friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family--his wife Ginny and five children--as they pass through this most difficult time. 
   I believe it can be said without hesitation that few individuals have served America with the distinction that JOHN CHAFEE exhibited in his many years of public service. From his active duty in the Marine Corps--where he saw action in both the Second World War and Korea--to his early years as a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, to his years as Governor and his work as Secretary of the Navy, to, of course, his 23 years of service in the Senate, JOHN's patriotism was beyond philosophical; it was pragmatic and it was concrete. 
   He had a keen sense of duty--a profound sense of responsibility. As a Senator, he knew his constituents, and he served them with such devotion that he was elected in 1976 and returned to Washington four times, despite the fact that he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic State. Much of his effectiveness was in his ability to find bipartisan cooperation, and to stand fast on issues that were important to the individuals and families he represented. Among these issues was a deep concern for the environment and for quality and affordable health care. 
   He was a tireless advocate of the underprivileged and a strong proponent of American leadership and economic opportunity. I understand how important these issues were to JOHN--not only because we served for so many years as colleagues and friends on the Senate Finance Committee--but because, like JOHN, I represent a small coastal State in the Northeast, much like you, Madam President. Many of the issues and concerns we faced were the same. In fact, one of the truly great honors I have received as a Senator is to be given the Ansel Adams Award by the Wilderness Society. It is the highest award that prestigious organization gives out, and there are only two Republican Senators who have ever received it. And I must say that it was awarded to JOHN first--2 or 3 years before me. 
   Madam President, along with you and all our colleagues, I am saddened by his death. But I am grateful for the time we spent together; I am grateful for his leadership and example; and I am grateful for his supportive family. Along with all my colleagues, I express my condolences to them as well as my most profound gratitude for sharing Senator CHAFEE with America. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed to H.R. 434. As Senator GRASSLEY, chairman of the Finance Committee's Trade Subcommittee, indicated last night, I will offer a manager's amendment--to be titled the Trade and Development Act of 1999--as a substitute for the House-passed language. 
   That act will include the Senate Finance Committee-reported bills on Africa, an expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, and the reauthorization of our Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. I want to explain the intent behind these measures and my reasons for supporting their passage. 
   Let me begin with Africa. No continent suffers more from poverty, hunger, and disease. Those problems have been compounded by colonialism, cold war politics, corruption, social division, and environmental disaster. Our daily news records the desperate images of starving mothers and their children, small boys employed as the dogs of war, and the slaughter of wildlife as poachers attempt to eke out a living on the bare plains of Africa.  
   The result has been the lowest living standards and the lowest life expectancy of any in the world. Those conditions have too often reinforced a dangerous cycle of war, political instability, and economic decay. 
   What the daily news has too often overlooked are the efforts of so many of our African neighbors to restore political freedom, guarantee human rights, and foster economic hope. 
   In the past decade, we have seen an end to apartheid in South Africa and the peaceful transition to black majority rule. We have seen Nelson Mandela go from political prisoner to president. 
   We have witnessed the more recent restoration of economic links between South Africa and the former ``front-line states,'' between Uganda and Tanzania, and between the sub-Saharan region and the rest of the world. We have benefited from the example of courage and dedication that many sub-Saharan African states have provided as they have confronted the daunting challenges they face. 
   We have also seen nothing short of a revolution in economic thinking. Africa has too frequently been the beneficiary of bad economic advice from well-meaning international institutions, technical advisers, and even creditors. 
   That advice often encouraged crushing debt, confiscatory taxation, growth-killing devaluations, inefficient state-owned enterprises, and economic mismanagement. For too long, our African neighbors have been encouraged to adopt models of economic development that have, in fact, wasted their most valuable resource--their people. 
   That era has now come to an end. The new Africa is tackling its own problems and the new Africa can be the master of its own economic destiny. 
   It is in that context that the African title of the Trade and Development Act is relevant. It offers tariff preferences to sub-Saharan Africa that will encourage economic foundation on which the eligible countries can build their own future. Equally important, it reflects a belief in the power of markets, incentives to investment, and human potential. 
   That approach enjoys broad bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress and by the President, who mentioned the bill as one of his top foreign policy and trade priorities in this year's State of the Union Address. As the chart behind me attests, the legislation also enjoys broad support in the business community, among U.S. and foreign opinion leaders, as well as, most importantly, from the potential African beneficiaries themselves. 
   Numerous U.S. businesses and business groups have expressed their support for moving this legislation. That group includes companies as diverse as Oracle, Cargill, General Motors, Enron, and The Limited. 
   The list of supporters includes the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the National Council of Churches. It includes opinion leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Coretta Scott King, the Reverend Leon Sullivan who led much of the fight in this country to force change in South Africa under apartheid, and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television who appeared before the Finance Committee in support of the legislation. And, most importantly, the legislation is endorsed by all 47 of the potential beneficiaries in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   The bill deserves our support as well. 
   The Trade and Development Act of 1999 would do much the same of the Caribbean and Central America that it would do for sub-Saharan Africa. It expands the existing benefits available under the Caribbean Basin Initiative to include the duty-free and quota-free treatment of the value added in the Caribbean to apparel made from U.S. yarn and U.S. fabric. 
   It is no understatement to say that the countries of the Caribbean and Central America have faced problems similar to those faced in Africa, and often-times on a similar scale. It was only a decade or so ago that Nicaragua was an avowedly Marxist state harboring guerrillas that sought to undermine the governments and economies of Central America. It was only a decade or so ago that El Salvador was confronted with bloody civil strife and a mass migration of its people northward to escape the conditions of poverty and hopelessness that recurring civil war had brought. 
   More recently, the region has been hit by natural disasters, rather than the man-made variety. This past year, Hurricane Mitch devastated the islands of the Caribbean and the countries of Central America. Among the hardest hit were Honduras and Guatemala, where farms and factories were literally washed away overnight. Both countries confronted the need to rebuild their economic infrastructure from the ground up. 
   Since 1983, the countries of the region have been eligible for enhanced tariff preferences under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. The CBI was expressly designed to encourage private investment and an economic partnership between the firms in the United States and firms in the Caribbean. The CBI accomplished that objective. 
   In 1993, however, with the conclusion of the NAFTA, the margin of preference enjoyed by the CBI beneficiaries was undercut by the preferential treatment accorded Mexican goods under that agreement. That was particularly significant in the area of textiles and apparel, where the NAFTA rules of origin gradually encouraged a shift in United States investment and trade from the region to the Mexico. 
   In order to make good on the initial promise of the CBI, the Caribbean title of the manager's amendment would encourage the manufacture in the Caribbean of apparel articles made from U.S. fabric woven with U.S. yarns. In effect, the bill would simply restore the margin of preference it previously enjoyed in the region in such manufacturing. 
   At this point, it is worth outlining the reasons why the Finance Committee settled on the particular package of benefits extended to textiles and apparel under both the Africa and CBI titles of the manager's amendment. 
   For many years, we have employed a program that encouraged production sharing between the United States and many countries in the developing world. That program--generally known as the ``807'' program--allowed for the export of U.S.-manufactured components off-shore for assembly. 
   Under the 807 program, when the assembly was complete and the goods were returned to the United States, the importer paid duty only on the amount of value added offshore in the assembly process. 
   Do such programs work? The answer, based on the latest reports of the International Trade Commission, is an unequivocal yes. They work for both the beneficiary countries and for American firms. 
   Production sharing programs, according to the ITC, are used by American companies ``to minimize their overall costs and improve competitiveness.'' Indeed, in most instances, American firms experience ``enhanced overall competitiveness'' that ``allows companies to maintain higher U.S. production and employment levels that might otherwise be possible.'' In short, the programs reflected in both the Africa and CBI titles of the manager's amendment are designed to create a ``win-win'' outcome for the regions and for American firms. 
   The American textile industry's latest analyses vindicate the approach we adopted in the Finance Committee. 
   I think it is fair to say that when we started the process of considering these programs for Africa and the Caribbean in the 105th Congress, the textile industry was lukewarm at best. What they have found in the intervening three years is that the bill proposed by the Finance Committee would help create a competitive platform from which American firms could compete effectively on a global basis even in the face of fierce competition from exporters such as China and India. 
   According to the respected industry consultant, Nathan Associates, the Finance Committee bill would ``increase U.S. textile shipments by $8.8 billion and increase U.S. textile and textile-related employment by 121,400 by the end of five years.'' 
   That result led the president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Doug Ellis of Southern Mills, to conclude that the Senate Finance Committee bill would have a ``very strong and direct positive impact ..... on U.S. textile production and jobs.'' He indicated that the legislation will ``significantly enhance'' trade between the United States and the beneficiary countries. For that reason, ATMI,  urged the Congress to support the Finance Committee's bill. 
   What is more, U.S. wholesalers, retailers, and consumers benefit as well. The direct effect on the duty preferences extended under the manager's amendment will be to lower the cost of apparel products sold in the United States as cost savings are passed on to the consumer. 
   The indirect effect is that, by ensuring the continuing competitiveness of the U.S. industry, the bill would also encourage continuing competition well into the future. That competition ultimately means a broader range of higher quality goods available to the consumer at lower prices. 
   I want to pause here to reemphasize my basic point. Under the manager's amendment, everyone in the U.S. textile and apparel market--from the farmer growing cotton to the yarnspinner to the fabric-maker to the apparel manufacturer to the retailer to the consumer--wins under the Finance Committee bill. The same holds true for the beneficiary countries. 
   Now, I would be remiss if I failed to mention two other particularly important provisions of the manager's amendment. The first is the renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences. The GSP program lapsed in June of this year. Much depends on its renewal. 
   The program was designed to create an incentive to investment in the developing world. Since its inception in 1975, the GSP program has done just that. Now, however, in the absence of the renewal of the program, that needed incentive to productive capital investment will be cut off. Many American firms that depend on the GSP program will be hurt along with the beneficiary countries. 
   The second additional item is the reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. The TAA programs are designed to help U.S. workers and firms adjust to new levels of import competition. 
   I have always maintained that those that benefit from trade should care for those who are hurt by the economic adjustment trade can engender. For that reason, I rushed to the floor to object when there was an initiative to do away with these programs in the past. In my view, the TAA programs represent a down payment on the commitment we must make to workers as the United States if we want them to join us in support of the benefits trade brings. 
   In closing, let me urge my colleagues to listen carefully to the debate they will hear in the coming hours on the motion to proceed to H.R. 434. I firmly believe that my colleagues will hear no meaningful objection to the Senate Finance Committee's approach to providing additional trade incentives to sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, or the developing world generally through the renewal of GSP. Nor can there be any principled objection to the renewal of the TAA programs. 
   This is a significant step in favor of engagement with our neighbors in Africa and the Caribbean to help them surmount their own economic problems. I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed to the bill.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first, let me make the observation that textile jobs are being lost to China and India, not to Mexico. NAFTA has helped increase U.S. textile shipments. But I think it is particularly important to understand that it is not I who is saying that the legislation before us will help the textile industry; rather, it is the textile industry itself. It is the President of the American Textile Manufacturing Institute that is telling us that the Finance Committee will raise textile shipments by $8.8 billion over the next 5 years. That is what is significant, Mr. President--that it is the textile industry itself that is asserting that the legislation before us will help the textile industry to the tune of $8.8 billion and, most important of all, it will increase employment by 121,000 jobs. 
   That is the reason I made the comment that it is win-win because we are not only helping the countries such as the sub-Saharan Africa CBI, but we are helping the workers here at home. We are not talking about what happened in the past; we are talking about what will happen in the future. And what we are seeking to do is to enact legislation that will both create jobs and help the industry. I should also point out, most importantly, it will be of benefit to the retailers, the wholesalers, as well as the people who acquire the goods. So I reiterate what I said earlier, that this is good legislation. It accomplishes what I think we all want--a stronger economy in the textile area. 
   Now, on the immigration issue, my distinguished colleague says NAFTA hasn't helped. What that statement overlooked is the strong flow of illegal immigration. But, again, as I said earlier, it is not from Mexico; rather, it is from Central America and the Caribbean, which is precisely the reason that the Finance Committee bill will help. In other words, by strengthening their economy, there will be jobs there, and as a result of that, there won't be the need for the illicit immigration that has occurred in the past. 
   As to who would benefit, my distinguished colleague cannot possibly claim that Korean and Taiwanese firms will benefit. As I explained before, the only fabric that will benefit is American fabric. It is U.S. textiles that will benefit and U.S. export of textiles. So my colleague argues that we are losing in manufacturing. In fact, it is increasing, and that is the purpose of this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I think it is important that the record reflect what has happened to productivity in the textile industry. 
   In a CRS report for Congress dated August 24, 1999, the point is made on page CRS-3 that:  
   Labor productivity growth in the textiles industry has actually outstripped [I think that is important] that of the economy as a whole, increasing at 2.8% per year from 1970 to 1996, compared with 1.2% per year for the aggregate economy.  
   In other words, the economy as a whole, its productivity, has been growing at the rate of 1.2 percent per year, whereas the textile industry, in contrast, has been growing as rapidly as 2.8 percent. 
   Textile productivity growth was fast even compared to the rest of the manufacturing sector. 
   The figures are given that it grew at 2.8 percent versus 2.3 for the rest of the manufacturing sector and has maintained the high growth of labor productivity even in the 1990s. Again, it is 4 percent versus 3.5 percent.  
   Much of the increase in the textile industry productivity was due to capital deepening that occurred beginning in the 1970s. Over this decade, capital expenditures by textile producers outstripped their profit with almost $3 billion invested annually in new plant and equipment.  
   The same publication points out that exports have grown 12.1 percent in the textile sector from 1989 to 1996 but has shrunk very slightly, 1.2 percent, since 1997 due primarily to lingering effects of foreign currency devaluations that have been induced by the Asian crisis. 
   I urge anyone who has an opening statement or comment on the legislation to come down to the floor as soon as possible while there is an opportunity to speak on this matter. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want the record to be clear that this Government has been of help to the apparel and textile industry, as well as others, including agriculture and aerospace. The claim was made that the A&T sector has not benefited, but that is not correct. Let me give one example. 
   The question of the R&E tax credit--a most important credit in that it encourages research by various industries and I think helps keeps us on the cutting edge of technology--I point out this is a matter, as a matter of fact, being discussed and debated in the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee on the other side as part of extenders. 
   The point I want to make is the R&E tax credit is of great benefit to the textile and apparel industry. As a matter of fact, the CRS report for Congress of August 24, 1999, states that the R&E tax credit may be even more important to the A&T sector. This is probably because more technology-intensive industries consider R&D spending a fixed cost of their sector activity that must be undertaken to maintain competitiveness regardless of public policy. While in the A&T sector, the amount of R&D engaged in is variable depending on the expense. It concludes, for these reasons, this credit is probably of more benefit to this industry than many others. 
   I conclude by saying that as Congress has recently displayed a preference in favor of tax credits over direct funding for R&D, the future of the R&D tax credit may be determined, to a large degree, by the rate of continued technical progress in the A&T sector. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROTH. I've long been committed to the effective and efficient management of the Medicare program, specifically the detection of fraud and abuse. I supported the creation of the MIP program, established under HIPAA, to provide a stable and increasing funding source for fraud and abuse detection efforts. Prior to MIP, Medicare contractor funding for anti-fraud and abuse activities was often reduced because of other spending priorities in the annual appropriations process. MIP was created to prevent that from happening again. The House Appropriations Committee recommendation is in clear disregard of congressional intent.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to make some brief observations in reference to the debate on the Lautenberg amendment to the Labor/Health and Human Services/Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. The Senator from New Jersey suggests that there is an aversion to identifying and addressing tax loopholes. I would point out that in the Finance Committee we have worked in a bipartisan manner to identify and address areas of our tax code which are viewed as candidates for change. These measures have raised tens of billions in revenue over the last few years. Some examples in this area include action the committee took to effect the tax treatment of corporate owned life insurance (COLI), liquidating REITs and tax shelter registration requirements. 
   Indeed, we are required to consistently look for avenues where we can adjust our tax code to enact change going forward. We are faced with just such a situation right now in crafting our so called extender bill. The items we are seeking to go forward with include permanently shielding individuals from the alternative minimum tax--an important item to ensure that our families are able to take advantage of measures designed to advance their education and child care needs. We are looking to create job opportunities with the extension of the work opportunity tax credit, the R&D tax credit and the welfare to work tax credit and to enable working men and women to continue their education both at the undergraduate and graduate level through the employer provided education assistance program. In the environmental area we are looking to continue provisions which enable communities and businesses to address brownfields. I would point out that millions of people benefit from these provisions. 
   I believe it is possible to craft legislation which will provide for programs which have been identified as priorities--health care for our veterans, education, aid for our farmers, environmental programs and health research. We have worked in the Finance Committee to advance these priorities as well and will continue to do so going forward in a bipartisan manner.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important--a historically important--vote taken in the course of our recent deliberations on defense policy. I am speaking of the rollcall vote this Chamber took on May 25 requesting the long-overdue, posthumous advancement of two fine World War II officers, Adm. Husband Kimmel and Gen. Walter Short. The Senate voted in support of the Kimmel-Short resolution, and I wish to take a moment to underscore the historic import of that vote. 
   As you may recall, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were publicly and wrongly accused of dereliction of duty and unfairly scapegoated with singular responsibility for the success of the fateful December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   After the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a painfully unjust and enduring veneer when Admiral Kimmel and General Short were not advanced on the retired lists to their highest ranks of war-time command--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in war-time positions above his regular grade. 
   After over 50 years, this injustice remains a prominent, painful spur in the integrity of our Nation's military honor. After numerous official investigations totaling well over 30 volumes of thick text absolved these officers of dereliction of duty and highlighted gross negligence and ineptitude on the part of their superiors as predominant factors in the Pearl Harbor disaster, these officers still remain unfairly treated. 
   For those of you who are interested, I will shortly send to the desk for placement in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a set of excerpts from these investigations. This is a short document, but it poignantly highlights how unjust treatment endured by Kimmel and Short just does not correlate with the official history--the official documented history--of the Pearl Harbor disaster.  
   Anyone who looks over these few pages cannot but feel uncomfortable with how our Nation has so unfairly turned its back on these two officers who dedicated their lives to our own freedoms. 
   Mr. President, a great step, indeed an historic step was taken toward the correction of this injustice last May, on May 25 to be exact. This Chamber, the U.S. Senate, the legislative body our Constitution deems responsible for providing advice and consent in the promotion of military officers, voted and passed an amendment to the Senate Defense authorization bill that stated:  
   This singular exclusion from advancement of Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) Short from the Navy retired list and the Army retired list, respectively, serves only to perpetuate the myth that the senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and is a distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States.  
   This resolution then requested the President to advance the late Rear Adm. Husband Kimmel to the grade of admiral on the retired list of the Navy and the late Maj. Gen. Walter Short to the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list of the Army. 
   Mr. President, the injustice suffered by Admiral Kimmel and General Short remains a flaw in the integrity of our Nation's chain of command and its unparalleled military honor. 
   In this regard, the Senate's vote on the Kimmel-Short resolution was of great historic importance. The Senate has every right to be proud of this vote. This Chamber, which under the Constitution is responsible for promotion of military officers of our Armed Forces, deemed the treatment of Kimmel and Short to be unfair and unjust and inconsistent with our national sense of honor. 
   That vote gave formal and official recognition to this injustice and highlighted it as a pernicious inconsistency in the application of our national understanding of military accountability. 
   It demonstrated that no wrong, no matter how distant in the past will be ignored by this Chamber. it correctly called upon the President to correct this injustice by advancing these two fine officers on the retired lists. 
   It is now up to the President to take this corrective action. I hope that he will not heed the contradictory conclusions of his advisors on this matter. While the Pentagon opposes the advancement of Kimmel and Short, they nonetheless recognize that, and I quote their own 1995 report, ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly shared.'' 
   How they square this conclusion with the reality that today Kimmel and Short are the only two officials to suffer from official sanction is beyond me. 
   I hope that the President of the United States will use his wisdom to listen beyond this contradictory and unjust advice. I hope that he will look at the official record compiled by over eight official investigations. 
   I hope that he will listen to the studied voice of the Senate and take the final step necessary to correct this injustice by advancing these two fine officers to their highest grade of World War II command on the retired lists. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has once again ably demonstrated that it is never too late to correct an injustice. I urge the President of the United States to do the same and advance Kimmel and Short to their highest grade of command as was done for their peers who served in World War II.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, over the couse of the next several months, countless ``lessons learned'' studies assessed Operation Allied Force will be conducted by NATO authorities as well as by our armed services, our own Committees here in Congress, and their counterparts found among our NATO allies. 
   What I wish to do today is to approach this matter of ``lessons learned'' from the vantage point of one who regards the NATO Alliance to be a vital  interest of the United States. I want to ensure that NATO's experience in Kosovo contributes to an Alliance that is better prepared for the challenges it will face in the next millennium. 
   The conflict over Kosovo was NATO's first war, and the Alliance did win. Operation Allied Force forced the regime of Serbian Prime Minister Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo. It thereby ended the systematic brutality that regime exercised against the province's Albanian population. 
   It was in many ways a military campaign of unprecedented success. Not a single NATO airman lost his or her life to enemy fire in the course of over 35,000 sorties. Despite a few tragic errors, the bombing campaign featured unmatched accuracy and precision. 
   However, while Operation Allied Force did attain victory, the accomplishment of its goals did not yield a shared sense of triumph and finality. This absence of triumph is the product of how NATO exercised its power in this war in light of the tremendous military advantages it had over its opponent, the forces of the Milosevic regime. 
   Among NATO's first and foremost objectives in this war was to stop the atrocities then being committed against Kosovar Albanians. Yet, in the course of Operation Allied Force, Milosevic accelerated and expanded his campaign of terror. Before the war was over, nearly 90% of Kosovar Albanians were driven from their homes by Serbian para-military and military forces. Nearly one half were actually expelled from Kosovo. 
   Moreover, no less than 10,000 Albanians were executed by Milosevic's henchmen during the course of the NATO campaign. As we learn daily from the grim excavations of body-filled wells and mass graves, the actual figure is probably much, much higher. And then there were the countless rapes of Albanian women, which for cultural reasons will unfortunately never be fully reported--all occurring during the course of Operation Allied Force. 
   When assessing the lessons learned from the Kosovo war, we must not forget that the primary purpose of NATO's threats and then its bombing campaign was to prevent these tragedies from occurring. 
   Then there are the facts concern the balance of power between NATO and Serbia. It took the Alliance 78 days to force Milosevic from Kosovo, a region that size of Los Angeles County whose population was 90% Albanian--a population that wanted NATO's support and that would have warmly welcomed Alliance ground forces as was done when Operation Joint Guardian commenced. 
   That this campaign took 78 days is especially disturbing when one takes into account that, according to a Washington Post report, NATO was a standing force some 37 times larger than that fielded by Slobodan Milosevic and a combined economy that is 696 times larger than that of Serbia. These statistics do not come close to capturing the vast technological advantages NATO forces have over the Serbian military. 
   That NATO won the war is obvious. That in the course of Operation Allied Force, NATO demonstrated its awesome capabilities is indisputable. But, when assessing the lessons learned from this war, one cannot avoid the haunting fact that its results included an acute and brutal increase in the suffering of the Kosovar population, that an Alliance of such power and magnitude took over two months to defeat an exponentially far weaker foe, and that in the aftermatch of Operation Allied Force, the regime that created this crisis remains not only in 
   place, but belligerent. 
   So what are the key lessons and issues raised by NATO's first war, a war that brought NATO victory yet, denied it triumph? 
   The first and foremost lesson concerns the Alliance's political cohesion. Many have stated that NATO's greatest success in this conflict was that its 19 members hung together. 
   There can be no doubt that this cohesion was rooted in the common values and interests that bind the 19 Allies. But in recognizing this, one must not overlook a central fact: The first lesson from Operation Allied Force is that the trust among Allied military personnel promoted by NATO is an invaluable reinforcer of the political cohesion binding NATO Allies. Allied unity in this war was never a given. Several allies floated proposals to temporarily halt the bombing campaign. Others publicly denied the use of their territory for forced entry into Kosovo or Serbia proper. NATO's political cohesion was vulnerable in an often very visible manner. 
   The trust and unity fostered among allied militaries through fifty years of joint planning, training, command and operations significantly buttressed the durability of Alliance cohesion during the conflict. Unfortunately, I fear that the significance of this military bond may never be fully appreciated. I am disturbed that French Defense Minister Alain Richard recently asserted that the experience of Operation Allied Force has only further legitimized Paris' inclination to remain outside of NATO's Integrated Military Command. 
   Quite the contrary, the war over Kosovo underscored the need for all Allies to become full members of that integrated command structure. It is an institution that facilitates and orchestrates more effective military operations by the NATO coalition. Its day-to-day operation is a cornerstone of trust and credibility that in times of crisis and war not only maximizes NATO's military effectiveness, but also its political unity. 
   As I just stated, numerous studies assessing the strategy behind Operation Allied Force are underway. Much attention will be directed, as it should, toward the factors that contributed to Milosevic's capitulation. These, of course, include that regime's intensified international isolation, the actual damage done to its military and civilian infrastructure, the role of the KLA, and the influence of slowly increasing NATO ground force deployments around Kosovo, among others. 
   We also need to ensure a fair and objective assessment of the Alliance's decision to tailor the bombing campaign around a strategy of gradual escalation. And, there has to be a thorough review of the decision to preclude the use of NATO ground forces for a forced entry into Kosovo. An important question will be whether a more severe and overwhelming application of force would have more effectively prevented the suffering that occurred in Kosovo over those 78 days. 
   Because so much attention will be directed toward these issues and others related to what went right and wrong in Kosovo, we must, however, avoid the mistake of making Kosovo a singular template for NATO's planning and preparations for future conflicts. As a matter of prudence, we have to assume that the future will present contingencies that are more demanding than that which we encountered over Kosovo. 
   Hence, the central focus of our assessments must be the following issue: Did Operation Allied Force demonstrate that NATO benefits from a force structure that can deploy on suitably short notice, be sustained over long distances, and readily provide Alliance leaders the option of swiftly delivering overwhelming force, be it from the sea, from the air, or from the ground? 
   These are not new standards. The Alliance's Strategic Concept of 1991, which was updated in the course of the Washington Summit last April, postulated a NATO force featuring ``enhanced flexibility and mobility and an assured capability for augmentation when necessary.'' That same doctrine also called upon the Alliance to have available ``appropriate force structures and procedures, including those that would provide an ability to build up, deploy and draw down forces quickly and discriminately.'' With this in mind, NATO established in 1991 its ``Rapid 
   Reaction Forces.'' 
   So after eight years, just how rapid and overwhelming are NATO's forces? 
   Operation Allied Force yielded a very mixed answer to this question. And, it generates concern on my part about the overall readiness of Allied forces, including those of our own country, and, thus, the overall health of the Alliance. 
   First, it is clear that the Alliance's ability to deliver devastating firepower from the air emerges almost solely from the United States. The U.S. provided 70% of the aircraft flown in Operation Allied Force. And, an overwhelming majority of the precision  guided missions launched in the conflict were American. 
   While Allied Force demonstrated the awesome capacities of American air power, it also highlighted glaring shortfalls in European inventories, including: fighter-bombers; electronic jamming aircraft; advanced command, control, and communications capacities; intelligence capacities; and, precision-guided munitions. 
   Instead of becoming a symbol of NATO power, Operation Allied Force emerged as a symbol of the imbalance that exists between the military capabilities of the United States and its Allies. While it is true that our allies are bearing their share of responsibility in Operation Just Cause, we cannot ignore the unequal capabilities the Allies bring to the forward edge of NATO's sword. 
   The Alliance's singular dependence upon the United States is neither conducive to transatlantic unity nor is it the best way to provide an Alliance capability that is robust in the fullest sense of the term. An Alliance is simply not healthy if it is solely dependent upon the capabilities of but one member. 
   It is, thus, especially disturbing that both France and Germany announced planned cuts in their defense budgets just weeks after the end of Operation Allied Force. It raises questions as to how seriously they take this matter. 
   Second, the Kosovo war highlighted great gaps in inter-operability that divide Allied forces. No military commander has dedicated more time and focus on this urgent concern than General Klaus Naumann, who stepped down in April as Chairman of NATO's military Committee. He has repeatedly warned that ``the growing gap of capabilities which we see inside NATO ..... will lead to an inter-operability problem.'' 
   Operation Allied Force showed that this inter-operability problem is not a matter of military theory, but that it is matter of real and urgent concern. As we all know, Serbian forces were given advance warning of Allied attacks, including specific targets, when Allied aircraft were forced to communicate over open and insecure radio channels because they did not benefit from suitably compatible and secure communications systems. This, needless to say, undercut the effectiveness of the bombing campaign. More importantly, it subjected Allied pilots to unnecessarily greater danger. 
   Third, the Kosovo war highlighted the limited mobility of Allied forces. In April, I was disturbed to hear our nation's premier military experts assert that it would take months for the Alliance to deploy a ground force in the Balkans suitable for a forced entry into Kosovo or Serbia. Considering the relative size and capability of Serbia's armed forces to that of NATO and the proximity of Kosovo to available staging grounds for such a forced entry, this assertion does not reflect well on the mobility of NATO military capacities. 
   This is a matter relevant not only to our European Allies, but also to the United States as well. As the Kosovo War demonstrated, not every conflict of the future will be like that of Operation Desert Storm where the United States was able to use literally months to build-up the offensive force necessary to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. In 1991, NATO established its Rapid Reaction Corps. I repeat in 1991! Where was this corps and its rapidly deployable assets when NATO found itself confronted by a regime that was exponentially weaker and situated in its backyard, if not on its doorstep? 
   These are not new issues nor new conclusions. Burden-sharing has always been an acute thorn in the side of Alliance unity. For several years, numerous European and American 
   commanders, in addition to General Naumann, have been warning of the growing technology gap between the armed forces of the United States and Europe. And, NATO's own Strategic Concepts have been urging the Alliance to field forces that are rapidly deployable and assets that can sustain these forces over long distances and long periods of time. What is disturbing is that after nearly a decade, the need for such forces has been so loudly reaffirmed by the Kosovo war. 
   Considering what can happen in war, Operation Allied Force provides a not-so-gentle reminder of the need to more seriously address these challenges. If one believes, as I do, that one has to assume that NATO will in the future face contingencies more challenging than that presented in Kosovo, it is imperative that NATO do more than study these issues. Alliance members must dedicate the resources necessary to overcome these shortcomings. To quote General Naumann again, what ``we require [is] action, and not just more paper declarations.'' 
   In addition to reviewing and studying the insights provided by Operation Allied Force upon Allied military strategy and capabilities, we have to remember that NATO is first and foremost a political Alliance. The conduct and procedures used in the course of the Kosovo war by NATO's political authorities must also be reviewed and critiqued. 
   It was discomfiting, to say the least, to observe inter-Alliance disputes over target lists emerge on the public scene. NATO stumbled in the first phase of the campaign when individual NATO heads of state were personally reviewing and squabbling over daily targets lists. 
   These disputes, which concerned how to achieve ends through the use of force, raise a number of questions that must be addressed over the coming months. These include the following: 
   Was Operation Allied Force an example of coalition warfare or a ``war by committee.'' 
   Should the Alliance establish procedures that will further separate the political and diplomatic decisions defining the objectives of war as well as the decision to go to war from those military decisions through which the war is executed? 
   In the course of Operation Allied Force, did the SACEUR benefit from the flexibility and freedom of action his office requires in the conduct of war? Are there alternative arrangements between the SACEUR and the NAC that the Alliance should consider? 
   Does the SACEUR have sufficient command and control over his subordinate commanders? 
   With regard to the last question, it has been widely reported that in the course of the NATO-Russia showdown over the Pristina airport, British Commander General Robertson refused an order from SACEUR General Clark to seize that airport prior to the arrival of the Russian battalion. General Robertson balked at the order and successfully appealed to his British senior political authorities to have that order rescinded. This example demonstrated the inherently political nature of NATO's multi-national command structures, one that warrants close examination. 
   The questions I have raised constitute the core issues of coalition warfare. They are central to the Alliance's ability to sustain unity in times of crisis and conflict. They are also core issues of civilian control over the military, a cornerstone of democracy. 
   While it is widely known that many NATO officers were not totally enamored of the political constraints they were dealt in Operation Allied Force, the evidence currently available indicates that they accepted and respected these constraints. They fully respected the authorities of their civilian leaders. That is another overlooked NATO success story in Operation Allied Force. 
   In posing the aforementioned questions, the intention is not necessarily to yield structural change, but to ensure a fuller understanding of what to expect and demand of our Alliance's political and military leadership in times of conflict. In doing so we may be better 
   able, and I quote again General Naumann, ``to find a way to reconcile the conditions of a coalition war with the principles of military operations such as surprise and the use of overwhelming force.'' That sustaining Allied unity was one of the success stories of Operations Allied Force is a fact that shows how NATO manages war is as important a matter as the capacities NATO brings to war. 
   The Kosovo war also yielded lessons about another issue of great importance to the Alliance, the relationship between NATO and Russia. Over the last decade the alliance has made great efforts to transform that relationship into one of partnership. Toward that end, it invited Russia to join its Partnership to Peace Program, and in 1997 the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed establishing a unique consultative relationship between Brussels  and Moscow. This effort to build a genuine partnership must be continued, but it also must be pursued with greater realism. 
   The Kosovo war was the first major test of the progress made in relations between the Alliance and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Moscow's conduct in the course of this conflict and its immediate aftermath demonstrated that while Russia may not be the protagonist it was in the Cold War, it is certainly not a partner, at least not today. To paraphrase Russia analyst Tom Graham, Russia is more often than not, sometimes purposely and sometimes inadvertently, a troublesome problem. 
   A brief review of Russia's role in the Kosovo conflict underscores this point. First, remember that Russia still calls for NATO's dissolution. Second, from the very start of Operation Allied Force, Moscow harshly condemned the bombing campaign and sided with Slobodan Milosevic. Russia continued oil transfers to Serbia despite a request by nearly all other European democracies to impose an embargo. So-called ``Russian volunteers'' operated with Milosevic's forces in Kosovo and Serbia and with the blessing of Moscow authorities. Third, Russia's successful dash to Pristina and its airport required a great deal of coordination with Serbian authorities. Moreover, let us not forget that Russian and Serbian soldiers jointly manned roadblocks in Kosovo that impeded the movement of Allied units in the initial days of Operation Just Cause. 
   Russia's conduct in the course of Operation Allied Force and its self-invited role in Operation Just Cause demonstrated the volatility that still characterizes Russia's foreign policy, particularly its approach to NATO. Russian participation in NATO diplomatic and military operations is a double-edged sword, and has to be treated as such, particularly when sensitive Alliance operations are at stake. 
   Engaging Russia should remain a significant priority of the Alliance. Introducing greater realism to this effort does not mean isolating Russia. It does involve recognizing the difficult challenge of simultaneously promoting cooperation and mutual accommodation while avoiding propitiating risk-taking behavior by Moscow, such as that which occurred in Pristina. 
   The lesson from Kosovo is that while we must engage Russia with the goal of creating partnership, greater realism and caution in this endeavor is more likely to yield more stable and enduring cooperation. 
   The Kosovo war demonstrated the continued centrality of NATO to transatlantic security. It has demonstrated the awesome power that emanates from allied unity. It underscored the profound political and military pay-off that comes from fifty years of intensive military consultation, cooperation, coordination, joint planning, joint training, and all the day-to-day activities the Allied militaries conduct to protect and defend our common values and interests and peace. 
   The war over Kosovo tangibly reminded us of the military and political challenges NATO will likely face in the future. It was a firm reminder of the need for the Alliance's force structure to become more mobile and more capable of rapid deployment. It was an urgent call for improvements in the inter-operability of Allied forces and in the balance of transatlantic military capabilities. And it provided the first test of NATO's ability to manage war in the post-Cold War era. 
   As Operation Allied Force was NATO's first war, it is essential that we ensure that it is comprehensively reviewed. In objectively assessing what went right and wrong, we must keep our eyes upon NATO's future. We must also work to ensure that the lessons learned and relearned from Operation Allied Force will not just reside in dusty reports but actually prompt decisions and actions that improve NATO's ability to decisively manage the political and military levels of war.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of conference on the bill (H.R. 2488) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to sections 105 and 211 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, and ask for its immediate consideration.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the fundamental question before Congress these past few weeks, as we have debated the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, is quite simple: Is it right for Washington to take from the taxpayer more money than is necessary to run the Government? 
   The issue of tax relief is not any more complicated than that, and the outcome of the conference between the Senate and House makes it clear that we believe Government is not automatically entitled to the surplus that is, in large part, due to the hard work, thrift, and risk-taking of the American people. 
   Individuals and families are due a refund, and that is exactly what we do with this legislation. We give the people a refund. We do it in a way that is fair, broad based, and empowering. We do it in a way that will benefit nearly every working American, a way that will help restore equity to the Tax Code, and provide American families with the relief and resources they need to meet pressing concerns. 
   This tax refund legislation will help individuals and families save for self-reliance in retirement. It will help parents prepare for educational costs. It will give the self-employed and underinsured the boost they need to pay for health insurance, and it will begin to restore fairness to the Tax Code by addressing the marriage tax penalty. 
   How do we accomplish all of this? We begin by reducing our marginal income tax rates by a point. In other words, the 15-percent tax bracket will drop to 14 percent, and the 39.6-percent top rate will drop to 38.6 percent. The new 14-percent bracket will be extended upward to include millions of Americans who are now paying taxes in the 28-percent bracket. 
   These changes will benefit individuals and families across the economic spectrum. For example, an individual with $40,000 of income will save over $700. An individual earning $50,000 will save over $800. Under this bill, a taxpayer with $70,000 of income will save over $1,000. 
   This is significant tax relief. When fully phased in, a middle-class family of four with an adjusted gross income of $80,000 will save almost $3,000 a year. This is real savings, money that can be used by individuals and families to meet their pressing needs and objectives. 
   To restore equity to the Tax Code, this legislation also meets a bipartisan objective by providing relief for the marriage tax penalty, and it does this by doubling the standard deduction and the 15-percent tax bracket for married couples filing jointly. 
   We can all agree on how important this is. For too long, husbands and wives who have worked and paid taxes have been penalized by their dual incomes. This plan will address that inequity by giving working American couples greater relief. 
   Let me give an example. Two individuals, each making $35,000 a year, face a penalty of almost $1,500 when they marry. Under this legislation, that penalty will be addressed in two ways: first, by doubling the standard deduction and, second, by doubling the 15-percent tax bracket to include their combined income. 
   The marriage penalty relief offered in this bill retains the Senate position on the amount of relief received, and it even provides relief for people receiving the earned income tax credit. 
   To help families with their education expenses, the legislation before us allows taxpayers to increase their contributions to education IRAs, or what will--under the provisions of this bill--be called education savings accounts. Allowable contributions will rise from $500 to $2,000 annually. 
   And these funds will be available to meet expenses for all students, from kindergarten through college. Beyond increasing the level a family can save for education, this Tax Relief Act also makes interest earned on qualified State and private school higher education tuition plans tax free--a most important development, in my judgment. It also extends employer-provided educational assistance for undergraduate studies, and it repeals the 60-month rule on student loan interest deductions. This will allow individuals to claim tax deductions on interest that they pay on their student loan, without the imposition of a time limit. 
   To help families meet health care and long-term care needs, this legislation provides a 100 percent above-the-line deduction for those who pay more than 50 percent of their health insurance premiums. This, of course, includes the self-employed. The plan also provides an additional personal exemption for those who care for an elderly relative in their home. 
   As you can see, this legislation is, indeed, empowering; it addresses concerns that are vitally important in the lives of our families, coast to coast. It provides across-the-board tax relief. It addresses the marriage tax penalty. 
   It makes education more affordable for all students--kindergarten through college. And it helps our families meet their health care and long-term care needs. But it doesn't stop here; it does much more. 
   The legislation before us phases out the alternative minimum tax. It provides capital gains tax relief, simplifying the rate structure, and reducing the individual capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 18 percent, beginning with the current 1999 tax year. For those individuals taxed at the lowest individual rate, their capital gains tax rate is reduced from 10 percent to 8 percent. 
   In addition, the tax basis of certain assets may be increased by an ``inflation adjustment,'' so that any capital gain attributable to inflation is not subjected to tax. Also, we have maintained the 2 percent capital gains rate differential that is imposed on long-term capital gains from depreciable real estate, by reducing that rate from 25 percent to 23 percent. 
   Another very important measure is the treatment of estate taxes. This legislation completely phases out and ultimately repeals the Federal estate, gift, and generation skipping taxes. It also corrects technical problems in the House provision. 
   Each of these will be a powerful tool in the hands of taxpayers and families who will use these changes--their relief--to meet the needs that are unique to their situation. However, a couple of major provisions in this bill that I would like to outline in some detail will--like the across-the-board tax rate cut--benefit everyone, enabling individuals and families to prepare for self-reliance and success in retirement. These, of course, include the expansion of individual retirement accounts and pension programs. 
   Under the bill, IRA contribution limits will be increased over the next 7 years until they reach $5,000. And taxpayers who are close to retiring will be allowed to make catchup payments in their plans. These changes will in my judgment, be incredibly beneficial. For example, an individual without an employer-provided pension plan, who contributes the maximum amount allowable, as it increases over the next 7 years--with the magic of compounding interest--will be able to put away over $31,000 for retirement. In year 7 and beyond, he or she will be able to put away the full $5,000 annually. 
   With the catchup provision--applicable for people over the age of 50--if those 7 years pass just prior to the taxpayer's retirement, the amount, for example, he or she could save in those 7 years under this bill would be over $44,000. This bill also increases the income threshold for those who can take full advantage of Roth IRA accounts up to $200,000 for a couple filing jointly. 
   For employer-provided plans, this bill increases the maximum amount an individual can contribute to a 401(k) plan, a 403(b) plan or a 457 plan. Starting next year, an employee may contribute up to $11,000 to his employer's 401(k) plan In each year thereafter, he could contribute increasing amounts to his 401(k), and in 2005, he will be able to contribute a full $15,000. To show you how empowering this is, if John, a 35-year-old, contributes the maximum amount allowable over the next 30 years, his 401(k) plan benefit at retirement would increase by over $1.2 million.  
   In addition, if John's employer established a newly added Plus Account program under its 401(k) plan, that amount would be nontaxable when John receives it at retirement. The Plus Account program--as addressed in this bill--lets an employer establish an account which has the same tax treatment as a Roth IRA. That means that John would have over $1.2 million in nontaxable income. 
   Finally, this bill gives small businesses a new incentive to establish a retirement plan for their employees. The contribution limits for a SIMPLE plan--a defined contribution plan only for small businesses--have been increased in this bill to encourage small business owners to establish such plans. The incentive to establish a SIMPLE plan is easy to understand. Small business owners who offer SIMPLE plans will be able to save up to $10,000 in the plans they establish. 
   This will be a great benefit to them, but in order to save their own money--as part of the SIMPLE plan--they will have to provide their employees with a contribution to their own plans of up to 2 percent of their salary. 
   At the same time, under this plan the employees could also receive a matching contribution from their employer of up to 3 percent of compensation if they decide to contribute to the SIMPLE plan. 
   Now, I believe this is good policy. It will encourage Americans to take advantage of these opportunities and provide for their retirement future. As with almost every provision in this Taxpayer Refund Act, the catalyst is the individual and the family, using tax relief to meet their needs. Every measure I have outlined as part of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 is important, as each rightfully returns resources that Americans can use to meet their current needs, and the refund being offered comes from surplus funds. In other words, this broad-based tax relief package can be passed, signed into law, and, indeed, still leave sufficient resources in Washington to take care of Social Security, Medicare reform, and other necessary Government obligations. 
   Let me repeat that: This broad-based tax relief package can be passed, signed into law, and still leave sufficient non-Social Security funds available to address comprehensive Medicare reform, including a prescription drug benefit. We can offer this relief and still pay down the debt and keep the budget balanced. We can do all of this for one very simple reason: The work, the investment in job creation achieved by Americans everywhere, has succeeded in creating long-term economic growth. As I have said before, it is not right that the reward for this success is that today our taxes are the highest percent of our gross national product of any time in postwar history. 
   After paying for the Government programs for which Congress has planned and budgeted, a refund from the surplus must now be returned to the American taxpayer. 
   I know there is wide agreement that Americans deserve relief. This is the bill that will give them relief. We must and should support it. 
   We must keep in mind that major tax cuts must be done through the reconciliation process. This is, indeed, a lengthy, time-intensive process. We have successfully completed it. I am proud to say that this conference report, as it stands today, carries no provision that was not in either the House or Senate bill. In other words, nothing extraneous was added in conference. It is clean and representative of the direction received by those who crafted the Senate and House bills. 
   Frankly, this is a first in tax history. It represents a tremendous amount of work by our colleagues, Members of the House, and the staff in both Chambers. Those who believe we may be coming back to do this again in September are mistaken. This is the tax bill for this year. We won't have a second chance on this. When we come back after recess, our time and attention will be focused on Medicare reform, a vital issue that concerns us all. 
   For those who are concerned that this major relief package may be too big, please be reminded that there are important trigger mechanisms included in this bill. If we don't continue to reduce the payment on the interest on the national debt--let me repeat that--if we don't continue to reduce the payment on the interest on the national debt, then the tax relief included here will be reduced to compensate accordingly. 
   Well, the bottom line is that this is tax relief in which we can have confidence. It meets the criteria we established 
   before we began. It is fair. It restores equity to the Tax Code and makes education more affordable. It helps taxpayers prepare for self-reliance and retirement. This legislation will help families keep their homes, their farms, and businesses safe from death taxes. It makes health care more affordable. 
   I believe these are objectives that are shared by everyone. They are objectives that can be embraced by Senators and Congressmen on both sides of the political aisle. 
   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote for passage, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. I agree that this is an issue of concern to Finance Committee members. The cellular telephone industry is a high-growth, job-creating, industry. It is clear to any observer that the industry is frenetically competitive. Companies incur substantial marketing expenses, including sales commission, to attempt to sign up new customers and to entice customers to move from other carriers. 
   I have little doubt that the IRS's position requiring companies to capitalize the sales commissions may lead to years of litigation. The Treasury Department has made the decision to review the IRS's position. The agency included the issue in its 1999 Priority Guidance Plan and has advised the Committee that they plan to deal with the issue this year. 
   I strongly support the quick resolution of this issue by the Treasury Department. Sales commissions are a basic cost of doing business for cellular telephone companies, and I believe that the Treasury should be able to reach a sensible resolution of this issue.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as remains. I think it is 2 minutes. 
   As I said this morning, the fundamental question before Congress these past few weeks, as we have debated the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, is quite simple: Is it right for Washington to take from the taxpayer more money than is necessary to run Government? 
   The issue of tax relief isn't anymore complicated than that, and the outcome of the conference between the Senate and the House makes it clear that Government is not automatically entitled to the surplus that is, in large part, due to the hard work, thrift, and risk taking of the American people. Individuals and families are due a refund. That is exactly what we do with this legislation. We give the people a refund, and we do it in a way that is fair, broad based, and empowering. 
   Mr. President, I am ready to yield back the remainder of time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. Unrequested mailings are seen by many as a nuisance. But when junk mail makes insupportable and outrageous claims of instant wealth, phantom prices, and bogus benefits annoyance becomes fraud--the small print notwithstanding. 
   Among its provisions, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, S. 335, would place new requirements on sweepstakes offerings and allow fines to be levied on deceptive mailings. S. 335 would also require sweepstakes information to be presented clearly, and grants the Postal Service new authority to halt misleading mailings. I feel strongly that these reforms will benefit an untold number of American families and elderly persons from some unscrupulous elements of our society. 
   It pleases me to remark briefly on the genesis of this proposal. In my experience, the role of oversight and investigation has enabled the Congress to craft its most informed, well reasoned, and thorough legislative proposals. As past chairman of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation and current chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I have long used and will continue to use these tools to assess and reform. 
   I commend my successor as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation, Senator SUSAN COLLINS, for taking a thorough approach to crafting this proposal. Following a process of investigation and hearings, Senator COLLINS has applied the right tools to a common problem. The people of Maine, Delaware, and the rest of our Nation will benefit from her hard work.

   Mr. ROTH. Actually, Mr. President, I want to add my support for the amendment put forward by Senator HUTCHISON. It builds on the basic objectives of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, particularly objectives of helping families bring greater equity to the Tax Code. 
   One very important provision of the tax relief package we have proposed is the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. There is strong bipartisan agreement that this penalty is not only unfair but that it is counterproductive in a way that discourages couples from marrying. 
   When I introduced the Taxpayer Refund Act 2 days ago, I introduced Robert and Dianne, a hypothetical couple who had fallen in love and wanted to marry. I explained how, as individuals, they would not be considered wealthy, how Robert worked as a foreman in an auto plant and Dianne worked as a nurse. I then explained how, as a married couple with a combined income, they would be considered well off and how they would end up paying the Government $1,500 more in taxes than they would if they remained single. 
   The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 does away with the marriage tax penalty. It completely eliminates the penalty for Robert and Dianne and for any other couples who choose to marry. What I like about the amendment introduced by our distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, is that under her plan the tax relief is expedited. This is done at a price. The change does require the delay of other provisions that provide relief for the taxpayer. I regret that. But we do think it is desirable to provide marriage relief as early as possible. 
   Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, although the Kerry amendment is well-intended, it is not germane to this reconciliation bill. The Finance Committee is paying close attention to the concerns of health care providers and beneficiaries. Over ten Medicare hearings have been held this year, three focusing specifically on BBA 1997 policies. 
   The Finance Committee is also developing a Medicare package that will address the many concerns in the Balanced Budget Act. The tax package in no way interferes with this process. 
   Finally, I might add that even the President's Medicare proposal sets aside a maximum of only $7.5 billion over 10 years to address BBA fixes, $12.5 billion less than this amendment. 
   The amendment is not germane to this reconciliation legislation, and I raise a point of order under section 305 (b)(2) of the Budget Act.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this motion. In a very real way, this is the final vote on the legislation before us. Let me point out that both Democrats and Republicans have broadly agreed that there should be a tax cut. That tax cut should be now. The American people are entitled to relief. What we are really doing here is restoring the excess taxes already paid. For that reason, I shall make a motion to table. 
   Let me reemphasize again, the Democrats have had a proposal of $300 billion in a tax cut. There has been a $500 billion tax cut. We have followed the budget recommendations of $792 billion. To deny the working people of America the tax break they deserve today makes no sense at all. 
   For that reason, I move to table the motion to recommit, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator SCHUMER's amendment would provide a full tax deduction for higher education and a tax credit for student loans. While I recognize that we need to assist American families with the cost of higher education, I cannot support this amendment. The costs of this amendment are enormous. I understand that it would cost something like $25 billion over 10 years, but the pay-for would delay the AMT relief that is provided in this bill. That delay would impact on working Americans, depriving them of the child credit, personal exemptions, and, ironically, educational benefits such as the HOPE scholarship and lifetime earnings. 
   Mr. President, I regret that I must make a point of order against the amendment under section 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds it is not germane.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The poultry provision in the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 meets three important criteria: 
   First, it facilitates the development and use of alternative fuel to generate clean electricity--energy that is not only abundant, but environmentally friendly. Certainly, in this summer of rolling brownouts, we cannot overstate how important this is.  
   Second, the poultry provision in this bill addresses the need to safely and effectively dispose of chicken waste. Poultry production in the United States has tripled since 1975. Along with this growth, comes the waste, and the need to dispose of it. 
   And third, the poultry provision in the bill demonstrates Congress' willingness to help our poultry farmers, while encouraging technological advances. Providing incentives for facilities that turn chicken waste into clean energy is consistent with our objectives. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and to support the production of clean electricity--production that will help America meet its energy needs, while helping our farmers and protecting our environment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, section 202 of S. 1429 makes certain that the marriage penalty relief in the bill also applies to married couples receiving earned-income tax credits. Thus, the provision violates the Budget Act because it increases outlays. 
   In order to protect the provision against a point of order, I move to waive any point of order against section 202 in this legislation, a subsequent conference report, or in an amendment between the Houses if such point of order is made on the grounds that the enhancement of the earned-income tax credit for married couples is an increase in outlays.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator GRAMM has provided Members with a straightforward alternative to the bipartisan Finance Committee bill. I compliment him on the clarity of his approach, much of which I favor. Although provisions of Senator GRAMM's substitute have appeal for me, frankly, I could not have used it as a basis for the Finance Committee. His proposal contains elements that would not garner a majority of committee members. 
   In addition, Senator GRAMM's substitute, though popular with many in the Senate Republican caucus, would not pick up support on the other side of the aisle. For that reason, his proposal would not be a blueprint for tax cuts, in the form of a signable bill, that we can deliver to the American people now. 
   Finally, although Senator GRAMM's amendment is simpler, it leaves out many bipartisan tax measures that address important tax issues. For instance, education savings incentives are deleted. This means parents who want to save for a child's college education would be left out of the picture. We're talking about millions of parents and students in every state. 
   Yet another example is the student loan interest deduction. Under the Finance Committee bill, at least three million graduates, bearing the burden of college debt, would be allowed to deduct student loan interest on their tax returns. 
   In my legislation I try to focus on matters of need to the American family. I provide incentives to promote savings, pensions, IRAs. Many in retirement depend not only on Social Security, which we will address, but also on personal savings and pensions. My bill addresses that. There is nothing to correct the problems of AMT, the alternative minimum tax. Unfortunately, thousands upon thousands of American families will be hit by AMT and not enjoy the full benefit of many programs such as the child tax credit. 
   Finally, nothing is done with respect to charitable giving. We have proposals that will promote and create incentives. 
   For these and other reasons, I must oppose Senator GRAMM's well-intentioned amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take off the bill. 
   Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have attacked the Reagan tax cut. With that I strongly disagree. 
   I have no argument with those who want to bring up history in their attempt to argue against the need for this tax relief package. But I do have an argument when they attempt to change facts and debunk what was--and continues to be--a tremendous economic legacy. 
   First, let me make it clear that cutting taxes to keep the economy strong did not begin with President Reagan--nor is the idea isolated to one political party or the other. 
   In the 1960s, President Kennedy ushered America into economic expansion with his own historic tax cuts. 
   In fact, in recalling our history it might help us to remember President Kennedy's statement to the Economic club of New York in December 1962. On that occasion, he said:  
   Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that...an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never product enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.  
   Second, the facts concerning President Reagan's economic record are very clear: everyone benefited from the broad based 25 percent across-the-board tax cuts signed into law by President Reagan. The facts show that all income groups saw their incomes rise during the period of 1980 to 1989. The facts show that during that period, the mean average of real income rose by 15.2 percent, compared to a 0.8 percent decline from 1970 to 1980. 
   And what of record-setting deficits? Did cutting taxes 25 percent across the board deplete the Treasury revenues? Absolutely not. Again, the records, the facts show that Federal revenues actually exploded. As Americans grew in wealth, Treasury revenues grew. Between 1981 and 1987, they grew 42 percent. 
   The deficits remind my debunking colleagues--were not created by cutting taxes and stimulating economic growth; they were the product of a Congress that refused to hold the line on spending. While revenues increased 42 percent, following those tax cuts, spending increased by 50 percent. 
   And, my colleagues, that is unlikely to happen after this tax relief package becomes law, as Congress is largely controlled by the same individuals who--2 years ago--passed the first balanced budget in a generation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. President, no one in the Senate is more concerned about Medicare and the program's beneficiaries than members of the Finance Committee. This year alone, our committee has held a  dozen hearings looking into the needs and future of this important program. We are firm in our commitment to strengthen and preserve Medicare for the Americans who are now a part of the program, and for those who will depend on it in the years ahead. 
   One of our areas of focus concerns prescription drug benefits, and we appreciate the seriousness with which the senior Senator from Massachusetts takes this issue. However, now is not the time and place to address this issue. 
   The carefully crafted bipartisan Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 leaves over $500 billion of the surplus for Congress to carefully weigh and meet the needs and long-term viability of Medicare. In September, we will turn our attention to addressing this most important concern. 
   But we should not be pressured into simply accepting something that requires our most careful and studied attention. 
   Testifying before the Finance Committee only last week, Comptroller General David M. Walker made it clear that Congress must take great care as we address Medicare reform. He reminded us that Congress has learned some sobering lessons about moving forward, pressed by political expediency to alter such an important program, without benefiting from careful study and deliberation. 
   ``Effectiveness,'' Comptroller Walker reminded our committee, ``involves collecting the data necessary to assess impact--separting the transitory from the permanent, and the trivial from the important.'' 
   ``Steadfastness is needed,'' Mr. Walker said, ``when particular interests pit the primacy of needs against the more global interest of making Medicare affordable, sustainable, and effective for current and future generations of Americans. 
   This makes it all the more important that any new benefit expansion be carefully designed to balance needs and affordability both now and over the longer term.'' 
   Mr. President, Congress cannot haphazardly paste one politically motivated change after another on the Medicare program and call it reform. We must be careful. We must be deliberate. To know how important this is, we simply need to harken back to 1988, when Congress--again out of politics, and in a rush--pasted together the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act. 
   Within six months of enacting that legislation, Congress and the people realized the debacle, and we were forced to repeal it within the year. 
   So we've been down this road before, Mr. President. A rush to legislation that not only failed to serve those whom we intended to help, but that actually set back progress more than a decade. 
   There is no question that Medicare reform is necessary. And there is agreement on both sides of the aisle that prescription drugs for the elderly must be a critical component of the reform. But now is not the time to address this issue. I can assure you that the committee will continue to proceed with Medicare reform as a top priority. We look forward to working with Senator KENNEDY and others who are concerned about this issue. Likewise, we will continue to give the President's recent proposal careful consideration. 
   By proceeding methodically, but cautiously, Mr. President, Congress will construct a reform package that is complete--one that meets the pressing needs in the lives of the seniors who depend on the Medicare program. The amendment Senator KENNEDY offers--as well as the President's prescription drug benefit, as it now stands--provides only limited coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. 
   By waiting ..... by proceeding constructively ..... and by working in a bipartisan effort to reform Medicare, Congress will--in the end--provide a more complete and lasting reform--reform that will prepare the Medicare program for the new millennium. 
   This effort does not have to wait long. The Finance Committee intends to continue our work on Medicare reform following the August recess. 
   I fully intend to include a prescription drug option as part of the plan we will offer. At that time, the Senate will be able to more fully and carefully examine reform legislation. This will be in the long-term interests of everyone. 
   I compliment Senator KENNEDY on his continuing commitment in addressing social needs, but now is not the time to move on it. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Senator BREAUX and Senator CHAFEE have thoughtfully crafted an amendment that offers a $500 billion tax cut. As with the alternative introduced yesterday by my friend, the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator BREAUX's amendment demonstrates that there is agreement on both sides of the aisle concerning the need to give individuals and families a well-deserved tax refund from the $3.3 trillion surplus. 
   I appreciate the fact that Senator BREAUX, with his amendment, offers a deeper cut than the alternative introduced yesterday, but I am concerned that it still does not go far enough. It does not go far enough in providing the much needed relief Americans require to meet the necessary and important priorities in their lives. It does not go far enough to offer broad-based tax relief that will be necessary to gain the bipartisan support needed to pass this bill in the Senate. 
   For example, Mr. President, the Breaux amendment does not lower the  15-percent tax bracket. Instead, it simply expands it by only $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for joint returns. And this benefit is only available for people who do not itemize. This means that if you take a deduction for home mortgage interest you will not receive a tax rate cut, under this bill. Additionally, because the 15-percent bracket is not reduced, the tax relief is not felt by middle-income taxpayers in that bracket, nor is there a reduction for those paying taxes in the higher brackets. 
   The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 cuts the 15 percent rate to 14 percent and broadens the 14-percent bracket by twice as much as what the Breaux amendment would do at the higher 15-percent rate. 
   The Breaux amendment also falls short when it comes to providing family tax relief. For example, the Taxpayer Refund Act offers $222 billion for family tax relief. The Breaux bill only provides $43 billion. When it comes to providing families with the relief they both need and deserve, the amendment offered by Senator BREAUX is only 20 percent of the relief offered in our more complete package. 
   As with relief to families, this amendment also comes up short in providing health care relief. Where the Taxpayer Refund Act offers $52 billion in health-related cuts, this amendment offers only $32 billion, or roughly $20 billion less. The Shortfall can be seen in specific areas such as long-term care, where this amendment would not allow an employer to provide such long-term care coverage as part of its employee benefits package. 
   Another important difference between the Taxpayer Refund Act and this amendment is the area of estate tax relief. We have heard eloquent and persuasive arguments these past two days concerning how important it is that Congress provide American families with relief from death taxes. And our legislation offers almost $63 billion in relief. This will help countless families save the businesses, farms, and ranches that have been built by parents and grandparents. 
   It is good for these families, and for America, as it protects their work and sacrifice. Unfortunately, this amendment only contains a third of the relief that these families would receive from our legislation. 
   Mr. President, I compliment Senator BREAUX for the work he has done on this amendment. It certainly offers more than the alternative that the Senate voted against yesterday. Like yesterday's alternative, it shows that there is bipartisan support for relief, but it does not go far enough. It does not go far enough in the area of family tax relief. 
   It does not go far enough in the area of savings and investment. It does not provide enough health care tax relief, nor does it provide enough relief against death taxes. 
   As I said when I spoke against the Democratic alternative yesterday, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 is built on the proposition that the income Americans earn belongs to them; that when government sets a budget and receives revenues in taxes to meet the budget obligations, government--by the will of the people--receives what it needs to pay the bills; and that when the people have given government more than what the budget calls for, well, then that money should be returned to the people. 
   It's that simple, Mr. President. And with that understanding, Congress passed a budget resolution authorizing the Finance Committee to cut taxes by $792 billion over 10 years. The Finance Committee, with bipartisan support, met that responsibility and, as a result, has offered the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. What we have offered is a broad-based tax relief plan that will benefit all Americans--one that is fair, constructive, and empowering. 
   Our plan will help restore equity to the tax code and provide American families with the relief and resources they need to meet pressing concerns. It will help individuals and families save for self-reliance in retirement. It will help parents prepare for educational costs. It will give the self-employed and under-insured the boost they need to pay for health insurance. It will begin to restore fairness to the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty. 
   These are all important goals. And, as with the Democratic alternative, this amendment also falls far short of accomplishing all that we do with our broad-based plan. This amendment will leave many taxpayers without the relief they deserve. For that reason, I encourage my colleagues to vote against it. 
   Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROTH. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Texas. 
   One of the frustrating things of putting a bill together, although I have to admit it is a very interesting challenge that I much enjoy, is the fact that there are so many things I believe should be done for the American family. It is frustrating that there are limitations as to what we can do. I agree with the distinguished Senator that nothing is more important than eliminating this marriage penalty. Obviously, the sooner we can do it, the better off we are. I thank her for her leadership. 
   For the information of all Senators, I do want to make clear that my concern with the pending amendment had been that it would put us out of compliance with our reconciliation instructions. I was also concerned that the earlier version of the amendment would have relied heavily on delaying the AMT relief. 
   And this delay would hit middle-income Americans very hard. 
   But now we understand, of course, that the Senator from Texas will offer a modification to the filed amendment which will alleviate this offset problem. For that I am very grateful. With these changes, I just say, I look forward to working with the Senator from Texas on having this amendment enacted. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Thank you, Senator COVERDELL. As you are aware, I have been a supporter of this legislation in the past, and I will continue to support this legislation in the future. 
   This bipartisan proposal is an outstanding example of our ability to use the tax code, to help millions of middle class American families across the country. By using the tax code to encourage families to save for their children's education needs and expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the education IRA will result in greater opportunities for every American child and their families. With education savings accounts, 14 million families--over 20 million kids--will take advantage of the expanded education IRAs, generating billions of dollars in education savings that might otherwise not exist. It is an outstanding way to provide families new and innovative options in education. 
   Because this legislation has the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate and is contained in the House-passed bill, I believe it should be given every consideration by the conferees during the negotiations of the conference report.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I don't think there is any parent who hasn't had the experience of sending a child into a store with a $20 bill to buy a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, or perhaps a dozen eggs, and the child returns with the few essentials. In a demonstration of maturity and responsibility, the child returns the change to his or her parent. There is no question who the change belongs to. After all, the parent earned the money; it is needed to support the family; the family will certainly have important uses for it later. The child understands this. So does the parent. Most often, the change is returned to the household budget to take care of other important needs. 
   Washington needs to demonstrate the same responsibility when it comes to determining what to do with the change that is left over from running the government. There are surplus revenues in the Treasury. As with a child emerging from the grocery store, there is change--big change--left over after Congress has met the necessities of running government. 
   In trying to balance the budget in 1997, Congress miscalculated the revenues that would be generated by the economy. At the same time, the hard work, the thrift, investment, and risk-taking of Americans combined to create an unexpected windfall of revenue. Now the question Washington seems to be grappling with concerns who rightly deserves the windfall. It is a question any parent or child can answer. American families, those who created the wealth in the first place, those who need their precious resources to meet future basic needs at home, are rightly entitled to the revenues they have earned, revenues Washington did not plan for to meet the expense of government, from which Washington had budgeted. 
   Now, as the child returning change for the $20, we must hand back the money. We must do it in a broad-based way that is fair to those who provided the funds to Washington in the first place. We must do it through broad-based tax relief that helps individuals and families at all income levels meet real needs. 
   The broad-based tax relief plan that passed out of the Finance Committee with bipartisan support will do just that. It will benefit nearly every working American. It will help restore equity to the Tax Code and provide American families with the resources they need to meet pressing concerns. It will help individuals and families save for self-reliance and retirement. It will help parents prepare for educational costs. It will give the self-employed and underinsured the boost they need to pay for health insurance. It will begin to restore fairness to the Tax Code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty. 
   Let me state exactly how the plan works and why it has received bipartisan support. This tax cut package will provide broad relief by reducing the 15-percent tax bracket that serves as the baseline for all taxpayers to 14 percent. In other words, no matter which tax bracket a family may be in, by cutting the 15-percent bracket, everyone will benefit as they will pay 14 percent on their first portion of taxable income. 
   At the same time, this plan expands the 14 percent bracket, dropping millions of Americans who are now paying taxes at 28 percent down to the lower bracket. 
   For a middle-income family of four, these two changes will mean a tax savings of over $450 a year. And these provisions have already found bipartisan support. 
   To restore equity to the Tax Code, this plan targets another bipartisan objective by eliminating the marriage tax penalty. For too long, husbands and wives who have worked and paid taxes have been penalized by their dual incomes. I have heard of some couples who have actually chosen not to marry because of the tax penalties their marriage would incur. 
   This plan will fix that by giving working married couples the option of filing combined returns, using separate schedules to take advantage of the single filer tax rates and the single filer standard deduction. 
   This is a change that is long overdue. American families have been suffering under the unfair burden of the marriage tax penalty for too long. A simple example shows us why: 
   Robert and Diane are two single Americans who have fallen in love and want to marry. They are not considered wealthy. In fact, Robert is a hardworking foreman at an auto factory. Susan, his fiancee, is an experienced nurse. Each makes roughly $50,000 a year. Now, under current law--when the file their separate tax returns--they each take a personal exemption and the standard deduction, giving them a taxable income of $43,000. After applying the tax rates for singles, they each owe tax of about $8,745. 
   If, however, Robert and Diane follow their hearts--get married and start a family--they realize that their total combined income would be $100,000. Should they marry, they would no longer be considered middle-class individuals, but many would regard them as a wealthy family, and under current law their combined income would be reduced by their two personal exemptions and by the standard deduction for married couples. 
   And here is where they would hit their first marriage penalty problem, discovering that their new standard deduction is significantly less than the combination of the two standard deductions they receive as singles. 
   But the marriage penalty does not end there. In fact, it gets worse. With their combined income, Robert and Diane--now considered by many to be wealthy--would have a taxable income of $87,400. This is where they would hit their second marriage penalty problem. 
   The lowest tax rate bracket for married couples is less than twice as wide as the lowest tax rate bracket for singles. In other words, more of their income would now be taxable at higher rates. The result would be a total tax bill of $18,967, almost $1,500 more than they would have paid as singles. That steep increase would come at a time when they could least afford it, a time when just starting out as a married couple they would be looking to buy a home, raise a family, and save for education. 
   The legislation we introduce today--this broad-based tax relief--completely eliminates the marriage penalty for Robert and Diane. The Senate Finance Committee bill will allow Robert and Diane to file a joint return, but to calculate their tax liability as if they had remained single. They would each get the benefit of the more generous standard deduction and of the more generous rate brackets. Under this new approach, they would pay a total tax of $17,490 which is the combination of what they had each paid before. This saves them almost $1,500. 
   But in restoring equity to the tax code, we do not stop with the marriage penalty. Another important measure contained in this broad-based tax relief plan is the elimination of the alternative minimum tax for middle-income families--families like David and Margaret Klaassen. Most of us know their  story. The Tenth Circuit recently affirmed that under the current law, the Klaassens are required to pay the alternative minimum tax despite the fact that it may not have been Congress' intent to impact families like the Klaassens when Congress passed the AMT. 
   David and Margaret Klaassen are the parents of 10 dependent children. They had an adjusted gross income of $83,000 and roughly $19,000 of itemized deductions relating to state and local taxes, medical expenses, interest, and charitable contributions. Their reported adjusted gross income was $63,500, and with 12 personal exemptions their taxable income was $34,000, resulting in regular tax of $5,100. 
   That would seem fair. And the Klaassens paid the bill. However, the IRS flagged the return and determined that the family was liable for the alternative minimum tax, a provision in the code that was passed to make sure that wealthy individuals and families do not escape at least some liability through tax shelters and other tools they might use to minimize their liability. The IRS determined an AMT deficiency of $1,100. For AMT purposes, the Klaassens were disallowed a $3,300 deduction for State and local taxes. 
   In addition, $2,100 in medical expenses were disallowed because of the 10-percent floor for AMT purposes. And finally, the Klaassens' entire $29,000 deduction for personal exemptions was disallowed because of the AMT. These adjustments resulted in alternative minimum taxable income of $68,000--twice the taxable income that the Klaassens had without the AMT. 
   This simply is not fair. It is not what Congress intended. The Finance Committee bill will help return fairness to the tax code by allowing families to receive the full benefits from their personal exemptions. This will also restore taxpayers' ability to receive their $500 per child tax credits, and other benefits that were intended to be available to middle-income families. 
   These are changes that are long overdue. Again, they have strong bipartisan support. But our broad-based Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 does so much more. 
   This plan will also help individuals and families find self-reliance and security in retirement through expanded individual retirement accounts, as well as through enhanced 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans and 457 plans. These are critical programs--programs that along with Social Security and personal savings help individuals prepare for their golden years. 
   For savings through the workplace, there are 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans and 457 plans, each of which can be sponsored by different types of employers. For individual savings, there is either the traditional IRA or the Roth IRA. And all these different savings vehicles have different limits on how much individuals can save. However, our current system can do more, and the limitations that we placed on retirement savings in times of budgetary restraints should be reexamined in light of the current surplus. For example, the IRA contribution limit has not changed since 1982. 
   Had it simply been indexed for inflation, it would be almost $5,000 today. What an opportunity that would present middle-class families to prepare for their futures. And that's exactly who benefits from IRAs--middle- and lower-income Americans. 
   Fifty-two percent of all IRA owners earn less than $50,000. This same group makes about 65 percent of all IRA contributions, and right now they are limited by the $2,000 cap on contributions. IRS statistics also show that the average contribution level in 1993 for people with less than $20,000 in income was $1,500. 
   Clearly, if the average contribution of modest-income taxpayers is $1,500, this demonstrates that many of these Americans want to make contributions of more than the $2,000 limit. This tax relief bill will incrementally increase the amount that people can contribute to IRAs from $2,000 to $5,000. 
   In the area of employer-provided savings vehicles, the current maximum pre-tax contribution to a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) annuity is $10,000. 
   In addition, the maximum contribution to a 457(b) plan is $8,000. Finally, the maximum contribution to a SIMPLE plan is $6,000. These limits are indexed for cost-of-living increases. 
   There has traditionally been a differential in contribution limits among the various types of plans: IRAs having the lowest limits; SIMPLE plans having a greater limit, but not as much as a 401(k) plan; and 401(k) and 403(b) plans having the highest limits, but the greatest number of regulations. 
   Since the IRA limit will be raised to $5,000, the bill will increase limits for 401(k) and 403(b) plans to $15,000 and for SIMPLE plans to $10,000; thereby continuing the differential. The limit for 457(b) plans for government employees will increase to $10,000. 
   There is no question, with rising concerns about security and self-reliance in retirement, that these changes are needed. They will go a long way toward helping individuals and families achieve their economic goals. But the benefits this legislation has for retirement planning do not stop here. 
   There are other provisions that will add new retirement vehicles, provide greater ability to transfer retirement savings between plans, promote retirement plans for small businesses, and simplify the retirement plan system for both employers and employees. 
   One provision will allow employees 50 years old or older to make catch-up contributions to their retirement plans. This will be most important for women, benefiting those who may have started their retirement savings late or who may have taken time off to raise children. 
   Whatever the reason, once these individuals have reached 50, they will be eligible to make additional contributions to their retirement plans that are equal to 50 percent of their plans' maximum allowable contribution. In other words, their total annual contribution could be 150 percent of the normal contribution. 
   Beyond restoring equity to the tax code and helping Americans prepare for retirement, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 will also help individuals and families gain access to health care--particularly those who are self-employed, or who are not covered by their employers--this legislation will enhance the tax deductibility of health insurance. It does this by accelerating the full deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed and by providing the same benefit on a phased-in basis to employees who are not covered by their employers. 
   In detail, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 will provide an above-the-line deduction for health insurance and for long-term care for which the taxpayer pays at least 50 percent of the premium. It will allow long-term care insurance to be offered in cafeteria plans and provide an additional dependency deduction to caretakers of elderly family members. To benefit small businesses, this legislation will accelerate the 100 percent deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals beginning in 2000. 
   To help make education more affordable for families and students, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 strengthens educational savings opportunities by making college tuition plans tax-free. In other words, families--including grandparents, aunts, and uncles--can invest their after-tax income into a child's educational future. And when that money is used by the child, it will be tax-free on buildup and withdrawal. 
   This legislation also increases student loan interest deduction income limits for single taxpayers by $10,000 and adjusts the beginning income limits for married couples filing joint returns to twice that of a single taxpayer. Beyond these important changes, this tax relief plan promotes education by making deductions for employer provided assistance permanent, and by allowing employer assistance to be used for graduate-level courses. 
   Again, these are necessary changes--changes that will help families meet their priorities. 
   Another important component of this tax relief package involves its treatment of estate and gift taxes. Here, our objective is to protect families, farmers, and small business men and women who have worked their whole lives to build a future for their posterity. Members of the Senate Finance Committee can recall the heartrending testimony of Lee Ann Goddard Ferris whose 71-year-old father died in a tragic farming accident in Lost River Valley, Idaho. For more than 60 years, her family had worked the land. 
   They owned over 2,600 acres--2,600 acres that had been purchased through  decades of toil. In Lee Ann's own words, ``My father's death was the most devastating event that any of us has ever gone through. The second most devastating event was sitting down with our estate attorney after his death. I'll never forget his words. The estate attorney said, `There is no way you can keep this place, absolutely no way.' '' 
   Still suffering from her father's accidental death, Lee Ann couldn't believe what she was hearing. ``How can this be?'' she asked. ``We own this land. We have no debt! We just lost my father, and now we are going to lose the ranch?'' According to Lee Ann, ``Our attorney proceeded to pencil out the estate taxes ..... and we all sat in total shock.'' 
   Where is the fairness, Mr. President? Here a family works for more than half a century to build a ranch, only to hear that estate taxes would rob them of their legacy, their heritage, their home. 
   ``This tax situation has put a tremendous strain on my mother,'' Lee Ann testified. ``Mother worries constantly and has had many sleepless nights. I don't know if any of you could ever imagine how hard it has been on her. She doesn't have her husband anymore. She worked hard her whole life and gave up a lot of material things to put her after-tax dollars back into the land to pay it off. Now, unless this tax law is changed or abolished, she will have to leave her home, which she loves, and our family will not have a base from which to carry on.'' 
   With this legislation, Congress will do something to protect these families. The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 turns the unified estate tax credit into a true exemption, and it increases the exemption from $1 million to $1.5 million. This legislation also significantly reduces the actual estate tax rate, and it increases the annual gift tax exclusion from $10,000 to $20,000 by the year 2006. 
   Each of the measures I have outlined as part of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 is vitally important to the well-being of all families; 
   each is a key component of this tax relief package. Again, our purpose is to be broad-based--to provide the most meaningful tax relief possible--to do it in a way that families can meet their individual needs--and to present a plan that can receive strong bipartisan support. 
   With this major tax relief package--$792 billion over 10 years--we meet all of these criteria. And, in the process, we leave over $500 billion to meet pressing concerns here in Washington, such as preserving and strengthening Medicare. 
   We are able to do all this and to keep the budget balanced for a simple reason: the work, the investment, and the job creation achieved by Americans everywhere have succeeded in creating long-term economic growth. 
   It is not right that the reward for this success is that today our taxes are the highest percent of our gross national product than at any other time in postwar history. These same Americans--the authors of this success story--are rightful heirs to the wealth they are creating. After paying for the Government programs for which Congress has planned and budgeted, the change must now be returned to the taxpayer. 
   This legislation not only returns the change by cutting taxes, it increases access to healthcare; it makes education more affordable; it helps taxpayers prepare for self-reliance and retirement; it keeps their home, farm, and family business safe from death taxes. These are objectives that are shared by everyone. They are objectives that can be embraced by Senators and Congressmen on both sides of the political aisle. They are objectives that can be made realities by being passed into law. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   I yield the floor.

   I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
   Mr. President, the point of order against section 1502 is made necessary by the antiquated provision of the Budget Act where provisions were drawn to function in an era of deficits. 
   Even though the Senate instructed the Finance Committee to cut taxes, almost everyone understood those instructions to mean the tax cuts would be permanent. 
   Nevertheless, we must contend with the language of section 313(b)(1)(e) of the Budget Act which forbids any reconciliation bill from achieving a net reduction in revenue beyond the 10 years for which the committee was instructed.  
   Of course, achieving a net reduction in revenues is our goal, as well as our instructions. 
   Moreover, the Budget Act provision in question was not written with this situation in mind. It was not written to hinder refunds of a budget surplus. Rather, it was written to bar creative accounting provisions, such as those offered on this floor to delay the timing of expenditures, or to accelerate the timing of revenue. 
   These were one-time only provisions designed to occur at the end of the window--not for any policy reason but only to achieve compliance for a moment in time with the relevant instructions. 
   I remember a military pay installment was once moved from the last day of one fiscal year to the first day of the next year, which was outside the window, to achieve budgetary savings in the earlier years. But no provision of that sort is contained in this bill. 
   Rather, the question here is whether any tax relief can be permanent except for a very small percent of tax provisions. 
   It is a general rule that tax relief is permanent. This was true with the last tax bill, which provided an actual tax cut--the Tax Relief Act of 1997. But that bill was paired with a balanced budget act of the same year, the savings of which far exceeded the tax cut then provided. 
   Today, we face a new question under the Budget Act because it is unnecessary to pair this tax cut with another bill to cut spending. It is unnecessary because we have already achieved the goal that such a spending bill would hope to achieve, a surplus to fund a tax cut. 
   In my opinion, the Budget Act provision makes no sense if applied to the current circumstances. 
   Everything I have said applies in equal measure to the Democratic alternative, and every other tax cut Members are anxious to propose on the floor this week. 
   In sum, everyone thought we were instructed to achieve permanent tax relief. That was the commonsense understanding. That is the better tax policy. I urge support for the waiver to protect this legislation against an arcane budget rule never intended to apply to this situation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, if we do not waive it with respect to the conference report, then we put the conference in a very difficult position. Should it write a bill for 10 years, or should it write one for a permanent tax cut? 
   Just let me point out that I don't know of a single tax cut taking place since we have had the Budget Act that was not permanent. I don't think there is a single person in the Finance Committee or on the floor who thought  otherwise--that when you had tax cuts it was necessarily going to be permanent. That is just common sense. 
   We all know that the point of the Byrd rule in this case was to avoid monkey business. We have all seen that happen, where you shift payment from one fiscal year to the next year by changing it but for 1 day and, by doing that, you assure that you are in compliance with the budget instructions in theory but not in substance. 
   Now, we are all interested in seeing this economy continue to grow and prosper. One of the purposes of the tax cut is to ensure that it will happen. I am weary of those who are saying, well, this is going to cause inflation, and so forth. That is just plain rubbish. If you look at our tax cut, practically nothing happens the first year--a very small tax cut. For the first 5 years, it is something like $156 billion. So the big tax cut is 5 years off. 
   Let me make the point: Congress will be in session. People will be here. They will be able to take appropriate action. If it is thought that the tax cut is not desirable, there is nothing to prevent them from changing it. But let me just say, common sense--and that is what the American people want to see displayed here on the Senate floor--common sense is that when you have a tax cut, it is permanent. 
   Every substitute, every amendment to be offered here is permanent. Even the Democratic substitute is permanent. Every reconciliation before on spending or taxes, whether it was a Republican Congress or a Democratic Congress, has made permanent changes. Every reconciliation bill has depended on projections. There is nothing new about that. This bill is no different. It is not reckless; it is not radical; it is traditional and common sense. 
   As I said earlier, everyone thought we were instructed to achieve permanent tax relief. That was the commonsense understanding. This is by far and away the better tax policy. 
   I urge Members to support the waiver to protect this legislation against an arcane budget rule never intended to apply to this situation. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Mr. President, my good friend and colleague, the Senator from Virginia, raised the question as to why a tax cut now, what is the hurry; the economy is doing well. Let me tell you why I think it is critically important we have a tax cut now. That is because the American family needs it. 
   In going home and talking to my constituents, talking to many families, whether they are farmers or small businessmen, or whomever, they are finding it hard to face the challenges of today. The cost of sending a child to college is increasing very rapidly and is taxing the typical American family.  We provide relief in this package for the American family who is trying to send their children to college. They are trying to send their children to college today, not 5 or 10 years hence. That is the reason it is important. 
   I point out there is something like 42 million families without health insurance. There is no hurry to try to address that, as we do in this legislation? We provide that someone who is self-employed or an employee who works for a company that has no health insurance can take a tax deduction for their insurance. That is helping to provide access today. None of us know whether we will be sick today, tomorrow, or in a week. There is a need for that today, not 5, 10 years from now. 
   What about savings? We all agree as to the critical importance of the two domestic programs--Social Security and Medicare. But to retire today, it is important people have savings, and that is the reason we have stressed so much the importance of pensions, the importance of IRAs, because if people are going to retire with dignity, they must have the opportunity to save not tomorrow, not 5 years from now, but today. 
   Marriage penalty: How many of my colleagues have gone home and talked to people about that? There is concern that taxwise it pays not to marry but to live in so-called sin. We take care of the marriage penalty. It is long overdue. Why wait? I think there is good reason, if we are going to help the American family, let's help the American family today, not sometime in the distant future. 
   It intrigues me. People say delay the tax cut, it is not important. But what about spending? My good friend from Wyoming raised that point, and it is a solid one. If we are going to delay tax cuts, why shouldn't we say there can be no increased spending until we solve these two domestic programs? If it is fair for one, why isn't it fair for the other? 
   Then the point was made this tax cut is inflationary. That is hard to understand. In the year 2000, we are talking about a $4 billion tax cut. That is not very large when you stop and think that our GDP is $9 trillion. It is not very likely our tax cut in the next year or two is going to have a very significant effect on the economy. The larger cuts come down the road in the last 5 years. Sure, we may not like to vote for tax increases, but we have all done it in the past, and we will do it again if it is necessary, but this tax cut is very slow in developing into a major reduction for the American people. 
   I oppose the legislation for those reasons. I am a strong believer that we can have the tax cut, address the problems of Medicare, as well as Social Security. As I said, the new CBO estimate of the on-budget surplus over the next 10 years is $996 billion, while my bill returns most of this overpayment of taxes back to those who sent it to Washington, while at the same time it leaves enough money on the table for Social Security reform, $1.9 trillion, and Medicare reform, $505 billion. 
   As I said in the Finance Committee, I am committed to moving a Medicare bill through the committee after we return in September. It is my hope that comprehensive Medicare reform can be achieved, including providing for a prescription drug benefit, but it must be on a bipartisan basis and it must be done with White House cooperation. 
   The chairman's mark complies with the budget resolution to this committee by reducing on-budget revenues by $792 billion over 10 years. This amount will allow up to $505 billion of the on-budget surplus to be dedicated to Medicare reform. The President's plan costs $118 billion over 10 years. Clearly, the $505 billion left on the table is more than sufficient to reform Medicare with a prescription drug benefit. 
   The Committee on Finance has held numerous hearings on Social Security over the past few years. Many of the members of the committee have offered comprehensive Social Security reform plans that, I have to say, are quite compelling. I do intend to return to Social Security after this recess and the Senate works its way through Medicare reform. 
   I oppose this amendment, and I firmly believe we can address all three--a tax cut, Medicare reform, and strengthen Social Security. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator SMITH's motions to discharge the Finance Committee of S.J. Res 27 and 28. These resolutions would overturn the President's extension of the Jackson-Vanik waiver authority with respect to China and Vietnam.  
   I can understand Senator SMITH'S desire to have the Senator consider and debate these resolutions. Our economic relationship with these countries is clearly worth our attention. 
   This, however, is not the time for such a debate. There is a process already underway in the House on these resolutions that we should allow to continue. The Ways and Means Committee has already reported out these resoltuions--both adversely, I might add. Floor action in the House on both these measures is already planned for the next few weeks. With the House ready to act, there is no reason for us to undercut that process by taking these matters up at this time. 
   If the House does pass either of these resolutions, then the Senate should consider them on their merits. On the issue of China, I will be ready, along with many of my colleagues, to discuss why maintaining normal trade relations with that country is in our national interest. In short, there are--and there will continue to be--areas of significant disagreement between our two nations. But the record is clear that our commercial relationship with China has been good for our economy. It has also helped bring about positive change in China. 
   On the issue of Vietnam, I look to my colleagues, Senators JOHN KERRY, MCCAIN, BOB KERREY, HAGEL, ROBB, and CLELAND. These Senators--all Vietnam veterans--support the Jackson-Vanik waiver. In their view, the President's waiver has helped in resolving the problems we have had with Vietnam on emigration. 
   While these are my views, in brief, a more substantive discussion of these issues should come at a later time. Until the House acts, we should complete our work on the matters already before us. After all, the motions to discharge the committee are effectively motions to proceed to the resolutions themselves. That means, under the Jackson-Vanik statute, 20 hours of floor debate on each measure. That also means putting off our consideration of the appropriations bills. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator SMITH's motions.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, health care in America is the envy of the world. We have the finest doctors, nurses, and medical care personnel available anywhere. We have the best research facilities and the most advanced--state-of-the-art--technology. We are the world's leader in providing new and effective treatments and therapies. And it doesn't seem that a day goes by without news of some exciting breakthrough in medicine and health. 
   While this is the good news, there's no question that our health care delivery system also faces some serious challenges. No one argues that there isn't cause for concern when it comes to making high quality health care more affordable, and therefore more accessible, to millions of Americans who currently have no coverage, and for those who may even have coverage, but who are receiving substandard and even poor care. 
   For the last fifteen years, Congress has been concerned about the skyrocketing costs associated with health care. I remember the dire predictions we listened to in the 1980s and early 1990s. I recall the testimony of OMB Director Dick Darman in 1992, when he warned that given its current rate of increase, total public and private health spending was quickly taking over the Gross National Product. Unless something was done, he said, expenditures--which were less than six percent of GNP three decades earlier--would reach the unmaintainable level of 26 percent of GNP by the year 2030.  
   One of the innovative answers to curb this dangerous increase was the advent of managed care and the creation of Health Maintenance Organizations. Through this system, millions of Americans found access to health care that was affordable. Small businesses were better able to provide insurance for their employees. And competition between HMOs and other health care providers in the miraculous free market system worked to reduce the exploding costs of coverage. At the same time, it allowed those incentives to work that were continuing to promote new research and development, new therapies and technology, and the daily breakthroughs I mentioned earlier. 
   Was everything perfect? No. Questions and concerns--very relevant questions and concerns--soon surfaced regarding the quality of care delivered by some of the providers participating in the managed care system. But just as valid as these concerns was the fact that through managed care, millions of satisfied Americans were receiving high quality services that may have, otherwise, been unavailable to them. And because of the influence that managed care was having on the delivery 
   of health care in America, free market principles were continuing to reward innovation and quality, while at the same time creating a new dimension of competition to help control costs. 
   With this background, we see more clearly the dynamics involved in the issue before us today. As we look to address the need of establishing a patients' bill of rights--and, again, the need is very real--we see clearly how the improvements we incorporate in such a bill of rights must protect Americans and improve the quality of the health care they are receiving while, at the same time, not undermine the strengths of the current system. 
   This is a delicate balance--one that was of primary importance to the task force that I served on with several of my colleagues. Together, we listened to dozens of experts and consumer representatives. We collected and reviewed reams of information. We reviewed countless areas that might be addressed and looked at countless possibilities for legislative action. There was no question that managed care could be improved. In fact, many providers from within managed care organizations agreed that there were improvements to be made, and it became clear by the evidence we reviewed that a bill of rights is warranted. 
   Our goal was simple: increase standards and the quality of health care delivered by providers, without excessively escalating costs that would make health care coverage less available to Americans who need it most. There is no question that any time costs go up, those who are most adversely affected are those who are least able to afford the increases. This not only includes the millions of American families that might not have access to health care without competitive managed care providers, but it also includes millions of Medicare beneficiaries who--to receive extra coverage and benefits--are participating in managed care programs. 
   If attempts to improve the system go to the extreme--opening up, and even encouraging, litigation, or increasing government intervention and regulation, or holding small businesses that provide health care coverage liable for the judgments made by physicians--costs are going to explode; countless individuals and families are going to suffer the adverse consequences. 
   On the other hand, if improvements focus on protecting the patient while strengthening the current system, then coverage can be expanded, quality can be assured, and even the most vulnerable will be protected. This, Mr. President, is our objective; it's what we intend to do with the Patients' Bill of Rights Act--a well-studied and common sense approach to protecting Americans, while at the same time improving our health care delivery system. The legislation we introduce today not only targets specific problems in the current system, but it will make health care more affordable, more accessible, and give consumers greater choice concerning their own care. 
   This is accomplished in several ways. 
   First, this legislation will guarantee patients a more thorough due process than they currently receive when they are denied a benefit by their health plan. This includes an external review by an independent medical expert to determine if a health plan has unfairly denied a benefit. In urgent cases, this review must be completed within 72 hours. This provision is so important because it will ensure that patients get the benefits they are entitled to, when they need those benefits most. 
   If, for some reason, the safety net of an independent external review process fails, our plan preserves an individual's right to sue his or her health plan in Federal court for all benefit denials. The individual can also sue in State court for malpractice claims. 
   Beyond this, our legislation increases the choices that are made available to patients by requiring health plans that contract with businesses of 51 or more employees to offer participants the opportunity to receive health care service from out-of-network providers. In this way, consumers will be able to choose providers that best suit their needs. 
   Outside of encouraging greater choice, our plan effectively increases access to health insurance by making coverage for self-employed Americans 100 percent tax deductible, starting next January. This is a provision that is long overdue. Self-employed individuals have unfairly been limited in the amount of money they can deduct from their taxes for health care coverage, while business and corporations have been able to deduct all the health care benefits they provided their employees. This provision will not only help restore equity, but it will benefit 25 million Americans who are in families headed by a self-insured individual--five million of whom are currently uninsured. 
   The legislation will require patients to be fully informed concerning their coverage, including cost-sharing requirements, supplemental benefits, out-of-area coverage, options for selecting primary health care providers, access to emergency care, and preventative services. In other words, no more surprises. And this legislation also gives patients the right to request and be given information concerning their plan's administrative details. For example, providers will be required to answer their customers' queries into the licensure and qualifications of the professionals who participate in the providers' plans. They will be required to provide relevant information concerning participating health care facilities and reimbursement methods between the plan and its participating professions, as well as the status of the plan with accrediting organizations. Likewise, consumers can request information about medications that are included in the plan and procedures to obtain medications that may not be a part of the program. 
   All of these provisions are fundamentally important to the rights that patients should have when dealing with their health care providers. But as you can see, Mr. President, they are constructed and included in this legislation in a way that the benefits are received without adversely influencing accessibility and affordability. In fact, as I have shown, accessibility and affordability will actually increase with this Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. 
   But the benefits of this plan do not stop there. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act includes important prohibitions against gag rules that some health plans use to limit communication between doctors and patients. This legislation will prohibit health plans from restricting their doctors from sharing information and discussing treatment options with their patients. 
   This legislation will also patients to have direct access to obstetricians, gynecologists, and pediatricians for routine care without referrals. 
   And it includes important measure to protect sensitive patient information. It prohibits the use of genetic information to deny health care coverage or to set premium rates. And it enhances the role of the Agency for Health Care Quality Research to continue the important effort of improving the system for long-term. 
   These, too, are important, but perhaps the provisions in this legislation with which I am most pleased are those that will advance research, prevention and treatment for women with cancer and cardiovascular disease. These provisions will expand basic and clinical research, specifically for women, on the underlying causes and prevention of these diseases. Beyond this, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act will fund  extended research related to osteoporosis and women's geriatric concerns. And it will support continued data collection through the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Program of Cancer Registries--two leading women's health data centers. 
   Mr. President, I don't think there's anyone who can argue with the important measures contained in this bill. It is, indeed, comprehensive. At the same time, it's balanced and constructive. It's the kind of effective leadership Americans expect from Congress--making access to health care easier, not harder, for individuals and small businesses. 
   It allows the incentives that make our health care system the envy of the world to continue, while it includes new incentives for providers to offer better quality, greater efficiency, and to be more responsive to their customers. While addressing the short-comings of the current system, this legislation builds on what is good--what is working--in the current system. It expands the real rights of patients and provides for continued research and development in areas that are vitally important to America's changing demographics. 
   For these important reasons, I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. It is not only comprehensive and very workable, it is constructive and necessary.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there is a serious inadequacy in the treatment of Americans who must pay for their health care on their own and those who receive it on a tax subsidized basis from their employers. In addition, our tax code restricts people from making health care decisions in a tax advantaged way. I am happy to join with my colleagues, Senator GRAMS of Minnesota and Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan in sponsoring the Health Care Access and Equity Act of 1999. Our bill would rectify this situation and provide a level playing field for all Americans who purchase their own health insurance and those who receive employer subsidized insurance. It will also give people more tax-advantaged options in how they use their health care dollars. 
   Let me explain the current unfairness of our tax code as it relates to health care insurance. Current law provides that any employer subsidy of health benefits is not included in the income of the employee. This means that if an employer pays the entire cost of health care insurance, that entire subsidy is not included in the employee's taxable income. 
   However, if the employer does not provide health care insurance for its employees or if the employee has to pay the full cost of the insurance, they do not get the same tax benefit as those who have all or a portion of their health care insurance paid for by their employer. Those premiums that are not paid for by the employer can be deducted by the employee--but only to the extent that the total premium amount and other health care costs exceed 7.5% of the employee's adjusted gross income. What this effectively means is that these individuals are denied a tax effective way of paying for health insurance. 
   Self-employed individuals don't have an employer to cover their health insurance needs; they must pay for their health insurance on their own. Self-employed individuals can only deduct 60% of the amount of their health care premiums. This percentage will increase over time until the year 2003, when health care premiums will be fully deductible. 
   Our current tax code does not treat all taxpayers the same. Our bill changes this situation. 
   This bill provides that all taxpayers can fully deduct the amount paid for health insurance--as long as the taxpayer is not eligible to participate in an employer subsidized medical plan. This equalizes the tax treatment of 
   paying for health insurance so that all individuals get a tax incentive when they have health care insurance, regardless of whether their employer pays for the coverage. 
   This amendment underscores the need to make health care more affordable for more Americans and to begin providing greater equity in the tax treatment of health insurance whether people obtain their coverage at their place of employment or purchase coverage in the individual health insurance market. 
   It is a sobering fact that there are over 41 million Americans without health insurance. 
   Largely as a result of the tax incentives I explained before, the number of people covered by employer-provided health insurance has grown from less than 12 million in 1940 to approximately 150 million today. 
   However, those who do not have tax-subsidized health care benefits do not fare as well. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, individuals who must pay for health coverage with after-tax dollars are 24 times more likely to be uninsured as those with employer-provided coverage. 
   With this change, all individuals who do not receive the employer-provided subsidies for health care insurance will not have the opportunity to have their taxes reduced because they purchased insurance. 
   This amendment will benefit approximately 12 million taxpayers who do not have health insurance that is subsidized by an employer. 
   Our bill also provides that more individuals will be able to have long term care insurance in a tax effective manner, by giving them a tax deduction for the payment of premiums for a long term care policy. Current law only allows a deduction for long term care premiums if those premiums, along with other medical expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. With this bill, the entire amount of the long term care premium will be deductible. This will benefit at least 3.8 million taxpayers. Clearly more people will be able to prepare for their future needs by buying long term care insurance. 
   Another important provision of our bill is the expansion of the availability of medical Savings Accounts. MSAs gives individuals more choice in how they spend their health care dollars. 
   Current law restricts who can participate in an MSA and clearly these 
   restrictions have limited who participate in this program. Our bill would lift these caps on this program and give people more reason to choose to be in an MSA. 
   Another important point to remember with MSAs is that they encourage those individuals who are not insured to become insured. When the General Accounting Office reviewed what has happened in the MSA market, they reported that approximately one third of those who participated in the MSA program had been previously uninsured. The MSA participated in the MSA program had been previously uninsured. The MSA program has been proven to increase those covered under a health plan; with this bill we expand the program so that more people will be insured. 
   Finally, our bill provides incentives for employees to contribute to flexible spending accounts. With a flexible spending account, an employee can contribute a portion of his salary--thereby reducing his taxable income--to a flexible spending account and then use the money in that account to pay for health care benefits, whether or not they are covered by his medical insurance. Increasing the availability of these FSAs, will give employees more freedom on how to spend their money when purchasing health care. 
   The policy behind our bill is clear--increased equity in the tax system for health care insurance and more choice for individuals in how they spend their health care dollars. I am happy to join my two distinguished colleagues--Senator GRAMS and ABRAHAM and the other Senators co-sponsoring this important health care legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to H.R. 975 and to urge my colleagues, in the strongest terms possible, to vote no on cloture. Let me explain why. 
   Our steel industry faces a serious challenge as a result of foreign competition. That challenge stems from the persistent overcapacity in the global steel industry that is the legacy of decades of foreign government interventionism. 
   The quota bill, however, does nothing to eliminate this overcapacity. What the quota bill does do is simply lock in a certain share of our market--the quota amount--for foreign imports at a vastly inflated price. 
   According to a study by the Institute for International Economics, this bill would raise steel import prices by about $29 a ton. This represents a windfall of $800 million to the lucky foreign producers who get their goods into the United States under the quota, with the price tag being paid by the American people. 
   While the bill does enrich certain foreign producers, it also poses a grave threat to our economy. For every 1 job in the steel industry, there are 40 jobs in the steel-using industries. These 40 workers manufacture autos, industrial machinery, kitchen appliances, and other products. All these jobs will be at risk as a result of the quota bill, because this legislation seeks arbitrary limits on the amount of steel coming  into our country. And the quotas apply regardless of domestic demand and regardless of whether the type of steel is even produced in the United States. 
   To make matters worse, this measure would actually help foreign companies that compete against American steel-using industries both in the United States and abroad. For instance, U.S. automakers would be forced to pay higher prices for steel than their foreign competitors. This would disadvantage American companies in our market and in the foreign markets in which they compete. The impact on jobs and on the economy could be severe. 
   This bill would also put us at risk of retaliation by our trading partners. Our farmers are well aware of this risk. That is why 21 leading agriculture groups signed a letter last week stating their strong opposition to this legislation. These include the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and others. As these groups understand all too well, passage of this legislation will threaten our access to foreign markets at a time when these markets are most needed for our businesses and our farmers. 
   If we decide to go down the path of quotas, we must also keep in mind that the price will ultimately be paid by the American consumer. 
   I yield myself 1 more minute. 
   By raising the average price of products made with steel, the quota constitutes an artificial tax on ordinary Americans regardless of wealth or income. Keep in mind that the tax will not be insignificant. According to the Institute of International Economics study, the bill will, at most, save 1,700 jobs in the steel industry but will do so at a cost to the economy of about $800,000 a job. For us to put such a burden on the American people is unconscionable. 
   With that said, let us not forget that the import surge the quotas are designed to address appears to be over. In fact, imports of all steel products for the first 4 months of this year were below the imports for the same period in 1997, well before the surge began. 
   I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Let me address one last point. 
   For some of my colleagues, this may be seen as a free vote. I, like many, hope the President will have the courage to veto this legislation if it does pass. But we have to remember that the American people sent us to Congress to further their national interests. Let's not disappoint them. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is an important day for millions of Americans with disabilities--a day that presents the Senate with an opportunity to build on the legacy of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Today, we have a chance to help disabled Americans move toward independence. 
   Despite the success of the Americans With Disabilities Act, there are still serious obstacles facing too many people with disabilities--obstacles that stand in the way of employment. 
   Senators JEFFORDS, MOYNIHAN, KENNEDY, and I want to change that. Accordingly, in January we introduced S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   This legislation has a simple objective--to help people with disabilities go to work if they want to go to work, without fear of losing their health insurance lifeline.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleague for the leadership that he has provided in this renewable energy program. 
   I strongly believe that renewable energy technology represents our best hope for reducing air pollution, creating jobs, and decreasing our reliance on imported oil and finite supplies of fossil fuel. 
   These programs promise to supply economically competitive and commercially viable exports. I believe that the nation should be looking toward clean, alternative forms of energy, not taking a step backward by cutting funding for these important programs. 
   Indeed this is a sentiment shared by a majority of the American people. Public support for renewable energy programs is strong. For the fifth year in a row, a national poll has revealed that Americans believe renewable energy along with energy efficiency should be the highest energy research and development priority. 
   My own State of Delaware has a long tradition in solar energy. In 1972, the University of Delaware established one of the first photovoltaic laboratories in the nation, the Institute for Energy Conversion, which has been instrumental in developing photovoltaic technology. Delaware's major solar energy manufacturer, Astro Power, has become the largest U.S.-owned photovoltaic company and has doubled its work force since 1997. 
   While the solar energy industry might have evolved in some form on its own, federal investment has accelerated the transition from the laboratory bench to commercial markets by leveraging private sector efforts. This collaboration has already accrued valuable economic benefits to the nation. Solar energy companies--like Astro Power--have already created thousands of jobs and helped to reduce our trade deficit through exports. My state has demonstrated that solar energy technology can be an economically competitive and commercially viable energy alternative. 
   International markets for solar energy systems are virtually exploding, due to several key market trends. Most notably, solar energy is already one of the lowest cost options available to developing countries that cannot afford to build large, expensive centralized power generation facilities with elaborate distribution systems. 
   The governments of Japan, Germany, and Australia are investing heavily in aggressive technology and market development in partnership with their own solar energy industries. Until recently, Japan and Germany held the lead in world market share for photovoltaics; the United States has only recently recaptured international market dominance. 
   Cutting funding for these technologies would have a chilling effect on the U.S. industry's ability to compete on an international scale in these billion-dollar markets of today and tomorrow. The employment potential of renewables represents a minimum of  15,000 new jobs this decade with nearly 120,000 the next decade. 
   It is imperative that this Senate support renewable energy technologies and be a partner to an energy future that addresses our economic needs in an environmentally acceptable manner. My state has done and will continue to do its part. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will look to the future and do their part in securing a safe and reliable energy future by supporting this amendment. 
   Again, I want to congratulate my distinguished colleague for his leadership on this most important matter.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that runs to the heart of who we are and what we hold dear and meaningful in our lives. 
   There is a special relationship between men, women, children, and their family pets--particularly their dogs and cats. 
   I have been profoundly affected in my life because of the animals that transcended emotional boundaries to become true and meaningful friends--even a part of the family. I can name every dog I've owned since I was a boy. 
   I can tell you their qualities, their peculiarities, their preferences and dislikes. Even now, my wife Jane and I--our children and grandchildren--are surrounded by the most loyal St. Bernards in the world. They--as all the pets we've had--speak volumes about strong and lasting friendship. 
   You can understand, given this background, that I am outraged to learn that there are clothing articles imported into America that are made from the fur of these precious animals. 
   I'm outraged to learn that dog and cat fur is being used in a wide variety of products, including fur coats and jackets. 
   I'm outraged to learn from the Humane Society of the United States that more than two million dogs and cats are killed annually as part of the fur trade, and that many retailers in the U.S. who sell these items are doing so unaware of their content. 
   To respond to this growing problem, I'm introducing legislation today, the Dog and Cat Protection Act of 1999, to prohibit the domestic sale, manufacture, transportation, and distribution of products made with cat or dog fur. 
   My legislation requires all fur products to be labelled, closing a loophole in the current law, and it will ban deceptive or misleading labelling of these products so consumers and retailers can buy with confidence, knowing that they are not supporting this tragic process. 
   With this legislation, our message will be clear: No matter where in the world this merchandise is made, there will be no legitimate market for it here--not in the United States. 
   This is important legislation. It will provide uniformity of regulations and prevent conflicts between states. It will give the Justice Department the ability to enforce the law and prosecute those who may try to get around it. 
   And the U.S. Customs Service would be able to function as the first line of defense. I appreciate the work being done by the Humane Society of the United States and many other important organizations to heighten our awareness of these kinds of issues. 
   And I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation enacted into law. Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Senate today passed the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999. This bill, which my friend Senator MOYNIHAN cosponsored, is similar to legislation that the Committee on Finance had reported out last year. 
   This legislation consists of over 150 provisions temporarily suspending or reducing the applicable tariffs on a wide variety of products, including chemicals used to make anti-HIV, anti-AIDS and anticancer drugs, pigments, paints, herbicides and insecticides, certain machinery used in the production of textiles, and rocket engines. 
   In each instance, there was either no domestic production of the product in question or the domestic producers supported the measure. By suspending or reducing the duties, we can enable American firms that use these products to produce goods in a more cost efficient manner, thereby helping create jobs for American workers and reducing costs for consumers. 
   The bill also contains a number of technical corrections and other minor modifications to the trade laws that enjoy broad support. One such measure would help facilitate Customs Service clearance of athletes that participate in world athletic events, such as the upcoming Women's World Cup. Another measure corrects certain outdated references in the trade laws. 
   For each of the provisions included in this bill, the House and Senate solicited comments from the public and from the administration to ensure that there was no controversy or opposition. Only those measures that were noncontroversial were included in the bill. 
   I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator MOYNIHAN, for helping move this legislation. I am delighted that we were able to pass these commonsense measures that will provide real benefits for the American people. 
   Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. President, my great thanks to the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his efforts in bringing this legislation, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999, to a successful conclusion. The technical work on this bill began 15 months ago, culminating in the Finance Committee's approval of the package last September. For reasons unrelated to the substance of the bill, the Senate was unable to complete work on the measure last year. 
   The Chairman made this the first order of business for the Finance Committee in the 106th Congress, and, accordingly, the Committee ordered this package of temporary duty suspensions and Customs provisions reported on January 21, 1999. Of particular importance to New Yorkers, the bill will authorize the United States Customs Service to station inspectors in a number of Canadian airports, to ``preclear'' passengers in advance of their arrival in New York, thus helping to reduce congestion at JFK International Airport. Passengers cleared in Canada can be routed through LaGuardia, where no further Customs formalities will be required. Passengers on flights routed through JFK will face shorter Customs processing times since many of the flights that would otherwise be routed through JFK will instead be directed to LaGuardia. Arriving in New York should become just a little easier. 
   The bill also suspends the duties on the personal effects of athletes participating in the Women's World Cup soccer games, their coaches and their families. The games will begin June 19, 1999. In addition, H.R. 435 reduces the tariffs that New York companies must pay on certain imported components not produced in the United States, such as high-purity glass and a number of synthetic organic chemicals used to manufacture rubber products, produce aircraft coatings, and inhibit corrosion on rail cars. 
   The Senate has now given its unanimous consent and the measure will return to the House for final approval. It is my hope that the House will take up the matter as soon as it returns from the Memorial Day recess.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I rise to address the Kimmel-Short resolution which I and Senators BIDEN, THURMOND, and KENNEDY introduced to redress a grave injustice that haunts us from World War II. 
   That injustice was the scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General Short for the success of the disastrous Pearl Harbor attack. This unjust scapegoating was given unjust permanence when these two officers were not advanced on the retirement list to their highest ranks of wartime command, an honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in wartime positions above his regular grade. 
   Our amendment is almost an exact rewrite of Senate Joint Resolution 19, that benefits from the support of 23 cosponsors. It calls for the advancement on the retirement lists of Kimmel and Short to the grades of their highest wartime commands--as was done for every other officer eligible under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. 
   Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of blame that so unfairly burdens the reputation of these two officers. It is a correction consistent with our military tradition of honor. 
   Allow me to review some key facts about this issue. 
   First, it is a fact that Kimmel and Short were the only two World War II officers eligible under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 for advancement on the retired list who were not granted such advancement. No other officer or official paid a price for their role in the Pearl Harbor disaster. That fact alone unfairly perpetuates the scapegoating they endured for the remainder of their lives. 
   Second, there have been no less than nine official investigations on this matter over the last five decades. They include the 1944 Naval Court of Inquiry which completely exonerated Admiral Kimmel and the 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board who found considerable fault in the War Department--General Short's superiors. These investigations include that conducted by a 1991 Board for the Correction of Military Records which recommended General Short's advancement on the retired list. 
   I can think of few issues of this nature that have been as extensively investigated and studied as the Pearl Harbor matter. Nor can I think of a series of studies conducted over five decades where conclusions have been so remarkably consistent. 
   They include, first, the Hawaiian commanders were not provided vital intelligence they needed and that was available in Washington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and consistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   Third, these investigations found that the handling of intelligence and command responsibilities in Washington were characterized by ineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification followup. 
   Fourth, these investigations found that these failures and shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington contributed significantly, if not predominantly, to the success of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   We are not rewriting history. We are merely correcting the record. Just let me point out that the Dorn report, which has been mentioned time and again by those in opposition, specifically concluded that responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared. Let me emphasize that: It should be broadly shared. In other words, there were others responsible, primarily in Washington. To place the blame on these two gentlemen, who had distinguished military careers, is wrong and is unfair. I believe we have a responsibility, a duty, to recommend to the President action that corrects this unfortunate misdeed. 
   In making this decision, let me point out that a number of endorsements of my resolution have been received from senior retired officers of the highest rank. For example, Arleigh Burke sent a letter in which he concluded that:  
   It is my considered judgment that when all the circumstances are considered that you should approve this posthumous promotion and recommend it to the President. 
   The record is clear that important information, available to the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, was never made available to Admiral Kimmel in Hawaii. 
   Lastly, the Naval Court of Inquiry, which exonerated Admiral Kimmel, concluded that his military decisions were proper based on the information available to him.  
   Let me now refer to a letter we received from several distinguished members of the Navy: Thomas Moorer, Admiral, U.S. Navy; former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, William J. Crowe, Admiral, U.S. Navy; J.L. Holloway, Admiral, U.S. Navy; Elmo Zumwalt, Admiral, U.S. Navy. They wrote:  
   We ask that the honor and reputations of two fine officers who dedicated themselves to the service of their country be restored. Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were singularly scapegoated as responsible for the success of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941. The time is long overdue to reverse this inequity and treat Admiral Kimmel and [G]eneral Short fairly and justly. The appropriate vehicle for that is the current Roth-Biden Resolution.  
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what we are talking about today is a matter of justice and fairness, a matter that goes to the core of our military tradition and our Nation's sense of military honor. Just let me point out once again the Dorn report says:  
   Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. It should be broadly shared.  
   Unfortunately, it was not broadly shared. The only two people who were singled out for punishment, or not to be promoted to their wartime rank, were Admiral Kimmel and General Short. They were held singularly responsible for what happened in Pearl Harbor. That is not fair. That is not just. Just let me point out that we have had the essence of the tremendous 
   number of endorsements we have received from senior retired officers of the highest rank. Once again, I point out that admiral after admiral--Burke, Zumwalt, Moorer and Crowe--have asked that this be corrected. All we seek today is justice and fairness to two officers who served their Nation with excellence.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, for 58 years, two distinguished commanders, Admiral Kimmel and General Short, have been unjustly scapegoated for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Numerous studies have made it unambiguously clear that Short and Kimmel were denied vital intelligence that was available in Washington. Investigations by military boards found Kimmel and Short had properly disposed their forces in light of the intelligence and resources they had available. 
   Investigations found the failure of their superiors to properly manage intelligence and to fulfill command responsibilities contributed significantly, if not predominantly, to the disaster. Yet, they alone remain singled out for responsibility. This amendment calls upon the President to correct this injustice by advancing them on the retired list, as was done for all their peers. 
   This initiative has received support from veterans, including Bob Dole, countless military leaders, including Admirals Moorer, Crowe, Halloway, Zumwalt, and Trost, as well as the VFW.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of my colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, and on behalf of Senator THURMOND and Senator KENNEDY to introduce an amendment whose intent is to redress a grave injustice that haunts us from the tribulations of World War II. 
   Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were the two senior commanders of U.S. forces deployed in the Pacific at the time of the disastrous surprise December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, they were unfairly and publicly charged with dereliction of duty and blamed as singularly responsible for the success of that attack. 
   Less than 6 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack, in a hastily prepared report to the President, the Roberts Commission--perhaps the most flawed and unfortunately most influential investigation of the disaster--levelled the dereliction of duty charge against Kimmel and Short--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized. 
   Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of this Commission, later disavowed its report, stating that these two officers were ``martyred'' and ``if they had been brought to trial, they would have been cleared of the charge.'' 
   Later, Admiral J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor as Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, wrote:  
   In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government Printing Office.  
   After the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a painfully enduring veneer when Admiral Kimmel and General Short were not advanced on the retired lists to their highest ranks of war-time command--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in war-time positions above his regular grade. 
   Admiral Kimmel, a two star admiral, served in a four star command. General Short, a two star general, served in a three star command. Let me repeat, advancement on the retired lists was granted to every other flag rank officer who served in World War II in a post above their grade. 
   That decision against Kimmel and Short was made despite the fact that war-time investigations had exonerated these commanders of the dereliction of duty charge and criticized their higher commands for significant failings that contributed to the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than six studies and investigations conducted after the war, including one Department of Defense report completed in 1995 at Senator THURMOND'S request, reconfirmed these findings. 
   Our amendment is a rewrite of Senate Joint Resolution 19, the Kimmel-Short Resolution, that I, Senator BIDEN, Senator THURMOND, Senator HELMS, Senator STEVENS, Senator COCHRAN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DOMENICI, Senator SPECTER, Senator ENZI, Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator CRAIG, Senator DURBIN, Senator JOHN KERRY, Senator KYL, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator BOB SMITH, Senator COLLINS, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator VOINOVICH, Senator DEWINE, and Senator FEINSTEIN--a total of 23 cosponsors--introduced last month. 
   The amendment calls upon the President of the United States to advance posthumously on the retirement lists Admiral Kimmel and General Short to the grades of their highest war-time commands. Its passage would communicate the Senate's recognition of the injustice done to them and call upon the President to take corrective action. 
   Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of blame that so unfairly burdens the reputations of these two officers. It is a correction consistent with our military's tradition of honor. 
   Mr. President, the investigations providing clear evidence that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame include a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, the 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional Committee, and a 1991 Army Board for the Correction of Military Records. 
   To give you the sense of the thoroughness of these investigations, I have before me the volumes that constitute the Joint Congressional Committee's final report that compiles many of these studies. 
   I think they demonstrate, beyond question, the thoroughness with which the investigation had proceeded. 
   The findings of these official reports can be summarized as four principal points. 
   First, there is ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not provided vital intelligence that they needed, and that was available in Washington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and consistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   In my review of this fundamental point, I was most struck by the honor and integrity demonstrated by General George Marshall who was Army Chief of Staff at the time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   On November 27 of that year, General Short interpreted a vaguely written war warning message sent from the high command in Washington as suggesting the need to defend against sabotage. Consequently, he concentrated his aircraft away from perimeter roads to protect them, thus inadvertently increasing their vulnerability to air attack. When he reported his preparations to the General Staff in Washington, the General Staff took no steps to clarify the reality of the situation. 
   In 1946, before a Joint Congressional Committee on the Pearl Harbor disaster, General Marshall testified that he was responsible for ensuring the proper disposition of General Short's forces. He acknowledged that he must have received General Short's report, which would have been his opportunity to issue a corrective message, and that he failed to do so. 
   Mr. President, General Marshall's integrity and sense of responsibility is a model for all of us. I only wish it had been able to have greater influence over the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the Department of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the flow of intelligence. The 1995 Department of Defense report stated that the handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by, among other faults, ineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up. 
   The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned reports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed only upon the Hawaiian commanders. They all underscored significant failures and shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington that contributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   The 1995 Department of Defense report put it best, stating that ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders  of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared.'' 
   This is an important quote. It shows that the Department of Defense recognizes that these two commanders should not be singled out for blame. Yet, still today on this issue, our government's words do not match its actions. 
   Kimmel and Short remain the only two officials who have been forced to pay a price for the disaster at Pearl Harbor. 
   Let me add one poignant fact about the two wartime investigations. Their conclusions--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been properly disposed according to the information available to them and that their superiors had failed to share important intelligence--were kept secret on the grounds that making them public would have been detrimental to the war effort. 
   Be that as it may, there is no longer any reason to perpetuate the cruel myth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor. Admiral Spruance, one of our great naval commanders of World War II, shares this view. He put it this way: 
   ``I have always felt that Kimmel and Short were held responsible for Pearl Harbor in order that the American people might have no reason to lose confidence in their government in Washington. This was probably justifiable under the circumstances at that time, but it does not justify forever damning those two fine officers.'' 
   Mr. President, to do so is not only unfair, it tarnishes our nation's military honor. 
   Mr. President, this sense of the Senate has been endorsed by countless military officers, including those who have served at the highest levels of command. These include former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and Admiral William J. Crowe, and former Chiefs of Naval Operations Admiral J.L. Holloway III, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt and Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost. 
   Moreover a number of public organizations have called for posthumous advancement of Kimmel and Short. Last August, the VFW passed a resolution calling for the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   Let me add that Senator Robert Dole, one of our most distinguished colleagues and a veteran who served heroically in World Warr II, has also endorsed this sense of the Senate resolution. 
   This resolution now in amendment form is about justice, equity, and honor. Its purpose is to redress an historic wrong, to ensure that Admiral Kimmel and General Short are treated with the dignity and honor they deserve, and to ensure that justice and fairness fully permeate the memory and lessons learned from the catastrophe at Pearl Harbor. 
   As we approach Memorial Day and prepare to honor those who served to protect our great nation, it is a most appropriate time to redress this injustice. After 58 years, this correction is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.

   Mr. ROTH. I point out to my distinguished colleague that first of all, the Dorn Report makes the very clear finding that responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. It should be broadly shared. 
   When it says it should be broadly shared, it seems to me it is saying in effect that all of those who had any responsibility for the act should be treated the same. That is basically what we are saying here. These two distinguished gentlemen gave a lifetime of service to their country with distinction. There are many factors that were shown in the other investigations: That they did not have the intelligence, they did not have the information that they were entitled to if they were going to properly discharge their responsibility. 
   We are not saying here that they were not partly responsible, but they were no more responsible than other leaders in Washington. To me, it is unfair, inequitable and not in the tradition of the military to treat two individuals differently from others. 
   This is not an effort of a younger generation trying to correct what we think is an unfair situation. I, like the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, served in World War II with the military. I just think it is only right, it is only just that we treat them exactly the same and let them be promoted to their higher wartime ranks. 
   There is a responsibility, accountability, among many. Any number of these studies clearly showed that a large part of that responsibility was in Washington. 
   All we are asking is, let's treat all these people alike--fair and with justice.

   Mr. ROTH. With all due deference to my colleague, that is hypothetical. It is possible that somewhere someone was mistreated. But those facts are not before us. I am not aware of any such charges. 
   But here we have two individuals about whom many different people agree, from those like Bob Dole, who served with great distinction, from the admirals who were in command, both of the Navy and our military forces, all coming forward with the recommendation that, to be fair, these two individuals should be advanced to their highest wartime rank. 
   The point the Senator is making is true in life. Many times lawsuits are brought but you cannot, in settling that lawsuit, with the individuals before you--you are not going to solve all the problems of mankind because you only have the facts of those you are considering. Our resolution is a followthrough for two individuals, about whom, time and time again, it was said they served with distinction.

Again, all I can say is that rare is it that by one stroke of action you correct all inequities, all injustices. But here we have two individuals who were scapegoated. Let's face it. They needed to blame somebody. I think as a matter of fact the Roberts 
   investigation was not known for the legal jurisprudence with which it was conducted. 
   I believe, in fairness to these individuals, the record ought to be set straight. They served their country with great distinction through the years. Disaster occurred at Pearl Harbor, but they alone cannot be held responsible. Most of these reports will admit that. The others were permitted to rise to their highest rank, and I just say as a matter of justice----

   Mr. ROTH. I go back to the fact, it was the President who decided in the 1947 act not to raise them to their wartime ranks. I think it is a rank injustice. I think it is a blot on the history of World War II. There are many people one can probably point out who said this, that, or the other. 
   Here were two gentlemen, one an admiral who had been in command, a naval CO, who was in charge in Hawaii. General Short was in command of the Army Hawaiian department. They did not have the intelligence. 
   One has to remember, in a time of war and stress, one of the concerns was that the country was so shocked by what took place in Hawaii that there was concern over what would be the reaction of the American people. Even though they were found innocent of dereliction of duty, that did not become public information, for the simple reason they wanted to make certain that the American people supported the efforts of this country and more. 
   That was kept secret indefinitely, until 1947, at which time it came out. 
   But I know the chairman is a fair man. I admire him greatly. I know there are those in the military saying: Well, don't go back and change now. Let history judge. I just think it is unfair to these individuals who did serve with excellence, who did serve with distinction, to be penalized when they were the only two.

   I think that is what makes this country different. If there is a wrong, an error, it is never too late to correct it. 
   Here we have a case where these individuals were found not to be solely responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor. As a matter of fact, there were findings in agreement that many in Washington played a key role. Most persuasive to me is the fact that the intelligence they needed to address the attack was not made available to them, yet they are the ones who were denied promotion. The only two.

   Mr. ROTH. There were findings that these individuals did not have the intelligence to which they were entitled. In Washington, it was known that war was imminent. If you had the full information, it was fairly clear that there could be an attack on Pearl Harbor. There was a so-called bomb, 14-part message, all of which indicated that attack was an immediate threat. 
   That information was denied the two individuals with the key critical responsibility in Hawaii. I just think that to hold them responsible and not to give them the lifetime is unfair.

   Mr. ROTH. Yes, you knew an air carrier attack was possible. But to know, for example, as they knew in Washington in the days right before the attack that the Japanese wanted to know where the warships were located, it was this kind of information that gave immediacy to the threat. To me, that was critical. 
   You talk about the Dorn Report. Let me just say, as part of the Dorn Report, they sort of are all over the map in their finding. They say:  
   It is clear today, as should have been clear since 1946 to any serious reader of the JCC hearing record, that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were not solely responsible for the defeat at Pearl Harbor. * * * * * 
   *.*.*.more information was available in Washington but not forwarded to them. Army and Navy officials in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese diplomatic  communications (notably the ``bomb plot'', ``winds'', ``pilot'', and ``fourteen-part'' messages) which provided crucial--  
   Now, this is the Dorn report--  
   which provided crucial confirmation of the imminence of war. Read together and with the leisure, focus, and clarity of hindsight, these messages point strongly towards an attack on Pearl Harbor at dawn on the 7th.  
   That is the Dorn Report:  
   The immediacy of an attack on Pearl Harbor at dawn on the 7th. 
   The evidence of the handling of these messages in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some unwarranted assumptions and misstatements, limited coordination, ambiguous language and lack of clarification and followup at higher levels.  
   I could go on.  
   A careful reading of the proceedings and reports of those panels suggests clear recognition of the faults at all levels. Yet these two gentlemen were singled out and were not given advance to their wartime rating.  
   I think it was inequitable. I think it was not fair, and it seems to me the greatness of this country is that we can go back and make changes where warranted.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to express my views with respect to the issue of background checks at gun shows in relation to the amendments we have today before the Senate. 
   I am a strong supporter of the second amendment; however, I also believe we must maintain procedures to ensure that guns do not find their way to the wrong hands. This is why I have supported the instant check system which is currently in place. 
   I have reviewed the amendment offered by Senator LAUTENBERG and the amendment offered by Senator CRAIG. I have concerns with both. In my view the amendment offered by Senator LAUTENBERG goes much further than simply requiring a background check for purchases at gun shows. It would put in place new and burdensome record requirements for gun show operators and vendors and provide the Secretary of the Treasury with unlimited authority to issue additional regulations. 
   On the other hand, the amendment offered by Senator CRAIG, in my view, does not go far enough. Senator CRAIG's amendment merely outlines a voluntary or optional background check process. 
   Mr. President, consistent with my view and past support of the Brady bill, I would support a straightforward background check system for gun show sales, but that is not the choice we have before us today.

It represents the ten-thousandth vote cast by JOE BIDEN, and I would like to take a moment not only to bring it to the attention of our colleagues, but to reflect on a career that has been--and continues to be--a bright legacy of service. 
   To put this vote into perspective, Mr. President, only twenty Senators in history have reached this milestone--only twenty Senators out of the 1,851 who have had the honor of serving in this distinguished body. Each of us who has the honor of representing our state in the Senate understands what a rare privilege it is to cast a vote on this floor. In fact, the first vote we cast ranks among the most memorable moment in our lives--a moment not to be forgotten. 
   I'm sure that when JOE cast his first vote on January 23, 1973--over twenty-five years ago--he could not have foreseen this moment. Through the years, he has achieved many distinguished honors. He has gained national stature, as a candidate for President. He has established himself as a foremost expert on judicial and foreign policy matters. And though I know that we often differ philosophically, I can say that each vote JOE has cast, his focus has been on doing what's best for Delaware and our Nation, at large. 
   JOE, on this special occasion, I salute you. Ten thousand votes speak volumes about a life dedicated to public service. On behalf of our colleagues I congratulate you. And on behalf of our friends and neighbors in Delaware I thank you. 
   For me, it has been an honor, a pleasure, and a privilege to serve these many years with Senator BIDEN. He always does what he thinks is in the best interests of our country and our people of Delaware. I am proud to count him a friend.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is Arson Awareness Week in our nation. As Chairman of the Congressional Fire Service Caucus. I want to remind all Americans of the blight of arson that kills over 700 innocent victims each year and destroys millions of dollars of property. Additionally, firefighters who have been summoned to extinguish the blaze die needlessly. 
   Arson has many faces. The misguided youth that sets fires for excitement; criminals that use fire in an attempt to cover another crime; persons using fire as a weapon to intimidate; the property owner attempting to solve financial problems by defrauding an insurance company; or the terrorist who uses fire to attack our democracy. 
   No matter what the motive, arson in our society cannot be tolerated. Every level of our law enforcement community fights the war against arson. Local and state fire marshals are often assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in conducting investigations to bring the arsonist to justice. 
   The United States Fire Administration in FEMA and the Center for Fire Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Commerce Department are important federal partners in furthering research to learn how arson fires are started and how set fires can be detected. Our National Fire Academy provides training in arson investigation for many state and local law enforcement personnel. 
   But we should not assume that government alone can solve the arson problem. Private enterprise, especially the insurance industry has taken a much higher profile in attacking the arson problem by investigating claims and cooperating with law enforcement personnel. This trend must continue to take the profit out of arson. The insurance industry has also contributed to teaching the public about arson by sponsoring education programs such as Arson Awareness Week. The Fire Administration helps supports Arson Awareness Week by working with the International Association of Arson Investigators. This is the 50th Anniversary of the IAAI. Over seven thousand  members worldwide working together to control arson are making a difference. 
   I send my congratulations to the IAAI during Arson Awareness Week. I am particularly proud of the Delaware Chapter of the IAAI. Some of best that Delaware has to offer from the fire service, law enforcement, the insurance industry and the private sector work hard to protect and educate us about arson. As we go about our busy week, let us not forget that we must all work to snuff out the arsonist match.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the measure now before the Senate. This bill would create new budget procedures to prevent the spending of any surpluses attributed to  Social Security, other than for reducing the public debt or for Social Security reform. Although this bill is well intended, in my view the bill is unlikely to accomplish its objectives and, worse, may have negative, unintended consequences. 
   Before describing specific objections, let me first commend Senator DOMENICI for his leadership on the budget resolution and his commitment to Social Security. The FY 2000 budget resolution that passed Congress last week sets aside every penny of every dollar of the $1.8 trillion in Social Security surpluses expected over the next 10 years. This measure demonstrates unequivocally our commitment to protecting Social Security and to restoring confidence and accountability in Social Security's financing. 
   On the other hand, the President's budget would spend $158 billion of the Social Security surpluses over the next 5 years, and even more thereafter. The differences between the President's budget plan and Congress's could not be more clear. 
   Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate intends to provide additional protections against spending so-called ``off budget'' surpluses, by, among other things, creating a new public debt limit. 
   In my view, the bill has serious substantive problems. The simple fact is that if Congress does not authorize spending, money cannot be spent. Debt is issued solely to pay for spending Congress authorizes. Indeed, Congress delegated its exclusive constitutional authority to borrow money on the credit of the United States in 1917 to the Treasury Department. Prior to 1917, Congress individually authorized each debt issue, specifying interest rates and maturity 
   Over the years, debt ceilings have made little difference in preventing spending or deficits. But, as those of us who have been involved with debt ceiling legislation know too well, the need to raise the debt ceiling can and has often created a sense of crisis. Indeed, this bill could hamper the Federal government from paying its bills in a timely manner; injure the Federal government's credit standing; and limit the Treasury's flexibility to manage the debt in the most efficient manner. 
   Having said that, the legislation before us does attempt to address some of these problems. For example, the bill contains exceptions for emergency spending, recession, and war. However, these exceptions seem to undo the very purposes of the bill, without providing the flexibility needed to properly manage the debt. Moreover, the language of the bill ensuring the timely payment of Social Security benefits should be strengthened. 
   The best solution is to prevent spending, not to undo spending with a new type of debt limit. Indeed, the whole point of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, and subsequent budget process legislation, has been to provide an organized, disciplined framework for consideration of the nation's budget and of public spending. If the current budget procedures are not adequate to prevent spending authorizations, new remedies should be devised without creating a new type of debt limit. 
   I received a letter from Treasury Secretary Rubin which addresses the pending amendment. In this letter Secretary Rubin raises concern that the amendment, if enacted, could actually jeopardize the payment of Social Security benefits. This concerns me as well. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the letter from the Treasury Secretary in the RECORD following my remarks.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me turn now to one other issue before closing--the importance of prompt action on Social Security reform. The bill before us is at best intended to be a stopgap measure until Social Security reform is accomplished. Social Security has long-term financial problems, which the President and Congress must address. Indeed, there is broad agreement--in Congress and by the President--that Social Security reform is better done sooner than later. I strongly agree, although any action will require Presidential leadership and a bipartisan consensus in Congress.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower had the wisdom to set aside a portion of America's Arctic for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations. His Arctic National Wildlife Refuge protected the highest peaks and glaciers of the Brooks Range, North America's two largest and most northerly alpine lakes, and nearly 200 different wildlife species, including polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, caribou, and millions of migratory birds. 
   Eisenhower's Secretary of Interior Fred Seaton called the new Arctic Range, ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas in North America ..... a wilderness experience not duplicated elsewhere. 
   With this in mind, I reintroduce legislation today, Earth Day 1999, that designates the coastal plain of Alaska as wilderness area. At the moment this area is a national wildlife refuge--one of our most beautiful and last frontiers. This legislation, the Arctic National Refuge Wilderness Act of 1999, would forever safeguard this great national treasure from oil exploration and development. 
   And I can't stress how important this is. 
   The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our Earth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete spectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a vital part of our national consciousness. It is a place we can cherish and visit for our soul's good. 
   The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness and recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and glaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich with caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, moose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, black brant, and more. Birds from the Arctic Refuge fly to or through every state in the continental U.S. In all, Mr. President, about 165 species use the coastal plain. 
   It is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give birth, nurse and feed their young, and set about the critical business of fueling up for winters of unspeakable severity. 
   The fact is Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is good that man can come only as a visitor. These are the pristine lands that belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the lands that belong to our future. 
   Considering the many reasons why this bill is so important, I came across the words of the great Western writer, Wallace Stegner. Referring to the land we are trying to protect with this legislation, he wrote that it is `the most splendid part of the American habitat; it is also the most fragile.' And we cannot enter `it carrying habits that [are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely excessive.' 
   What this bill offers--and what we need--is a brand of pragmatic environmentalism, an environmental stewardship that protects our important wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and judiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its long-term needs. 
   Together, we need to embrace environmental policies that are workable and pragmatic, policies based on the desire to make the world a better place for us and for future generations. I believe a strong economy, liberty, and progress are possible only when we have a healthy planet--only when resources are managed through wise stewardship--only when an environmental ethic thrives among nations--and only when people have frontiers that are untrammeled and able to host their fondest dreams.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I wish to briefly comment on the resolution that my colleague from Indiana and I, the majority leader, and others have just introduced. 
   This weekend the NATO Alliance will hold a summit meeting here in Washington. That summit will be dominated by the conflict in Kosovo, and that is to be expected as so much is at stake. 
   Should the Alliance emerge defeated from this conflict, it would signal that dictatorship and atrocity can lead to political survival in post-Cold War Europe. NATO's defeat by a bloody regime that controls no more territory than the state of Kentucky would signal NATO's irrelevance. It would mark the decay of the transatlantic order of democracy, human rights, and security that NATO spent the last five decades defending and promoting. 
   For these grave reasons, the Kosovo crisis underscores how vital NATO is today to the values and interests we share with our European allies. At stake in this conflict is more than Balkan peace and stability, but also the prospects of a transatlantic partnership based on a Europe that is undivided, democratic, and secure. 
   However significant and immediate the Kosovo issue may be, NATO's leaders cannot allow it to obscure two other critical issues that will significantly shape NATO's future as the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic security. These are the revisions to NATO's Strategic Concept the Alliance intends to codify at this summit and the next phase of NATO enlargement. 
   Mr. President, NATO's Strategic Concept is a public document that defines the threats and opportunities that lie before the Alliance's interests and values. It defines the political and military roles and missions the Alliance must undertake to protect and promote those interests and values. From this important document are derived the resources Alliance members commit to the implementation of this strategy. It is a critically important document, one whose revision must be taken with great care. 
   Two Strategic Concept issues that right now appear unresolved prior to this summit and that should be of great concern to us are NATO's relationship with the United Nations and the future of the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI). 
   There are still today Allies who wish to require NATO to attain a UN or a OSCE mandate prior to undertaking out-of-area military actions. I cannot think of a more destructive poison pill for the Alliance. A UN mandate would give non-NATO countries, such as Russia and China, a veto over Alliance decisions. We must not forget that NATO was established in 1949 to overcome the inability of the United Nations to act decisively in the face of danger, threats, and conflagration. We need only to look back to the UN's role in the former Yugoslavia this decide to be reminded of the grave limitations of this institution. If there is one thing that new Strategic Concept must not do, it is to constrict NATO freedom to act by subjecting it to the decisions of other organizations. NATO must preserve its freedom to act. 
   Second, the Alliance's new Strategic Concept must continue the process toward a viable ESDI within the framework of the Washington Treaty. Allied leaders should focus on developing better European military capabilities within NATO. The resolution we introduce today underscores this point by calling upon our European Allies to acquire better capability to ``rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for extended periods of time and operate jointly with the United States in high intensity conflicts.'' The Alliance must not only be able to project power decisively within and outside NATO borders; it must be able to do so in a manner that features transatlantic parity in power projection capabilities. 
   Mr. President, let me add one more point on this matter. Over the last half decade NATO has restructured its command structure to afford it greater operational flexibility. The establishment of Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF), one of the most important reforms, will 
   enable European Allies to utilize Alliance assets for operations of a distincity European character. Europe's key to maximizing the potential of these reforms is the development of better military capabilities. It is through capability--not rhetoric--that our Allies can put a final end to the often acrimonious debates over burden-sharing, and at the same time allow them to more effectively address security challenges of distincity European concern. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the issue of NATO enlargement. How the Washington Summit manages the next phase of enlargement will determine whether this meeting strengthens or undermines the dream for a Europe that is free, secure, and undivided. If the process of NATO enlargement is clearly advanced, the summit will reinforce the prospects for enduring peace and stability in post-Cold War Europe. 
   Article Ten of the Washington Treaty, which established the NATO Alliance in 1949, articulates the Alliance's vision of a united Europe. It states that NATO is open to ``any other European state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.'' In 1995 the Alliance defined through its Study on Enlargement the political, military, and foreign policy guidelines to direct enlargement in the post-Cold War era.  These include a commitment to democracy, the resolution of disputes with neighbors, and the ability to contribute to the Alliance's roles and missions, including collective defense. 
   Based on these guidelines, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were invited to join the Alliance. Their accession on March 12 strengthened the Alliance and marked the first step in the elimination of the divisive and destablizing vestiges, not only of the Cold War, but of the era preceding World War II. 
   The Washington Summit must not only celebrate the first round of NATO enlargement, it must decisively press the process forward. Toward that end, I believe that NATO should invite Solvenia and any other qualified NATO European applicant to accession negotiations. Recently, at my request, the Congressional Research Service examined the nine European states that have applied for NATO membership. This study clearly revealed that Slovenia not only meets NATO's own guidelines, it surpasses some of the economic and military standards set by the Alliance's three newest members. 
   An invitation to Slovenia would demonstrate to the other democracies of Central Europe that NATO remains genuinely committed to its ``Open Door Policy''--proof that would reinforce their commitment to democratic and economic reform and the Alliance's Partnership for Peace program. 
   Above all, it would help ensure that enlargement becomes a continuous, not a convulsive, process. The momentum generated by the first round of enlargement would be sustained. In contrast, if enlargement is subject to pauses of undefined and indefinite duration, each succeeding round will be more difficult to initiate and complete. Enlargement would less likely be seen and appreciated as a normal dynamic of post-Cold War Europe. 
   In the absence of new invitations at the Summit, it will be a challenge for NATO to sustain the credibility of its Open Door Policy. The Alliance must not step back to the theme of its 1994 Summit in Brussels: ``NATO enlargement is not a matter of if, but when.'' This April, such an open-ended ``when'' would ring especially hollow. 
   For this reason, NATO cannot simply retierate longstanding promises; it must yield a process. Herein lies an important recommendation presented by our resolution on the issue of NATO enlargement. 
   It calls upon Alliance leaders to instruct the NATO International Staff to conduct a comprehensive and transparent review of the nine applicant countries in terms of the guidelines articulated in its 1995 study. (Such a review should not be confused with discrete annual reviews currently being considered for each applicant.) This comprehensive review should be presented, with recommendations, to a North Atlantic Council meeting of ministers or heads of state no later than May 2000. 
   While this review should complement new NATO invitations, even standing alone it offers the following advantages: 
   The Alliance would demonstrate that it is actively engaged in an ongoing enlargement process. It would deflect suspicions that the Alliance is camouflaging its unwillingness for further enlargement behind the generosity of more financial and material assistance. A review is more than words, it is action. 
   A review would not bind the Alliance to ``automaticity'' in that it does not commit the Alliance to issue new invitations in 2000. The review would, however, probably highlight the fact that one or more applicant countries have met the grade. 
   It would underscore that NATO stands by the guidelines established in the 1995 Study on Enlargement. That would encourage the applicant states to continue, if not accelerate, the democratic, military, and economic reforms and regional cooperation requisite for NATO membership. 
   NATO enlargement must also be a central component of NATO's new Strategic Concept, the document that will define the Alliance's roles and missions for the next century. It inclusion will not only communicate commitment, it will help institutionalize enlargement as a planning priority of the Alliance. 
   NATO enlargement is not an act of altruism; it is an act of self-interest. It is a process motivated by the dream of an undivided Europe, the stability that would come to the Euro-Atlantic community, and the capabilities new members would yield the Alliance. It is a policy guided by objective political, economic and military criteria. 
   Each of these enlargement steps outlined above, an invitation to Slovenia, a comprehensive review process, and an emphasis in the Alliance's game plan for the future, will ensure that the Washington Summit is remembered for revitalizing the dream of a Europe, whole, free, and undivided. 
   Mr. President, history will judge this week's NATO Summit not only for how it handles the crisis in Kovoso, but also for the strategy that it lays out for its future. Kosovo, the new Strategic Concept, and enlargement present a challenging agenda at a very trying time. Yet, I remain confident this Alliance has the potential to address each of these issues in a manner that will ensure that NATO becomes an even more capable and effective promoter of a transatlantic partnership that features a strong, undivided and democratic Europe. It is toward this vision that we introduce this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to lend their support.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation that would amend section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit to biomass energy facilities that use poultry litter as a fuel for generating electricity. 
   I am pleased to report that my bill has received even more cosponsors than when it was introduced in the 105th Congress. Fourteen of my colleagues are joining me as original cosponsors. They include Senators JEFFORDS, COVERDELL, HELMS, ROBB, MIKULSKI, BIDEN, SESSIONS, HUTCHINSON, SARBANES, LEAHY, GRAMS, SHELBY, MCCONNELL, and HARKIN. 
   Mr. President, I am bullish on poultry's future in America. It is hard not to be with worldwide poultry consumption growing at double-digit rates. 
   In the United States, poultry production has tripled since 1975. We now produce almost 8 billion chickens a year to feed the growing worldwide demand. 
   In particular, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia produce some of the world's finest poultry. Just last year Delmarva poultry farmers produced over 600 million chickens. Our poultry farmers are among the most productive and efficient in the world. 
   As the amount of chickens we produce as a nation has grown, so too has the need to find creative means for disposing of poultry manure. 
   Due to environmental pressures, spreading manure on land is no longer an option in some areas for our rapidly growing poultry industry. In those areas, the nutrient runoff from the manure has been identified as a contributing factor in surface and groundwater pollution. 
   Addressing these water quality problems will require a range of innovative approaches. One part of the solution may be to use poultry manure to generate electricity. 
   The United Kingdom has two utility plants that use poultry manure to generate electricity. These two poultry power plants will, when combined with a third scheduled to open soon, burn 50 percent of the UK's total volume of chicken manure. 
   The electricity generated by these plants will supply enough power for 37,000 homes. These plants have the support of both the poultry industry and the international environmental community. 
   The way this system works is simple. 
   Power stations buy poultry manure from surrounding poultry farmers and transport it to the power station. At the station the manure is burned in a furnace at high temperatures, heating water in a boiler to produce steam which drives a turbine linked to a generator. The electricity is then transferred to the local electricity grid for use by commercial and residential customers. 
   There are no waste products created through this process. Instead, a valuable by-product emerges in the form of a nitrogen-free ash, which is marketed as an environmentally friendly fertilizer. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will provide a tax credit to energy facilities that use poultry manure as a fuel to generate electricity. 
   It will build on concepts in the Tax Code that provide incentives for innovative alternative energy production. 
   This legislation will provide incentives for electricity generation that will not only help dispose of poultry manure, but will also supply our Nation's farmers with a clean fertilizer free of nitrates. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill, the Poultry Electric Energy Power Act. It is important for future generations that we continue to explore innovative alternative technologies that will help protect our environment.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, and on behalf of Senator THURMOND, Senator HELMS, Senator DOMENICI, Senator SPECTER, Senator STEVENS, and 15 other of our colleagues, to reintroduce a resolution whose intent to redress a grave injustice, one that haunts us from the tribulations of World War II. 
   The matter of which I speak concerns the reputations of two of the most accomplished officers who served in Pacific theater during that war: Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. 
   They were the two senior commanders of U.S. military forces deployed in the Pacific at the time of the disastrous surprise December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. In the immediate aftermath of the attack they were unfairly and publicly charged with dereliction of duty and blamed as singularly responsible for the success of that attack. In short, as we all know today, they were scapegoated. 
   What is most unforgivable is that after the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a near permanent veneer when the President of the United States declined to advance Admiral Kimmel and General Short on the retired list to their highest ranks of wartime command--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in wartime positions above his regular grade. 
   That decision to exclude only these two officers was made despite the fact that wartime investigations had already exonerated those commanders of the dereliction of duty charge and criticized the War and Navy Departments for failings that contributed to the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   Mr. President, let me repeat this fact: Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the only two flag and general rank officers from World War II excluded from advancement on the military's retired list. That fact alone perpetuates the myth that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were derelict in their duty and singularly responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   The scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General Short was one of the great injustices that occurred within our own ranks during World War II. The motivation behind our resolution today is to recognize and correct this injustice. 
   Our resolution calls upon the President of the United States posthumously to advance on the retirement lists Admiral Kimmel and General Short to the grades of this highest wartime commands. In adopting this resolution, the Senate would communicate its recognition of the injustice done to them and call upon the President to take corrective action. Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of blame that so unfairly burdens the reputations of these two officers. It is a correction consistent with our military's tradition of honor, and it is one long overdue. 
   Mr. President, the facts that constitute the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short have been remarkably documented. Since the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, there have been no less than nine official governmental investigations and reports, and one inquiry conducted by a special Joint Congressional Committee.  
   Perhaps the most flawed, and unfortunately most influential investigation, was that of the Roberts Commission. Less than 6 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack, in a hastily prepared report to the President, the commission accused Kimmel and Short of dereliction of duty--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized. 
   Adm. William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of this Commission, later disavowed its report, stating that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were ``martyred'' and ``if they had been brought to trial, they would have been cleared of the charge.'' 
   Later, Adm. J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, wrote:  
   In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government Printing Office.  
   Subsequent investigations provided clear evidence that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame. These reports include those presented by a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, the 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional Committee, and more recently a 1991 Army Board for the Correction of Military Records and report prepared by the Department of Defense in 1995. The findings of these official reports can be summarized as four principal points. 
   First, there is ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not provided vital intelligence that they needed, and that was available in Washington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their senior commanders had critical information about Japanese intentions, plans, and actions, but neighter passed this on nor took issue nor attempted to correct the disposition of forces under Kimmel's and Short's commands in response to the information they attained. 
   Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and consistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   In my review of this case, I was most struck by the honor and integrity demonstrated by Gen. George Marshall who was Army Chief of Staff at the time of the attack. On November 27, 1941, General Short interpreted a vaguely written war warning message sent from the high command in Washington as suggesting the need to defend against sabotage. Consequently, he concentrated his aircraft away from perimeter roads to protect them, thus inadvertently increasing their vulnerability to air attack. When he reported his preparations to the General Staff in Washington, the General Staff took no steps to clarify the reality of the situation. 
   In 1946 before a Joint Congressional Committee investigating the Pearl Harbor disaster General Marshall testified that he was responsible for ensuring the proper disposition of General Short's forces. He acknowledged that he must have received General Short's report, which would have been his opportunity to issue a corrective message, and that he failed to do so. 
   Mr. President, General Marshall's integrity and sense of responsibility is a model for all of us. I only wish it had been able to have greater influence over the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
   A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the Department of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the flow of intelligence. The Dorn Report completed in 1995 for the Deputy Secretary of Defense at the request of Senator THURMOND, stated that the handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by, among other faults, ineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and followup. 
   The bottom line is that poor command decisions and inefficient management structures and procedures blocked the flow of essential intelligence from Washington to the Hawaiian commanders. 
   The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned reports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed only upon the Hawaiian commanders. Some of these reports completely absolved these two officers. While others found them to have made errors in judgment, all the reports subsequent to the Roberts Commission cleared Admiral Kimmel and General Short of the charge of dereliction of duty and underscored the rollout of a broad failure by the entire chain of command. 
   And, Mr. President, all those reports identified significant failures and shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington that contributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   The Dorn Report put it best, stating that ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared.'' 
   Mr. President, let me add one poignant fact about two of these investigations. The conclusions of the 1944 Naval Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been properly disposed according to the information available to them and that their superiors had failed to share important intelligence--were kept secret on the grounds that citing the existence of this intelligence would have been detrimental to the war effort. 
   Be that as it may, there is no longer any reason to perpetuate the cruel myth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor. To do so is not only unfair, it tarnishes our Nation's military honor. For reasons unexplainable to me, this scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General Short has survived the cleansing tides of history. 
   This issue of fairness and justice has been raised not only by General Short and Admiral Kimmel and their surviving families today, but also by numerous senior officers and public organizations around the country.

   Mr. ROTH. Madam President, this amendment is sponsored by myself, Mr. BREAUX, Mr. FRIST, Mr. KERREY, Mr. GRAMM, Mr. DOMENICI, Mr. NICKLES, Mr. GRASSLEY, and Mr. HATCH. 
   Madam President, one of the most important bipartisan efforts we will undertake in the months ahead will be to address the challenges confronting the Medicare program--a program whose reach and importance in the lives of Americans cannot be overstated. In years past we have looked at the demographics, studied the statistics, and struggled with a sense of vulnerability concerning Medicare and its future. 
   Our population is aging. Health care costs seem to be growing exponentially. New and necessary technologies are becoming more expensive. And the financial base of the Medicare program provided by working Americans is shrinking in proportion to the number of seniors who depend on it. In less than 10 years, the population of Medicare beneficiaries will begin growing at a rate unseen in the program's history. 
   In the past, the Medicare population has grown by about 1 percent a year. Beginning very soon, that growth rate will begin to double. In just 10 years, the Medicare program will be required to serve a population that is 20 percent larger than it is today--that is, 46 million seniors--and at that point the baby-boom generation will have only just begun to retire. 
   Concerning the growth in the cost of health care services, Gene Steuerle of the Urban Institute recently testified before the Finance Committee that an average couple retiring now receives about $250,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits. Once the baby-boom generation is in full retirement, that amount will double. As a result, we will need to dedicate a larger and larger portion of the Nation's budget to pay for Medicare. Medicare is expected to consume an expanding share of the Nation's economy. 
   In 1998, Medicare spending was an estimated 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product. It is projected to grow to $518 billion--or 3.5 percent of GDP--in 2010. By 2030, Medicare is forecasted to grow to $2.2 trillion, representing 5.9 percent of the GDP. 
   It is good news that people are living longer, that they are spending almost a decade more in retirement than they were when the Medicare program began. These are demographics we have worked long and hard to bring to pass and we should celebrate them. 
   However, these were, and continue to be, serious challenges to the Medicare trust fund. The balance in the Part A Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is declining. The end-of-year balance began to drop in 1995, when payments from the trust fund began to exceed income to the trust fund. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 helped to delay the bankruptcy of the trust fund for a few years, but it will still occur in our lifetimes if something is not done now. 
   As I said, each of these represents a serious concern, Madam President. But as of late, there appears to be a growing sense of optimism that we can take the favorable economic conditions our Nation is enjoying and, with bipartisan leadership, we can find long-term solutions to these pressing challenges. 
   Not only is there consensus on both sides of the aisle that something must be done, but there is growing confidence that something can be done. An important component of the answer, we have come to see, rests in the potential of a strong economy and with the willingness of the American people. 
   Toward meeting the challenges confronting Medicare, we must be guided by five specific criteria: 
   First, our efforts, if they are to succeed, must have bipartisan support, and they will require leadership from the White House. President Clinton must articulate his strategy for securing and strengthening the Medicare program. 
   Second, we must assure that the measures we adopt do not undermine the economic growth our Nation needs to continue providing jobs, opportunity, and security for Americans now and in the future. 
   Third, we must see that our policies are fair, that those who are being called upon to strengthen the system in the short term have the confidence of knowing that the system will be there for them in the long run. 
   Fourth, reform measures must be holistic in nature, taking into account the challenges we have to preserve and strengthen Social Security and to coordinate other programs that can serve the same constituency benefited by the Medicare and Social Security programs. 
   Fifth, our reform efforts must find acceptance with the American people.  They must take what has been a good program and make it better--make it better by making it financially sound and easily accessible to those who depend on it. 
   I am hopeful that the President will provide the genuine leadership required to address the future of Medicare. I encourage him and his administration to come work with us on the Finance Committee. We look forward to working with them. Certainly there are few issues as importnt as this one. 
   It demands our immediate attention, and the best effort we have to offer. Our work must go beyond the few items he included in his budget. It must take into account the long-term needs of the program, a careful analysis of benefit expansion, such as pharmaceutical drugs, and other concerns. 
   We must look at how we can best serve the Medicare program in a way that the reforms we offer will positively affect Medicaid. Too often lost in the debate over Medicare reform is the direct impact that Medicare changes will have on Medicaid. These two programs are most obviously linked through the 5.4 million low-income elderly and disabled individuals who are eligible for both. For this dually eligible population, Mediaid essentially serves as a source of wraparound benefits, providing among other important services nursing home care and prescription drugs. 
   In addition, nearly 600,000 low-income Medicare beneficiaries receive Mediaid financial support to meet Medicare's cost-sharing requirements. 
   Together, these six million individuals represent 16 percent of the Medicare population, but they consume 30 percent of all Medicare spending and 35 percent of all Medicaid spending. Medicare reform proposals that would impact these low-income populations must be very carefully undertaken to avoid simply shifting costs or responsibilties from one program to the other. 
   As we face the challenges of reforming the Medicare program, we must explore opportunities to substantially improve the health care experiences of these dually eligible populations. Currently, efforts to coordinate the services covered by the two programs are stymied by barriers to integration. 
   These barriers include the need for complicated waivers, arbitrary restrictions on mingling Medicare and Medicaid dollars, and difficulties in coordinating program oversight. A reform process undertaken by this Senate presents an opportunity to better meet the needs of a very vulnerable population. 
   Immediately after passage of this budget, I will begin, as chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the process of developing a bipartisan, consensus proposal for real Medicare reform. In developing this plan, the Finance Committee will conduct a series of hearings to take testimony from Medicare consumers, trustees, providers, and other experts who are intricately involved with this program and who are in a position to make worthy recommendations on how to proceed with improving the Medicare program. 
   We will indeed carefully study the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare led by Senator BREAUX. Senator BREAUX and the other members of the bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare worked very hard and committed a great deal of time during the past year to try to find a solution to the impending Medicare crisis. They deserve our appreciation for their efforts. The discussions that they had has certainly furthered the Medicare debate and will be invaluable to us as we proceed with this important work. In addition to these measures, the committee will also take into consideration the many concerns and proposals of Senators--on both sides of the aisle--for improving this program which is so important for all of those we represent and are here to serve. 
   Our effort to lay a solid foundation for the future of Medicare will be a major undertaking. I believe that the budget resolution we are considering now provides the necessary framework. The budget committee has set aside on-budget surplus funds of up to $133 billion that--if needed--can be used for Medicare reform, including prescription drug benefits. Once we have achieved a bipartisan agreement on a comprehensive Medicare plan, we may indeed find it necessary to revisit this budgetary framework--and I expect that we would be able to obtain the necessary votes to proceed with such adjustments. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to set aside attempts to legislate Medicare reform in the budget resolution. This is not the time or place for such a complex undertaking. Instead, I urge that we work together over the next few months on a Medicare reform plan. Such a plan should provide the nation's current and future seniors the assurance of health care that is comprehensive in benefits, superior in quality and financially sustainable. This is important to them. It is important to the future. And it is something that can and will be done. 
   I yield the floor.

But as I said earlier, it is my intent, as chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over these matters, to begin hearings and to develop a consensus on Medicare when we return from the Easter recess. This will be a bipartisan effort. There is no way we can get anything done unless we are able to develop, as I said, a bipartisan consensus. It is my intent to move as expeditiously as possible upon our return.

   Mr. ROTH. Well, as I indicated, it is the intent of the chairman to proceed expeditiously, upon our return, with hearings and developing a program on Medicare. As far as tax cuts are concerned, I don't intend to begin work on them probably until sometime early fall. But it is my intention to work immediately on Medicare.

   Mr. ROTH. Madam President, let me just point out that as far as the so-called 15 percent is concerned, the Comptroller General said that the President's proposal does nothing to alter the imbalance between the program's tax receipts and benefits payments. It has been cash deficits since 1992, and remains a cash deficit even with the new Treasury securities. Thus, the President's proposal does provide additional claims on the Treasury, not additional cash to pay benefits. 
   Let me make it very clear, under this resolution we intend 
   to do three things: To strengthen and preserve Social Security, to reform Medicare, and to provide a major tax cut for the working people of America. 
   Let me stress that this resolution has been carefully crafted by the chairman and others on the Budget Committee to do exactly that. That is our intent, and we shall follow through on the policies laid down in this resolution. 
   I think the distinguished Senator from Louisiana may care to comment.

   The recommendations by Senator John Breaux and Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.  
   We delete the words with respect to the Presidential appointees. 
   Just let me say as a followthrough on the statement by the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator stated it exactly correct. We are on the road to real reform. We want to make sure that this Medicare program exists not only for the seniors today but indefinitely in the future. I pledge to the Senator that that is what my committee will do.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I point out to my distinguished colleague from Connecticut that we are not voting up or down the work of the Bipartisan Commission. We very clearly say in this resolution:  
   Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend the solvency of the Medicare program and to ensure that benefits under this program will be available to beneficiaries in the future.  
   We go on, on the next page, paragraph 6:  
   Congress should move expeditiously to consider the bipartisan recommendation of the chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.  
   Paragraph 7:  
   Congress should continue to work with the President as he develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the Medicare program.  
   Mr. President, what I am saying is, we ought to forget this debate, trying to argue about surpluses and so forth. 
   What we want to do is to get on with the job, to work in a bipartisan spirit. I think the Finance Committee is known for working in a bipartisan spirit. I say to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, when I say that we are going to start work on this after the recess, that is what I mean and that is what we will do. I think the distinguished Senator knows me well enough to know that I am a man of my word. 
   I ask that we proceed. Let us get the job done.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment does not endorse any one course of action. It calls upon the Finance Committee to develop bipartisan legislation to reform the Medicare program. Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend the solvency of  the Medicare program and to ensure that benefits under that program will be available to beneficiaries in the future. Congress should move expeditiously to consider the bipartisan recommendations of the chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. It urges the President to work with the Congress in fixing the problems in the Medicare program. 
   I thank my colleagues Senator BREAUX, Senator FRIST, Senator KERREY, Senator DOMENICI, Senator THOMPSON, Senator Bob GRAHAM, Senator ABRAHAM as well as Senators PHIL GRAMM, NICKLES, GRASSLEY, MURKOWSKI, and ASHCROFT for cosponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as we turn our attention to the Budget Resolution, pondering the course government is going to take--the philosophy and policies that are going to lead us into a new millennium--I want my colleagues to consider that rather than a time for acrimony and partisan politics, this is a time of great opportunity. 
   In fact, few times in history have been so rich with the opportunities that are before us--opportunities to set a future where the needs of taxpayers, families, students, and communities come before the insatiable appetite of the federal government. Because of policies we began to implement in the early 1980s, we are the beneficiaries of the longest peacetime economic expansion in history. 
   Our efforts to support the home--to provide incentives to save and invest--as well as our work to encourage risk-taking businessmen and -women, researchers and developers, our agricultural and educational communities--these efforts have paid tremendous dividends. 
   Now the question, as we face the final hours of the 20th century, is simple: Do we move forward, embracing economic policies that are proven to increase prosperity and economic opportunity for all Americans, or do we abandon them for proposals that will raise taxes on the most vulnerable among us, proposals that will fill government coffers, swell federal programs, and risk shutting down the tremendous engine of growth that we have successfully created? 
   It seems that the answer to this question is clear, and therefore I rise today to support a Sense of the Senate amendment to the Budget Resolution--a Sense of the Senate amendment that is bipartisan in nature--one that makes it clear that in the choice between a tax cut, as authorized in the resolution, or a tax increase, as provided in the Administration's budget, we are resolved and choose to be consistent as to the direction we want to go. 
   Today the federal government is collecting more taxes than ever before. Because of our entrepreneurs, our farmers, laborers, and families preparing for the future, we are witnessing strong economic growth, and this has been very beneficial for the government's income. These individuals have been encouraged by our efforts to dramatically cut taxes in the 1980s, to create incentives for saving and investing in the 1990s, and by our work to reduce government interference in their lives. 
   Unfortunately, and despite the fact that government is collecting more revenue than ever, the Administration's budget reverses this important trend. It represents another in a series of large tax increases this Administration has tried to impose on Americans. In fact, this proposal is a net tax increase of $50 billion over five years and $90 billion over ten years. It is not a targeted tax cut as its proponents claim. Rather, it is a tax increase that dramatically hits lower-income Americans the hardest. For example, under the Administration's budget, taxpayers with incomes of $25,000 and under will bear almost 40 percent of the net tax increase. Taxpayers with incomes of $75,000 and under will bear over 75 percent of the burden. 
   One might ask, with all the talk about targeted tax breaks in the Administration's budget, how can it be a tax increase on America's most vulnerable. The simple answer is that the Administration's budget relies to a great degree on a 55 cents per pack cigarette tax increase. That tax increase, which largely goes for new spending, far outweighs any tax cutting provisions in the budget, and it hits lower-income Americans the hardest. 
   On the other hand, Mr. President, the budget resolution proposed by Senator DOMENICI does not unfairly penalize one group of Americans. In fact it does not penalize any group. Rather, it provides the Senate Finance Committee with the authority to cut taxes, not increase them. And it allows us to cut taxes in a way that will continue to energize the economic growth our nation is enjoying. This is what America needs as we look to the opportunities before us. 
   I reject any argument that tries to raise the old worn-out issue of class warfare--those who might try to suggest that this resolution will provide tax cuts for the rich. First, I reject it because this resolution does not actually cut taxes, but only authorizes the Finance Committee to proceed to cut taxes. And second, I reject it because the kind of across-the-board tax cuts that are being discussed are just that --fairly applied across-the-board tax cuts that go to everyone. They are just like the tax cuts that President Kennedy implemented in the 1960s and the tax cuts that President Reagan implemented in the 1980s. On both occasions these bipartisan tax cuts led to record-setting economic growth, so not only were they fairly applied, but they benefitted everyone.  
   Mr. President, I also reject the argument that the federal revenue windfall, or budget surplus, will be used by the Administration to retire the debt. For years, there were many among us who argued that tax increases were needed to reduce deficit spending and retire the debt. On occasion, they prevailed and taxes were raised, but then something interesting happened. Deficit spending did not stop, the debt was not retired. The increased taxes actually placed a damper on the economy, and the government spent more than $1.50 for every $1.00 it increased taxes. In other words, the government actually taxed itself into higher deficit spending. It wasn't until Congress insisted on holding the line on spending that the growing economy actually brought about a balanced budget. 
   According to a new study by the Joint Economic Committee, in the post-war period, sixty cents of every dollar of surplus taken into government coffers has been spent by government within a year. Does anyone doubt the taxpayer overpayments that are now contributing to surplus revenue will not be spent by future Congresses? Of course they will. The way to reduce the debt is to keep the economy growing--to keep an environment of opportunity available to all Americans. And the way to keep the economy growing is to cut taxes and minimize government interference in the lives of Americans. This is the message of the Grams Sense of the Senate amendment. It reaffirms support for the tax cut authorized under the resolution offered by Senator DOMENICI. The tax cut provided in that resolution is $142 billion over five years and $778 billion over ten. 
   This resolution will empower the Finance Committee, Republicans and Democrats, to work together and provide comprehensive tax relief. The Finance Committee can provide across-the-board tax relief, over the long-term--relief that is simple, fair, and meaningful to all taxpayers. With the authority given us by this resolution, the Finance Committee can provide tax relief in the short term for many good purposes--purposes supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. 
   For example, we could enhance retirement security. By this I mean improving small business pension plans, making IRAs more accessible, and simplifying employer 401(k) plans. Also, we should address the needs of women returning to the workforce. Every worker has a stake in a better retirement that these incentives could provide. 
   Second, we could enhance family tax relief. For instance, we could ensure that the $500 per child tax credit, dependent care tax credit, and education credits are available to middle income families by exempting these credits from the alternative minimum tax (``AMT''). If we do not provide these exemptions, millions of families could be adversely affected. In addition, the Budget Committee, on a bipartisan basis, has emphasized the importance of providing marriage penalty relief. 
   Third, we could do more to correct our abysmal national savings rate. Chairman Alan Greenspan says this is the number one economic problem confronting America. To this end, in addition to the retirement plan and IRA expansion mentioned above, we could do something for small savers. For instance, we could simplify the tax system by providing an exclusion for small savers of $200 for 
   singles and $400 for married couples. 
   This bipartisan tax cut would benefit more than 60 million taxpayers. It would also allow up to 11 million Americans to file the 1040 EZ--which is the simpliest federal tax form there is. 
   Fourth, we could provide greater tax relief to improve educational opportunities for students and their families. We could provide incentives for families and students to seek higher education and avoid large debt burdens. For instance, nearly every state has a prepaid college tuition plan, and those plans could be made tax-free under a bipartisan proposal. 
   Fifth, we could address the expiring provisions in the current tax code, and we could look at real tax code simplification. The Finance Committee could eliminate needless complexity that results from income limits, phaseouts, and the alternative minimum tax. Again, these are bipartisan objectives. 
   And finally, Mr. President, we could continue to push for proper taxpayer protections. Reform of the IRS is in its infant stages. Elimination of unjust penalties and interest scores as revenue loss. In order to continue meaningful reform of the Internal Revenue Service, we must realize that our efforts will be scored as revenue losses and we must consequently address them in the context of tax cuts. 
   This Sense of the Senate amendment makes clear that without the authority provided in the budget resolution, the Finance Committee will not be able to provide significant tax relief--we will not be able to address these important bi-partisan issues and fix problems in the current code. 
   The resolution will allow us to move forward. And let me conclude by explaining how important it is that we move forward. 
   Working together, we have delivered on a bold promise to the American people--the promise of a balanced budget and a dynamic economy where jobs, opportunity, and growth are available to all. Since 1995, we have worked for tax relief for families, savings and investment incentives, health care-related tax relief, relief for small business, and tax simplification. As we moved forward in these areas, not everyone was supportive at first, but they were eventually adopted by Congress and signed into law by the President. Among the items enacted were tax deductible treatment for long-term care insurance and raising the deductible portion of health insurance for self-employed small businesses and farmers. In addition, pension plan reforms, especially for small business, were enacted. 
   In 1997, we pushed for tax relief in the context of a balanced budget. The President agreed to tax relief he had previously vetoed. Among the tax relief proposals enacted was a $500 per child tax credit that is now providing relief to millions of taxpaying families. We also expanded individual retirement accounts and created the new Roth IRA. Millions of taxpayers now have tax-favored savings vehicles open to them. We reduced the top capital gains rate from 28% to 20%. This provision helped unlock investment dollars for the economy and provided relief to farmers and small business. 
   Beyond this, Mr. President, we have worked together to offer education-related tax relief, including educational IRAs, prepaid college tuition plans, an extension of the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance, and a revival of the student loan interest deduction. 
   We have passed estate tax relief, including relief for small businesses and farmers. And we have succeeded with historic reform of the Internal Revenue Service, including new taxpayer protections regarding the collection activities of the IRS. 
   The Grams Sense of the Senate amendment makes clear that once again, we are at the crossroads on the question of tax relief or tax increases. The Sense of the Senate clarifies that the resolution continues Congress on the same tax relief path begun in 1995. It can be summarized into three points: 
   First, the Administration's budget, though described by its supporters as targeted tax cuts, is a tax increase. 
   Second, if you are serious about tax relief, it must be accommodated in the resolution. The Finance Committee must have the tools to provide meaningful relief. To oppose the tax cut in the resolution is to deny the Finance Committee the tools to do the job. 
   Third, a vote for the tax cut in the resolution is a vote for tax relief that is consistent with tax cuts that have been enacted over the past four years. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Grams Sense of the Senate amendment and I ask unanimous consent to insert into the RECORD a copy of the Tax Foundation's analysis of the Administration's budget, as well as a copy of a revenue table, prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores the Administration's budget.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Abraham amendment. This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Social Security surpluses be used only for preserving and protecting Social Security, and that new procedural safeguards be enacted to ensure this outcome. 
   The Abraham amendment provides an important first step in saving Social Security, and is an excellent occasion to reflect on the issues before the Congress in preserving Social Security for the long-term. Social Security's financial problems of Social Security are well known, but bear repeating. In just 15 years, in 2013, Social Security benefit payments will exceed revenues, and Social Security will need to tap its Trust Fund. 
   Today's Trust Fund is relatively small, equal to about a year-and-a half benefits and intended as a cushion in an economic downturn. However, the Trust Fund will swell over the next 15 years because of payroll tax surpluses and interest. Between 2013 and 2032, Social Security Trust Fund will need to spend over $6 trillion for benefits. But the Trust Fund is simply a claim on the U.S. Treasury. Future taxpayers--our children, our grandchildren, even our great grandchildren--will have to pay off this debt. Even so, the Trust Fund will be empty in 2032, and Social Security can pay only 75 percent of benefits from annual revenues. 
   Worse yet, the President has proposed to add even more debt to the Trust Fund. Although the President claims his plan would extend solvency to 2050, in fact the President would simply commit another $24 trillion of future Federal budgets to Social Security. David Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, delivered this stark assessment of President's proposal at a February 9th Finance Committee hearing: ``It would be tragic indeed if [the president's] proposal, through its budgetary accounting complexity, masked the urgency of the Social Security solvency problem and served to delay much-needed action.'' 
   Most traditional fixes won't work, either. Social Security has faced financial crises before--in 1977 and again in 1983. Both times, the biggest part of the solution was a hike in payroll taxes. The result? Today, 80 percent of American families pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes (with the employer share factored in). And let's remember, Social Security taxes are on the first dollar of income--no deductions, no exemptions. 
   Mr. President, there is broad bipartisan agreement that there may be another way to preserve and protect Social Security benefits--personal retirement accounts. While proposals differ, personal retirement accounts would provide each working American with an investment account he or she owns. With even conservative investment in stocks and bonds and the power of compound interest, personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial retirement nest egg. 
   As Senator PAT MOYNIHAN, my colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, has pointed out, with annual deposits equal to just 2 percentage points of the current payroll tax, ``A worker 
   who spent 45 years with the Bethlehem Steel Company could easily find himself with an estate of half a million dollars. The worker could pass on that wealth to his or her heirs.'' 
   How remarkable! 
   Personal retirement accounts embody other enduring American values as well. Creating these accounts would give the majority of Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic growth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. More Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers. 
   Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, Americans save less than people in most countries, and even this low savings rate has declined in recent years. Personal retirement accounts will demonstrate how even small personal savings grow significantly over time. 
   Creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare for retirement. According to one estimate, 60 percent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement program other than Social Security. Indeed, most Americans have little idea of what they will need in order to retire when and how they want. Personal retirement accounts can help Americans--particularly Baby Boomers--better understand retirement planning. 
   And these accounts may point the way to a more flexible Social Security program. Today, Social Security is a ``one-size-fits-all'' program. People receive a fixed benefit based on earnings and the number of years worked, with the earliest benefits available at age 62. But if an individual takes early retirement but still wants to work, Social Security cuts his or her benefits. Personal accounts can be crafted to give individuals more control over retirement decisions, and eliminate the penalty for working. 
   Setting up a personal retirement accounts program will be a big job. Who will hold, manage, and invest the accounts? How much will it cost to run the program? What kinds of investment choices should be allowed? How to finance the accounts? The White House Conference should tackle each of these issues. Fortunately, there are proven models, such as the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, a pension savings and investment plan for Federal employees. 
   Indeed, I have introduced legislation, S. 263, the Personal Retirement Accounts Act of 1999, that would get accounts up and running with a portion of the budget surplus to answer just these questions. 
   Mr. President, personal retirement accounts have one other big promise. Poll after poll find that Social Security is the most popular Federal government program, deservedly so. But the same polls also show that many Americans, particularly young Americans, doubt they will receive benefits when they retire. Personal retirement accounts can provide the accountability and assurances that Americans are asking for, and restore the confidence of the American people in Social Security.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Ashcroft amendment. This Sense of the Senate expresses the Senate's opposition to the Federal government directly investing the Social Security Trust Funds in the nation's financial markets, that is, making the Federal government or Social Security the owner of stocks and bonds. 
   The risks of this kind of investing are well known, but bear repeating. Put simply, many believe, with good reason, that there would be a strong, irresistible temptation by future Administrations or Congresses to invest according to political considerations, rather than seeking the best rate of return. Let us consider just a few of these ways. For example, some stocks might be avoided because of public policy concerns. For example, last year the State of Minnesota decided to divest tobacco stocks from its state employee pension fund, losing $2 million in the process. Others might want to invest in particular businesses to create or protect jobs. 
   But even if proponents of direct Federal investing are right that firewalls could be built to insulate Trust Funds investments from political considerations, such investing would almost certainly be contentious. Americans are very diverse, with diverse views, and groups would almost certainly organize to bring those views to bear on Trust Fund investing. Frankly, we need to solve Social Security's future problems, not add new ones. 
   Nonetheless, there is broad, bipartisan agreement that the future of Social Security may be improved by reaping higher returns from investments in the nation's securities markets, in stocks and bonds. The President has generally endorsed this approach, as well as many lawmakers, economists and other policy experts, and millions of average Americans. The issue is how to conduct such investments. 
   One promising approach is personal retirement accounts. While proposals differ, personal retirement accounts would provide each working American with an investment account he or she owns. With even conservative investment in stocks and bonds and the power of compound interest, personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial retirement nest egg. 
   Indeed, I have introduced legislation, S. 263, the Personal Retirement Accounts Act of 1999, that would get accounts up and running with a portion of the budget surplus. 
   Still others may have ideas to secure the benefits of investments for Social Security. In my view, the more ideas the better regarding investment--as long as the Federal government is not the owner of record.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my name be added as a cosponsor to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act. It is clear that a reform of our consumer bankruptcy laws is called for. The United States is at the height of its prosperity, yet in these good economic times bankruptcy filings are at an all time high. 
   Of course, no matter how well the Nation is doing as a whole, individuals and individual families may need to fall back upon bankruptcy protection. The reforms included in the bipartisan Grassley-Torricelli proposal will not punish legitimate uses of the bankruptcy codes. Rather this bill will root-out what I agree are its illegitimate uses, and assert rights of consumers filing for bankruptcy. S. 625 also extends or authorizes several necessary bankruptcy judgeships, including one in Delaware, and reenacts farm bankruptcy laws among its provisions. 
   This bill also makes changes in the way that tax claims are handled in bankruptcy. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I have a strong interest in these tax-related provisions. As Senator GRASSLEY mentioned when he introduced the bill, we both expect to modify a number of the provisions at the appropriate time. 
   Mr. President, I am glad to join my friend and fellow Delaware Senator, JOE BIDEN, as a cosponsor of the Bankruptcy Reform Act. I look forward to its consideration on the Senate floor in the coming months.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator HUTCHINSON. Like him, I am deeply concerned about the issues he is attempting to address with this legislation--human rights violations and security concerns involving China, particularly the theft of scientific information from Los Alamos. I am concerned about China's military build-up, its continuing threats of force against Taiwan, and what is taking place in Tibet. I believe that appropriately addressing these issues is vitally important and I look forward to working with Senator HUTCHINSON and others to do so. 
   However, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I must oppose both the method and timing of this approach. It not only fails to allow the Senate to raise and address the sensitive issue of trade relations with China in the appropriate forum of the Finance Committee--a forum where the merits of such an amendment can be carefully studied and weighed against the best interests of our nation--but this approach also has tremendous foreign policy implications that need careful scrutiny. 
   Let me address the first concern. Trade negotiations and trade agreements go to the core of the Finance Committee's jurisdiction over trade matters. Together with Senator MOYNIHAN, I as Chair, and he as ranking member, are responsible, not only for the Committee's substantive role in the trade policy process, but also are the guardians of its prerogatives. The Committee was the first formed in the United States Congress when tariffs were the central source of revenue to a still new republic. Trade and tariff policy remain central to the Committee's role in the legislative process. 
   For example, the Finance Committee reported out a trade bill the first day of the 106th Congress. In addition, at my instigation, the Committee has launched a comprehensive review of America's trade policy, including the role that China's accession to the WTO would play in our trade policy. 
   Unfortunately, there has been no attempt to offer this legislation and lay it before the Finance Committee for its review. Nor has there been any attempt by its supporters to engage with the Committee in the process of our review of America's trade policy. 
   Instead, this amendment seems to be driven by the emotions of the moment toward a form of legislative anarchy. It has gone around the Finance Committee in a way that provides no time for the deliberations for which the Senate is designed. It attempts to move legislation of monumental importance to our trade and foreign policies on the back of a supplemental appropriations measure principally designed to help impoverished countries in Central America and to support the constructive role Jordan has played in the Middle East peace process. 
   Beyond these procedural concerns, I am deeply concerned about the underlying intent of this amendment. Is this bill being raised at this time out of a concern that our trade negotiators will not strike a deal that serves our commercial interests in China? Or is this bill being offered simply to hinder those negotiations in response to recent allegations of spying or the theft of secrets from Los Alamos? 
   I ask those questions because there seems to be a rush to pass this measure in advance of the visit of Zhu Rongji to the United States. It rests on the assumption that the United States will reach an agreement on WTO accession and that, by virtue of that deal, China will enter the WTO the day after Zhu leaves. 
   That is simply wrong. Everything we hear of the negotiations is that it will be difficult even to reach an agreement on U.S. access to China's market. I want to emphasize to my colleagues that a deal on market access, even if it is reached in time for the summit, is only one step along the road to China's accession to the WTO. The more difficult negotiations on when and how China will agree to be bound by the basic rules of the WTO remain. No protocol of accession will be approved until those negotiations are complete. 
   In other words, there is no reason to act precipitously on this measure. There is no reason to subvert the normal legislative processes to secure passage of this amendment at this time. Indeed, the Finance Committee is actively at work on trade matters as part of the trade policy review I have initiated. That is the appropriate venue for the initial discussion of this measure and any necessary refinements to my colleague's approach. 
   China has been the subject of intense concern to the Finance Committee. We have made it clear at every stage that constructive trade relations with China must offer concrete assurances of U.S. market access consistent with our national interest. We have also made it clear that there must be no rush to judgment or attempt to offer a politically-motivated deal to the Chinese simply because the White House wants a foreign policy ``deliverable'' to cap the upcoming summit meeting. 
   My impression from our discussion with Ambassador Barshefsky is that, while there has been considerable progress in recent days, there is still a considerable distance to go even before the United States could agree to a package on market access, much less the more difficult process of negotiating the actual protocols of accession. 
   Beyond these reasons, Mr. President, I oppose Senator HUTCHINSON's amendment on China's accession to the World Trade Organization because of the damaging precedent it would set for all future WTO accessions. It would dramatically undercut the United States' consistent position--under both Republican and Democrat presidents--that accession to the WTO and its predecessor organization, the GATT, is not a political decision, but is one we as Americans base simply on another country's willingness to be bound by the same rules that govern our other trading partners in the world trading system. It is quintessentially a commercial agreement that should be judged on its merits as such. 
   I also oppose this amendment as a matter of Senate procedure. I have always objected to attempts to legislate on appropriations measures. Offering substantive amendments to appropriations bills subverts the normal process of the Senate by which legislation is introduced, moved through the committee of jurisdiction with expertise on the matter, and moved to the floor. 
   Attempts to modify substantive law on the back of appropriations bills often results in the delay of the appropriations themselves. Whether my colleagues support the current supplemental or not, I think we would all agree that the bill deserves to rise or fall on its own merits, not as a result of extraneous and unrelated matters. 
   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator HUTCHINSON'S amendment.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one question many Americans ask themselves is this: Will I have enough to live on when I retire. According to a study published by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, about one third of Americans are not confident that they will have enough to live on in their retirement years. Social Security is an important component of an individual's retirement income, but savings--whether through personal accounts or through employer-provided retirement plans--will help provide for a better life at retirement. Another troubling factor is that if you are employed by a small business you are far less likely to be eligible for a retirement plan. There must be ways to get more Americans interested in providing for their retirement years and to get small businesses interested in providing retirement benefits for their employees. This is a concern that spreads across party lines; everyone knows that there must be incentives for promoting retirement savings. 
   Despite these concerns, we have a strong system of tax favored savings plans in place. For savings through the workplace, there are 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans and 457 plans, each of which can be sponsored by different types of employers. For individual savings, there is either the traditional IRA or the Roth IRA. And all these different savings vehicles have different limits on how much individuals can save. However, our current system can do more and the limitations that we placed on retirement savings in times of budgetary restraints should be re-examined now. In addition, we should capitalize on some of the successful savings incentives and use them to broaden our savings base.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one week ago today, the Finance Committee unanimously voted to support legislation to protect from eviction nursing home residents who rely on Medicaid. Our bill, S. 494, the Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999, is supported by both the nursing home industry and senior citizens' advocates. 
   Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 540, companion legislation to our bill, by a vote of 392 to 12. I call on my colleagues now to join me in voting in support of this important legislation. Let us send it to the President and make it the first piece of health care legislation to become law this year. 
   Our legislation prohibits nursing homes that withdraw from participation in the Medicaid program from evicting the Medicaid residents who are already in the facility. Essentially, we provide for a phase-down rather than an immediate termination of participation in Medicaid. 
   Sixty-eight percent of all nursing home residents eventually end up on Medicaid. Our bill protects these vulnerable senior citizens and individuals with disabilities from finding themselves evicted. The bill goes a long way toward assuring residents and their families that they will continue to receive quality nursing home care without fear of inappropriate eviction.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator GRAHAM, and Senator GRASSLEY to introduce important legislation to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens--nursing home residents. Our bill will keep nursing home residents who rely on Medicaid from being ``dumped'' out of the facility they call home, should that facility decide to drop participation in the Medicaid program. 
   The problem we will solve with this bill does not occur often. In fact, nearly 90 percent of all nursing homes participate in the Medicaid program. Pullouts are very rare and usually result from facilities deciding to close. But when a still-functioning facility decides to stop serving Medicaid clients, our bill will ensure that current residents do not find themselves pushed out of the place they view as home. 
   Recently, Medicaid beneficiaries in facilities in Indiana and Florida found themselves in precisely this horrible situation. They were forced out of nursing homes that decided to drop participation in the Medicaid program. Residents' well-being was disrupted and families were forced to scramble to develop other care alternatives. 
   Our new legislation, and H.R. 540, its companion bill in the House, will protect current residents from displacement. The bill simply requires that facilities withdrawing from the Medicaid program continue to care for current residents under the terms and conditions of the Medicaid program until those residents no longer require care. Facilities would essentially phase-down participation in Medicaid rather than dropping from the program overnight. 
   Both the nursing home industry and senior citizens' advocates support our legislation. This is a common sense, good-government bill that will enhance the peace of mind of low-income elderly and disabled individuals. 
   I applaud the House Conference Committee for having already held a hearing on H.R. 540, and Representatives  BILIRAKIS and DAVIS are to be congratulated for their leadership on this important issue. As we introduce our bill in the Senate today, I would like to particularly thank Senator BOB GRAHAM, whose commitment to this legislation has been pivotal. Working with him, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator GRASSLEY, and other original Finance Committee cosponsors Senators CHAFEE, MACK, ROCKEFELLER, BREAUX, BRYAN, and KERREY, I look forward to taking up the bill up in our committee.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his comments. 
   I must say, I rise in opposition to the amendment. As the distinguished Senator from Virginia well knows, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the Health and Human Services Administration and Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a detailed implementation plan for a veterans subvention demonstration. This report has not yet been submitted to Congress and is due at the end of this year. 
   Frankly, a veterans subvention demonstration at this time would be premature. The Department of Defense Medicare subvention demonstration enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was carefully crafted in a bipartisan fashion between the committees of jurisdiction in the House and Senate, as well as the administering Secretary to address complex budgetary and design issues. 
   It is very, very important, Mr. President, that the veterans subvention demonstration should undergo the same process in order to ensure a successful demonstration for all Medicare-eligible veterans. 
   Finally, as you are aware, the Medicare Part A trust fund is facing an insolvency date of 2008. This is a most serious, critical matter, and the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare is meeting this afternoon to continue to address the current solvency issue. 
   I cannot overemphasize how important, in light of this problem of solvency, is careful consideration of the budgetary implication associated with the veterans subvention demonstration in order to prevent the solvency of the trust fund from being further jeopardized. 
   I will be happy to assure the parties supporting and author of this legislation that we will be glad to work with them in the future in trying to work out legislation that seems appropriate under the circumstances. 
   As I said, it is critically important that it be carefully crafted because the Medicare legislation is in deep trouble.  As I said, it faces insolvency by 2008. We have set up a special commission headed by Senator BREAUX to try to find a solution to assuring the continued solvency of this program. And to add to the difficulty, the complexity of that problem, by including now a new proposal on veterans Medicare subvention makes little or no sense. For that reason, I strongly support the motion to table suggested by the chairman of the defense committee. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROTH. I just want to say to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota that we are all sympathetic to trying to do something to help the veterans hospitals. We are all interested in assuring that the veterans have the best care possible. But he misunderstood what I said. The fact is, the study that is about to come out, which is to be performed by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, is to submit a detailed implementation plan for a veterans subvention demonstration. The purpose of it is not to await the results of a defense program and see how it works out. The fact is that there are two different systems, and what may work for defense will not necessarily be efficient or effective as far as the veterans are concerned. 
   All I was saying is that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does require the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs to submit a plan, and that we should not act and move forward until we have that report. When we get that report, then we should be in a position to create a demonstration program that meets the necessities, the peculiarities, and the problems that are inherent in the current veterans plan. 
   So I just wanted to make clear we are not awaiting the results of the Department of Defense intervention program. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose the amendment offered by Senator GRAHAM. I say reluctantly because I strongly agree with the premise that it is important to pay for this important bill, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   However, Senator GRAHAM's amendment is not the way to do it. This is an authorization bill. It is not a tax bill. And if we adopt Senator GRAHAM's amendment, we turn the bill into a revenue bill. Neither Senator GRAHAM's amendment nor any other potential amendments will have come through the Finance Committee, which is the appropriate committee to review all tax legislation in the Senate. 
   But most importantly, adoption of the amendment would subject the entire bill to a blue slip from the House of Representatives, effectively dooming the important policies embodied in S. 4. So I say to those of you who support this important piece of legislation--and I do--I think it is important that we kill this amendment; otherwise, as I say, it becomes a tax bill and will be blue-slipped on the House side. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. Chief Justice, the House of Representatives presented to the Senate two Articles of Impeachment alleging that the President of the United States committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' in the form of perjury and obstruction of justice. These  are serious offenses, not unlike those which in the past have been sufficient to remove other federal officials from office. 
   In deciding how to vote on the Articles of Impeachment, each Senator had to undertake a two-step analysis: first, to determine the facts--the conduct in which the accused engaged; and second, to determine whether that conduct constituted ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors'', which, under the Constitution, require removal from office. This second step calls for the Senate to determine the facts and evaluate the effect of the conduct on the office and on the operations of government. 
   Having listened to the presentations made to the Senate by the House Managers and by Counsel for the President, it is my opinion that the President committed perjury and obstructed justice, and that this misconduct--based on constitutional definitions and historical precedents--meets the standard for convicting an official of an impeachable offense. 
   As the impeachment process is not a criminal proceeding, it is not necessary that the evidence shows that the accused is guilty of a criminal offense under the United States Code. The Framers wrote the Constitution before Congress wrote, and then amended, the criminal code. Nor is it required that relevant facts be established to the same standard as in a criminal trial, as Congress cannot punish the President, other than to remove him from office. Simply put, the Framers' objective was to provide a remedy to protect the American people and their institutions of government from an unfit officeholder. In view of this, I believe that such remedy is to be available if there is clear and convincing evidence to establish the underlying facts which demonstrate that an officeholder is unfit to serve. 
   In determining whether alleged conduct is a ``high crime and misdemeanor'', Senators must examine each case individually. They must consider the officeholder's position in government and look at the effect of the officeholder's conduct in light of the particular position he or she holds. The fact that the Senate has convicted and removed federal judges for committing perjury does not necessarily mean that it should automatically remove a President who commits perjury. The precedents regarding federal judges are instructive, but they are not conclusive. 
   The 1974 House Judiciary Committee Staff Report during the Nixon Impeachment Inquiry, drawing on two centuries of precedents, explains this concept in connection with a presidential impeachment. The report states that the impeachment of the President should be ``predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties of the presidential office.'' In other words, Congress must determine whether the particular misconduct in which President Clinton engaged is serious enough to warrant removal from that particular office. This is what I call the ``incompatibility'' test. 
   The ``incompatibility'' test requires Senators to exercise their expertise in, and knowledge of, government and to use their best judgment, focusing on the offenses committed and the effect of those offenses on the office and on the operation of government. It is this kind of threat to the republic which we must evaluate in applying the ``incompatibility'' test. Accordingly, under this test we should focus on the unique nature of the Presidency and the offenses the President committed. 
   The Constitution created three separate branches of government in order to limit the powers of government and to enhance the liberty of the American people. Each branch is supreme in its own area but must respect and defer to the others, when they are operating in their assigned areas. Reduced to the simplest characterization, the legislature makes the laws, the executive executes the laws, and the judiciary interprets the laws and dispenses justice. As the head of the executive branch, the President stands alone as the official responsible for executing the laws of our country. 
   The duty of a branch to respect the other branches is a duty that can only be carried out by federal officeholders. It cannot be borne by private citizens. And it is fundamental to the operations of the federal government. Our government could not function if the branches did not respect one another. I believe President Clinton violated this fundamental duty to respect the judicial branch by subverting its function. 
   When a private citizen sued President Clinton under our civil rights statutes, the President took the position that he was unique in our system of law and could not be sued while President. When the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the President could be sued, the President decided to frustrate the judicial process while appearing outwardly to comply with the requirement of our constitutional plan. As a practical matter, he sought to veto this Supreme Court decision. 
   The evidence shows that he undertook a deliberate and multifaceted plan to thwart the Supreme Court ruling. That plan included the commission of perjury and obstruction of justice, which are very serious and fundamental wrongs. Even worse is that his conduct was conscious and calculated. It was not a mistake of the moment. Rather he deliberated and chose to commit perjury. He deliberated and chose to obstruct justice. In making these conscious and calculated choices, he placed his personal and political interests above his presidential duty to respect the judicial branch. 
   This is what concerns me greatly. If the President is willing to place his personal and political interests above his duties as President, he is not fit for the office he holds. 
   The President has, as one branch of the federal government, a duty to respect the requirements of the judicial branch and its proceedings. The President has, as the chief executive, an express duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. In committing perjury and in obstructing justice, he exhibited an attitude dangerous to the operation of government--an attitude where he viewed himself as more important than the rule of law, where his personal and political interests took precedence over the public interest in administering equal justice under law. 
   Ours is a nation ruled by law, not by men, and not by personalities. The judgment that we render here will set a precedent for the ages. If Congress concludes that the office of the Presidency should remain occupied by one who has sullied it with premeditated criminal conduct in violation of constitutional and legal duty, then it will have diminished America's right of self-defense against unfit officeholders, something that the Framers specifically provided for in the Constitution.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the great Leo Tolstoy once confided in his diary that he would be the unhappiest of men if he could not find a purpose for his life. As we all know, Tolstoy did, indeed, find purpose. As a novelist, philosopher, and social reformer, he brought entertainment, meaning, and direction into the lives of millions--his influence continuing even into our day and age. 
   The need to bring meaning and success into our lives--the need to have a purpose, to be anxiously engaged in a good cause--is, as Tolstoy pointed out,  one of the most basic in our nature. With this in mind, it is my pleasure to join Senators MOYNIHAN, JEFFORDS, and KENNEDY to introduce legislation that while simple in purpose will be infinite in application and influence. Our objective? To help people with disabilities go to work. 
   In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. That law made an important statement about this nation's commitment to independence and opportunity for people with disabilities. Since then, barriers that had made some of even the simplest daily tasks difficult or even impossible have been lifted. Millions of Americans have gone back to work or found their daily chores to be more accessible--easier to address and accomplish. 
   Despite these successes and the progress that has been made in the ensuing eight years, there are still serious obstacles for too many people with disabilities--obstacles that stand in the way of their realizing the most basic and important opportunity of getting a job. 
   With this legislation, we begin to address some of the remaining impediments to employment for people with disabilities. These include the lack of access to health insurance and fundamental job assistance. 
   At a hearing held by the Finance Committee last July, witness after witness testified about the importance of health insurance for people with disabilities trying to enter the workforce. Jeff Bangsberg of the Minnesota Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities put it best when he said that ``having appropriate, affordable health care is a critical factor in decisions people with disabilities make about working. Many individuals are afraid to work because they can't afford to lose access to continued Medicaid coverage.'' 
   The simple fact, Mr. President, is that people with disabilities are often presented with a Catch-22 between working and losing their Medicaid or Medicare. This is a choice they should not have to make. But even modest earnings can result in a loss of eligibility for Medicaid or Medicare. Without health insurance, medical treatment often becomes prohibitively expensive for individuals with disabilities, and without medical treatment it becomes impossible for many to work. 
   My constituents in Delaware have made it clear that lack of access to health insurance is a real and seemingly insurmountable barrier to employment. Larry Henderson, Chair of Delaware's Developmental Disabilities Planning Council, supports our bill ``because it does not penalize persons with disabilities for working in that it allows for continued access to health care.'' 
   Our bill is designed to empower States to break this cycle of uncertainty by making it possible for people with disabilities who choose to work to do so without jeopardizing health insurance access. 
   We do this by creating two new Medicaid options. The first option builds on a change enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). That law allows States to permit people with disabilities to buy-in to Medicaid who would otherwise be eligible except that they earned too much. The new change would eliminate the income cap on this buy-in option. 
   The second Medicaid change would make it possible for States to permit a similar Medicaid buy-in option for individuals with a severe, medically determinable impairment who would otherwise lose eligibility because of medical improvement. 
   Let me also note that both Medicaid expansions would be voluntary on the part of each State. 
   Under both options, States would be able to set their own cost-sharing requirements for people with disabilities who enroll. States could require individuals buying into the program to pay 100 percent of premium costs in order to participate. The bill also extends Medicare Part A coverage for a ten-year trial period for individuals on SSDI who return to work. 
   In addition to these health coverage innovations, the bill also provides a user-friendly, public-private approach to job placement. Because of a new, innovative payment system, vocational rehabilitation agencies will be rewarded for helping people remain on the job, not just getting a job. 
   Mr. President, this combination of health care and job assistance will help disabled Americans succeed in the work place. And our society will be enriched by unleashing the creativity and industry of people with disabilities eager to go to work. 
   I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. And it is my intention to hole a hearing on the bill in the Finance Committee next week and mark it up later this spring.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce legislation to ensure that the federal government provides Delaware small businesses with the same treatment as those in other states. Delaware is the only state in which the Small Business Administration does not maintain a district office. As a result, Delaware small businesses are being shortchanged. 
   The primary function of Small Business Administration district offices is the approval of Small Business Administration loan guarantee applications. Without a district office, Delaware applications must be processed out of state. As a result, community benefit, interviews, and local outlook cannot be considered with loan guarantee paperwork as is common in other states, and applications take longer to process. Small Business Administration district offices will also provide Delaware's Small Business community with more effective outreach and awareness of Small Business Administration programs and services. 
   The bill I am introducing today, with the cosponsorship of Senator BIDEN, will correct this inequity. This bill, the Small Business Administration Equal Representation Act, specifies that each state is entitled to a single Small Business Administration district office. But it will do so without authorizing any additional appropriations. 
   Mr. President, Delaware small businesses deserve the same level of support from the Small Business Administration as is found in every other state. Even Puerto Rico benefits from having a Small Business Administration district office. The Small Business Administration Equal Representation Act will assure that Delaware receives from the Small Business Administration the level of support it deserves.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of Senator MOYNIHAN and myself, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999. This bill reflects unfinished business from the 105th Congress and I am hopeful that the Senate will quickly move to approve this legislation this year. 
   On September 29, the Finance Committee reported unanimously H.R. 4342, the Miscellaneous Tariff and Technical Corrections Act of 1998. On October 20, 1998, the House passed and sent to the Senate H.R. 4856, the identical bill with the addition of several provisions. Unfortunately, for reasons unrelated to the substance of the bill, the Senate was unable to pass either piece of legislation. 
   The bill I am introducing today with Senator MOYNIHAN is substantively identical to H.R. 4856, with only minor technical changes necessary because of the passage of time. This bill contains over 150 provisions temporarily suspending or reducing the applicable tariffs on a wide variety of products, including chemicals used to make anti-HIV, anti-AIDS and anti-cancer drugs, pigments, paints, herbicides and insecticides, certain machinery used in the production of textiles, and rocket engines. 
   In each instance, there was either no domestic production of the product in question or the domestic producers supported the measure. By suspending or reducing the duties, we can enable U.S. firms that use these products to produce goods in a more cost efficient manner, thereby helping create jobs for American workers and reducing costs for consumers. 
   The bill also contains a number of technical corrections and other minor modifications to the trade laws that enjoyed broad support. One such measure would help facilitate Customs Service clearance of athletes that participate in world athletic events, such as the upcoming Women's World Cup. Another measure would correct outdated references in the trade laws. 
   For each of the provisions included in this bill, the House and Senate has solicited comments from the public and from the Administration to ensure that there was no controversy or opposition. Only those measures that were noncontroversial were included in the bill. 
   The Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a mark-up of this bill on Friday, January 22nd. I hope that both the House and Senate will move to approve this legislation soon.

   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Personal Retirement Accounts Act of 1999. This legislation has a simple but powerful purpose--to establish personal retirement accounts for working Americans. In my view, these accounts promise to give working Americans not only a more secure retirement future but a new stake in the nation's economic growth. And, as I will describe, these accounts may provide the model for future Social Security reform. 
   Just a few years ago personal retirement accounts were an exotic and even controversial concept. But no longer! Today, personal retirement accounts are a bipartisan, even mainstream, idea. 
   In 1997, a majority of a Clinton administration task force on Social Security endorsed the concept. 
   In the last Congress, two comprehensive Social Security reform proposals, one introduced by Senator MOYNIHAN, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee; the other by Senators GREGG and BREAUX, had as a central element personal retirement accounts. 
   Mr. President, let me explain why retirement accounts find so much support--not only in Congress but among the American people. With even conservative investment, such accounts have the potential to provide Americans with a substantial retirement nest egg. And an estate that can be left to children and grandchildren. 
   Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic growth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. More Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers. 
   Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, Americans save less than people in almost every other industrial country. But personal retirement accounts will demonstrate to all Americans the magic of compound interest as even small savings grow significantly over time. 
   Lastly, creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare for retirement. According to the Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement program other than Social Security. A recent survey found that only about 45 percent of working Americans have tried to calculate how much they will need for retirement. It is my belief that retirement accounts will prompt Americans--particularly Baby Boomers--to think more about retirement planning. 
   Mr. President, let me describe a few of the features of my bill. First, the program would run for 5 years, from 2000 to 2004, utilizing half the budget surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Each year, working Americans who earned a minimum of four quarters of Social Security coverage--$3,000 in 2000--would receive a deposit in his or her account. About 128 million Americans would receive a deposit in 2000. 
   The formula for sharing the surplus among the accounts is progressive. Each eligible individual would receive a minimum amount of $250 per year, plus an additional amount based on how much they paid in payroll taxes. 
   Over the life of the program, a minimum wage earner--someone earning $12,400 this year--would receive about $1,850. That amount is equal to a 35-percent rebate of his or her payroll taxes. 
   An average wage earner--earning $27,600--would receive about $2,590--equal to a 22-percent rebate of payroll taxes. And an individual who paid the maximum Social Security tax would get $4,560, a 16-percent rebate of payroll taxes. These figures do not include any investment income--or deductions for the costs of running the program. 
   Account holders would have three investment choices--prudent choices that balance risk and return. The three choices are a ``stock index fund''--a mutual fund that reflects the overall performance of the stock market; a fund that invests in corporate bonds and other ``fixed income'' securities; and a fund that invests in U.S. Treasury bonds. 
   However, my legislation also provides for a study of additional investment options--of other types of investment funds and investment managers. 
   An account holder would become eligible for benefits when he or she signs up for Social Security. An individual could choose between an annuity or annual payments based on life expectancy. 
   The bill also provides a number of features to ensure the program is properly run. First, the program would be neither ``on'' budget nor ``off'' budget--instead, the program would be outside the Federal budget. The money in the program could be used for no other purpose than retirement benefits and the 
   program's operating expenses. 
   Second, the program would be supervised by a new, independent Personal Retirement Board, with members appointed by the President and Congressional leaders and subject to Senate confirmation. Board officials would be fiduciaries, and required by law to act only in the best financial interests of beneficiaries. 
   Lastly, the stock funds would be managed by private sector investment managers. To insulate companies represented in the stock funds from politics, no Board official or other government employee and would be eligible to vote company proxies--only the investment managers. 
   Mr. President, the design of this personal retirement accounts plan follows a proven model--the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Back in 1983, when I was Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the retirement program for Federal employees needed to be revamped. One of the new elements we added was the Federal Thrift Savings Plan--a defined contribution employee benefit plan--that has been a great success. 
   Many Americans will undoubtedly ask, ``What size nest egg might grow in my personal account?'' According to an analysis done by Social Security's actuaries, someone earning the minimum wage would have an account worth about $2,145 in 2004, assuming a 7.5 percent interest rate. For the average wage earner, the account would be worth about $2,990, and for the individual paying the maximum Social Security tax, about $5,250. 
   Of course, over the long-term, accounts can grow significantly. For the minimum wage earner after 40 years--in 2039, his or her account would be worth about $27,000. The average wage earner would have $38,000; and the person paying the maximum payroll tax, $66,000. 
   Mr. President, some might ask, ``Why start with personal retirement accounts, rather than comprehensive Social Security reform?'' Indeed, my bill will not affect the current Social Security program. Personal retirement accounts are an exciting concept, but still a big job, requiring careful work by the Finance Committee. 
   Personal retirement accounts also enjoy broad support, unlike many other Social Security reform proposals. So let's get these accounts up and running, proven and tested, while Congress considers carefully protecting and preserving Social Security for the long term. 
   Mr. President, in closing, let me add that personal retirement accounts have another big promise. Such accounts--if later made a part of Social Security or even as a permanent supplemental program--may help restore the confidence of the American people in this important national program. Polls show that Social Security is among the most popular government programs, deservedly so. But many Americans--particularly young Americans--seem to have lost confidence in Social Security. They believe that there will be no benefits for them when they retire. Personal retirement accounts will provide the accountability and assurances that Americans are asking for. 
   I encourage my colleagues to take a careful look at my bill, and I invite members to co-sponsor it.

    Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act with Senator ROD GRAMS, Senator LOTT, the distinguished Majority Leader, and other Members. 
   Let me begin by saying that this Congress holds the promise of being the most productive in recent memory because we have the opportunity to build on some notable successes. In just the past few years we reformed the IRS, provided tax relief, voted to ratify NATO enlargement, expanded health care for children, and created new opportunities for Americans to save--all while balancing the budget and strengthening Medicare. 
   Our agenda for the next two years must be to build on these successes. Accomplishing this will include tax reform, shoring up Social Security, and promoting economic opportunity for individuals and families. 
   It is wrong that in an era of every-increasing budget surpluses Americans are being taxed more than ever before. It is wrong that 20.5% of our GDP is going into federal coffers--the highest since World War II--that our families are finding it increasingly difficult to send their children to school, and to become self-reliant in retirement. 
   This Congress can do something about that. We will do something about it. With this legislation we offer Americans a ten percent across-the-board tax cut--a broad-based tax cut--one that will put money where it belongs, in the hands of those who earn it. The budget surplus will allow this. It allows us to do this and to shore up Social Security at the same time. Washington demonstrated last year that unless the surplus is given back to the taxpayer the government will spend it. 
   The Tax Cuts for All Americans Act is the right and necessary thing to do. The broad-based tax cut in this package is the simplest, fairest, and--I believe--most productive way to give the money back to the taxpayer and to see that the economic growth our nation is enjoying continues well into the future. Broad-based tax cuts will also be the best way to return hard-earned money to the taxpayer without increasing IRS intrusion into the lives of Americans. 
   Beyond this legislation, in this Congress we will also address the Alternative Minimum Tax--a set of rules in the code that has grown out of control. The AMT was originally intended to ensure that wealthy taxpayers were  not able to use loopholes and shelters to arrive at a zero tax liability. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the AMT was not indexed it has turned into a debilitating liability with the code affecting millions of middle-income taxpayers. Something must be done. 
   These proposals are all about one thing: increasing personal and family financial security--helping Americans meet their needs today and prepare for their needs tomorrow. I intend to push this agenda by going beyond a broad-based tax cut and creating incentives to promote and strengthen pensions and personal retirement accounts. I have proposed a plan to increase IRA contributions to $5,000 a year, and to allow up to $2,000 a year to be placed into education savings accounts. 
   I will also introduce legislation to dedicate a portion of the ever-increasing budget surplus to creating Personal Retirement Accounts for every worker--giving individuals at all income levels an opportunity to own a piece of America's economic future. 
   This is the most important agenda we can have as we look to a new millennium--a millennium that I believe will be bright and prosperous, one that will hold great promise for all Americans if we stay focused, work cooperatively, and put the interests of hard-working taxpaying families before the interests of a big-spending, over-bearing government.
